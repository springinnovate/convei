TI  - Utility of Satellite Remote Sensing for Land-Atmosphere Coupling and Drought Metrics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Feedbacks between the land and the atmosphere can play an important role in the water cycle, and a number of studies have quantified land-atmosphere (LA) interactions and feedbacks through observations and prediction models. Because of the complex nature of LA interactions, the observed variables are not always available at the needed temporal and spatial scales. This work derives the Coupling Drought Index (CDI) solely from satellite data and evaluates the input variables and the resultant CDI against in situ data and reanalysis products. NASA's Aqua satellite and retrievals of soil moisture and lower-tropospheric temperature and humidity properties are used as input. Overall, the Aqua-based CDI and its inputs perform well at a point, spatially, and in time (trends) compared to in situ and reanalysis products. In addition, this work represents the first time that in situ observations were utilized for the coupling classification and CDI. The combination of in situ and satellite remote sensing CDI is unique and provides an observational tool for evaluating models at local and large scales. Overall, results indicate that there is sufficient information in the signal from simultaneous measurements of the land and atmosphere from satellite remote sensing to provide useful information for applications of drought monitoring and coupling metrics.

TI  - The Influence of Soil Salinization on Land Use Changes in Azov District of Rostov Oblast
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A retrospective monitoring of changes in land use on cultivated salt-affected soils of Azov district in Rostov oblast for a period from 1968 to 2013 was performed within the framework of the creation of a problem-oriented system of retrospective monitoring of the soil cover and land uses. A higher dynamism of land uses on salt-affected soils in comparison with that on nonsaline soils was shown. A decisive role of the anthropogenic factor in the increasing soil salinization in the region was established. The areas of meadow ecosystems with participation of salt-affected soils considerably increased at the end of the 1960s-the beginning of the 1970s. It is argued that their development with a corresponding worsening of the salt status of regional soils was initiated by the wide-scale planting of shelterbelts in the 1940s and 1950s.

TI  - Seasonal shifts in ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) species and functional composition maintain prey consumption in Western Oregon agricultural landscapes
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground beetles (Carabidae: Coleoptera) are generalist predators that contribute to biological control of agricultural pests. Different ground beetle species vary in terms of size, feeding habits, and season of adult and larval activity. Species with similar biology and feeding habits may form a functional group if they are also similar in their effect on the overall risk to a potential prey item in an area. Farm surveys and laboratory studies were conducted to test whether ground beetle populations on Western Oregon vegetable farms were associated with the predation risk of a sentinel prey item. Pitfall traps were used to measure the activity patterns of adult beetles throughout the year. Along with the monthly pitfall traps, sentinel prey cards were deployed to measure the risk of predation to a potential prey item by a carabid beetle on the landscape. Additionally, beetles were collected after pitfall trapping to measure the amount of the sentinel prey items they would eat. The ground beetle species collected in the sampling were placed into three size based groups. The phenology and feeding habitats of the species within each sized based group tended to be similar. Sentinel prey removal rates in the field were significantly increased in areas with high activity of midsized beetles during the spring, when midsized beetles were the most active on the landscape but the explanatory power was somewhat low. In the summer, when large beetles were active in the landscape, sentinel prey removal rates were similarly associated with large beetle activity densities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Concordant Surgical Treatment: Non-melanocytic Skin Cancer of the Head and Neck.
T2  - Archives of craniofacial surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin cancer is the most common type of cancer. Of the 4 million skin lesions excised annually worldwide, approximately 2 million are considered cancerous. In this study, we aimed to describe a regional experience with skin cancers treated by a single senior surgeon and to provide a treatment algorithm.METHODS: The medical records of 176 patients with head and neck non-melanocytic skin cancer (NMSC) who were treated by a single surgeon at our institution between January 2010 and May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed, and their data (age, sex, pathological type, tumor location/size, treatment modality) were analyzed. Patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) who were classified as a high-risk group for nodal metastasis underwent sentinel node mapping according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.RESULTS: Among the patients with NMSC who were treated during this period, basal cell carcinoma (BCC; n=102, 57.9%) was the most common pathological type, followed by cSCC (n=66, 37.5%). Most lesions were treated by complete excision, with tumor-free surgical margins determined via frozen section pathology. Thirty-one patients with high-metastasis-risk cSCC underwent sentinel node mapping, and 17 (54.8%) exhibited radiologically positive sentinel nodes. Although these nodes were pathologically negative for metastasis, 2 patients (6.5%) later developed lymph node metastases.CONCLUSION: In our experience, BCC treatment should comprise wide excision with tumor-free surgical margins and proper reconstruction. In contrast, patients with cSCC should undergo lymphoscintigraphy, as nodal metastases are a possibility. Proper diagnosis and treatment could reduce the undesirably high morbidity and mortality rates.

TI  - Evaluating fire growth simulations using satellite active fire data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognized shortcomings of fire spread modeling systems and the widespread use of their outcomes in fire management decisions render the evaluation of fire simulation results crucial for model calibration and improvement. Additionally, new methods are essential to avoid model misapplication in fuel and fire management decision processes. This study proposes an exploratory evaluation framework of fire growth simulations using satellite active fire data. It uses nine very large fires that occurred in Portugal between 2003 and 2012. Their fire growth was simulated using the Fire Area Simulator (FARSITE) and compared with active fire data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The evaluation is based on two spatial measures that quantify the absolute (SpD) and relative (NRSpD) spatial discrepancies between fire growth simulations and satellite active fires. Both measures account for the uncertain location of the fire front(s) inside the active fire footprint. Results highlight the contribution of the spatial discrepancy measures to locate areas of low/high spatio-temporal agreement between simulated fire growth and MODIS active fires, thereby aiding the assessment of potential sources of simulation error. Results also show that despite the coarse spatial resolution of MODIS active fires, these data are able to capture the spatial dynamics of fire growth. Limitations on the spatial measures were identified, particularly the lack of independence of evaluations using the NRSpD. In spite of being exploratory, this study represents a novel contribution to the evaluation of fire growth simulations because: 1) it uses satellite active fire data and is independent of the collection of reference burnt area perimeters; 2) it proposes two simple quantitative spatial discrepancy measures; and 3) it can be applied to a large number of wildfires, regardless of their geographical location. This innovative approach represents a potential cost effective evaluation scheme, that can be used systematically whenever evaluation of a large number of large wildfires is required and reference burned area perimeters are not available.

TI  - Road Network Extraction from High-Resolution SAR Imagery Based on the Network Snake Model
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic road network extraction from satellite images is currently considered to be an important research trend in the field of remote sensing and photogrammetry. This paper presents a method for automatic extraction of road networks from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. The method consists of three steps. During the first step, road area candidates are detected based on the fusion of extracted features: minimum radiance, contrast, and direction of minimum radiance. In the second step, several refinement criteria are used in order to discard detected false candidates, and a thinning morphology operator is applied on the road areas to extract the road segments. Seed points of interest are then extracted to using in a network snake model, which is employed in the third step to connect the seed points in order to form the road network. Minimizing the energy function of the Snake model and then using a perceptual grouping algorithm is for discarding redundant segments and avoiding gaps between segments is used sequentially in the network snake model. The proposed algorithm is tested on TerraSAR-X images with different areas. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method is effective in terms of correctness, completeness, and quality. An accuracy assessment showed that the proposed model is capable of achieving a quality index between 56 to 82.5 percent.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Participants were grouped on the basis of theological beliefs about divine-human and female-male dynamics using cluster analysis. We then explored whether these subgroups might differ on (a) hierarchical social expectations, (b) commitments to social justice and intercultural competence, (c) religious exploration, (d) existential defensiveness, (e) views of psychology - theology integration, and (f) perspectives on women's leadership. The sample consisted of graduate students (N=227) at an Evangelical seminary in the Midwestern United States. Results yielded a four-cluster solution. Individuals scoring high on both Calvinist theological beliefs and complementarian gender role beliefs scored significantly higher on hierarchical relationship expectations and existential defensiveness, and preferred a Christian psychology view of integration and a male headship perspective of leadership, compared to those scoring low on Calvinism and complementarianism. In contrast, individuals scoring low on both theological dimensions scored higher on Arminianism, gender egalitarianism, social justice commitment, intercultural competence commitment, religious exploration, and they preferred an integration view of psychology and theology and a "no restrictions" perspective on women's roles. Findings highlight implications for theological training and spiritual formation.

TI  - Role of Climate Variability and Human Activity on Poopo Lake Droughts between 1990 and 2015 Assessed Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, an emergency state was declared in Bolivia when Poopo Lake dried up. Climate variability and the increasing need for water are potential factors responsible for this situation. Because field data are missing over the region, no statements are possible about the influence of mentioned factors. This study is a preliminary step toward the understanding of Poopo Lake drought using remote sensing data. First, atmospheric corrections for Landsat (FLAASH and L8SR), seven satellite derived indexes for extracting water bodies, MOD16 evapotranspiration, PERSIANN-CDR and MSWEP rainfall products potentiality were assessed. Then, the fluctuations of Poopo Lake extent over the last 26 years are presented for the first time jointly, with the mean regional annual rainfall. Three main droughts are highlighted between 1990 and 2015: two are associated with negative annual rainfall anomalies in 1994 and 1995 and one associated with positive annual rainfall anomaly in 2015. This suggests that other factors than rainfall influenced the recent disappearance of the lake. The regional evapotranspiration increased by 12.8% between 2000 and 2014. Evapotranspiration increase is not homogeneous over the watershed but limited over the main agriculture regions. Agriculture activity is one of the major factors contributing to the regional desertification and recent disappearance of Poopo Lake.

TI  - Supervised classification of civil air patrol (CAP)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The mitigation and response to floods rely on accurate and timely flood assessment. Remote sensing technologies have become the de facto approach for observing the Earth and its environment. However, satellite remote sensing data are not always available, and it is crucial to develop new techniques to complement them with additional sources. This research proposes a new methodology based on machine learning algorithms to automatically identify water pixels in Civil Air Patrol (CAP) aerial imagery. Specifically, a wavelet transformation is paired with multiple classifiers to build models that discriminate water and non-water pixels. The learned classification models are first tested against a set of control cases and then used to automatically classify each image separately. Lastly, for each pixel in an image, a measure of uncertainty is computed as a proportion of the number of models that classify the pixel as water. The proposed methodology is tested on imagery collected during the 2013 Colorado flood.

T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We combined generalised additive models and GIS to model and map anchovy potential spawning habitat using anchovy egg and adult presence/absence data from the North Aegean Sea along with in situ environmental information, collected during the beginning / peak of the spawning period. First, we compared the spawning habitat models constructed using different data subsets (egg or adult data for different months and areas). This analysis highlighted the potential effects of (a) temporal variability in environmental conditions during the transitional period of spring-early summer, in relation to survey timing and peak spawning; (b) stock contraction/expansion due to interannual changes in spawning biomass; and (c) increased area of egg vs adult presence due to fast egg dispersal on the estimated habitat model/map characteristics. We conclude that potential spawning habitat models should be constructed based on pooled data (preferably adult data) covering as much as possible the seasonal and interannual variability in spawners' distribution. Subsequently, we compared the pooled egg and adult models/habitat maps with those previously published for the same area using satellite environmental information. We demonstrate that the predicted habitats based on satellite vs in situ data were quite consistent, further supporting the use of readily available satellite data in essential habitat studies.

TI  - Cloud-Base Height Estimation from VIIRS. Part I: Operational Algorithm Validation against <i>CloudSat</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The operational VIIRS cloud-base height (CBH) product from the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite is compared against observations of CBH from the cloud profiling radar (CPR) on board CloudSat. Because of the orbits of SNPP and CloudSat, these instruments provide nearly simultaneous observations of the same locations on Earth for a; similar to 4.5-h period every 2-3 days. The methodology by which VIIRS and CloudSat observations are spatially and temporally matched is outlined. Based on four 1-month evaluation periods representing each season from June 2014 to April 2015, statistics related to the VIIRS CBH retrieval performance have been collected. Results indicate that when compared against CloudSat, the VIIRS CBH retrieval does not meet the error specifications set by the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.7 km for all clouds globally. More than half of all matching VIIRS pixels and CloudSat profiles have CBH errors exceeding the 2-km error requirement. Underscoring the significance of these statistics, it is shown that a simple estimate based on a constant cloud geometric thickness of 2 km outperforms the current operational CBH algorithm. It was found that the performance of the CBH product is impacted by the accuracy of upstream retrievals [primarily cloud-top height (CTH)] and the a priori information used by the CBH retrieval algorithm. However, even when CTH errors were small, CBH errors still exceed the JPSS program error specifications with an RMSE of 2.3 km.

TI  - A multi-scale analysis of western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest insect outbreaks are influenced by ecological processes operating at multiple spatial scales, including host-insect interactions within stands and across landscapes that are modified by regional-scale variations in climate. These drivers of outbreak dynamics are not well understood for the western spruce budworm, a defoliator that is native to forests of western North America.Our aim was to assess how processes across multiple spatial scales drive western spruce budworm outbreak dynamics. Our objective was to assess the relative importance and influence of a set of factors covering the stand, landscape, and regional scales for explaining spatiotemporal outbreak patterns in British Columbia, Canada.We used generalized linear mixed effect models within a multi-model interference framework to relate annual budworm infestation mapped from Landsat time series (1996-2012) to sets of stand-, landscape-, and regional-scale factors derived from forest inventory data, GIS analyses, and climate models.Outbreak patterns were explained well by our model (R (2) = 93%). The most important predictors of infestation probability were the proximity to infestations in the previous year, landscape-scale host abundance, and dry autumn conditions. While stand characteristics were overall less important predictors, we did find infestations were more likely amongst pure Douglas-fir stands with low site indices and high crown closure.Our findings add to growing empirical evidence that insect outbreak dynamics are driven by multi-scaled processes. Forest management planning to mitigate the impacts of budworm outbreaks should thus consider landscape- and regional-scale factors in addition to stand-scale factors.

TI  - River Extraction From High-Resolution SAR Images Combining a Structural Feature Set and Mathematical Morphology
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies extraction using satellite images is of great importance due to its utility in several applications such as land use planning, floods management, and monitoring. Among the wide range of sensors orbiting the Earth, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a very effective tool in this context due to its robustness in the face of unfavorable weather conditions and its cloud penetration capabilities. This paper presents a novel river extraction algorithm from high-resolution SAR images mainly based on the combination of a local texture measurement and the global knowledge associated with the shape of the object of interest. A local texture measurement is first computed at every pixel of the image to extract the homogeneous surfaces contained in the image, and then a mathematical morphology operator is applied to eliminate the noise generated by speckle characterizing SAR images. Finally, the surface occupied by the object of interest is compared with the surface associated with the smallest rectangle that encloses this object in order to separate rivers from lakes in the image. The proposed approach was tested on SAR images acquired by the RADARSAT-2 satellite over numerous regions of Canada. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust and effective.

TI  - The empirical relationship between PM<sub>2.5</sub> and AOD in Nanjing of the Yangtze River Delta
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground-based Aerosol optical properties and PM2.5 concentrations in an industrial area in Nanjing were measured and analyzed from May 2013 to May 2015. The annual mean of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm was 1.04 +/- 0.63. The annual mean of the Angstrom exponent (alpha) was 1.03 +/- 0.23. The annual PM2.5 concentration was 62 +/- 13 mu g m(-3). There were significant correlations between the PM2.5 concentration and the AOD. The linear regression functions of the daily PM2.5 concentration (y) with the ground- based AOD (x) and the MODIS AOD (x) were y = 55.70x + 25.60 (R-2 = 0.53) and y = 63.84x + 39.33 (R-2 = 0.56), respectively. The results demonstrated significant differences in the slopes and intercepts of the linear regression functions for different seasons. The distribution of PM2.5 was retrieved by the seasonal functions between the ground- based PM2.5 and the MODIS AOD on sunny days in the region. The MODIS- derived PM2.5 concentrations in the north of Jiangsu and parts of Shandong and Henan were generally higher than those in the hilly lands of the south of Anhui and the northwest of Zhejiang. There was a high- PM2.5 area anchored over the industrial area. The particle pollution was more serious in spring and winter than in autumn and summer. The MODIS- derived PM2.5 concentration in urban and industrial areas was higher than 80 mg m(-3) during spring and winter. The retrieved PM2.5 values had the highest absolute error (+17 mu g m(-3)) in summer and the lowest (+2 mu g m(-3)) in winter, and the average relative error of the seasonal PM2.5 concentration was 15% +/- 10%.

TI  - Assessing forest fragmentation in north-western Himalaya: a case study from Ranikhet forest range, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwestern Himalaya harbors high levels of biodiversity due to its unique topography, climatic conditions and heterogeneity. Forest fragmentation is one of the major threats causing a decline in biodiversity in the Himalayan region. We assesses forest fragmentation and changes in land use land cover (LULC) patterns using multi-temporal satellite data over a time span of four decades (1976-2013). Fragmentation analysis using the Landscape Fragmentation Tool (LFT) reveals a decrease in core and edge areas by 14 and 2.3 %, respectively; while an increase in non-forest, patch area and perforation area by 2.1, 0.4, and 14 %, respectively. The LULC dynamics show that the areas under dense forest and scrub forest have decreased by 2.8 % and 1.9 %, respectively; and there is an increase in open forest, crop land and fallow land area by 2.6, 1.7 and 2.1 %, respectively. The quantification of landscape heterogeneity is undertaken with the help of landscape metrics computed using FRAGSTATS at class and landscape level, showing signs of increased fragmentation. Our study provides baseline database that can support the future biodiversity conservation and sustainable forest management initiatives.

TI  - SAHARA: A Simplified AtmospHeric Correction AlgoRithm for Chinese gAofen Data: 1. Aerosol Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently launched Chinese GaoFen-4 (GF4) satellite provides valuable information to obtain geophysical parameters describing conditions in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface. The surface reflectance is an important parameter for the estimation of other remote sensing parameters linked to the eco-environment, atmosphere environment and energy balance. One of the key issues to achieve atmospheric corrected surface reflectance is to precisely retrieve the aerosol optical properties, especially Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). The retrieval of AOD and corresponding atmospheric correction procedure normally use the full radiative transfer calculation or Look-Up-Table (LUT) methods, which is very time-consuming. In this paper, a Simplified AtmospHeric correction AlgoRithm for gAofen data (SAHARA) is presented for the retrieval of AOD and corresponding atmospheric correction procedure. This paper is the first part of the algorithm, which describes the aerosol retrieval algorithm. In order to achieve high-accuracy analytical form for both LUT and surface parameterization, the MODIS Dark-Target (DT) aerosol types and Deep Blue (DB) similar surface parameterization have been proposed for GF4 data. Limited Gaofen observations (i.e., all that were available) have been tested and validated. The retrieval results agree quite well with MODIS Collection 6.0 aerosol product, with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.72. The comparison between GF4 derived AOD and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations has a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.86. The algorithm, after comprehensive validation, can be used as an operational running algorithm for creating aerosol product from the Chinese GF4 satellite.

TI  - Bacterial Elicitation of Transcriptional Response of Female Squash Bug, <i>Anasa tristis</i> (De Geer)
T2  - SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - The squash bug, Anasa tristis (De Geer), is a major pest of squash, pumpkin, and other cucurbits throughout North America. A. tristis is a piercingsucking feeder that causes extensive foliar wilting and fruit scarring and transmits plant pathogens. Current biological agents to control A. tristis are limited in efficacy, and newer control methods must be developed. Here we present studies of immune system transcripts as the initial step in identifying potentially vulnerable targets for control of gene expression. Following immune stimulation with bacteria, transcript levels of six components of the inducible innate system in adult female A. tristis were measured using quantitative PCR. An antibacterial peptide-encoding transcript, anacin; an enzyme central to melanization, prophenoloxidase; and three sentinel proteins, scavenger receptor, beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein, and peptidoglycan-binding protein were upregulated by bacterial elicitation. Expression of a putative immunoregulatory cytokine, astakine, was identified and increased by septic puncture. We also found novel upregulation of an enzyme of central energy metabolism, arginine kinase, in response to septic puncture of A. tristis adults.

TI  - Correcting bias in the rational polynomial coefficients of satellite imagery using thin-plate smoothing splines
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rational Function Model (RFM) has proven to be a viable alternative to the rigorous sensor models used for geo-processing of high-resolution satellite imagery. Because of various errors in the satellite ephemeris and instrument calibration, the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) supplied by image vendors are often not sufficiently accurate, and there is therefore a clear need to correct the systematic biases in order to meet the requirements of high-precision topographic mapping. In this paper, we propose a new RPC bias-correction method using the thin-plate spline modeling technique. Benefiting from its excellent performance and high flexibility in data fitting, the thin-plate spline model has the potential to remove complex distortions in vendor-provided RPCs, such as the errors caused by short-period orbital perturbations. The performance of the new method was evaluated by using Ziyuan-3 satellite images and was compared against the recently developed least-squares collocation approach, as well as the classical affine-transformation and quadratic-polynomial based methods. The results show that the accuracies of the thin-plate spline and the least-squares collocation approaches were better than the other two methods, which indicates that strong non-rigid deformations exist in the test data because they cannot be adequately modeled by simple polynomial-based methods. The performance of the thin-plate spline method was close to that of the least-squares collocation approach when only a few Ground Control Points (GCPs) were used, and it improved more rapidly with an increase in the number of redundant observations. In the test scenario using 21 GCPs (some of them located at the four corners of the scene), the correction residuals of the thin-plate spline method were about 36%, 37%, and 19% smaller than those of the affine transformation method, the quadratic polynomial method, and the least-squares collocation algorithm, respectively, which demonstrates that the new method can be more effective at removing systematic biases in vendor-supplied RPCs.

TI  - Bias Compensation for Rational Polynomial Coefficients of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery by Local Polynomial Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rational Function Model (RFM) is a widely used generic sensor model for georeferencing satellite images. Owing to inaccurate measurement of satellite orbit and attitude, the Rational Polynomial Coefficients (RPCs) provided by image vendors are commonly biased and cannot be directly used for high-precision remote-sensing applications. In this paper, we propose a new method for the bias compensation of RPCs using local polynomial models (including the local affine model and the local quadratic model), which provides the ability to correct non-rigid RPC deformations. Performance of the proposed approach was evaluated using a stereo triplet of ZY-3 satellite images and compared with conventional global-polynomial-based models (including the global affine model and the global quadratic model). The experimental results show that, when the same polynomial form was used, the correction residuals of the local model could be notably smaller than those of the global model, which indicates that the new method has great ability to remove complex errors existed in vendor-provided RPCs. In the experiments of this study, the accuracy of the local affine model was nearly 15% better than that of the global affine model. Performance of the local quadratic model was not as good as the local affine model when the number of Ground Control Points (GCPs) was less than 10, but it improved rapidly with an increase in the number of redundant observations. In the test scenario with 15 GCPs, the accuracy of the local quadratic model was about 9% and 27% better than those of the local affine model and the global quadratic model, respectively.

TI  - Using Landsat time series imagery to detect forest disturbance in selectively logged tropical forests in Myanmar
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting forest disturbances is an important task in formulating mitigation strategies for deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics. Our study investigated the use of Landsat time series imagery combined with a trajectory-based analysis for detecting forest disturbances resulting exclusively from selective logging in Myanmar. Selective logging was the only forest disturbance and degradation indicator used in this study as a causative force, and the results showed that the overall accuracy for forest disturbance detection based on selective logging was 83.0% in the study area. The areas affected by selective logging and other factors accounted for 4.7% and 5.4%, respectively, of the study area from 2000 to 2014. The detected disturbance areas were underestimated according to error assessments; however, a significant correlation between areas of disturbance and numbers of harvested trees during the logging year was observed, indicating the utility of a trajectory-based, annual Landsat imagery time series analysis for selective logging detection in the tropics. A major constraint of this study was the lack of available data for disturbances other than selective logging. Further studies should focus on identifying other types of disturbances and their impacts on future forest conditions.

TI  - Fractures network mapping using remote sensing in the Paleozoic massif of Tichka (Western High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Paleozoic massif of Tichka in the southern part of the Western High Atlas of Morocco constitutes a structural transition between the Meseta and the Anti-Atlas domains. It was affected by a complex network of fractures noticeable at different scales. Using Landsat ETM+ imagery permits detecting the main fracture directions. Various techniques of lineament's extraction were applied, including the colored compositions, spectral band ratios, and directional filters applied to the principal component analysis. Lineament's extraction is based on visual interpretation and completed by field observations. The resulted map allows recognizing at least four trending fracture system, with average N-S, NE-SW, E-W, and NW-SE orientations. The surrounding rocks of the granitic massif show a high fracture density. Tectonic indicators show that this massif is initially affected by NW-SE Variscan tectonic extension, followed by NW-SE Variscan compression. This regime is being maintained until the late Variscan period corresponding to the relaxation of the NW-SE major Variscan stress. A clockwise rotation of the latter stress, which became N-S to NNE-SSW, related to the late Variscan deformation, is responsible for reworking preexisting faults.

TI  - Distribution of water masses and meltwater on the continental shelf near the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm waters flood the continental shelf of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas in West Antarctica, driving rapid basal melt of ice shelves. In contrast, waters on the continental shelf in East Antarctica are cooler and ice shelves experience relatively low rates of basal melt. An exception is provided by the Totten and Moscow University ice shelves on the Sabrina Coast, where satellite-derived basal melt rates are comparable to West Antarctica. Recent oceanographic observations have revealed that relatively warm (similar to -0.4 degrees C) modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) enters the cavity beneath the Totten Ice Shelf through a 1100 m deep trough, delivering sufficient heat to drive rapid basal melt. Here we use observations from a recent summer survey to show that mCDW is widespread on the continental shelf of the Sabrina Coast, forming a warm (up to 0.3 degrees C) and saline (34.5-34.6) bottom layer overlaid by cold (similar to freezing point) and fresh (salinity similar to 34.3) Winter Water. Dense Shelf Water is not observed. A 1000 deep m trough allows water at -1.3 degrees C to reach the Moscow University ice-shelf cavity to drive basal melt. Freshening by addition of glacial meltwater is widespread on the southern shelf at depths above 300-400 m, with maximum meltwater concentrations up to 4-5 ml L-1 observed in outflows from the ice-shelf cavities. Our observations indicate that the ocean properties on the Sabrina Coast more resemble those found on the continental shelf of the Amundsen and Bellingshausen seas than those typical of East Antarctica.Plain Language Summary The Totten Glacier drains more ice from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet than any other glacier. The Totten holds a volume of ice equivalent to more than 3.5m of global sea level rise, so changes in the glacier could have significant consequences. East Antarctic ice shelves, including the Totten, were thought to be largely isolated from warm ocean waters and therefore stable. An Australian voyage in 2015 obtained the first oceanographic data near the Totten and Moscow University Ice Shelves. The measurements show that relatively warm water spreads from the open ocean across the continental shelf to reach the ice shelf cavities, where it drives melt of the underside of the ice shelves. The presence of warm water near the ice shelves helps explain rapid rates of melt inferred from satellite data. The study shows that this part of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is more exposed to warm ocean waters, and therefore may make a larger contribution to sea level rise, than previously thought.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common, followed by squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous cell carcinoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The gold standard treatment for periocular epithelial malignancies is surgical excision. Given the constraints of the anatomy and function of the eyelids, excision with negative margins and reconstruction can be challenging. In cases of significant tissue invasion or metastasis, complete tumor removal may not be possible. This review examines the management of periocular skin cancer from diagnosis and staging, including the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy, to both surgical and nonsurgical treatment. The development of targeted drug therapy against specific genetic mutations in cutaneous malignancies has allowed for the treatment of specific cancer cells with less systemic toxicity than more traditional treatments.

TI  - Assessing the time taken for a surveillance system to detect a re-emergence of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic in July 2001 the European Commission established a surveillance scheme for the comprehensive sampling of all BSE clinical suspects, healthy slaughter (HS) animals >30 months, and all emergency slaughter and fallen stock animals tested when >24 months. With the exponential decline in classical BSE cases, this comprehensive surveillance system has been successively modified to become risk-based, targeting those exit streams and ages where cases from the original epidemic are most likely to be detected. Such reductions in testing are not without losses in the information subsequently collected, which could affect the sensitivity of the surveillance system to relatively small changes in the underlying prevalence of BSE across the European Union (EU). Here we report on a cohort-based approach to estimate the time taken for EU surveillance to observe a theoretical re-emergence of BSE in cattle. A number of surveillance schemes were compared. The baseline scheme considered detection being triggered by at least one case in the 'age window' 48-72 months in the fallen stock or emergency slaughter exit streams. Alternative schemes changed the start and end of this age window as well as considering testing for HS cattle. Under the baseline scheme, an estimated 15 years would lapse ([2.5th, 97.5th] percentiles = [10,24]) prior to detection, during which time 2867 infected animals ([2.5th, 97.5th] = [1722,6967]) would enter the slaughter population. These animals would be predominantly young animals (majority <24 months) showing no clinical signs. This baseline scheme reduced the time to detection by 2 years, compared to a scheme where only clinical suspects were tested assuming BSE symptoms are recognised to the same degree by veterinary surgeons. Additional testing of younger animals did not improve detection as young infected animals were unlikely to test positive, but testing of older animals reduced the time to detection. Testing of HS animals >72 months reduced the time to detection by one year compared to the baseline model, but would incur a high financial cost, e.g. testing HS animals >72 months of age for 14 years would entail approximately 50.4 million additional tests. A limitation of the results is that there is no guarantee that current detection methods, optimised for detection of classical BSE, would identify a novel prion disease in cattle and it is currently difficult to envisage plausible routes by which a re-emergence of classical BSE could occur in Europe.

TI  - Comparison of In-Situ and Satellite Data of Surface Incoming Short-Wavelength Radiation for the Atlantic Ocean during 2004-2014
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about short-wavelength (from 0.2 to 4 mu m) heat radiation fluxes incoming to the ocean surface is available from very few observations collected by shipboard equipment and buoys and obtained from satellite data archives. Presently, the most complete archive on short-wavelength radiation fluxes is provided by geostationary Earth-orbiting satellites, such as 1G and 2G.ETEOSAT (European Union), GOES (United States) and HIMAWARI (Japan), which are equipped with scanners operating in the visible and infrared (IR) ranges, which can image the Earth's disk every 0.5 h. Additionally, the European EPS/MetOP satellites and US NOAA satellites circulating in mid-altitude circumpolar Sun-synchronous orbits and carrying AVHRR radiometers [1] can be used to obtain daily and monthly average values of incoming short-wavelength solar radiation fluxes. In the future, radiation heat flux data measured by satellites will undoubtedly play a leading role; however, today, the available data record spans only the last few decades, still lacking accuracy and consequently requiring thorough validation.

TI  - Vicarious Calibration of the Landsat 7 Thermal Infrared Band and LST Algorithm Validation of the ETM plus Instrument Using Three Global Atmospheric Profiles
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to problems in the thermal infrared sensor on-board the Landsat-8 satellite, Landsat-7 (L7) can be an interesting alternative source of thermal data because it is the only source of well-calibrated, free, high-resolution data. To contribute to the quality of thermal data, a vicarious calibration (VC) of the enhanced thematic mapper instrument and a validation of the single-channel general equation and the water vapor approach algorithm in conjunction with an inversion of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) have been performed during 2013-2015 over two Spanish test sites. For this purpose, three global atmospheric profile data sets were used to better characterize the error due to atmospheric correction: 1) MODIS atmospheric product MOD07 version 5; 2) MOD07 version 6; and 3) national center for environmental prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data. The VC results show a negligible bias in our test sites while the land surface temperature algorithms validation present a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.5 to 3 K, with the best performance for NCEP atmospheric profiles in combination with the inversion of the RTE (RMSE below 1.5 K).

TI  - Review of high-risk features of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and discrepancies between the American Joint Committee on Cancer and NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines In Oncology
T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignancy that arises from epidermal keratinocytes. Although the majority of cutaneous SCC cases are easily treated without further complication, some behave more aggressively and carry a poor prognosis. These " high-risk" cutaneous SCCs commonly originate in the head and neck and have an increased tendency toward recurrence, local invasion, and distant metastasis. Factors for high-risk cutaneous SCC include large size (>2 cm), a deeply invasive lesion (>2 mm), incomplete excision, high-grade/desmoplastic lesions, perineural invasion (PNI), lymphovascular invasion, immunosuppression, and high-risk anatomic locations. Both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network((R)) (NCCN (R)) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) identify several of these high-risk features of cutaneous SCC. The purpose of this article was to review the high-risk features included in these guidelines, as well as their notable discrepancies and omissions. We also provide a brief overview of current prophylactic measures, surgical options, and adjuvant therapies for high-risk cutaneous SCC. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Furthering Prostration in the Hebrew Bible: A Non-Denotative Analysis of <i>histahawah</i>
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF THE OLD TESTAMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides a non-denotative analysis of the Hebrew word for prostration in the Old Testament, histahawah. It does so in order to better grasp the discursive situating of prostration as a ritual within the socio-religious contexts and conceptions of biblical authors and peoples. The analysis of histahawah proceeds along non-denotative lines, specifically analyzing its usage as per its connotative attribution, its grammatical subjects and number (communal versus individual), and its directedness. This study shows that the usage of histahawah must be understood as a variegated literary term representing a ritualized action that originally was seen and understood multivalently. However, the aggregate usage of the term indicates continuities of understanding as well as changes due to historical circumstances and uses. Such measures give greater insight into experiential aspects of Israelite religious practice, as well as providing insight into the discursive norms that structured Israelite society and worldview during different periods

TI  - Estimating the permanent loss of groundwater storage in the southern San Joaquin Valley, California
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the San Joaquin Valley, California, recent droughts starting in 2007 have increased the pumping of groundwater, leading to widespread subsidence. In the southern portion of the San Joaquin Valley, vertical subsidence as high as 85 cm has been observed between June 2007 and December 2010 using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). This study seeks to map regions where inelastic (not recoverable) deformation occurred during the study period, resulting in permanent compaction and loss of groundwater storage. We estimated the amount of permanent compaction by incorporating multiple data sets: the total deformation derived from InSAR, estimated skeletal-specific storage and hydraulic parameters, geologic information, and measured water levels during our study period. We used two approaches, one that we consider to provide an estimate of the lowest possible amount of inelastic deformation, and one that provides a more reasonable estimate. These two approaches resulted in a spatial distribution of values for the percentage of the total deformation that was inelastic, with the former estimating a spatially averaged value of 54%, and the latter a spatially averaged value of 98%. The former corresponds to the permanent loss of 4.14x108 m(3) of groundwater storage, or roughly 5% of the volume of groundwater used over the study time period; the latter corresponds to the loss of 7.48x108 m(3) of groundwater storage, or roughly 9% of the volume of groundwater used. This study demonstrates that a data-driven approach can be used effectively to estimate the permanent loss of groundwater storage.Plain Language Summary Subsidence due to groundwater pumping from 2007 to 2010 in the San Joaquin Valley, California was mapped using satellite data known as InSAR. These data were incorporated with additional datasets, including geological information, to estimate how much subsidence was permanent. This subsidence represents a permanent loss in groundwater storage. Using these methods, we estimated that a permanent loss of 7.48 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater storage occurred during our study period. This accounted for roughly 9% of groundwater pumping in our study area. While this is just a small fraction of the total water stored underground in this area, this 'water of compaction' is an important safeguard for times of drought that, once removed, cannot be replenished.

TI  - Potassium Channel Candidate Genes Predict the Development of Secondary Lymphedema Following Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - NURSING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Potassium(K+) channels play an important role in lymph pump activity, lymph formation, lymph transport, and the functions of lymph nodes. No studies have examined the relationship between K+ channel candidate genes and the development of secondary lymphedema (LE).Objective: The study purpose was to evaluate for differences in genotypic characteristics in women who did (n = 155) or did not (n = 387) develop upper extremity LE following breast cancer treatment based on an analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in 10 K+ channel genes.Methods: Upper extremity LE was diagnosed using bioimpedance resistance ratios. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify those SNPs and haplotypes that were associated with LE while controlling for relevant demographic, clinical, and genomic characteristics.Results: Patients with LE had a higher body mass index, had a higher number of lymph nodes removed, had more advanced disease, received adjuvant chemotherapy, received radiation therapy, and were less likely to have undergone a sentinel lymph node biopsy. One SNP in a voltage-gated K+ channel gene (KCNA1 rs4766311), four in two inward-rectifying K+ channel genes (KCNJ3 rs1037091 and KCNJ6 rs2211845, rs991985, rs2836019), and one in a two-pore K+ channel gene (KCNK3 rs1662988) were associated with LE.Discussion: These preliminary findings suggest that K+ channel genes play a role in the development of secondary LE.

TI  - "Over-Learning" Phenomenon of Wavelet Neural Networks in Remote Sensing Image Classifications with Different Entropy Error Functions
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial neural networks are widely applied for prediction, function simulation, and data classification. Among these applications, the wavelet neural network is widely used in image classification problems due to its advantages of high approximation capabilities, fault-tolerant capabilities, learning capacity, its ability to effectively overcome local minimization issues, and so on. The error function of a network is critical to determine the convergence, stability, and classification accuracy of a neural network. The selection of the error function directly determines the network's performance. Different error functions will correspond with different minimum error values in training samples. With the decrease of network errors, the accuracy of the image classification is increased. However, if the image classification accuracy is difficult to improve upon, or is even decreased with the decreasing of the errors, then this indicates that the network has an "over-learning" phenomenon, which is closely related to the selection of the function errors. With regards to remote sensing data, it has not yet been reported whether there have been studies conducted regarding the "over-learning" phenomenon, as well as the relationship between the "over-learning" phenomenon and error functions. This study takes SAR, hyper-spectral, high-resolution, and multi-spectral images as data sources, in order to comprehensively and systematically analyze the possibility of an "over-learning" phenomenon in the remote sensing images from the aspects of image characteristics and neural network. Then, this study discusses the impact of three typical entropy error functions (NB, CE, and SH) on the "over-learning" phenomenon of a network. The experimental results show that the "over-learning" phenomenon may be caused only when there is a strong separability between the ground features, a low image complexity, a small image size, and a large number of hidden nodes. The SH entropy error function in that case will show a good "over-learning" resistance ability. However, for remote sensing image classification, the "over-learning" phenomenon will not be easily caused in most cases, due to the complexity of the image itself, and the diversity of the ground features. In that case, the NB and CE entropy error network mainly show a good stability. Therefore, a blind selection of a SH entropy error function with a high "over-learning" resistance ability from the wavelet neural network classification of the remote sensing image will only decrease the classification accuracy of the remote sensing image. It is therefore recommended to use an NB or CE entropy error function with a stable learning effect.

TI  - National-scale soybean mapping and area estimation in the United States using medium resolution satellite imagery and field survey
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and timely information on agricultural production is essential for ensuring world food security. Freely available medium-resolution satellite data (e.g. Landsat, Sentinel) offer the possibility of improved global agriculture monitoring. Here we develop and test a method for estimating in-season crop acreage using a probability sample of field visits and producing wall-to-wall crop type maps at national scales. The method is illustrated for soybean cultivated area in the US for 2015. A stratified, two-stage cluster sampling design was used to collect field data to estimate national soybean area. The field-based estimate employed historical soybean extent maps from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Cropland Data Layer to delineate and stratify U.S. soybean growing regions. The estimated 2015 U.S. soybean cultivated area based on the field sample was 341,000 km(2) with a standard error of 23,000 km2. This result is 1.0% lower than USDA's 2015 June survey estimate and 1.9% higher than USDA's 2016 January estimate. Our area estimate was derived in early September, about 2 months ahead of harvest. To map soybean cover, the Landsat image archive for the year 2015 growing season was processed using an active learning approach. Overall accuracy of the soybean map was 84%. The field-based sample estimated area was then used to calibrate the map such that the soybean acreage of the map derived through pixel counting matched the sample -based area estimate. The strength of the sample -based area estimation lies in the stratified design that takes advantage of the spatially explicit cropland layers to construct the strata. The success of the mapping was built upon an automated system which transforms Landsat images into standardized time-series metrics. The developed method produces reliable and timely information on soybean area in a cost-effective way and could be applied to other regions and potentially other crops in an operational mode.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF SENTINEL LYMPH NODE METASTASIS IN CANINE MAMMARY GLAND TUMORS USING COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC INDIRECT LYMPHOGRAPHY
T2  - VETERINARY RADIOLOGY & ULTRASOUND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the staging process of the breast cancer, demonstrating metastasis of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) has an important prognostic value, in both humans and animals. The aim of this prospective case-control study was to determine the diagnostic value of computed tomographic indirect lymphography (CT-LG) for detecting SLN metastasis in dogs with mammary cancer. Thirty-three female dogs with tumors in the abdominal and inguinal mammary glands were prospectively selected and subjected to CT-LG, 1 and 5 min after injection of 1 ml of contrast agent (iopamidol) in the subareolar tissue of the neoplastic and the contralateral normal mammary glands. The pattern of postcontrast opacification, degree of postcontrast enhancement, and size and shape were assessed in 65 SLNs in total and were correlated with histopathological findings. The absence of opacification or heterogeneous opacification 1 min after contrast medium injection showed the highest sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy (93%, 100%, and 98.4%, respectively). In images taken 1 min after injection, an absolute density value lower than 444 Hounsfield units (HU) in the center of the SLN also provided significant sensitivity and specificity (93.8% and 75%, respectively). The size and shape of the SLN (maximum and minimum diameter, maximum/minimum diameter ratio, maximum diameter/height of fifth thoracic vertebral body ratio) showed the lowest sensitivity and specificity. Results of this study support the hypothesis that CT-LG could help in the assessment of SLN metastasis in cases of mammary gland tumors in dogs. (C) 2016 American College of Veterinary Radiology.

TI  - Identification of high nature value grassland with remote sensing and minimal field data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last 50 years intensification of agricultural land use systems drastically reduced extensively used grassland areas. These areas are of high ecological value due to high species richness and occurring rare species. Therefore, recent European Union (EU) laws stipulate the conservation and monitoring of this farmland, also called "high nature value" (HNV) farmland. As a consequence of these new laws, a so called HNV indicator system was implemented that requires all EU member states to establish a nationwide monitoring system for HNV areas. These monitoring systems are challenged among other by the difficult differentiation between grassland types which today at fine scale is only possible with time and cost intensive field work. Due to this high work-load and financial limitations, nationwide field campaigns have to be sample-based and hence will not deliver a spatially consistent result.In this study, we examine whether low and high nature value grasslands can be differentiated with remotely-sensed reflectance data, which could support existing field survey-based monitoring approaches. We used multi-seasonal, multispectral remote sensing data (RapidEye) in combination with sparse field data (collected in southern Germany) and three one-class classifiers to classify A) HNV grassland against other areas and to differentiate between B) three quality classes of HNV grassland according to the current German HNV monitoring approach.The results for A) indicated high performances of the tested approaches to identify HNV grassland areas. Biased support vector machine delivered best overall results (high detection rate and low false positive rates). However, the results also showed a consistent underestimation of HNV grasslands. Results for B) showed that a separation into several HNV quality classes is not possible with any of the tested approaches.We conclude that with the presented approach HNV grasslands can be identified from the landscape matrix based on its spectral signal. Combining the presented approach with an object oriented classifier or with land registry data could further improve the results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Two empirical algorithms are developed for wave mode images measured from the synthetic aperture radar aboard Sentinel-1 A. The first method, called CWAVE_S1A, is an extension of previous efforts developed for ERS2 and the second method, called F-nn, uses the azimuth cutoff among other parameters to estimate significant wave heights (H-s) and average wave periods without using a modulation transfer function. Neural networks are trained using colocated data generated from WAVEWATCH III and independently verified with data from altimeters and in situ buoys. We use neural networks to relate the nonlinear relationships between the input SAR image parameters and output geophysical wave parameters. CWAVE_S1A performs well and has reduced precision compared to F-nn with H-s root mean square errors within 0.5 and 0.6 m, respectively. The developed neural networks extend the SAR's ability to retrieve useful wave information under a large range of environmental conditions including extratropical and tropical cyclones in which H-s estimation is traditionally challenging.

TI  - Fine-resolution forest tree height estimation across the Sierra Nevada through the integration of spaceborne LiDAR, airborne LiDAR, and optical imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests of the Sierra Nevada (SN) mountain range are valuable natural heritages for the region and the country, and tree height is an important forest structure parameter for understanding the SN forest ecosystem. There is still a need in the accurate estimation of wall-to-wall SN tree height distribution at fine spatial resolution. In this study, we presented a method to map wall-to-wall forest tree height (defined as Lorey's height) across the SN at 70-m resolution by fusing multi-source datasets, including over 1600 in situ tree height measurements and over 1600 km(2) airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Accurate tree height estimates within these airborne LiDAR boundaries were first computed based on in situ measurements, and then these airborne LiDAR-derived tree heights were used as reference data to estimate tree heights at Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) footprints. Finally, the random forest algorithm was used to model the SN tree height from these GLAS tree heights, optical imagery, topographic data, and climate data. The results show that our fine-resolution SN tree height product has a good correspondence with field measurements. The coefficient of determination between them is 0.60, and the root-mean-squared error is 5.45 m.

TI  - Assessing accuracy and precision for space-based measurements of carbon dioxide: An associated statistical methodology revisited
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing retrieval accuracy and precision is an important element of space-based CO2 retrievals. However, this error analysis is sometimes challenging to perform rigorously because of the subtlety of Multivariate Statistics. To help address this issue, we revisit some fundamentals of Multivariate Statistics that help reveal the statistical essence of the associated error analysis. We show that the related statistical methodology is useful for revealing the intrinsic discrepancy and relation between the retrieval error for a nonzero-variate CO2 state and that for a zero-variate one. Our study suggests that the two scenarios essentially yield the same-magnitude accuracy, while the latter scenario yields a better precision than the former. We also use this methodology to obtain a rigorous framework systematically and explore a broadly used approximate framework for analyzing CO2 retrieval errors. The approximate framework introduces errors due to an essential, but often forgotten, fact that a priori climatology in reality is never equal to the true state. Due to the nature of the problem considered, realistic numerical simulations that produce synthetic spectra may be more appropriate than remote sensing data for our specific exploration. As highlighted in our retrieval simulations, utilizing the approximate framework may not be universally satisfactory in assessing the accuracy and precision of Xco(2) retrievals (with errors up to 0.17-0.28ppm and 1.4-1.7ppm, respectively, at SNR=400). In situ measurements of CO2 are needed to further our understanding of this issue and related implications.

TI  - Reducing Barriers to Mental Health Care for Student-Athletes: An Integrated Care Model
T2  - FAMILIES SYSTEMS & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research suggests that National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I student-athletes have higher levels of stress and other behavioral health issues, including substance use, than nonathletes. For several reasons, student-athletes may be less likely to admit to behavioral health issues and seek mental health care. Integrated care is a model of care that integrates behavioral health into a medical practice. This article explores the newly released NCAA Best Mental Health Practice guidelines and the application of integrated care to a Division I athletic training room setting using the three-worldview framework for successful integration, incorporating clinical outcomes, operational reliability, and financial stability.

TI  - GA-SVM Algorithm for Improving Land-Cover Classification Using SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisource remote sensing data have been widely used to improve land-cover classifications. The combination of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical imagery can detect different land-cover types, and the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) and support vector machines (SVMs) can lead to improved classifications. Moreover, SVM kernel parameters and feature selection affect the classification accuracy. Thus, a GA was implemented for feature selection and parameter optimization. In this letter, a GA-SVM algorithm was proposed as a method of classifying multifrequency RADARSAT-2 (RS2) SAR images and Thaichote (THEOS) multispectral images. The results of the GA-SVM algorithm were compared with those of the grid search algorithm, a traditional method of parameter searching. The results showed that the GA-SVM algorithm outperformed the grid search approach and provided higher classification accuracy using fewer input features. The images obtained by fusing RS2 data and THEOS data provided high classification accuracy at over 95%. The results showed improved classification accuracy and demonstrated the advantages of using the GA-SVM algorithm, which provided the best accuracy using fewer features.

TI  - Saltmarshes Response to Human Activities on a Prograding Coast Revealed by a Dual-Scale Time-Series Strategy
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - On many prograding coasts, human activities such as alien species introduction and tidal flat reclamation, as countermeasures against land scarcity, are having a major impact on saltmarshes. Despite their capacity for regeneration given ample sediment supply, saltmarshes are likely to disappear if they continue to be impacted by such activities without effective monitoring and protection. However, effective mon-itoring requires a combination of saltmarsh species mapping and short timespan change analyses, which are difficult to accomplish due to the widespread, rapid, and complex characteristics of saltmarsh replacement in the region. Integrating multi-source remote sensing data with a times-series strategy, this study constructed saltmarsh species maps for the Jiangsu middle coast with 89.4 % overall accuracy (similar to 16.1 % higher than that achieved by the individual image classification method). Subsequently, we used these maps to explore the interaction between saltmarshes and human activities by a dual-scale analysis: macroscale analysis, aiming at saltmarsh ecosystem wide processes, to reflect the general evolutionary trend for all saltmarsh species, and microscale analysis, focusing on a species-specific process, to reveal the focal response mechanism for Spartina alterniflora. The results show that: (1) In the past 20 years, over 97.6 % (227.72 km(2)) of the loss of native saltmarshes (Phragmites australis and Suaeda salsa) was caused by tidal flat reclamation, and the invasion of S. alterniflora poses a potential threat to the future wellbeing of the native saltmarshes. The limited remaining area of the native saltmarshes, together with their long regeneration time, suggests that future land replacement will be dominated by the interaction between S. alterniflora and reclamation. (2) Intertidal reclamation promotes the expansion of S. alterniflora, as revealed by high linear correlations (mainly with R-2 > 0.6) between the lateral expansion rate of S. alterniflora and reclamation. The prerequisite for this correlation was a sufficient width of S. alterniflora (850-1000 m for most of the coasts), and we propose that by maintaining this critical width, S. alterniflora will be capable of relatively rapid invasion after reclamation.

TI  - Analysis of the Temporal and Spatial Variation of Aerosols in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region with a 1 km AOD Product
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is one of the most polluted areas in China, especially in terms of particulate matter pollution. To describe the aerosol distribution of such an area, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) with a 1 km spatial resolution was retrieved from MODIS data based on a new high-resolution <1000 m> aerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori land surface reflectance (LSR) database support (HARLS). Continuous AOD data from 2013 and 2014 retrieved by this algorithm were used to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of the AOD in the above area. The AOD in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has obvious regional and seasonal variations. The AOD in the south and east is higher than in the north and west, and the AOD in spring and summer is higher than that in winter and autumn.

AB  - Generating system using solar energy technology is generally categorized into two groups, Passive and active technology utilization. The grouping dependis on the absorption process, conversion, and distribution of solar energy. Examples of active solar energy utilization is the use of photovoltaic panels and heat absorber panel. Otherwise passive solar energy utilization includes the prosess of directing building toward the sun, choosing a building with greater thermal mass or light dispersion capabilities, and designing the room with natural air circulation. Solar radiation intensity data of specific area can be obtained by three ways: first, direct measurement using the measuring instruments such as pyranometer, pyrheliometer and Campbell stokest. Second, by using the satellite imagery data, the satellite data is widely used because it is accessible globally. Third, by using the numerical salution computer modeling for determining the up coming potential radiation. In order to encourage the usege of renewable energy in potential solar energy region, was conducted same studies of solar energy potential by conducting a preliminary survey and installation of pyranometer, in West Sumbawa regency on September to December 2015 by average potential of 762.331 watts/ m(2). Intensity of solar radiation in West Sumbawa regency of West Nusa Tenggara average of 4.51 Watt/ m(2)/hour Utilization of solar energy for electricity generation. Based PLTS development planning in the province of West Nusa Tenggara most widely used System Solar Home System (SHS) with the scale of the need for households.

TI  - InSAR time-series monitoring of ground displacement trends in an industrial area (Oreokastro-Thessaloniki, Greece): detection of natural surface rebound and new tectonic insights
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The industrial area of Oreokastro, NW of the city of Thessaloniki, is monitored using radar interferometry to determine the spatial evolution of the underlying ground deformation trends. Previous studies, using SAR data acquired between 1992 and 1999, have revealed subsidence; however, the driving mechanism has not been, so far, solidly explained. Here, SAR satellite data from ERS 1, 2 and ENVISAT missions, acquired between 1992 and 2010, are analysed to enhance our understanding of the ground displacement trends and provide a thorough interpretation of the phenomena. The analysis confirms a subsiding displacement pattern from 1992 to 1999, whereas the recent data indicate that after 2003 the motion direction has changed to uplift. This whole monitoring of subsidence and the subsequent uplift is a rarely documented phenomenon, and in the case of Oreokastro is not reflecting a natural process; on the contrary, the driver is anthropogenic, related to the regional aquifer activity. Our study also highlights the fact that the local faults act as groundwater barriers and captures the existence of a possible previously unknown tectonic structure.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - South-west Asia including the Middle East is one of the most prone regions to dust storm events. In recent years, there was an increase in the occurrence of these environmental and meteorological phenomena. Remote sensing could serve as an applicable method to detect and also characterise these events. In this study, two dust enhancement algorithms were used to investigate the behaviour of dust events using satellite data, compare with numerical model output and other satellite products and finally validate with in-situ measurements. The results show that the use of thermal infrared algorithm enhances dust more accurately. The aerosol optical depth from MODIS and output of a Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (DREAM8b) are applied for comparing the results. Ground-based observations of synoptic stations and sun photometers are used for validating the satellite products. To find the transport direction and the locations of the dust sources and the synoptic situations during these events, model outputs (HYSPLIT and NCEP/NCAR) are presented. Comparing the results with synoptic maps and the model outputs showed that using enhancement algorithms is a more reliable way than any other MODIS products or model outputs to enhance the dust.

TI  - Diagnosis of Intracystic Papillary Carcinoma of the Breast by Preoperative Core Needle Biopsy: A Case Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intracystic papillary carcinoma (ICPC) of the breast is rare. It is categorized as noninfiltrating papillary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). It protrudes and grows into the inner cavity in a papillary form, usually unaccompanied by severe infiltration in the surrounding interstitium. ICPC is often a noninfiltrating carcinoma and differentiating it from benign intracystic papilloma is difficult using preoperative imaging alone. Therefore, deciding on a treatment policy is often difficult. For correct diagnosis, it is vital to perform fine needle aspiration (FNA) or core needle biopsy (CNB) of the intracystic solid part accurately and under ultrasound guidance. However, the rate of accurate diagnosis by FNA cytology is low, and diagnosis by CNB is reported to be more effective than cytology. CNB of the solid part of a cyst for preoperative diagnosis is difficult and has a sensitivity of 60%. There is also a report stating that preoperative diagnosis could not be obtained in 40% of patients with ICPC. Therefore, biopsy by resection should be considered in patients who cannot be diagnosed by either FNA or CNB. However, DCIS had better be preoperatively diagnosed because not only axillary lymph node dissection but also sentinel lymph node biopsy might be omitted. The patient was a 42-year-old woman. She found a tumor mass in the left inner breast 10 weeks before her initial visit to the author's clinic. It was difficult to differentiate between the benignity or malignancy of the tumor from images, but a diagnosis of ICPC was made using preoperative CNB.

TI  - Function-preserving gastrectomy based on the sentinel node concept in early gastric cancer
T2  - GASTRIC CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent meta-analyses and a prospective multi-center trial of sentinel node (SN) mapping in early gastric cancer have demonstrated acceptable SN detection rates and accuracy of determination of lymph node status. SN mapping may play a key role in obtaining individual metastatic information. It also allows modification of surgical procedures, including function-preserving gastrectomy in patients with early gastric cancer. A dual-tracer method that uses radioactive colloids and blue dye is currently considered the most reliable method for the stable detection of SNs in patients with early gastric cancer. New technologies, such as indocyanine green infrared or fluorescence imaging, are also useful for accurate SN mapping in gastric cancer. Theoretically, laparoscopic function-preserving gastrectomy, including partial resection, proximal gastrectomy, segmental gastrectomy, and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy, is feasible in early gastric cancer when the SN(s) is/are nonmetastatic. Our study group conducted a multicenter prospective trial in Japan to evaluate function-preserving gastrectomy with SN mapping for long-term survival and patient quality of life. Non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS) is a new technique for treating gastric cancer with partial resection involving full-thickness resection with endoscopy and laparoscopic surgery without transluminal access. The combination of NEWS and SN biopsy is expected to be a promising, minimally invasive, function-preserving surgery that is ideal for cases of cN0 early gastric cancer.

TI  - Land surface temperature retrieval from Landsat 8 data and validation with geosensor network
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) from the two thermal bands of Landsat 8 data is proposed in this paper. The emissivities of vegetation, bare land, buildings, and water are estimated using different features of the wavelength ranges and spectral response functions. Based on the Planck function of the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) band 10 and band 11, the radiative transfer equation is rebuilt and the LST is obtained using the modified emissivity parameters. A sensitivity analysis for the LST retrieval is also conducted. The LST was retrieved from Landsat 8 data for the city of Zoucheng, Shandong Province, China, using the proposed algorithm, and the LST reference data were obtained at the same time from a geosensor network (GSN). A comparative analysis was conducted between the retrieved LST and the reference data from the GSN. The results showed that water had a higher LST error than the other land-cover types, of less than 1.2A degrees C, and the LST errors for buildings and vegetation were less than 0.75A degrees C. The difference between the retrieved LST and reference data was about 1 degrees C on a clear day. These results confirm that the proposed algorithm is effective for the retrieval of LST from the Landsat 8 thermal bands, and a GSN is an effective way to validate and improve the performance of LST retrieval.

TI  - The detection of sentinel lymph nodes in laparoscopic surgery for uterine cervical cancer using 99m-technetium-tin colloid, indocyanine green, and blue dye
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Our objective was to determine the feasibility and detection rates and clarify the most effective combination of injected tracer types for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in uterine cervical cancer in patients who have undergone laparoscopic surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).Methods: A total of 119 patients with cervical cancer underwent SLN biopsy at radical hysterectomy using three types of tracers. The various factors related to side-specific detection rate, sensitivity, and false negative (FN) rate were analyzed.Results: The SLN detection rates using 99m-technetium (Tc-99m)-tin colloid, indigo carmine, and indocyanine green (ICG) were 85.8%, 20.2%, and 61.6%, respectively. The patients with >= 2-cm-diameter tumors and those who received NAC had lower detection rates than those with <2-cm-diameter tumors (75.7% vs. 91.5%, p<0.01) and those who did not receive NAC (67.9% vs. 86.3%,p<0.01), respectively. Laparoscopic procedures had a higher detection rate than laparotomy (100.0% vs. 77.1%, p<0.01). No factors significantly affected the sensitivity; however, the patients with >= 2-cm-diameter tumors (86.0% vs. 1.4%, p<0.01),NAC (19.4% vs. 2.2%, p<0.01), and those who underwent laparotomy (7.4% vs. 0%, p<0.01) had an unfavorable FN rate.Conclusion: Among the examined tracers, 99mTc had the highest detection of SLN mapping in patients with uterine cervical cancer. Patients with local advanced cervical cancer with/without NAC treatment might be unsuited for SLN mapping. SLN mapping is feasible and results in an excellent detection rate in patients with <2-cm-diameter cervical cancer. Laparoscopic surgery is the best procedure for SLN detection in patients with early-stage disease.

TI  - Temporal and spatial distribution of algal blooms in Lake Chaohu, 2000-2015
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Algal blooming in eutrophic lakes has become a critically important issue. As the fifth largest freshwater lake in China, Lake Chaohu has drawn increasing attentions due to the declining of water quality and the occurrence of massive algal blooms.This study applied 2478 free cloud MODIS images onboard Terra and Aqua satellites over the period of 2000-2015 to extract algal blooms with a floating algal index algorithm. The results showed that blooms coverage, frequency , and duration noticeably increased during these years, and the initial blooming occurs earlier. Particularly , algal blooms became more serious during 2000-2015. The conditions for algae blooming was getting better during 2008-2010, and the growth trend has emerged since 2011. 16-year series algal blooms data will help to understand the change in water quality of the Lake Chaohu.

TI  - THE FRESHWATER BIVALVE <i>CORBICULA AUSTRALIS</i> AS A SENTINEL SPECIES FOR METAL TOXICITY ASSESSMENT: AN IN SITU CASE STUDY INTEGRATING CHEMICAL AND BIOMARKER ANALYSES
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - A weight of evidence approach in environmental assessment includes the use of biomonitor organisms to measure biologically available contaminant concentrations and lethal and sublethal responses in an exposure, dose, and response framework. Corbicula australis was assessed as a test species for metal toxicity using in situ river sediment exposures at 4 locations in the Molonglo River (New South Wales, Australia), which has a legacy of sediment metal contamination, following 8 decades of mining in its upper reaches. A sediment metal contamination gradient was evident from 12.5 km to 47 km downstream of the mine, as follows: zinc (851-130 mg/kg) > lead (104-7 mg/kg) > copper (31-5 mu g/kg) > cadmium (2-0.3 mg/kg). Exposed C. australis accumulated the following metals in tissue: zinc (1358-236 mu g/g) > copper (24-20 mu g/g) > cadmium (4.7-0.7mg/g) = lead (4.2-1.8 mu g/g). Biomarker responses showed increased sublethal impairment with increased tissue metal concentrations. Total antioxidant capacity was mildly impaired, with corresponding increased lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilization at the higher tissue metal concentrations. Corbicula australis proved to be an effective biomonitor organism for sediment metal assessment, as it is able to accumulate metals relative to sediment concentrations and showed a pattern of increased sublethal impairment with increased tissue metal concentration. It is recommended as a suitable species for incorporation into local freshwater monitoring and assessment programs. (C) 2016 SETAC

TI  - The Persian-Portuguese Encounter in Hormuz: Orientalism Reconsidered
T2  - IRANIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, the quincentennial commemoration of the Portuguese arrival on the island of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf (1515-1622) revealed the underlying presupposition among Iranians that the Portuguese presence on the island was the harbinger of a long-term pattern of western imperialism. This analysis questions the accuracy of this narrative by advancing a new interpretative framework that does not reduce the holding of Hormuz to simply another dark episode of European colonial history. Circumscribed and limited in aim and reach, Lusitanian activities on Hormuz cannot be brought under the generic rubric of orientalism, which is embedded in European colonial tradition, and which, by extension, buttresses Iranian nationalist sentiment about the Persian-Portuguese entanglement. This research demonstrates that Portuguese objectives diverged from the eighteenth and nineteenth century rationalist scientific traditions of the British, French and Germans professing a civilizing mission as a rationale for colonial policies. Whereas the Portuguese operated from a worldview that combined profit, dynastic pride and religious rhetoric, the Portuguese mission to Hormuz was not guided by a grand discourse of civilizing the other. While there was a complex interplay of commercial interests and brutal methods on this strategic entrepot, Portuguese ambitions in Hormuz were confined and elusive, and at best a matter of tribute-taking. The present paper charters some of these complex interactions.

TI  - A New Map of Wetlands in the Southern Taiga of the West Siberia for Assessing the Emission of Methane and Carbon Dioxide
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A typological map of wetlands in the southern taiga of West Siberia has been compiled based on high-resolution Landsat images. In accordance with the new map, the area of southern-taiga wetlands is estimated at 12.02 Mha at the total wetland area percentage in the subzone estimated at 28%. The final accuracy of determination of various wetland classes is 80%. The use of the new map improved the estimates of methane emissions from southern-taiga wetlands from 0.84 to 1.57 MtCH(4)/year, i.e., by 87%. The respiration of wetland ecosystems in the southern taiga of the West Siberia is estimated at 67 MtCO(2)/year.

TI  - Water Consumption of Agriculture and Natural Ecosystems along the Ili River in China and Kazakhstan
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ili River is a transboundary river shared by China, upstream, and Kazakhstan, downstream. The Ili is the main water supplier to Lake Balkhash, the largest lake in Central Asia after desiccation of the Aral Sea. Agreements over water allocation have not been concluded between China and Kazakhstan. This paper investigated water consumption of agriculture and riparian ecosystems in the Ili river basin, to provide information for further debate on water allocation, through the Simplified Surface Energy Balance Index (S-SEBI) approach using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images. The overall water consumption in the Ili river basin was 14.3 km(3)/a in 2000, 17.2 km(3)/a in 2005, and 15 km(3)/a in 2014. In 2000, China and Kazakhstan consumed 38% and 62% of the water, respectively. By 2014, the relative share of China's water consumption increased to 43%. In China, 80% of the water consumption is due to agriculture. High runoff during the past 10 years enabled increasing water consumption in China and sufficient water supply to agriculture and riparian ecosystems in Kazakhstan. When runoff of the Ili River decreases, as expected for most rivers in Central Asia, then irrigation efficiency has to be further increased in China, and irrigation systems in Kazakhstan have to be restored and modernized in order to reduce water consumption and protect Lake Balkhash and the riparian ecosystems.

TI  - Exploring Digital Surface Models from Nine Different Sensors for Forest Monitoring and Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital surface models (DSMs) derived from spaceborne and airborne sensors enable the monitoring of the vertical structures for forests in large areas. Nevertheless, due to the lack of an objective performance assessment for this task, it is difficult to select the most appropriate data source for DSM generation. In order to fill this gap, this paper performs change detection analysis including forest decrease and tree growth. The accuracy of the DSMs is evaluated by comparison with measured tree heights from inventory plots (field data). In addition, the DSMs are compared with LiDAR data to perform a pixel-wise quality assessment. DSMs from four different satellite stereo sensors (ALOS/PRISM, Cartosat-1, RapidEye and WorldView-2), one satellite InSAR sensor (TanDEM-X), two aerial stereo camera systems (HRSC and UltraCam) and two airborne laser scanning datasets with different point densities are adopted for the comparison. The case study is a complex central European temperate forest close to Traunstein in Bavaria, Germany. As a major experimental result, the quality of the DSM is found to be robust to variations in image resolution, especially when the forest density is high. The forest decrease results confirm that besides aerial photogrammetry data, very high resolution satellite data, such as WorldView-2, can deliver results with comparable quality as the ones derived from LiDAR, followed by TanDEM-X and Cartosat DSMs. The quality of the DSMs derived from ALOS and Rapid-Eye data is lower, but the main changes are still correctly highlighted. Moreover, the vertical tree growth and their relationship with tree height are analyzed. The major tree height in the study site is between 15 and 30 m and the periodic annual increments (PAIs) are in the range of 0.30-0.50 m.

TI  - Religion and worldview in the work of Marie Muller-Lulofs, a pioneer in Dutch social work
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Social workers nowadays are confronted with recurrent issues about religion and spirituality when in contact with diverse client groups. This was also the case in the beginning of the profession around 1900, in Europe as well as in the US. This study analyses the work of a Dutch pioneer in social work, Marie Muller-Lulofs (1854-1954) and presents the religious and worldview aspects of her reflections on social work. Her standard work Van mensch tot mensch (From person to person) of 1916 forms the basic text for theory-driven content analysis by applying the seven-dimension model of worldview of Ninian Smart: doctrine/philosophy, organisations, ethics, stories, experiences, rituals and materials. Results show that Muller-Lulofs makes a strong plea for a secular profession. Social-economic approaches are on the foreground. And yet, the methods, skills and professional attitudes she describes are substantially accounted for in religious and spiritual terms. This is mainly done by introducing narratives and metaphors derived from Christian and Buddhist traditions. It is concluded that Muller-Lulofs uses religion and spirituality in a non-dogmatic and non-prescriptive way, but as a source of inspiration to underpin the new profession. Her approach is relevant for current issues in social work in multicultural societies.

TI  - Physical forcing of late summer chlorophyll a blooms in the oligotrophic eastern North Pacific
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated physical forcing of late summer chlorophyll a (chl a) blooms in the oligotrophic eastern North Pacific Ocean by using ocean reanalysis and satellite data. Relatively large chl a blooms as defined in this study occurred in August-October following sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly (SSTA) decreases, mixed layer deepening, and temperature and salinity increases at the bottom of the mixed layer. These physical conditions were apparently induced by the entrainment of subsurface water resulting from the destabilization of the surface layer caused by anomalous northward Ekman transport of subtropical waters of higher salinity. Salinity-normalized total alkalinity data provide supporting evidence for nutrient supply by the entrainment process. We next investigated the impact of including information about the entrainment on bloom identification. The results of analyses using reanalysis data and of those using only satellite data showed large SSTA decreases when the northward Ekman salinity transports were large, implying that the entrainment of subsurface water is well represented in both types of data. After surface-destabilizing conditions were established, relatively high surface chl a concentrations were observed. The use of SST information can further improve the detection of high chl a concentrations. Although the detection of high chl a concentrations would be enhanced by finer data resolution and the inclusion of biogeochemical parameters in the ocean reanalysis, our results obtained by using existing reanalysis data as well as recent satellite data are valuable for better understanding and prediction of lower trophic ecosystem variability.

TI  - Integrating global land cover datasets for deriving user-specific maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global scale land cover (LC) mapping has interested many researchers over the last two decades as it is an input data source for various applications. Current global land cover (GLC) maps often do not meet the accuracy and thematic requirements of specific users. This study aimed to create an improved GLC map by integrating available GLC maps and reference datasets. We also address the thematic requirements of multiple users by demonstrating a concept of producing GLC maps with user-specific legends. We used a regression kriging method to integrate Globcover-2009, LC-CCI-2010, MODIS-2010 and Globeland30 maps and several publicly available GLC reference datasets. Overall correspondence of the integrated GLC map with reference LC was 80% based on 10-fold cross-validation using 24,681 sample sites. This is globally 10% and regionally 6-13% higher than the input map correspondences. Based on LC class presence probability maps, expected LC proportion maps at coarser resolution were created and used for characterizing mosaic classes for land system modelling and biodiversity assessments. Since more reference datasets are becoming freely accessible, GLC mapping can be further improved by using the pool of all available reference datasets. LC proportion information allow tuning LC products to specific user needs.

TI  - Comparative study of performance of real-time satellite-derived rainfall in Swat Catchment
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the conventional models require rainfall data for realistic modeling results, and where ground data is scarce, remotely sensed data plays a vital role. For monitoring, hydrological models require near real-time observations to allow for effective planning and forecasting. However, monitoring rainfall in mountainous region is difficult because of inaccessibility and sparse gauge density. However, the accurateness of these satellite estimates over different spatial and temporal scales is unknown. The study intended at carrying out a comparative analysis of satellite rainfall estimates as a substitution for ground-based rainfall observations in the Swat Catchment. Limited availability of temporally continuous available data records in Pakistan has been a problem and has effected the reliability of modeling results. As well as, data is not freely available and cost is the biggest hindrance to its usage. So, remotely sensed data plays a vital role both in terms of timely availability and its free of charge. For this region, only two remotely sensed gridded data products are freely available, i.e., NOAA RFE CA and TRMM RT. Respective two products have been analyzed by various verification statistics. RFE CA proves better probability of detection, false alarm ratio, threat score, and equitable threat score than TRMM RT. The outcome of this comparative study concludes that for hydrological modeling purposes, RFE CA data is the best choice in this region. The annual bias for RFE CA and TRMM RT is 14% (over-estimation) and 18% (under-estimation) over the years having coefficient of determination with the ground-based data of 0.87 and 0.76, respectively, on annual basis. The result shows the suitability of RFE CA for effective monthly rainfall-runoff modeling in Swat Catchment, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Pakistan.

TI  - A Model for Deriving the Spectral Backscattering Properties of Particles in Inland and Marine Waters From <i>In Situ</i> and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A model is developed for deriving the backscattering properties of phytoplankton [bbph(lambda)] and nonalgal particles [bbNAP(lambda)] from the total particulate backscattering coefficient [bbp(lambda)] in turbid and productive coastal and inland water environments. In situ spectral particulate backscattering data acquired from several field campaigns on the turbid and pro-ductive coastal regions of southern India are used to develop a partitioning method and establish robust relationships between the partitioned bbph(lambda) and bbNAP(lambda) versus chlorophyll and turbidity. The performance of this method is assessed using independent data sets from marine and inland productive waters. The bbph(lambda) and bbNAP(lambda) products derived from this method are found in good agreement with in situ data, with the overall percentile error of a few percent which is well within the benchmark for a validated uncertainty of +/- 35% endorsed for the chlorophyll-a retrieval in oceanic waters. Further comparison with other inversion methods demonstrated the relative performance of the new model, especially in productive and algal bloom-dominated waters. To illustrate the use of the new model for remote sensing applications, it was applied to both multispectral Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Aqua and hyperspectral ( Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean) images from the algal bloom-dominated waters of the Arabian Sea and turbid productive lagoon waters on the coastal region of the Bay of Bengal. The results were interesting, i. e., the existence of strong spectral features and inflections in the phytoplankton backscattering spectra in bloom-dominated waters and the nearly featureless NAP backscattering spectra varying approximately according to a power law in sedimentladen waters. Corroborating the previous experimental and theoretical studies, our results for algal bloom waters show a steep slope in the blue region and enhanced backscattering in the green and near-infrared regions due to the influence of phytoplankton absorption and backscattering. These results further suggest that living algal matter in productive waters may be a source of significant backscattering. Under typical nonbloom conditions in turbid coastal waters, our analyses confirm that the minerogenic and detrital particles are likely the most important because of their high abundance relative to living organic particles and their spectral dependences have profound implications for our understanding of the relationship between the backscattering to scattering ratio and particle size distribution and related properties. The new model clearly represents as an important tool permitting the analysis of the spectral backscattering coefficients associated with phytoplankton and nonliving components in sediment-laden and algal-bloom-dominated productive waters within coastal environments.

TI  - Influence of Compositing Criterion and Data Availability on Pixel-Based Landsat TM/ETM plus Image Compositing Over Amazonian Forests
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent cloud cover is an important obstacle to studying the ground surface of tropical rain forest areas using high-resolution optical data, such as those obtained with Landsat satellites. The identification and masking of the cloud-affected parts of such images is a necessary preprocessing step, but it easily leads to impractical fragmentation of the informative image area. Pixel-based multitemporal image compositing solves the fragmentation problem, but depends on a predefined compositing period length and compositing criterion. Here, we evaluate the radiometric consistency of Landsat TM/ ETM+ composite images over undisturbed Amazonian forests and test to what degree it varies with the number of available multitemporal observations per pixel and the compositing criterion. Five compositing criteria were tested: maximum NDVI, median red, median near-infrared, multi-dimensional medoid, andminimum aerosol optical thickness. Each was applied to datasets consisting of 3-30 observations per pixel. Compositing quality was assessed both visually and with quantitative measures using the overlap area of neighboring WRS-2 scenes. We found that the medoid approach generated the most radiometrically consistent composite images. Composite image quality increased monotonically with the number of observations, but with diminishing returns. Satisfactory results were generally obtained with 10-15 observations per pixel.

TI  - DWI for Assessment of Rectal Cancer Nodes After Chemoradiotherapy: Is the Absence of Nodes at DWI Proof of a Negative Nodal Status?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ROENTGENOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. When considering organ preservation in patients with rectal cancer with good tumor response, assessment of a node-negative status after chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is important. DWI is a very sensitive technique to detect nodes. The study aim was to test the hypothesis that the absence of nodes at DWI after CRT is concordant with a ypN0 status.MATERIALS AND METHODS. A retrospective study was performed of 90 patients with rectal cancer treated with CRT followed by restaging MRI at 1.5 T, including DWI (highest b value, 1000 s/mm(2)). Two independent readers counted the number of nodes visible in the mesorectal compartment on DW images obtained after CRT. The number of nodes on DWI (0 vs >= 1) was compared with the number of metastatic nodes at histopathology or long-term clinical follow-up (yN0 vs yN-positive status).RESULTS. Seventy-one patients had a yN0 status, and 19 had a yN-positive status. For 10 patients, no nodes were observed at DWI, which was concordant with a yN0 status in 100% of cases. In the other 61 patients with a yN0 status, the median number of nodes detected at DWI was three (range, 1-17 nodes). To differentiate between yN0 and yN-positive status, sensitivity was 100%, specificity was 14%, the positive predictive value was 24%, and the negative predictive value was 100%.CONCLUSION. Although the absence of nodes at DWI is not a frequent finding, it appears to be a reliable predictor of yN0 status after CRT in patients with rectal cancer. DWI may thus be a helpful adjunct in assessing response after CRT and may help select patients for organ-saving treatment.

TI  - (Neo)adjuvant systemic therapy for melanoma
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgery still is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with stage II and III melanoma, but despite great efforts to gain or preserve locoregional control with excision of the primary tumour, satellites, intransits, sentinel node biopsy and lymphadenectomy, surgery alone does not seem to improve survival any further. Prognosis for patients with high risk melanoma remains poor with 5-year survival rates of 40 to 80%. Only interferon-2b has been approved as adjuvant therapy since 1995, but clinical integration is low considering the high risk benefit ratio. In recent years systemic targeted- and immunotherapy have proven to be beneficial in advanced melanoma and could be a promising strategy for (neo)adjuvant treatment of patients with resectable high risk melanomas as well. Randomised, placebo- controlled phase III trials on adjuvant systemic targeted- and immunotherapy are currently being performed using new agents like ipilimumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab, vemurafenib and dabrafenib plus trametinib. In this article we review the literature on currently known adjuvant therapies and currently ongoing trials of (neo)adjuvant therapies in high risk melanomas.

TI  - Thermophysical properties along <i>Curiosity'</i>s traverse in Gale crater, Mars, derived from the REMS ground temperature sensor
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The REMS instrument onboard the Mars Science Laboratory rover, Curiosity, has measured ground temperature nearly continuously at hourly intervals for two Mars years. Coverage of the entire diurnal cycle at 1 Hz is available every few martian days. We compare these measurements with predictions of surface atmosphere thermal models to derive the apparent thermal inertia and thermally derived albedo along the rover's traverse after accounting for the radiative effects of atmospheric water ice during fall and winter, as is necessary to match the measured seasonal trend. The REMS measurements can distinguish between active sand, other loose materials, mudstone, and sandstone based on their thermophysical properties. However, the apparent thermal inertias of bedrock-dominated surfaces (similar to 350-550 J m(-2) K-1 s-(1/2)) are lower than expected. We use rover imagery and the detailed shape of the diurnal ground temperature curve to explore whether lateral or vertical heterogeneity in the surface materials within the sensor footprint might explain the low inertias. We find that the bedrock component of the surface can have a thermal inertia as high as 650-1700 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) for mudstone sites and 700 J m(-2) K-1 s(-1/2) for sandstone sites in models runs that include lateral and vertical mixing. Although the results of our forward modeling approach may be non-unique, they demonstrate the potential to extract information about lateral and vertical variations in thermophysical properties from temporally resolved measurements of ground temperature.

TI  - FIRST EXPERIENCE OF LYMPHOSCINTIGRAPHY USE IN EARLY STAGES OF BREAST CANCER
T2  - Kazanskii Meditsinskii Zhurnal
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. To evaluate efficacy of radioisotopic methods in detection of metastatic involvement of sentinel lymph nodes for choosing further theurapeutic tactics.Methods. The study group included 23 females with confirmed breast cancer. Sentinel lymph nodes were detected by isotope Tc-99m Nanocolloid and blue dye in General Electric gamma camera (USA).Results. In all cases patients' age was 45 to 60 years. In 16 (69.5%) cases the tumor size was below 5 cm which corresponded to clinical stage 2, in other 7 (30.5%) patients the tumor size was below 2 cm. Positive results with the use of lymphoscintigraphy were revealed in 6 (26%) cases, all results were morphologically confirmed straight after lymph node removal. In 5 (83%) cases metastatic involvement of the node was observed in stage 2 cancer. Such patients were immediately referred to radical mastectomy with radical lymph node dissection. In other cases pathological accumulation of a radiopharmaceutical was not observed. Only in one case after removal of such node its metastatic involvement was confirmed histologically. So the frequency of false negative results was 4.3%. Respectively, status of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer reflects the status of lymphatic collector with 95.7% accuracy.Conclusion. The biopsy results demonstrated high diagnostic value of lymphoscintigraphy for detection of breast cancer metastases to sentinel lymph nodes (sensitivity 86%, specificity 100%): the method can be successfully used in early stages of breast cancer and also in case of negative results of conventional diagnostic methods (ultrasound, roentgen mammography).

TI  - Reprocessing the Most Intense Historical Tropical Cyclones in the Satellite Era Using the Advanced Dvorak Technique
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, a number of extremely powerful tropical cyclones have revived community debate on methodologies used to estimate the lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) of these events. And how do these storms rank historically? In this study, the most updated version of an objective satellite-based intensity estimation algorithm [ advanced Dvorak technique (ADT)] is employed and applied to the highest-resolution (spatial and temporal) geostationary satellite data available for extreme-intensity tropical cyclones that occurred during the era of these satellites (1979-present). Cases with reconnaissance aircraft observations are examined and used to calibrate the ADT at extreme intensities. Bias corrections for observing properties such as satellite viewing angle and image spatiotemporal resolution, and storm characteristics such as small eye size are also considered.The results of these intensity estimates (maximum sustained 1-min wind) show that eastern North Pacific Hurricane Patricia (2015) ranks as the strongest storm in any basin (182 kt), followed by western North Pacific Typhoons Haiyan (2013), Tip (1979), and Gay (1992). The following are the strongest classifications in other basins-Atlantic: Gilbert (1988), north Indian Ocean basin: Paradip (1999), south Indian Ocean: Gafilo (2004), Australian region: Monica (2006), and southeast Pacific basin: Pam (2015). In addition, ADT LMI estimates for four storms exceed the maximum allowable limit imposed by the operational Dvorak technique. This upper bound on intensity may be an unnatural constraint, especially if tropical cyclones get stronger in a warmer biosphere as some theorize. This argues for the need of an extension to the Dvorak scale to allow higher intensity estimates.

TI  - Observation of abnormal thermal and infrasound signals prior to the earthquakes: a study on Bonin Island earthquake M7.8 (May 30, 2015)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientists from all over the world try to incorporate multi-disciplinary precursors to forecast the earthquake on a short-term basis. The authors here have analyzed outgoing longwave radiations acquired from polar-orbiting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) satellites and long-period infrasound waves recorded by the ground observatories in China prior to the recent Bonin Islands, Japan region earthquake which occurred on May 30, 2015 with the magnitude of 7.8. The anomalous outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) was observed on May 15, 2015, and was recorded by "NOAA 18'' satellite during its "night pass.'' Similarly, an abnormal infrasound spike was recorded at the Beijing station on May 17, 2015. The delay in observing anomalous infrasound waves compared to the OLR anomaly is due to these low-frequency waves traveling at low speed with the velocity range of 10-15 m/s. From the analysis of the results, it can be inferred that there is a substantial relation between parameters like OLR and infrasound waves; hence, the authors conclude that it is possible to forecast the earthquake on a short-term basis with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Effect of environmental conditions on the relationship between solar-induced fluorescence and gross primary productivity at an OzFlux grassland site
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have utilized coarse spatial and temporal resolution remotely sensed solar- induced fluorescence (SIF) for modeling terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) at regional scales. Although these studies have demonstrated the potential of SIF, there have been concerns about the ecophysiological basis of the relationship between SIF and GPP in different environmental conditions. Launched in 2014, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has enabled fine- scale (1.3 by 2.5 km) retrievals of SIF that are comparable with measurements recorded at eddy covariance towers. In this study, we examine the effect of environmental conditions on the relationship of OCO-2 SIF with tower GPP over the course of a growing season at a well- characterized natural grassland site. Combining OCO-2 SIF and eddy covariance tower data with a canopy radiative transfer and an ecosystem model, we also assess the potential of OCO-2 SIF to constrain the estimates of V-cmax, one of the most important parameters in ecosystem models. Based on the results, we suggest that although environmental conditions play a role in determining the nature of relationship between SIF and GPP, overall, the linear relationship is more robust at ecosystem scale than the theory based on leaf- level processes might suggest. Our study also shows that the ability of SIF to constrain Vcmax is weak at the selected site.

TI  - The Relevance of Ultrasound Imaging of Suspicious Axillary Lymph Nodes and Fine-needle Aspiration Biopsy in the Post-ACOSOG Z11 Era in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: Evaluation of nodal involvement in early-stage breast cancers (T1 or T2) changed following the Z11 trial; however, not all patients meet the Z11 inclusion criteria. Hence, the relevance of ultrasound imaging of the axilla and fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) in early-stage breast cancers was investigated.Materials and Methods: In this single-center, retrospective study, 758 subjects had pathology verified breast cancer diagnosis over a 3-year period, of which 128 subjects with T1 or T2 breast tumors had abnormal axillary lymph nodes on ultrasound, had FNA, and proceeded to axillary surgery. Ultrasound images were reviewed and analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify the features predictive of positive FNA. Accuracy of FNA was quantified as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with axillary surgery as reference standard.Results: Of 128 subjects, 61 were positive on FNA and 65 were positive on axillary surgery. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FNA were 52 of 65 (80%), 54 of 63 (85.7%), 52 of 61(85.2%), and 54 of 67 (80.5%), respectively. After adjusting for neoadjuvant chemotherapy between FNA and surgery, a positive FNA was associated with higher likelihood for positive axillary surgery (odds ratio: 22.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.2-71.3, P <.0001), and the accuracy of FNA was 0.801 (95% CI: 0.727-0.876). Among ultrasound imaging features, cortical thickness and abnormal hilum were predictive (P <.017) of positive FNA with accuracy of 0.817 (95% CI: 0.741-0.893).Conclusions: Ultrasound imaging and FNA can play an important role in the management of early breast cancers even in the post-Z11 era. Higher weightage can be accorded to cortical thickness and hilum during ultrasound evaluation.

TI  - Comparing Arm Morbidity Following Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in Thai Patients with Early Breast Cancer
T2  - Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)for staging of the avilla in breast cancer patients may cause considerable morbidities. Recently, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLAB) has been shown to accurately define the patients who do not need ALND. There are multiple possible factors in addition to the extent of taillaty surgery that contribute to these morbidities.Objective: To evaluate arm morbidities in early breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB in comparison with those with ALND and to identify clinicopathological parameters associated with the development of arm morbidities.Material and Method: Postoperative morbidities and quality of life were compared in 112 breast cancer patients after ALND and 85 patients following SLNB at the Division of Head-Neck and Breast Surgery, Siriraj Hospital from October 1997 to January 2006. Correlations between clinicopathological parameters and arm morbidities were determined by Chi-square statistics and regression analysis.Results: Patients' characteristics were comparable between the two groups. Following ALND, the patients showed significant increase in arm swelling (9.8%) compared with SLNB (1.2%). as well as a significantly higher rate of numbness. No difference between the two groups was found regarding arm movement, strength. or daily activities. Multivariate analysis showed that ALND is the independent factor that significantly increased arm Morbidity.Conclusion: The authors reported for the first time of post-treatment arm morbidities in Thai breast cancer patients. The SLNB had been shown to spare the patients' morbidities resultingfrom ALND. Therefore. the SLNB should be adopted as an alternative to routine ALND in Thai pawtiets with clinically lymph node negative breast cancer

AB  - The paper deals with the history of Christian philosophy and its two main versions, Thomistic and Augustinian, as well as the criteria of the rationality of a worldview. The comparison of the two versions of Christian philosophy enables us to argue that the Thomistic version of Christian philosophy is more conductive to the dialogue with other worldviews than its Augustinian counterpart. Further, the article introduces the criteria of the rationality of a worldview and addresses the question whether Thomistic version of Christian philosophy meets them.

TI  - Differences in Rate and Direction of Shifts between Phytoplankton Size Structure and Sea Surface Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species distributions are changing with various rates and directions in response to recent global warming. The velocity of sea surface temperature (SST) has been used to predict species migration and persistence as an expectation of how species track their thermal niches; however, several studies have found that evidence for species shifts has deviated from the velocity of SST. This study investigated whether estimation of the velocity of shifts in phytoplankton size structure using remote sensing data could contribute to better prediction of species shifts. A chlorophyll-a (Chla) size distribution (CSD) model was developed by quantifying the relationships between the size structure of the phytoplankton community and the spectral features of the phytoplankton absorption coefficient (a(ph)()), based on the principal component analysis approach. Model validation demonstrated that the exponent of CSD (hereafter, CSD slope), which can describe the synoptic size structure of a phytoplankton community, was derived successfully with a relative root mean square error of 18.5%. The median velocity of CSD slope across the ocean was 485.2 kmdecade(-1), broadly similar to Chla (531.5 kmdecade(-1)). These values were twice the velocity of SST, and the directions of shifts in CSD slope and Chla were quite different from that of SST. Because Chla is generally covariant with the size structure of a phytoplankton community, we believe that spatiotemporal changes in Chla can explain the variations of phytoplankton size structure. Obvious differences in both rate and direction of shifts were found between the phytoplankton size structure and SST, implying that shifts of phytoplankton size structure could be a powerful tool for assessing the distributional shifts of marine species. Our results will contribute to generate global and regional maps of expected species shifts in response to environmental forcing.

TI  - Molecular typing for blood group antigens within 40 min by direct polymerase chain reaction from plasma or serum
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining blood group antigens by serological methods may be unreliable in certainsituations, such as in patients after chronic or massive transfusion. Red cell genotyping offers a complementary approach, but current methods may take much longer than conventional serological typing, limiting their utility in urgent situations. To narrow this gap, we devised a rapid method using direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification while avoiding the DNA extraction step. DNA was amplified by PCR directly from plasma or serum of blood donors followed by a melting curve analysis in a capillary rapid-cycle PCR assay. We evaluated the single nucleotide polymorphisms underlying the clinically relevant Fy(a), Fy(b), Jk(a) and Jk(b) antigens, with our analysis being completed within 40min of receiving a plasma or serum sample. The positive predictive value was 100% and the negative predictive value at least 84%. Direct PCR with melting point analysis allowed faster red cell genotyping to predict blood group antigens than any previous molecular method. Our assay may be used as a screening tool with subsequent confirmatory testing, within the limitations of the false-negative rate. With fast turnaround times, the rapid-cycle PCR assay may eventually be developed and applied to red cell genotyping in the hospital setting.

T2  - ANNALS OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Resection techniques for esophageal carcinoma continue to evolve, from endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection for early stage disease to standard and robot-assisted minimally invasive esophagectomy as part of multimodal therapy for locally advanced disease. Though currently limited to assessing conduit perfusion and sentinel lymph nodes, embedded technology in the robotic surgical platform will likely play an expanded role during esophagectomy in the future. The use of targeted therapies, checkpoint inhibitors, engineered immune cell therapy, and cancer vaccines show promise in the treatment of systemic disease. Radiation therapy techniques are becoming increasingly sophisticated and they may play a more active role in stage IV disease in the future.

TI  - A fusion method of high-resolution full polarimetric SAR and moderate-resolution optical image
T2  - Journal of Tropical Oceanography
M3  - Article
AB  - A method was proposed to solve the fusion problem of full polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and moderate-resolution optical remote sensing image, based on principal components analysis (PCA) and HSV transform, where HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value. First, the four bands of full polarization SAR went through principal component analysis, and the first principal component was extracted. Second, moderate-resolution optical image was transformed into the HSV space, and the V component was replaced by the first principal component. Finally, the desired image was obtained by using inverse IHS transform. The experiment was performed using Radarsat-2 full polarimetric SAR and TM/ETM+ moderate-resolution optical image. A comparison of the proposed method with the fusion of single polarimetric SAR and optical image based on a traditional method (PCA transform, HSV transform, or wavelet transform) showed that the proposed method made effective use of the texture information of full polarimetric SAR and improved the capability of image interpretation.

TI  - Estimation of Downwelling Surface Longwave Radiation under Heavy Dust Aerosol Sky
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The variation of aerosols, especially dust aerosol, in time and space plays an important role in climate forcing studies. Aerosols can effectively reduce land surface longwave emission and re-emit energy at a colder temperature, which makes it difficult to estimate downwelling surface longwave radiation (DSLR) with satellite data. Using the latest atmospheric radiative transfer code (MODTRAN 5.0), we have simulated the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and DSLR under different land surface types and atmospheric profile conditions. The results show that dust aerosol has an obvious warming effect to longwave radiation compared with other aerosols; that aerosol longwave radiative forcing (ALRF) increased with the increasing of aerosol optical depth (AOD); and that the atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is critical to the understanding of ALRF. A method is proposed to improve the accuracy of DSLR estimation from satellite data for the skies under heavy dust aerosols. The AOD and atmospheric WVC under cloud-free conditions with a relatively simple satellite-based radiation model yielding the high accurate DSLR under heavy dust aerosol are used explicitly as model input to reduce the effects of dust aerosol on the estimation of DSLR. Validations of the proposed model with satellites data and field measurements show that it can estimate the DSLR accurately under heavy dust aerosol skies. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 20.4 W/m(2) and 24.2 W/m(2) for Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively, at the Yingke site, and the biases are 2.7 W/m(2) and 9.6 W/m(2), respectively. For the Arvaikheer site, the RMSEs are 23.2 W/m(2) and 19.8 W/m(2) for Terra and Aqua, respectively, and the biases are 7.8 W/m(2) and 10.5 W/m(2), respectively. The proposed method is especially applicable to acquire relatively high accurate DSLR under heavy dust aerosol using MODIS data with available WVC and AOD data.

TI  - First versus second year respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in chronic lung disease (2005-2015)
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Children aged < 2 years with chronic lung disease (CLD) have a 10-fold higher risk for respiratory syncytial virus-positive hospitalization (RSVH) compared to healthy term infants. Based on the updated position statements, we compared respiratory-related illness hospitalization (RIH) and RSVH risks in CLD children who received palivizumab during the first year (FY) versus second year (SY) of life in the Canadian Registry of Palivizumab (CARESS). Demographic data were collected at enrolment and RIH events recorded monthly from 2005 to 2015. Eight hundred forty-seven FY and 450 SY children with CLD were identified. SY children had a lower gestational age (27 versus 29 weeks) and required more days of respiratory support (64 versus 43), oxygen therapy (108 versus 55), and length of stay (118 versus 73) during the neonatal course compared to FY children; all p < 0.0005. RIH rates were 12.2 (FY) and 18.2 (SY), and RSVH rates were 2.3 (FY) and 3.9 (SY). Cox regression showed similar hazards for both RIH (hazard ratio 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.6, p = 0.812) and RSVH (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% CI 0.4-2.9, p = 0.920).Conclusions: SY and FY children had similar risks for RIH and RSVH. The findings imply that SY children with CLD are correctly selected for palivizumab based on neonatal illness severity and merit prophylaxis.

TI  - A New Method for Retrieving Daily Land Surface Albedo From VIIRS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike instantaneous albedo, daily albedo of land surfaces is currently not routinely generated from satellite data, although it is a key input parameter for calculating daily shortwave radiation budget. This paper presents a novel approach to directly retrieve daily mean values of land surface broadband blue-sky albedo from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite clear-sky data of apparent reflectance, with the assumption that the atmospheric conditions of the satellite overpass time can represent their daily values. Training data were simulated by atmospheric radiative transfer models, with surface spectra and bidirectional reflectance distribution function data as inputs for four aerosol types and a range of aerosol loadings. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to study the effects of cloud coverage, aerosol, and surface types on retrieval accuracy. Two years of measurements at six Surface Radiation Budget Network and eight Greenland Climate Network stations were used for algorithm validation. Daily albedo of snow-free surfaces can be retrieved with very high accuracy. By excluding far off-nadir observations of snow surfaces, the overall accuracy of retrieving daily albedo has a bias of 0.003 and a root-mean-square error of 0.055.

TI  - Mapping the dynamics of eastern redcedar encroachment into grasslands during 1984-2010 through PALSAR and time series Landsat images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody plant encroachment of eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana L, hereafter referred to as "red cedar") into native grasslands in the U.S. Southern Great Plains has significantly affected the production of forage and livestock, wildlife habitats, as well as water, carbon, nutrient and biogeochemical cycles. However, time series of red cedar maps are still not available to document the continuously spatio-temporal dynamics of red cedar encroachment across landscape, watershed and regional scales. In this study, we developed a pixel and phenology-based mapping algorithm, and used it to analyze PALSAR mosaic data in 2010 and all the available Landsat 5/7 data during 1984-2010 with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This pilot study analyzed 4233 images covering >10 counties in the central region of Oklahoma, and generated red cedar forest maps for 2010 and five historical time periods: the late 1980s (1984-1989), early 1990s (1990-1994), late 1990s (1995-1999), early 2000s (2000-2004), and late 2000s (2005-2010). The resultant maps for 2010, the late 2000s, early 2000s, and late 1990s were evaluated using validation samples collected from Google Earth's high-resolution images and geo-referenced field photos. The overall (producer and user) accuracy of these maps ranged from 88% to 96% (88%-93%, and 96%-99%). The resultant maps clearly illustrated an increase in red cedar encroachment within the study area at an annual rate of similar to 8% during 1984-2010. These maps can be used to support additional studies on the driving factors and consequences of red cedar encroachment. This study also demonstrated the potential to trace the historical encroachment of red cedar into grasslands using time series Landsat images and PALSAR data. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Application and comparison of remote sensing GPP models with multi-site data in China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation at the global and regional scales is important for understanding the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. Due to the heterogeneous nature of surface, measurements at the site level cannot be directly up-scaled to the regional scale. Remote sensing has been widely used as a tool for up-saling GPP by integrating the land surface observations with spatial vegetation patterns. Although. there have been many models based on light use efficiency and remote sensing data for simulating terrestrial ecosystem GPP, those models depend much on meteorological data; use of different sources of meteorological datasets often results in divergent outputs, leading to uncertainties in the simulation results. In this study, we examines the feasibility of using two GPP models driven by remote sensing data for estimating regional GPP across different vegetation types.Methods Two GPP models were tested in this study, including the Temperature and Greenness Model (TG) and the Vegetation Index Model (VI), based on remote sensing data and flux data from the China flux network (ChinaFLUX) for different vegatation types for the period 2003-2005. The study sites consist of eight ecological stations located in Xilingol (grassland), Changbaishan (mixed broadleaf-conifer forest), Haibei (shrubland), Yucheng (cropland), Damxung (alpine meadow), Qianyanzhou (evergreen needle-leaved forest), Dinghushan (evergreen broad-leaved forest), and Xishuangbanna (evergreen broad-leaved forest), respectively.Important findings All the remote sensing parameters employed by the TG and VI models had good relationships with the observed GPP, with the values of coefficient of determination, R-2, exceeding 0.67 for majority of the study sites. However, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) varied greatly among the study sites: the RMSE of TG ranged from 0.29 to 6.40 g.m(-2)d(-1) and that of VI ranged from 0.31 to 7.09 g.m(-2)d(-1), respectively. The photosynthetic conversion coefficients m and a can be up-scaled to a regional scale based on their relationships with the annual average nighttime land surface temperature (LST), with 79% variations in m and 58% of variations in a being explainable in the up-scaling. The correlations between the simulated outputs of both TG and VI and the measured values were mostly high, with the values of correlation coefficient, r, ranging from 0.06 in the TG model and 0.13 in the VI model at the Xishuangbanna site, to 0.94 in the TG model and 0.89 in the VI model at the Haibei site. In general, the TG model performed better than the VI model, especially at sites with high elevation and that are mainly limited by temperature. Both models had potential to be applied at a regional scale in China.

TI  - On-orbit geometric calibration and geometric quality assessment for the high-resolution geostationary optical satellite GaoFen4
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese GaoFen4 (GF4) remote sensing satellite, launched at the end of December 2015, is China's first civilian high-resolution geostationary optical satellite and has the world's highest resolution from geostationary orbit. High accuracy geometric calibration is the key factor in the geometrical quality of satellite imagery. This paper proposes an on-orbit geometric calibration approach for the high resolution geostationary optical satellite GF4 in which a stepwise calibration is performed, external parameters are estimated, and internal parameters are then estimated in a generalized camera frame determined by external parameters. First, the correlation of the imaging error sources and the rigorous imaging model of GF4 are introduced. Second, the geometric calibration model based on the two-dimensional detector directional angle and the parameters estimation method for the planar array camera are presented. LandSat 8 digital orthophoto maps (DOM) and GDEM2 digital elevation models (DEM) are used to validate the efficiency of the proposed method and to make a geometric quality assessment of GF4. The results indicate that changing imaging time and imaging area will dramatically affect the absolute positioning accuracy because of the change of the camera's installation angles caused by thermal environment changes around the satellite in a high orbit. After calibration, the internal distortion is well-compensated, and the positioning accuracy with relatively few ground control points (GCPs) is demonstrated to be better than 1.0 pixels for both the panchromatic and near-infrared sensor and the intermediate infrared sensor.

TI  - NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF INFLUENCE OF STRATOSPHERIC METHANE ON TROPICAL WATER VAPOR AND TEMPERATURE
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic characteristics of tropical stratospheric methane have been well researched using various satellite data, and numerical simulations have furtherly conducted using chemical climatic models, while the impact of tropica1 stratospheric methane oxidation on tropical distribution of water vapor is not paid enough attention in general circulation models. Parameterization of methane oxidation is taken into account to deal with the chemical moisturizing action due to the methane oxidation in this paper. Numerical simulation and analysis of the influence of stratospheric methane on the prediction of tropical stratospheric moisture and temperature fields using general circulation model is conducted using heavy storm cases including a heavy rain in South China and a typhoon caused tropical storm. The results show obvious impact of methane oxidation on the forecasting precipitation. It is demonstrated that the stratospheric water vapor in the tropic is significantly remedied by introducing of parameterization of methane oxidation. And prediction of stratospheric temperature is accordingly modified, especially in the lower stratosphere within 30oN. The verification of monthly mean of forecast anomaly correlation (ACC) and root mean square (RMS) errors over the tropics indicated that the impact of stratospheric methane is neutral as to the forecast of geopotential height, and positive to the forecast of temperature and winds over the tropics.

TI  - A Fully Polarimetric SAR Imagery Classification Scheme for Mud and Sand Flats in Intertidal Zones
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediments on exposed intertidal flats are very dynamic and perform vital ecosystem functions. This paper proposes a new classification scheme for mud and sand flats on intertidal flats using fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Freeman-Durden (FD) and Cloude-Pottier (CP) polarimetric decomposition components as well as double bounce eigenvalue relative difference (DERD) are introduced into the feature sets instead of the original intensity polarimetric channels. Classification is carried out using the random forest (RF) theory, and the results are evaluated using confusion matrices, kappa coefficients, and RF variable importance indices. Three study sites with different environmental conditions are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed classification chain. To further assess the performance of the proposed feature set, we set different feature combinations and process with the same processing chain. Results show that the DERD parameter can detail the sediment mappings on exposed intertidal flats and is a useful SAR feature to distinguish mud and sand flats efficiently. The combined FD and CP components have the ability to describe the polarimetric characteristics of sediments more correctly than the commonly used original intensity channels. Meanwhile, the RF theory shows great potential in distinguishing sediments in intertidal zones accurately and time efficiently.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Change Detection of Ningbo Coastline Using Landsat Time-Series Images during 1976-2015
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ningbo City in Zhejiang Province is one of the largest port cities in China and has achieved high economic development during the past decades. The port construction, land reclamation, urban development and silt deposition in the Ningbo coastal zone have resulted in extensive coastline change. In this study, the spatio-temporal change of the Ningbo coastlines during 1976-2015 was detected and analysed using Landsat time-series images from different sensors, including Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI). Fourteen individual scenes (covering seven phases) of cloud-free Landsat images within the required tidal range of +/- 63 cm were collected. The ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) image of 2015 was used to extract the reference coastline for the accuracy assessment. The normalised difference water index (NDWI) and the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) were applied to discriminate surface water and land features, respectively. The on-screen digitising approach was then used to further refine the extracted time-series coastlines in the period from 1976 to 2015. Six relevant indices, length, length change, annual length change, fractal dimension (FD), average net shoreline movement (NSM) and average annual NSM, were calculated to analyse and explore the spatio-temporal change features of Ningbo coastlines. Results show that the length of the Ningbo coastlines increased from 910 km to 986 km, and the value of FD increased from 1.09 to 1.12, and the coastline morphology changed from sinuous to straight. The average NSM increased from 187 m to 298 m and the average annual NSM reached 85 m/year, indicating the advance of coastlines towards the sea at a high level. The spatio-temporal change patterns also varied in different areas. In Hangzhou Bay, significant advancement along the coastlines was experienced since 2001 mainly because of urban construction and land reclamation. In Xiangshan Bay, the forces of nature played a major role in coastline dynamics before 2008, whilst port construction, urban construction and island link projections moved the coastlines towards the sea. The coastline changes of Sanmen Bay were affected by the interaction of nature and human activities. All these observations indicate that forces of nature and human activities were the two important influential factors for the observed coastline change. In this case, the coastline complexity variation was considered responsible for various coastline patterns change of the Ningbo coast. In addition, erosion and accretion occurred in turn because of forces of nature and human activities, such as urban development and agricultural exploitation.

T2  - Huanjing Huaxue-Environmental Chemistry
M3  - Article
AB  - Total dissolved solids (TDS) of surface water is the total index of concentration of chemical components in surface water, and is an important parameter for the characterization of hydro-geochemical action. TDS directly affects the salinity of surface water. In this study, we chose Ebinur lake watershed as the study area, measured TDS data of the surface water, and analyzed quasi-synchronous Landsat OLI data to select sensitive band. We then used geo-statistics method, multiple linear regression model and SVM model to estimate the TDS of surface water, and compared with field measured TDS. The results show that SVM is the best model for TDS estimation and its coefficient R-2 is 0.97, RMSE is 50.59. The accuracy of multiple linear regression model is very close to the SVM model, and the coefficient R-2 is 0.9, RMSE is 66.55. The accuracy of Geo-statistical kriging interpolation method is the lowest, and coefficient R-2 is 0.87, RMSE is 95.73. The SVM model prediction can better reflect the general characteristics in large area. The estimated results of TDS are in conformity with the actual field TDS data in Ebinur lake. Therefore, the SVM model has a great potential application for water quality prodiction.

TI  - Retrieval of Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> and Total Suspended Solids Using Iterative Stepwise Elimination Partial Least Squares (ISE-PLS) Regression Based on Field Hyperspectral Measurements in Irrigation Ponds in Higashihiroshima, Japan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended solids (TSS) are significant parameters used to assess water quality. The objective of this study is to establish a quantitative model for estimating the Chl-a and the TSS concentrations in irrigation ponds in Higashihiroshima, Japan, using field hyperspectral measurements and statistical analysis. Field experiments were conducted in six ponds and spectral readings for Chl-a and TSS were obtained from six field observations in 2014. For statistical approaches, we used two spectral indices, the ratio spectral index (RSI) and the normalized difference spectral index (NDSI), and a partial least squares (PLS) regression. The predictive abilities were compared using the coefficient of determination (R-2), the root mean squared error of cross validation (RMSECV) and the residual predictive deviation (RPD). Overall, iterative stepwise elimination based on PLS (ISE-PLS), using the first derivative reflectance (FDR), showed the best predictive accuracy, for both Chl-a (R-2 = 0.98, RMSECV = 6.15, RPD = 7.44) and TSS (R-2 = 0.97, RMSECV = 1.91, RPD = 6.64). The important wavebands for estimating Chl-a (16.97% of all wavebands) and TSS (8.38% of all wavebands) were selected by ISE-PLS from all 501 wavebands over the 400-900 nm range. These findings suggest that ISE-PLS based on field hyperspectral measurements can be used to estimate water Chl-a and TSS concentrations in irrigation ponds.

T2  - DU BOIS REVIEW-SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ON RACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing bi/multiracial (1) community in the United States has generated much literature about racial identity and social psychological well-being. Drawing on sixty in-depth interviews with Black/White biracial Americans, this paper shifts the theoretical focus from identity and well-being to the conceptual development of how race shapes bi/multiracial Americans' social interactions with both Whites and Blacks. The majority of participants reported interacting differently when in predominately White settings versus predominately Black settings. I offer the concept of racial capital to highlight the repertoire of racial resources (knowledge, experiences, meaning, and language) that biracial Americans use to negotiate racial boundaries in a highly racialized society. These findings reveal the continuing significance of racial boundaries in a population that is often celebrated as evidence of racial harmony in the United States.

TI  - Comparison and Evaluation of Different MODIS Aerosol Optical Depth Products Over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region in China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many aerosol retrieval algorithms based on the remote sensing technology have been developed and applied to produce aerosol optical depth ( AOD) products for different satellite sensors. The dark target (DT) and deep blue (DB) algorithms are two main MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithms that are suitable for dark or bright areas. The estimation of land surface reflectance (LSR) is necessary to improve the accuracy of AOD retrievals. Therefore, in this paper, a new procedure to improve LSR estimation using MODIS surface reflectance products is developed. A new high-resolution < 1000 m> aerosol retrieval algorithm with a priori LSR database support (HARLS) is proposed. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the spatial adaptability of different MODIS AOD products produced by the above three algorithms. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (Jing-Jin-Ji) region, which features complex surface structures and serious air pollution, was chosen as the study area, and the different AOD products are validated using aerosol robotic network (AERONET) AOD ground measurements from four stations located in dark and bright areas. Comparedwith the DT retrievals (R approximate to 0.88 -0.95), the C6 DB AOD retrievals yield a stronger correlation (R approximate to 0.94 - 0.97) with AERONET AOD and lower RMSE, MRE and MAE values, resulting in approximately 20%-30% less average overestimation. The C6 DT& DBAODresults showa retrieval quality (R approximate to 0.93 - 0.97) similar to that of DB, with approximately 50%-70% of the collections falling within the expected error (EE). Moreover, DT& DB is much better than DT, with more than approximately 10%-20% of the collections falling within the EE. However, HARLS achieves a high correlation (R approximate to 0.93 - 0.96) with the AERONET AODs, with low RMSE (approximate to 0.118 - 0.128) andMAE (approximate to 0.09 - 0.12) and small offsets (intercept approximate to 0.00 -0.04). HARLS retrievals exhibited 7%-8% less uncertainty than the C6 DB retrievals, 37%-38% less uncertainty than the C6 DT& DB retrievals, and 39%-44% less uncertainty than the C5 and C6 DT retrievals. HARLS achieves greater accuracy and reliability in AODretrieval, and it is less biased(RMB approximate to 0.90 -1.10) and better overall than the routine MODIS aerosol products over the Jing-Jin-Ji region.

TI  - Mapping the global depth to bedrock for land surface modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Depth to bedrock serves as the lower boundary of land surface models, which controls hydrologic and biogeochemical processes. This paper presents a framework for global estimation of depth to bedrock (DTB). Observations were extracted from a global compilation of soil profile data (ca. 1,30,000 locations) and borehole data (ca. 1.6 million locations). Additional pseudo-observations generated by expert knowledge were added to fill in large sampling gaps. The model training points were then overlaid on a stack of 155 covariates including DEM-based hydrological and morphological derivatives, lithologic units, MODIS surface reflectance bands and vegetation indices derived from the MODIS land products. Global spatial prediction models were developed using random forest and Gradient Boosting Tree algorithms. The final predictions were generated at the spatial resolution of 250 m as an ensemble prediction of the two independently fitted models. The 10-fold cross-validation shows that the models explain 59% for absolute DTB and 34% for censored DTB (depths deep than 200 cm are predicted as 200 cm). The model for occurrence of R horizon (bedrock) within 200 cm does a good job. Visual comparisons of predictions in the study areas where more detailed maps of depth to bedrock exist show that there is a general match with spatial patterns from similar local studies. Limitation of the data set and extrapolation in data spare areas should not be ignored in applications. To improve accuracy of spatial prediction, more borehole drilling logs will need to be added to supplement the existing training points in under-represented areas.

TI  - Rahui and conservation? Maori voices in the nineteenth century niupepa Maori
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Maori worldview, humans are linked directly to flora and fauna through whakapapa (ancestry). As such, conservation can be expressed, not in terms of preserving otherness', but in terms of sustaining us-ness'our very selfhood, and our relationships and interactions with nature. We investigated the shifting discourse on the use of rhui' (prohibition, restriction) and conservation-related words in nineteenth century New Zealand using material from the early Maori newspapers (niupepa). Our search revealed numerous uses of rhui' but very few uses of kaitiakitanga' (guardianship, stewardship) or conservation in discussion of resources. The discourse included concerns around legislation, land alienation and land loss, that all impact rangatiratanga (authority, autonomy, chieftainship) and the kincentric relationship with nature.

TI  - Towards Global Estimates of the Surface Energy Budget
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - While global observational estimates of energy fluxes in and out of the climate system at the top of atmosphere (TOA) are now available with considerable accuracy from recent satellite programs, similar reference values are more difficult to establish for the surface energy fluxes, which cannot be directly measured from space. This is reflected in greatly diverging global estimates of the surface energy balance components that have been published over the years, or simulated in global climate models. Since the mid-1990s, accurate direct measurements become increasingly available from the networks of surface radiation stations, which allow to better constrain the energy fluxes at the Earth's surface. In parallel, satellite-derived products of surface fluxes profit from the great advancement in space-born observation systems that became operational since the turn of the millennium. As a consequence, recent independent global estimates of the surface radiation components based on surface and satellite data sources have converged to within a few watts per square meter. This suggests that we are approaching a stage where we are not only confident in the magnitudes of the global energy balance components at the TOA but also increasingly so at the surface. These recent estimates may also be able to reconcile formerly disputed inconsistencies between global energy and water cycle estimates. Remaining challenges include the accurate determination of representative surface albedos and skin temperatures in the calculation of surface shortwave absorption and upward longwave emission, respectively, as well as the partitioning of surface net radiation into the nonradiative fluxes of sensible and latent heat.

TI  - Low-level <i>Adelges tsugae</i> infestation detection in New England through partition modeling of Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) (Hemiptera: Adelges tsugae Annand) is an invasive insect causing damage to Eastern (Tsuga canadensis (L) Carr.) and Carolina (Tsuga caroliniana Engelm.) hemlock trees in the eastern United States. Maine and New Hampshire are currently the northernmost front of HWA's range. Developing methods to locate newly infested stands is paramount in the effort to monitor HWA range expansion; presently, the most reliable method of detection requires extensive on-the-ground manual surveying. Field surveys for invasive pests like HWA consume multiple resources, limiting the amount of area that can be surveyed, and the results often misrepresent the true extent or patchiness of an invasion. Satellite based remote sensing, using vegetation indices, enables us to detect insect driven changes in forest health at a landscape scale. Our objectives were to classify HWA infested hemlock stands along the infestation front and demonstrate how the classification product could be used to improve HWA survey planning. Our workflow consisted of 1) modeling hemlock habitat suitability using a Maximum Entropy algorithm; 2) developing decision tree rules to classify likely infested stands from a Landsat time series, using the habitat suitability model to mask out non-hemlock areas; and 3) field check the final classification product.The hemlock habitat suitability model attained an overall accuracy of 68.2%. Partitioning of leaf-on multi-year (1995-2013) Landsat 5 and 8 data resulted in seven probability of infestation classes with a training R-2 = 0.782. Agreement between the classification and previously reported HWA infestations was 75.0% in conifer forests, 33.3% in mixed forests and 50.0% in deciduous forests. Agreement between the classification and test-survey locations was 78.6%; verified new infestations were detected as far as 19 km away from previously reported infestations. The methods presented outline how Landsat could be used to detect low-level HWA infestations. Classification products such as this ultimately could be used by federal and state agencies to target specific areas for efficient survey, suppression, and eradication efforts.

TI  - Reconstruction of coseismic slip from the 2015 Illapel earthquake using combined geodetic and tsunami waveform data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 16 September 2015, a moment magnitude (M-w) 8.3 earthquake struck off the coast of central Chile, generating a large tsunami with nearby coastal wave heights observed on tide gauges in Chile and Peru of up to 4.7m and distal observations of over 40cm in the Kuril Islands across the Pacific Ocean. Through a transcoastal geodetic study, including tsunami time series recorded at open ocean pressure gauges, subaerial deformation observed through interferometric synthetic aperture radar from the Sentinel-1 A satellite and continuous GPS, we identify the location and extent of coseismic slip. We find that most coseismic slip was concentrated in a patch immediately offshore, with little modeled slip near the trench. This result satisfies the tsunami waveforms measured in the deep ocean north of the rupture area, with wave heights up to 10cm. While the event exhibits some features of a slow tsunami earthquake (moderately large tsunami and possible slow second-stage rupture), our inversion results do not require substantial near-trench rupture. However, the prevalence of large and shallow thrust along subduction megathrusts along central Chile raises the question of the likelihood of future such events and the implications for future hazardous tsunamigenic earthquakes.

TI  - Systematic investigation of power line harmonic radiation in near-Earth space above China based on observed satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The environmental impact of power line emission and power line harmonic radiation (PLHR) in near-Earth space has become an increasing concern. In the years 2004-2010, based on the data of microsatellite DEMETER, 133 PLHR events are detected in near-Earth space above China. PLHR has a close correlation with the development of China's electric power network. Its central frequency appears to depend on the latitude. The geographic distribution of the events occurs in clusters. Several events take place continuously above specific regions. PLHR shows no significant dependence on geomagnetic activity. There are more events in daytime than in nighttime and more in winter than in summer. The differences of naturally generated whistlers and power consumption between day and night and the strong thunderstorms in local summer may lead to such diurnal and seasonal differences of PLHR.

TI  - Investigating changes in lake systems in the south-central Tibetan Plateau with multi-source remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes in the Tibetan Plateau are considered sensitive responders to global warming. Variations in physical features of lake systems such as surface area and water level are very helpful in understanding regional responses to global warming in recent decades. In this study, multi-source remote sensing data were used to retrieve the surface area and water level time series of five inland lakes in the south-central part of the Tibetan Plateau over the past decades. Changes in water level and surface area of the lakes were investigated. The results showed that the water level of three lakes (Puma Yumco, Taro Co, Zhari Namco) increased, with expanding surface area, while the water levels of the other two lakes (Paiku Co, Mapam Yumco) fell, with shrinking area. The water levels of the lakes experienced remarkable changes in 2000-2012 as compared with 1976-1999. Spatially, lakes located at the southern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau showed consistency in water level changes, which was different from lakes in the central Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Sero-epidemiologic study of influenza A(H7N9) infection among exposed populations, China 2013-2014
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The first human infections of novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were identified in China in March 2013. Sentinel surveillance systems and contact tracing may not identify mild and asymptomatic human infections of influenza A(H7N9) virus.Objectives: We assessed the seroprevalence of antibodies to influenza A(H7N9) virus in three populations during the early stages of the epidemic.Patients/Methods: From March 2013 to May 2014, we collected sera from the general population, poultry workers, and contacts of confirmed infections in nine Chinese provinces reporting human A(H7N9) infections and, for contacts, second sera 2-3 weeks later. We screened for A(H7N9) antibodies by advanced hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and tested sera with HI titers >= 20 by modified microneutralization (MN) assay. MN titers >= 20 or fourfold increases in paired sera were considered seropositive.Results: Among general population sera (n=1480), none were seropositive. Among poultry worker sera (n=1866), 28 had HI titers >= 20; two (0.11%, 95% CI:0.02-0.44) were positive by MN. Among 61 healthcare and 117 non-healthcare contacts' sera, five had HI titers >= 20, and all were negative by MN. There was no seroconversion among 131 paired sera.Conclusions: There was no evidence of widespread transmission of influenza A(H7N9) virus during March 2013 to May 2014, although A(H7N9) may have caused rare, previously unrecognized infections among poultry workers. Although the findings suggest that there were few undetected cases of influenza A(H7N9) early in the epidemic, it is important to continue monitoring transmission as virus and epidemic evolve.

TI  - Impact of scalp location on survival in head and neck melanoma: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Scalp melanomas have more aggressive clinicopathological features than other melanomas and mortality rates more than twice that of melanoma located elsewhere.Objective: We sought to describe the survival of patients with scalp melanoma versus other cutaneous head and neck melanoma (CHNM), and explore a possible independent negative impact of scalp location on CHNM survival.Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed of all invasive primary CHNM cases seen at a tertiary referral center over a 20-year period. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was compared between scalp melanoma and other invasive CHNM. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to determine associations with survival.Results: On univariate analysis, patients with scalp melanoma had worse MSS than other CHNM (hazard ratio 2.22, 95% confidence interval 1.59-3.11). Scalp location was not associated with MSS in CHNM on multivariable analysis (hazard ratio 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.77-1.61) for all tumors together, but remained independently associated with MSS for the 0.76-to 1.50-mm thickness stratum (hazard ratio 5.51, 95% confidence interval 1.55-19.59).Limitations: Disease recurrence was not assessed because of unavailable data.Conclusion: The poorer survival of scalp melanoma is largely explained by greater Breslow thickness and a higher proportion of male patients.

TI  - Modeling gross primary production of paddy rice cropland through analyses of data from CO<sub>2</sub> eddy flux tower sites and MODIS images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on the gross primary production (GPP) of paddy rice cropland is critical for assessing and monitoring rice growing conditions. The eddy co-variance technique was used to measure net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 between paddy rice croplands and the atmosphere, and the resultant NEE data then partitioned into GPP (GPP(Ec)) and ecosystem respiration. In this study, we first used the GPP(Ec) data from four paddy rice flux tower sites in South Korea, Japan and the USA to evaluate the biophysical performance of three vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) in terms of phenology (crop growing seasons) and GPP(Ec), which are derived from images taken by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. We also ran the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), which is driven by EVI, LSWI, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and air temperature, to estimate GPP over multiple years at these four sites (GPP(VPM)). The 14 site-years of simulations show that the seasonal dynamics of GPP(VPM) successfully tracked the seasonal dynamics of GPPEc (R-2 > 0.88 or higher). The cross-site comparison also shows that GPP(VPM) agreed reasonably well with the variations of GPP(Ec) across both years and sites. The simulation results clearly demonstrate the potential of the VPM model and MODIS images for estimating GPP of paddy rice croplands in the monsoon climates of South Korea and Japan and the Mediterranean climate in California, USA. The application of VPM to regional simulations in the near future may provide crucial GPP data to support the studies of food security and cropland carbon cycle around the world.

TI  - Outgoing longwave radiation anomalies analysis associated with different types of seismic activity
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper has developed and proposed a statistical analysis method based on the Robust Satellite data analysis technique to detect seismic anomalies within the NOAA OLR dataset based on spatial/temporal continuity analysis. The proposed methods has been applied to statistical analyze about 3376 earthquake cases from September 01, 2007 to May 23, 2015. For statistical purposes, all these events have been divided into different types on the basis of the seismic parameters, including Southern or Northern Hemisphere earthquakes, earthquakes at different magnitude levels, earthquakes at different depth levels. The results show that the intensity of the anomalies increased with the magnitude increasing; anomalies are more easily observed during shallow earthquakes than the deep ones; more obvious anomalies could be detected for the earthquakes occurring in the Northern Hemisphere and the anomalies significant increases near the epicenter one day before and on the day of the earthquake. A similar anomaly shows that there are anomalies near the epicenters before earthquakes and the anomalies have some relation with the earthquake preparation on all seismic activity. All these statistical results can help create a better understanding of the preparation process of the earthquakes. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimising Phenological Metrics Extraction for Different Crop Types in Germany Using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological metrics extracted from satellite data (phenometrics) have been increasingly used to access timely, spatially explicit information on crop phenology, but have rarely been calibrated and validated with field observations. In this study, we developed a calibration procedure to make phenometrics more comparable to ground-based phenological stages by optimising the settings of Best Index Slope Extraction (BISE) and smoothing algorithms together with thresholds. We used a six-year daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and 211 ground-observation records from four major crop species (winter wheat/barley, oilseed rape, and sugar beet) in central Germany. Results showed the superiority of the Savitzky-Golay algorithm in combination with BISE. The satellite-derived senescence dates matched ripeness stages of winter crops and the dates with maximum NDVI were closely related to the field-observed heading stage of winter cereals. We showed that the emergence of winter crops corresponded to the dates extracted with a threshold of 0.1, which translated into 8.89 days of root-mean-square error (RMSE) improvement compared to the standard threshold of 0.5. The method with optimised settings and thresholds can be easily transferred and applied to areas with similar growing conditions. Altogether, the results improve our understanding of how satellite-derived phenometrics can explain in situ phenological observations.

TI  - The Dynamic Change of Vegetation Cover and Associated Driving Forces in Nanxiong Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural climate change and human activities are the main driving forces associated with vegetation coverage change. Nanxiong Basin is a key ecosystem-service area at the national level with a dense population and highly representative of red-bed basins, which are considered as fragile ecological units in humid regions. In this study, the authors aimed to determine the trends in vegetation cover change over past two decades and the associated driving forces in this study area. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of 2000-2015, derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing dataset along with the application of statistical methods and GIS (geographic information system) techniques were used to quantify vegetation cover change. The results show that human-induced factors can explain most variations at sites with significant cover change. That is to say that human activities are the main drivers of vegetation dynamics in this study area, which shows a significant reduction trend in vegetation cover during the industrialization and urbanization processes of the study period and noticeable recovery trend in 2000-2015 under the plantation and enclosed forest policy.

TI  - Deforestation and Carbon Stock Loss in Brazil's Amazonian Settlements
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate deforestation and the carbon stock in 2740 (82 %) of the 3325 settlements in Brazil's Legal Amazonia region. Estimates are made both using available satellite data and a carbon map for the "pre-modern" period (prior to 1970). We used data from Brazil's Project for Monitoring Deforestation in Amazonia updated through 2013 and from the Brazilian Biomes Deforestation Monitoring Project (PMDBBS) updated through 2010. To obtain the pre-modern and recent carbon stocks we performed an intersection between a carbon map and a map derived from settlement boundaries and deforestation data. Although the settlements analyzed occupied only 8 % of Legal Amazonia, our results indicate that these settlements contributed 17 % (160,410 km(2)) of total clearing (forest + non-forest) in Legal Amazonia (967,003 km(2)). This represents a clear-cutting of 41 % of the original vegetation in the settlements. Out of this total, 72 % (115,634 km(2)) was in the "Federal Settlement Project" (PA) category. Deforestation in settlements represents 20 % (2.6 Pg C) of the total carbon loss in Legal Amazonia (13.1 Pg C). The carbon stock in remaining vegetation represents 3.8 Pg C, or 6 % of the total remaining carbon stock in Legal Amazonia (58.6 Pg C) in the periods analyzed. The carbon reductions in settlements are caused both by the settlers and by external actors. Our findings suggest that agrarian reform policies contributed directly to carbon loss. Thus, the implementation of new settlements should consider potential carbon stock losses, especially if settlements are created in areas with high carbon stocks.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of GF-4 in Multispectral Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The GaoFen-4 (GF-4), launched at the end of December 2015, is China's first high-resolution geostationary optical satellite. A panchromatic and multispectral sensor (PMS) is onboard the GF-4 satellite. Unfortunately, the GF-4 has no onboard calibration assembly, so on-orbit radiometric calibration is required. Like the charge-coupled device (CCD) onboard HuanJing-1 (HJ) or the wide field of view sensor (WFV) onboard GaoFen-1 (GF-1), GF-4 also has a wide field of view, which provides challenges for cross-calibration with narrow field of view sensors, like the Landsat series. A new technique has been developed and used to calibrate HJ-1/CCD and GF-1/WFV, which is verified viable. The technique has three key steps: (1) calculate the surface using the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) characterization of a site, taking advantage of its uniform surface material and natural topographic variation using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery and digital elevation model (DEM) products; (2) calculate the radiance at the top-of-the atmosphere (TOA) with the simulated surface reflectance using the atmosphere radiant transfer model; and (3) fit the calibration coefficients with the TOA radiance and corresponding Digital Number (DN) values of the image. This study attempts to demonstrate the technique is also feasible to calibrate GF-4 multispectral bands. After fitting the calibration coefficients using the technique, extensive validation is conducted by cross-validation using the image pairs of GF-4/PMS and Landsat-8/OLI with similar transit times and close view zenith. The validation result indicates a higher accuracy and frequency than that given by the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (CRESDA) using vicarious calibration. The study shows that the new technique is also quite feasible for GF-4 multispectral bands as a routine long-term procedure.

TI  - Landsat-Based Land Cover Change in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Urban Agglomeration in 1990, 2000 and 2010
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization dramatically changes the local environment. A hybrid classification method is designed and applied to multi-temporal Landsat images and ancillary data to obtain land cover change datasets. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used to classify multi-temporal Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images that were collected in 2000 at the pixel level. These images are also segmented with the mean shift method. The impervious surface is refined based on a combination of the segmented objects and the SVM classification results. The changed areas in 1990 and 2010 are determined by comparing the Thematic Mapper (TM) and ETM+ images via the re-weighted multivariate alteration detection transformation method. The TM images that were masked as changed areas in 1990 and 2000 are input into the SVM classifier. Land cover maps for 1990 and 2010 are produced by combining the unchanged area in 2000 with the new classes of the changed areas in 1990 and 2010. Land cover change has continuously accelerated since 1990. Remarkably, arable land decreased, while the impervious surface area significantly increased.

TI  - Multiscale Integration Approach for Land Cover Classification Based on Minimal Entropy of Posterior Probability
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based land covermapping has drawn increasing attention for its ability to overcome the salt-and-pepper problem associated with pixel-based methods by considering spatial information from neighboring regions. However, the performance of object-based classification is strongly affected by over-or undersegmented objects. The optimal scale is difficult to determine; moreover, it usually varies along with the application purpose or classification targets. Most previous efforts on scale determination based only on image information are not flexible in adapting to different classification systems; consequently, their use is not advisable. In this paper, to better consider classification targets, the information from training samples for classification is also used for determining the optimal scale based on the concept of minimal entropy of posterior probability (MEPP). The proposed MEPP method consists mainly of two stages: 1) training samples from the original pixel level are applied to classify segmented images and obtain posterior probability maps on multiple scales; and 2) the optimal object scale is determined according to the MEPP that corresponds to the minimum classification uncertainty. Experiments on high-spatial-resolution images and Landsat images confirm the superiority of the proposed MEPP method in land cover classification.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been reported that global warming has negative effects on coral ecosystems in the past 50 years and the effects vary in different ocean environment. In order to make clear the coral reef status in the background of global warming along the south coast of Hainan Island of China, satellite and in situ data are used to retrieve the information of the coral reef status and surrounding environmental factors. The results show that cool water induced by upwelling along the south coast of Hainan Island is found in the area every summer month, especially in the relatively strong El Nio years (2002-2003 and 2005). From the NOAA satellite data, degree heating week (DHW) index does not exceed 3 in Sanya Bay even in the relatively strong El Nio years. By comparison of a coral reef growth rate in the Sanya Bay with respect to El Nio events from 1957 to 2000, coral's growth rate is relatively greater during 1972, 1991-1994 and 1998 El Nio event. By analyzing the environmental factors, it is found that the cool water induced by upwelling may be the main reason for protecting corals from global warming effects.

TI  - Improved Aerosol Optical Thickness, Columnar Water Vapor, and Surface Reflectance Retrieval from Combined CASI and SASI Airborne Hyperspectral Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An increasingly common requirement in remote sensing is the integration of hyperspectral data collected simultaneously from different sensors (and fore-optics) operating across different wavelength ranges. Data from one module are often relied on to correct information in the other, such as aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and columnar water vapor (CWV). This paper describes problems associated with this process and recommends an improved strategy for processing remote sensing data, collected from both visible to near-infrared and shortwave infrared modules, to retrieve accurate AOT, CWV, and surface reflectance values. This strategy includes a workflow for radiometric and spatial cross-calibration and a method to retrieve atmospheric parameters and surface reflectance based on a radiative transfer function. This method was tested using data collected with the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and SWIR Airborne Spectrographic Imager (SASI) from a site in Huailai County, Hebei Province, China. Various methods for retrieving AOT and CWV specific to this region were assessed. The results showed that retrieving AOT from the remote sensing data required establishing empirical relationships between 465.6 nm/659 nm and 2105 nm, augmented by ground-based reflectance validation data, and minimizing the merit function based on AOT@550 nm optimization. The paper also extends the second-order difference algorithm (SODA) method using Powell's methods to optimize CWV retrieval. The resulting CWV image has fewer residual surface features compared with the standard methods. The derived remote sensing surface reflectance correlated significantly with the ground spectra of comparable vegetation, cement road and soil targets. Therefore, the method proposed in this paper is reliable enough for integrated atmospheric correction and surface reflectance retrieval from hyperspectral remote sensing data. This study provides a good reference for surface reflectance inversion that lacks synchronized atmospheric parameters.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of urbanization-associated green space on urban land surface temperature: A case study of Dalian, China
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking Dalian City as the study area, the spatial distribution of urban green space and land surface temperature (LST), as well as their evolution in 1999, 2007 and 2013, were obtained through remote sensing (RS) interpretation and inversion. Landsat ETM and SPOT data were used for this purpose. By combining the temperature and vegetation index models (TVX), the effects of urban green space reduction on the thermal environment during city development were evaluated. The results show the following. (1) During 1999-2013, 88.1 km(2) of urban green space was converted to other land uses, accounting for a 29.4% reduction in urban green space in the study area. (2) During the study period, the LST in this area increased by +8.455 K. The evolution of the regional thermal landscape can be characterized by increases in the LST, greater complexity of the thermal landscape structure, increase and aggregation of high-temperature areas, and reduction and fragmentation of low-temperature areas. (3) During the process of urbanization, urban green space with low land-surface temperature was converted to other land use types with high land-surface temperature. When development occurred at the price of urban green space, negative effects on the regional thermal environment were observed. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

TI  - Automated High-Resolution Satellite Image Registration Using Supraglacial Rivers on the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution satellite imagery raises new prospects for detailed study of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) surface processes and ice discharge. However, dramatic spatiotemporal variability of ice surface reflectance and features poses significant challenges for registration of satellite imagery. This study proposes a new feature-based registration method to register high-resolution panchromatic images of the ice sheet ablation zone. Its idea is to use relatively stable supraglacial rivers as tie points for automated image registration. A first demonstration is made using WorldView-1/2/3 panchromatic images (spatial resolution 0.5 m) as follows: first, supraglacial rivers are delineated using spectral analysis, nonlocal means denoising, Gabor filtering, and path opening. Next, buffer and overlay tools are combined to generate an area of interest and eliminate tie point outliers, yielding subset of high-confidence tie points for registration. Finally, a coherent point drift algorithm is applied to match these tie points and implement registration. Results show that the proposed method demonstrates good performance, despite a heterogeneous ice surface background that complicates river delineation. Accuracy of image registration negatively correlates with seasonal spatiotemporal variability of supraglacial river patterns, suggesting that for the best results, repeat images and time-adaptive techniques should be used. For time-stable meltwater channels, however, the method offers a novel, automated way to register high-resolution satellite imagery of the GrIS ablation zone. Well-registered ice surface high-resolution images reveal that short-term (1-2 week) variations in surface melting rate affect channel morphology (drainage densities and channel widths) significantly, whereas a signal from background advection by flowing ice is not apparent.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Monitoring of Vegetation Recovery After the Wenchuan Earthquake
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous vegetation recovery after major earthquakes has important implications for preventing postseismic soil erosion and geo-hazards. However, regional recovery processes of the postseismic vegetation and its spatial patterns have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we examined the vegetation recovery processes following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Ms. 7.8) using 16-day intervalMODIS normalized difference vegetation index time series from 2000 to 2014. The Savitzky-Golay filter and cross-correlogram spectral matching were used to eliminate the influences of cloud and intraannual phenology. Change vector analysis was applied to measure the postseismic vegetation recovery conditions for each year. We find that the heavily affected vegetation areas are mainly located along the southern part of the earthquake surface rupture. Additionally, five major affected vegetation types have been identified: shrubland, grassland, broadleaf/mixed, needleleaf, and plantation. Shrubland represents the largest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area, whereas plantation comprises the smallest fraction of vegetation type in the heavily affected area. Further analysis indicates that the changing trend of postseismic vegetation conditions in the first six years can be grouped into three classes: recovering, fluctuating, and deteriorating. Recovering and fluctuating classes cover 59% and 37% of the heavily affected areas, respectively, and are the two dominant postseismic vegetation classes. In contrast, the deteriorating recovery class covers just 4% of the affected areas. The recovering vegetation is primarily located around the epicenter, and most of the fluctuating classes is located to the northeast of the epicenter. These results demonstrate that the Wenchuan earthquake has long-term and important influences on mountain vegetation, andmore attention should be given to the locations of deteriorating and fluctuating vegetation following mountain disasters.

TI  - Nontyphoidal <i>Salmonella</i> Gastroenteritis in Baoshan, Shanghai, China, 2010 to 2014: An Etiological Surveillance and Case-Control Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) gastroenteritis is a widespread global foodborne disease. To identify the epidemiologic characteristics, sources of food contamination, and risk factors of NTS gastroenteritis, epidemiologic data and stool specimens of diarrheal patients were collected from sentinel hospitals in Baoshan, Shanghai, People's Republic of China, between 2010 and 2014. Food products from nearby farmers' markets and animal feces from live poultry markets and livestock farms were sampled to identify the pathogen; a case-control study was conducted to characterize risk factors of NTS gastroenteritis. Of 3,906 diarrheal patients examined, 266 (6.8%) were positive for Salmonella. The positive rates were higher in summer than in the other seasons. Salmonella Typhimurium (36.1%) and Salmonella Enteritidis (30.8%) were the dominant serovars in the patients. Salmonella was detected in 26.2% pork samples, 7.1 to 7.8% poultry meats, and 3.3 to 8.9% poultry feces. Salmonella Typhimurium was the major serovar in contaminated food and animal feces. Multivariate conditional logistic regression analysis indicated that consumption of pork and quickly cooked eggs increased, whereas separating kitchen knives for cooked and raw food decreased the risk of NTS gastroenteritis, independently. We believe that NTS in poultry feces contaminated the meat products in the same markets and then infected humans if these foods were not sufficiently cooked. To prevent NTS gastroenteritis, it is necessary to survey Salmonella in meats and poultry feces, to cook eggs and pork sufficiently, to separate kitchen knives for cooked and raw food, and to prohibit live poultry trade in fresh meat markets.

TI  - Accuracy assessment of seven global land cover datasets over China
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover (LC) is the vital foundation to Earth science. Up to now, several global LC datasets have arisen with efforts of many scientific communities. To provide guidelines for data usage over China, nine LC maps from seven global LC datasets (IGBP DISCover, UMD, GLC, MCD12Q1, GLCNMO, CCI-LC, and GlobeLand30) were evaluated in this study. First, we compared their similarities and discrepancies in both area and spatial patterns, and analysed their inherent relations to data sources and classification schemes and methods. Next, five sets of validation sample units (VSUs) were collected to calculate their accuracy quantitatively. Further, we built a spatial analysis model and depicted their spatial variation in accuracy based on the five sets of VSUs. The results show that, there are evident discrepancies among these LC maps in both area and spatial patterns. For LC maps produced by different institutes, GLC 2000 and CCI-LC 2000 have the highest overall spatial agreement (53.8%). For LC maps produced by same institutes, overall spatial agreement of CCI-LC 2000 and 2010, and MCD12Q1 2001 and 2010 reach up to 99.8% and 73.2%, respectively; while more efforts are still needed if we hope to use these LC maps as time series data for model inputting, since both CCI-LC and MCD12Q1 fail to represent the rapid changing trend of several key LC classes in the early 21st century, in particular urban and built-up, snow and ice, water bodies, and permanent wetlands. With the highest spatial resolution, the overall accuracy of GlobeLand30 2010 is 82.39%. For the other six LC datasets with coarse resolution, CCI-LC 2010/2000 has the highest overall accuracy, and following are MCD12Q1 2010/2001, GLC 2000, GLCNMO 2008, IGBP DISCover, and UMD in turn. Beside that all maps exhibit high accuracy in homogeneous regions; local accuracies in other regions are quite different, particularly in Farming-Pastoral Zone of North China, mountains in Northeast China, and Southeast Hills. Special attention should be paid for data users who are interested in these regions. (C) 2017 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Change Detection in Multispectral Landsat Images Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we propose a novel method for unsupervised change detection in multitemporal multispectral Landsat images using multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA). The proposed method minimizes two different objective functions using MOEA to provide tradeoff between each other. The objective functions are used for evaluating changed and unchanged regions of the difference image separately. The difference image is obtained by using the structural similarity index measure method, which provides combination of the comparisons of luminance, contrast, and structure between two images. By evolving a population of solutions in the MOEA, a set of Pareto optimal solution is estimated in a single run. To find the best solution, a Markov random field fusion approach is used. Experiments on semisynthetic and real-world data sets show the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimation using Landsat-8 data with a two-layer framework
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in hydrological cycle by linking land surface and atmosphere through water and energy transfers. Based on the data from the Landsat-8 satellite for typical days with clear sky condition from 2013 to 2016, a two-layer daily ET remote sensing framework was built, which includes four compartments: surface feature parameter estimation, evaporative fraction estimation, daily net radiation estimation, and daily ET extension. Based on the model, evaporation, transpiration, and daily ET in Shahe River Basin were estimated. The estimated daily ET showed a mean absolute percentage error of 8.7% in the plain areas, and 12.1% in the mountainous areas, compared to observations using large aperture scintillometer and eddy covariance system. The method gave higher accuracy than other remote sensing models applied in the same area previously, including the surface energy balance system and the ETWatch. By analyzing the relationship between land use types and surface water/heat fluxes, it was found that the surface energy balance components in the basin have prominent spatial-temporal features, and the soil component's features are more obvious. It indicated that the proposed two-layer approach is superior to others in terms of simulation accuracy, and applicable to daily scale ET estimations on complex terrains.

TI  - A new technique for landslide mapping from a large-scale remote sensed image: A case study of Central Nepal
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new technique for landslide mapping from large-scale Landsat8 images. The method introduces saliency enhancement to enhance the landslide regions, making the landslides salient objects in the image. Morphological operations are applied to the enhanced image to remove most background objects. Afterwards, digital elevation model is applied to further remove the ground objects of plain areas according to the height of landscape, since most landslides occur in mountainous areas. Final landslides are extracted by the proposal regions from selective search. The study area covers 2 degrees x2 degrees, making it more similar with practical cases, such as emergency response and landslide inventory mappings. The proposed method performs satisfactorily by detecting 99.1% of the landslides in the image, and obtains an overall accuracy of 99.8% in the landslides/background classification problem, which gets further validated in another Landsat8 image of a different site. The experiment shows that the proposed method is feasible for landslide detection from large-scale area, which may contribute to the further landslide-related research.

TI  - A Study on Optimal Strategy in Relative Radiometric Calibration for Optical Sensors
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the analysis of three main factors involved in the relative radiometric calibration for optical sensors, namely: the number of radiance level; the number of measurements at each level; and the radiance level grouping method, an optimal strategy is presented in this paper for relative radiometric calibration. First, the maximization to the possible extent of either the number of the radiance level or the number of measurements at each level can improve the precision of the calibration results, where the recommended number of measurements is no less than 20. Second, when the number of the radiance level is divisible by four, dividing all the levels evenly into four groups by intensity gradient order and conducting averages for each group could achieve calibration results with the highest precision, which is higher than the result of no grouping or any other grouping method with the mean square error being 2 root 2M(n)/root IT (where M-n is the number of measurements for each level. In this case, the first two factors had an equivalent effect and showed their strongest effect on the precision. Third, when the calibration data were not evenly divided, the number of measurements demonstrated a stronger effect than the number of the radiance level. These cognitions are helping to achieve more precise relative radiometric calibration of optical sensors.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Remotely Sensed Data for Degradation Dynamics in Linxia Rangeland, Northwest China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of accurately monitoring rangeland degradation dynamics over decades is increasing in Linxia rangeland, the birthplace of the Yellow River in China. Since 2000, the Chinese government has implemented the Grain for Green program and enforced a grazing ban in Gansu province, one of the most degraded provinces, to mitigate the problem of rangeland degradation. The effects of these policies are controversial and have become a topic of public concern. In this study, a grading system was established for the estimation of Linxia rangeland degradation. Degrees of rangeland degradation were interpreted and the spatio-temporal dynamics of the degraded rangeland through several study periods were mapped and monitored using the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis method on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) images for the years of 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011. The results demonstrated that the time around the year 2001 appeared to be a turning point of the rangeland degradation reversion course, as the rangeland degradation reversed significantly since 2001. From 1996 to 2001, the total degraded area in Linxia rangeland increased from 2922.01 km(2) to 3048.48 km(2) (+4.33%), and decreased by 4.54% to 2909.97 km(2) in 2011; the non-degraded rangeland gradually increased from 602.74 km(2) to 710.01 km(2), an increase of 17.80%. Degraded rangeland vegetation was restored significantly during 2001-2011: the area of slightly degraded rangeland increased by 3.71% and 3.83% annually during 2001-2006 and 2006-2011 intervals, respectively, and the area of moderately and severely degraded rangeland decreased annually by 4.77% and 2.41% from 2001 to 2006, and 4.58% and 0.81% during 2006-2011, respectively. These results indicated that the Grain for Green program and grazing ban policy, together with other ecological impacting factors, helped reverse the rangeland degradation and promote the rehabilitation of rangeland vegetation.

TI  - Reexamination and further development of two-stream canopy radiative transfer models for global land modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Four representative two-stream canopy radiative transfer models were examined and intercompared using the same configuration. Based on the comparison results, two modifications were introduced to the widely used Dickinson-Sellers model and then incorporated into the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). The modified model was tested against Monte-Carlo simulations and produced significant improvements in the simulated canopy transmittance and albedo values. In direct comparison with MODIS albedo data, the modified model shows good performance over most snow/ice-free vegetated areas, especially for regions that are covered by dense canopy. The modified model shows seasonally dependent behavior mainly in the near-infrared band. Thus, the improvements are not present in all seasons. Large biases are still noticeable in sparsely vegetated areas, in particular for the snow/ice covered regions, that is possibly related to the model, the land surface input data, or even the observations themselves. Further studies focusing on the impact of the seasonal changes in leaf optical properties, the parameterizations for snow/ice covered regions and the case of sparsely vegetated areas, are recommended.

TI  - Mapping and discriminating the Pan-African granitoids in the Hoggar (southern Algeria) using Landsat 7 ETM+ data and airborne geophysics
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a multidisciplinary approach to discriminate and map different types and generations of Pan-African granitoids in the Hoggar, southern Algeria, using remote sensing and airborne geophysics in close correlation with previous works and established geological maps. RGB (Red, Green, Blue) combinations of band ratios; principal component analysis (PCA) and image classification for Landsat 7 ETM+ (Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus), allow spatial discrimination and mapping of granitoid rocks of the studied area (200*350 km). This area extend over four contrasted Pan-African terranes (In Tedeini, Iskel, Tefedest and Laouni terranes, the two latter belong to the LATEA (Laouni-Azrou-n-FadTefedest-Egere-Aleksod-Assode-Issalane) metacraton. The airborne magnetic intensity provides a wide range of responses from high values (youngest granitoids) to low values (volcano-sedimentary and gneissic country-rocks). Radiometric data, displaying radioelements concentration, discriminate efficiently the late alkaline granitoids (high values), the calk-alkaline granitoids (intermediate values) and the Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite series (low values). This study led to the establishment of a more accurate geological map where the geochemical characteristics of the Pan-African granitoids are determined, including plutons not yet studied, especially in the poorly known In Tedeini terrane, and brings new constraints for the geodynamic development of the Tuareg Shield, which includes the Hoggar.

TI  - Understanding Land Use and Land Cover Dynamics from 1976 to 2014 in Yellow River Delta
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term intensive land use/cover changes (LUCCs) of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) have been happening since the 1960s. The land use patterns of the LUCCs are crucial for bio-diversity conservation and/or sustainable development. This study quantified patterns of the LUCCs, explored the systematic transitions, and identified wetland change trajectory for the period 1976-2014 in the YRD. Landsat imageries of 1976, 1984, 1995, 2006, and 2014 were used to derive nine land use classes. Post classification change detection analysis based on enhanced transition matrix was applied to identify land use dynamics and trajectory of wetland change. The five cartographic outputs for changes in land use underlined major decreases in natural wetland areas and increases in artificial wetland and non-wetland, especially aquafarms, salt pans and construction lands. The systematic transitions in the YRD were wetland degradation, wetland artificialization, and urbanization. Wetland change trajectory results demonstrated that the main wetland changes were wetland degradation and wetland artificialization. Coastline change is the subordinate reason for natural wetland degradation in comparison with human activities. The results of this study allowed for an improvement in the understanding of the LUCC processes and enabled researchers and planners to focus on the most important signals of systematic landscape transitions while also allowing for a better understanding of the proximate causes of changes.

TI  - Compact Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar for Marine Oil Platform and Slick Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact polarimetric (CP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide ocean surface observations with large-coverage swath and abundant polarimetric scattering information. These distinctive characteristics make CP SAR a potential tool for operational monitoring oil slicks and oil platforms, overcoming the shortcomings of small spatial coverage by the traditional quad-polarization (quad-pol) SAR. In this paper, we use the RADARSAT-2 C-band quad-pol SAR data to generate CP covariance matrix elements and subsequently construct pseudoquad-pol backscatter coefficients, using two CP reconstruction algorithms to evaluate CP SAR's applications in detection of oil slicks and oil platforms. The reconstructed co-and cross-polarization data show good agreement with original radar observations acquired at different incidence angles and wind speeds. Furthermore, we develop an unsupervised classification method using the relative phase, a logical scalar threshold that separates odd and multiple scattering events, as an indicator to discriminate oil slicks and platforms from clean ocean waters. The relative phase is positive for clean ocean surfaces where odd scattering is dominant, but negative for oil platforms and oil slick-covered areas associated with multiple scattering. The detections of oil spills and oil platforms are validated against known oil platform geographic positions and optical aircraft surveys of the oil slicks. The proposed method provides a promising technique to detect oil slicks and oil platforms from CP imaging mode SAR data, i. e., as may be acquired by the RISAT-1, ALOS-2, and the future RADARSAT Constellation Mission.

TI  - A Hurricane Morphology and Sea Surface Wind Vector Estimation Model Based on C-Band Cross-Polarization SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decades, data from spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) have been used in hurricane research. However, some issues remain. When wind is at hurricane strength, the wind speed retrievals from single-polarization SAR may have errors, because the backscatter signal may experience saturation and become double valued. By comparison, wind direction retrievals from cross-polarization SAR are not possible until now. In this paper, we develop a 2-D model, the symmetric hurricane estimates for wind (SHEW) model, and combine it with the modified inflow angle model to detect hurricane morphology and estimate the wind vector field imaged by cross-polarization SAR. By fitting SHEW to the SAR derived hurricane wind speed, we find the initial closest ellipticalsymmetrical wind speed fields, hurricane center location, major and minor axes, the azimuthal (orientation) angle relative to the reference ellipse, and maximum wind speed. This set of hurricane morphology parameters, along with the speed of hurricane motion, are input to the inflow angle model, modified with an ellipse-shaped eye, to derive the hurricane wind direction. A total of 14 RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR images are employed to tune the combined model. Two SAR images acquired over Hurricane Arthur (2014) and Hurricane Earl (2010) are used to validate this model. Comparisons between the modeled surface wind vector and measurements from airborne stepped-frequency microwave radiometer and dropwindsondes show excellent agreement. The proposed method works well in areas with significant radar attenuation by precipitation.

TI  - Studying drought phenomena in the Continental United States in 2011 and 2012 using various drought indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous drought indices have been developed to monitor drought conditions. However, different drought indices have differing characteristics, and are suitable for specific environments. The aim of this study was to compare the occurrence of drought, as detected by remote sensing across the Continental United States (CONUS). We used drought events during 2011 and 2012 to compare various indices developed for the study of drought phenomena. Three in situ drought indices, the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), Z-index and standardized precipitation indices (SPI) with different time scales were used to evaluate drought conditions in different climate divisions. The drought indices compared in this study include the vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), the perpendicular drought index (PDI) and modified PDI (MPDI) derived from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the precipitation condition index (PCI) derived from tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data, and the soil moisture condition index (SMCI) derived from advanced microwave scanning radiometer - earth observing system (AMSR-E). Other synthesized drought indices, which combine indices such as VCI, TCI, SMCI and PCI, were also compared in this study. These included the vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), scaled drought condition index (SDCI), the microwave integrated drought index (MIDI), the synthesized drought index (SDI), the optimized meteorological drought index (OMDI), and the optimized vegetation drought index (OVDI). The results include a wide variety of drought conditions based on different drought indices. Meteorological drought indices indicated that more regions were under severe drought than agricultural drought indices did. Drought indices appear to be more similar to standard drought indices than PDI, MPDI and TVDI. The results also indicate that different indices have strengths and weaknesses in different climates across CONUS. SMCI has a good correlation with short-term SPI, and the sensitivity of SMCI is strongly dependent on terrain, as it performs worse in regions with heavy tree cover than in regions with a low density of vegetation. TCI, VCI, PDI and MPDI are more similar to 3-month SPI data, but correlate weakly with station-based indices located in areas of high precipitation, higher soil permeability, large-scale agriculture and forests. PCI is more strongly correlated with short-term drought conditions in almost all climate divisions than other single indices. VCI would be more reliable if there were only red and NIR surface reflectance bands available, while VHI would be a better choice if only NDVI and LST data were available. Condition index-based drought indices (PCI, TCI, VCI, SMCI, VHI, SDCI, SDCI, MIDI, OVDI, OMDI) performed better than other categories of drought indices, and the use of time series analysis may be a contributing factor to this difference in performance.

TI  - Exploration of scaling effects on coarse resolution land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous land surface phenology (LSP) datasets have been produced from various coarse resolution satellite data and different detection algorithms from regional to global scales. In contrast to field-observed phonological events that are defined by clearly evident organismal changes with biophysical meaning, current approaches to detecting transitions in LSP only determine the timing of variations in remotely sensed observations of surface greenness. Since activities to bridge LSP and field observations are challenging and limited, our understanding of the biophysical characteristics of LSP transitions is poor. Therefore, we set out to explore the scaling effects on LSP transitions at the nominal start of growing season (SOS) by comparing detections from coarse resolution data with those from finer resolution imagery. Specifically, using a hybrid piecewise-logistic-model-based LSP detection algorithm, we detected SOS in the agricultural core of the United States central Iowa at two scales: first, at a finer scale (30 m) using reflectance generated by fusing MODIS data with Landsat 8 OLI data (OLI SOS) and, second, at a coarser resolution of 500 m using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations. The VIIRS SOS data were compared with OLI SOS that had been aggregated using a percentile approach at various degrees of heterogeneity. The results revealed the complexities of SOS detections and the scaling effects that are latent at the coarser resolution. Specifically, OLI SOS variation defined using standard deviation (SD) was as large as 40 days within a highly spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel; whereas, SD could be <10 days for a more homogeneous set of pixels. Furthermore, the VIIRS SOS detections equaled the OLI SOS (with an absolute difference less than one day) in >60% of OLI pixels within a homogeneous VIIRS pixel, but in <20% of OLI pixels within a spatially heterogeneous VIIRS pixel. Moreover, the SOS detections in a coarser resolution pixel reflected the timing at which vegetation greenup onset occurred in 30% of area, despite variation in SOS heterogeneities. This result suggests that (1) the SOS detections at coarser resolution are controlled more by the earlier SOS pixels at the finer resolution rather than by the later SOS pixels, and (2) it should be possible to well simulate the coarser SOS value by selecting the timing at 30th percentile SOS at the finer resolution. Finally, it was demonstrated that in homogeneous areas the VIIRS SOS was comparable with OLI SOS with an overall difference of <5 days. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Methods for automatic identification and extraction of terraces from high spatial resolution satellite data (China-GF-1)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Terraces are effective measures to control soil and water loss on hillslopes and play significant roles in water storage, soil conservation and increasing of crop yield. With the launch of comprehensive management engineering of transforming slopes into terraces in China, the area of terraces is continuously expanding. To plan for soil and water conservation in a scientific way and ensure rational soil and water conservation measures, it is important to determine a timely and accurate inventory of the spatial distribution of the existing terraces. High-resolution satellite data (China GF-1) was used in this study to automatically identify and extract terraces. The edge characteristics statistics algorithm, template-matching algorithm and the Fourier transformation algorithm were used. The results suggest that the template-matching algorithm, based on high gray features of terraces, has higher identification accuracy and lower extraction miss rate, and is able to determines the complete map spots, which works well for identification and extraction of typical terraces. The Fourier transformation algorithm, based on the texture of the terraces, is easily affected by gray changes on the terrace field surfaces and field ridges and is hardly reliable as a stand-alone technique for terrace identification. In this study, we focused on an area near Hengshan County, Yulin of Shanxi Province, and performed field validation of the terrace automatic identification and extraction algorithms. The results suggest that the accuracy of automatic identification and extraction of the terraces is greater than 80%. The method proposed is helpful to meet the requirements for planning and monitoring soil and water conservation projects.

TI  - Stripe Rust Resistance in <i>Roegneria kamoji</i> (Poaceae: Triticeae) and its Genetic Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Roegneria kamoji accession ZY 1007 was resistant to the mixed predominant races of Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) in China based on field tests at adult-plant stage. The seedling resistance evaluation of ZY 1007 showed that it was resistant to stripe rust physiological strains CYR29, CYR33 and PST-V26, which were the predominant races of Pst in China. The female parent R.kamoji cv. Gansi No.1 (susceptible to Pst) was crossed with ZY 1007 (resistant to Pst). Parents, F-1 and F-2 populations were tested in a field inoculated with the mixed urediniospores. ZY 1007 and all the observed 11 F-1 hybrid plants were resistant, while plants of Gansi No.1 were susceptible. Among the 221 F-2 plants, 168 plants were resistant and 53 were susceptible, and the segregation of resistant and susceptible plants fits 3R:1S ratio ((2)=0.074, P>0.75). It confirmed that the resistance of stripe rust in ZY 1007 was controlled by a single dominant gene and temporarily designated as YrK1007.

TI  - Research on the Impact of Absorption Feature Extraction on Spectral Difference Between Similar Minerals
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Diagnostic absorption features can indicate the existence of specific materials, which is the foundation of mineral analysis with optical remote sensing data. In hyperspectral data processing, the most commonly used method to extract absorption feature, is Continuum Removal (CR). As for multispectral data, Principle Component Analysis and other indirect methods were used to extract absorption information, and little research has been done on full-band absorption feature extraction. Classification of similar minerals is one of the major difficulties in mineral spectral analysis, while there is no valid index for spectral difference between similar mineral groups. Absorption feature extraction may improve the classification accuracy, but there is no research to investigate the impact of absorption feature extraction on spectral difference between similar minerals. This paper summarized the principle of mineral spectral difference, and proposed the concept of Class Separability Ratio (CSR), which was verified to be a valid index for spectral difference between similar mineral categories. Through comparison experiments on alunite and kaolinite spectra, including USGS spectral library spectra and resampled spectra in accordance with the band settings of HYPERION, ASTER and OLI, the impact of absorption feature extraction on spectral difference between similar minerals were investigated. Experimental results show that valid absorption feature extraction can greatly enhance the spectral difference between similar minerals, and the spectral difference is positively correlated with spectral resolution. Besides, the results of CR can be severely affected by spectral resolution and band center positions, and the absorption feature spectra extraction results for multispectral datasets need to be improved. This research laid the foundation of precise identification between similar mineral categories, and provided valuable reference for the band settings of future geology remote sensing sensors.

TI  - Geometric Accuracy Evaluation of YG-18 Satellite Imagery Based on RFM
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - YaoGan-18 (YG-18) is a Chinese high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite, which was launched on 29th October 2013. So far, however, there have been no published reports evaluating the geometric accuracy of its imagery; this is rectified in this paper. A refined rational function model (RFM) with an affine transformation is utilised for the spaceborne SAR processing. By setting corner reflectors as ground control points (GCPs) and independent check points, the orthorectification accuracy of YG-18 satellite images was better than 25m. Its stereo-SAR measurement accuracy was subsequently evaluated using a high-precision digital surface model (DSM), achieving an elevation accuracy of 1136m. The feasibility of the orthorectification method based on GCPs selected from corresponding image points of YG-18 SAR images and ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) optical images was also verified, offering single-image accuracy better than 45m.

TI  - "Ghost cities" identification using multi-source remote sensing datasets: A case study in Yangtze River Delta
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drastic urbanization has taken place in China during the last two decades. Recently, a considerable number of "ghost cities" have emerged due to the extensive and unreasonable urban expansion which far exceeds the practical demand. In order to investigate "ghost cities", we proposed a feasible framework by utilizing multi-source remote sensing datasets, including nighttime light imagery, land cover type products and population grid. After eliminating blooming effect of nighttime imagery by a proposed modified optimal threshold method (MOTM) and extracting built-up area from land cover type products, we developed a "ghost city" index (GCI) to quantify and evaluate the intensity of "ghost city" phenomenon in Yangtze River Delta at county/district level. The GCI was established according to the intrinsic features of "ghost cities", comprising three criteria: consistency of lit area and built-up area, illumination intensity and population density. Then, we explored the spatial pattern of "ghost cities" of different GCI categories and the ternary contour was applied to demonstrate the key factor among three criteria. Our finding implies that "ghost cities" are prominently spatial clustered. Meanwhile, counties and new development zones have higher risk of suffering from the phenomenon, while capital cities and municipal cities have an alleviative effect for ambient regions. Besides, regions with higher intensity of the phenomenon tend to have less balanced composition among three criteria. Our results show good consistency with previous reports and studies, providing a more objective and spatial explicit insight into the "ghost city" phenomenon. Our findings do not only prove the capability of monitoring "ghost cities" using remote sensing data, but would also be beneficial to urban planning and regional sustainable development.(C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Mapping Forest Ecosystem Biomass Density for Xiangjiang River Basin by Combining Plot and Remote Sensing Data and Comparing Spatial Extrapolation Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of forest biomass in a river basin usually has obvious spatial heterogeneity in relation to the locations of the upper and lower reaches of the basin. In the subtropical region of China, a large amount of forest biomass, comprising diverse forest types, plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the regional carbon cycle. However, accurately estimating forest ecosystem aboveground biomass density (AGB) and mapping its spatial variability at a scale of river basin remains a great challenge. In this study, we attempted to map the current AGB in the Xiangjiang River Basin in central southern China. Three approaches, including a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model, a logistic regression (LR) model, and an improved k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm, were compared to generate accurate estimates and their spatial distribution of forest ecosystem AGB in the basin. Forest inventory data from 782 field plots across the basin and remote sensing images from Landsat 5 in the same period were combined. A stepwise regression method was utilized to select significant spectral variables and a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique was employed to compare their predictions and assess the methods. Results demonstrated the high spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of AGB across the basin. Moreover, the improved kNN algorithm with 10 nearest neighbors showed stronger ability of spatial interpolation than other two models, and provided greater potential of accurately generating population and spatially explicit predictions of forest ecosystem AGB in the complicated basin.

TI  - Unsupervised Object-Based Differencing for Land-Cover Change Detection
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One main problem of the spectral decomposition-based change detection method is the lack of efficient automatic techniques for developing the difference image. Traditional techniques generally assume that gray-level values in a difference image are independent and multitemporal images are co-registered/rectified perfectly without error. However, such assumptions are often violated because of the inevitable image misregistration and the interference of correlations between spectral bands. This study proposes an automated method based on the object-based multivariate alteration detection/maximum autocorrelation factor approach and the Gaussian mixture model-expectation maximization algorithm to obtain unsupervised difference images. This procedure is applied to bi-temporal (2005 and 2006) SPOT-HRV images at Panyu District Ponds, China. Results show that the proposed method successfully excludes the correlations of spectral bands and the influence of misregistration, as evidenced by a higher accuracy (up to 93.6 percent). These unique technical characteristics make this analytical framework suitable for detecting changes.

TI  - An evaluation of marine regions relevant for ocean color system vicarious calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - System Vicarious Calibration (SVC) is the fundamental process commonly implemented to meet uncertainty requirements in satellite ocean color data. It is performed by applying gain factors, g-factors, to the pre-launch calibration coefficients of the space sensor already corrected for sensitivity decay with time. Mission specific g-factors are determined from top-of-the-atmosphere data computed by propagating highly accurate in situ values of the water-leaving radiance, L-W, to the satellite sensor. Values of L-W from marine regions characterized by oligotrophic/mesotrophic waters and maritime aerosols, high environmental stability and spatial homogeneity, low cloudiness and absence of any source of land contamination, are essential to determine g-factors applicable to the creation of Climate Data Records (CDRs) from multiple ocean color missions. Accounting for the location of existing and potential new SVC fixed sites, marine regions satisfying SVC requirements for the generation of CDRs have been identified through the analysis of satellite data from recent ocean color missions.

TI  - A Cloud Computing Solution for the Efficient Implementation of the P-SBAS DInSAR Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an efficient Cloud Computing (CC) implementation of the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) algorithm, which is an advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique for the generation of Earth surface displacement time series through distributed computing infrastructures. The rationale of our approach consists in properly distributing the large data volumes and the processing tasks involved in the P-SBAS chain among the available (virtual and/or physical) computing nodes of the CC infrastructure, so that each one of these elements can concurrentlywork on data that are physically stored on its own local volume. To do this, both an ad hocmanagement of the data flow and an appropriate scheduling of the parallel jobs have been also implemented to properly handle the high complexity of the P-SBAS workflow. The proposed solution allows minimizing the overall data transfer and network load, thus improving the P-SBAS efficiency and scalability within the exploited CCenvironments. The presented P-SBAS implementation has been extensively validated through two experimental analyses, which have been carried out by exploiting the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) resources. The former analysis involves the processing of a large (128 SAR images) COSMO-SkyMed dataset, which has been performed by exploiting up to 64 computing nodes, and is aimed at demonstrating the P-SBAS scalable performances. The latter allows us to show the P-SBAS capability to generate DInSAR results at a regional scale (150 000 km2 in Southern California) in a very short time (about 9 h), by simultaneously processing 18 ENVISAT frames that correspond to a total of 741 SAR images, exploiting in parallel 144 AWS computing nodes. The presented results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed P-SBASCCsolution, whichmay contribute to further extend the frontiers of the DInSAR investigation at a very large scale.

TI  - Assessment of PDI, MPDI and TVDI drought indices derived from MODIS Aqua/Terra Level 1B data in natural lands
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of remote sensing indices including the perpendicular drought index (PDI), modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) in drought monitoring in the northeast of Iran during 2003-2013. The mentioned indices were extracted from 254 atmospherically corrected MODIS images, and their accuracy was determined against soil moisture data and also standardized precipitation index (SPI) at monthly and yearly scales. The 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month SPI was obtained from 42 weather stations. According to the results, although the MODIS-derived drought indices had different efficiencies at different time scales, they could generally better reflect drought conditions at the yearly scale compared to the monthly scale. At the monthly scale, the PDI, MPDI and TVDI had the greatest correlations with the SPI during the 6-, 9- and 3-month periods ending in February, September and April (-0.60, -0.69 and -0.43, respectively). At the yearly scale, the PDI, MPDI and TVDI had the strongest correlation coefficients with the 6-, 6-, 3-month SPI in 2012 (-0.95), 2012 (-0.96) and 2007 (-0.72), respectively. Moreover, the high correlations (> 80%) between the MODIS-derived drought indices and soil moisture data reflected their potential in the mapping of soil moisture in the study area. Considering the constant performance of the MPDI in different time scales, this index can be used as a suitable alternative to the SPI in agricultural drought mapping and monitoring in arid and semiarid areas where the SPI faces certain limitations.

TI  - Toward full exploitation of coherent and incoherent information in Sentinel-1 TOPS data for retrieving surface displacement: Application to the 2016 Kumamoto (Japan) earthquake
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1's continuous observation program over all major plate boundary regions makes it well suited for earthquake studies. However, decorrelation due to large displacement gradients and limited azimuth resolution of the Terrain Observation by Progressive Scan (TOPS) data challenge acquiring measurements in the near field of many earthquake ruptures and prevent measurements of displacements in the along-track direction. Here we propose to fully exploit the coherent and incoherent information of TOPS data by using standard interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), split-bandwidth interferometry in range and azimuth, swath/burst-overlap interferometry, and amplitude cross correlation to map displacements in both the line-of-sight and the along-track directions. Application to the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence reveals the coseismic displacements from the far field to the near field. By adding near-field constraints, the derived slip model reveals more shallow slip than obtained when only using far-field data from InSAR, highlighting the importance of exploiting all coherent and incoherent information in TOPS data.

TI  - Longitudinal analysis of antibody responses in symptomatic malaria cases do not mirror parasite transmission in peri-urban area of Cote d'Ivoire between 2010 and 2013
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the agenda towards malaria eradication, assessment of both malaria exposure and efficacy of anti-vectorial and therapeutic strategies is a key component of management and the follow-up of field interventions. The simultaneous use of several antigens (Ags) as serological markers has the potential for accurate evaluation of malaria exposure. Here we aimed to measure the longitudinal evolution of the background levels of immunity in an urban setting in confirmed clinical cases of malaria.MethodsA retrospective serological cross-sectional study on was carried out using 234 samples taken from 2010 to 2013 in peri-urban sentinel facility of Cote d'Ivoire. Antibody responses to recombinant proteins or BSA-peptides, 8 Plasmodium falciparum (PfAMA1, PfMSP4, PfMSP1, PfEMP1-DBL1a1-PF13, PfLSA1-41, PfLSA3-NR2, PfGLURP and PfCSP), one P. malariae (PmCSP) and one Anopheles gambiae salivary (gSG6-P1) antigens were measured using magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassay (MBA). Total anti-P. falciparum IgG responses against schizont lysate from african 07/03 strain (adapted to culture) and 3D7 strain was measured by ELISA.ResultsHigh prevalence (7-93%) and levels of antibody responses to most of the antigens were evidenced. However, analysis showed only marginal decreasing trend of Ab responses from 2010 to 2013 that did not parallel the reduction of clinical malaria prevalence following the implementation of intervention in this area. There was a significant inverse correlation between Ab responses and parasitaemia (P<10(-3), rho = 0.3). The particular recruitment of asymptomatic individuals in 2011 underlined a high background level of immunity almost equivalent to symptomatic patients, possibly obscuring observable yearly variations.ConclusionThe use of cross-sectional clinical malaria surveys and MBA can help to identify endemic sites where control measures have unequal impact providing relevant information about population immunity and possible decrease of transmission. However, when immunity is substantially boosted despite observable clinical decline, a larger cohort including asymptomatic recruitment is needed to monitor the impact of control measures on level of immunity.

TI  - Estimates of the aerosol indirect effect over the Baltic Sea region derived from 12 years of MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on-board the Aqua satellite, 12 years (2003-2014) of aerosol and cloud properties were used to statistically quantify aerosol-cloud interaction (ACI) over the Baltic Sea region, including the relatively clean Fennoscandia and the more polluted central-eastern Europe. These areas allowed us to study the effects of different aerosol types and concentrations on macro-and microphysical properties of clouds: cloud effective radius (CER), cloud fraction (CF), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud liquid water path (LWP) and cloud-top height (CTH). Aerosol properties used are aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE) and aerosol index (AI). The study was limited to low-level water clouds in the summer.The vertical distributions of the relationships between cloud properties and aerosols show an effect of aerosols on low-level water clouds. CF, COT, LWP and CTH tend to increase with aerosol loading, indicating changes in the cloud structure, while the effective radius of cloud droplets decreases. The ACI is larger at relatively low cloud-top levels, between 900 and 700 hPa. Most of the studied cloud variables were unaffected by the lower-tropospheric stability (LTS), except for the cloud fraction.The spatial distribution of aerosol and cloud parameters and ACI, here defined as the change in CER as a function of aerosol concentration for a fixed LWP, shows positive and statistically significant ACI over the Baltic Sea and Fennoscandia, with the former having the largest values. Small negative ACI values are observed in central-eastern Europe, suggesting that large aerosol concentrations saturate the ACI.

TI  - Mapping the montane cloud forest of Taiwan using 12 year MODIS-derived ground fog frequency data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Up until now montane cloud forest (MCF) in Taiwan has only been mapped for selected areas of vegetation plots. This paper presents the first comprehensive map of MCF distribution for the entire island. For its creation, a Random Forest model was trained with vegetation plots from the National Vegetation Database of Taiwan that were classified as "MCF" or "non-MCF". This model predicted the distribution of MCF from a raster data set of parameters derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat channels and texture measures derived from them as well as ground fog frequency data derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. While the DEM parameters and Landsat data predicted much of the cloud forest's location, local deviations in the altitudinal distribution of MCF linked to the monsoonal influence as well as the Massenerhebung effect (causing MCF in atypically low altitudes) were only captured once fog frequency data was included. Therefore, our study suggests that ground fog data are most useful for accurately mapping MCF.

TI  - Medico-economic impact of MSKCC non-sentinel node prediction nomogram for ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancers
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAvoiding axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for invasive breast cancers with isolated tumor cells or micrometastatic sentinel node biopsy (SNB) could decrease morbidity with minimal clinical significance. Purpose The aim of this study is to simulate the medico-economic impact of the routine use of the MSKCC non-sentinel node (NSN) prediction nomogram for ER+ HER2-breast cancer patients.MethodsWe studied 1036 ER+ HER2-breast cancer patients with a metastatic SNB. All had a complementary ALND. For each patient, we calculated the probability of the NSN positivity using the MSKCC nomogram. After validation of this nomogram in the population, we described how the patients' characteristics spread as the threshold value changed. Then, we performed an economic simulation study to estimate the total cost of caring for patients treated according to the MSKCC predictive nomogram results.ResultsA 0.3 threshold discriminate the type of sentinel node (SN) metastases: 98.8% of patients with pN0(i+) and 91.6% of patients with pN1(mic) had a MSKCC score under 0.3 (false negative rate = 6.4%). If we use the 0.3 threshold for economic simulation, 43% of ALND could be avoided, reducing the costs of caring by 1 051 980 EUROS among the 1036 patients.ConclusionWe demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of using the MSKCC NSN prediction nomogram by avoiding ALND for the pN0(i+) or pN1(mic) ER+ HER2-breast cancer patients with a MSKCC score of less than or equal to 0.3.

TI  - The footprints of 16 year trends of Arctic springtime cloud and radiation properties on September sea ice retreat
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The most prominent September Arctic sea ice decline over the period of 2000-2015 occurs over the Siberian Sea, Laptev Sea, and Kara Sea. The satellite observed and retrieved sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud/radiation properties over the Arctic (70 degrees-90 degrees N) have been used to investigate the impact of springtime cloud and radiation properties on September SIC variation. Positive trends of cloud fractions, cloud water paths, and surface downward longwave flux at the surface over the September sea ice retreat areas are found over the period of 1 March to 14 May, while negative trends are found over the period of 15 May to 28 June. The spatial distributions of correlations between springtime cloud/radiation properties and September SIC have been calculated, indicating that increasing cloud fractions and downward longwave flux during springtime tend to enhance sea ice melting due to strong cloud warming effect. Surface downward and upward shortwave fluxes play an important role from May to June when the onset of sea ice melting occurs. The comparison between linearly detrended and nondetrended of each parameter indicates that significant impact of cloud and radiation properties on September sea ice retreat occurs over the Chukchi/Beaufort Sea at interannual time scale, especially over the period of 31 March to 29 April, while strongest climatological trends are found over the Laptev/Siberian Sea.

TI  - A physically based hydrological connectivity algorithm for describing spatial patterns of soil moisture in the unsaturated zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic connectivity has been proposed as an important concept for understanding local processes in the context of catchment hydrology. It can be useful for characterizing the soil moisture variability in complex heterogeneous landscapes. The current land surface models (e.g., Community Land Model, CLM) could not completely account for flow path continuity and connected patterns of subsurface properties in the unsaturated zone. In this study, we developed a physically based hydrologic connectivity algorithm based on dominant physical controls (e.g., topography, soil texture, and vegetation) to better understand the spatially distributed subsurface flow and improve the parameterization of soil hydraulic properties in hydrological modeling. We investigated the effects of mixed physical controls on soil moisture spatial variability and developed hydrologic connectivity using various thresholds. The connectivity was used for identifying the soil moisture variability and applied in a distributed land surface model (CLM) for calibrating soil hydraulic properties and improving model performance for estimating spatially distributed soil moisture. The proposed concept was tested in two watersheds (Little Washita in Oklahoma and Upper South Skunk in Iowa) comparing estimated soil moisture with the airborne remote sensing data (Electronically Scanning Thinned Array Radiometer and Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer). Our finding demonstrated that the spatial variations of soil moisture could be described well using physically based hydrologic connectivity, and the land surface model performance was improved by using the calibrated (distributed) soil hydraulic parameters. In addition, we found that the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters significantly affect model outputs not only on the water cycle but also on surface energy budgets.

TI  - Direct radiative effect of aerosols based on PARASOL and OMI satellite observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate portrayal of the aerosol characteristics is crucial to determine aerosol contribution to the Earth's radiation budget. We employ novel satellite retrievals to make a new measurement-based estimate of the shortwave direct radiative effect of aerosols (DREA), both over land and ocean. Global satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth, single-scattering albedo (SSA), and phase function from PARASOL (Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar) are used in synergy with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) SSA. Aerosol information is combined with land-surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function and cloud characteristics from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite products. Eventual gaps in observations are filled with the state-of-the-art global aerosol model ECHAM5-HAM2. It is found that our estimate of DREA is largely insensitive to model choice. Radiative transfer calculations show that DREA at top-of-atmosphere is -4.6 +/- 1.5 W/m(2) for cloud-free and -2.1 +/- 0.7 W/m(2) for all-sky conditions, during year 2006. These fluxes are consistent with, albeit generally less negative over ocean than, former assessments. Unlike previous studies, our estimate is constrained by retrievals of global coverage SSA, which may justify different DREA values. Remarkable consistency is found in comparison with DREA based on CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) and MODIS observations.

TI  - Aerosol and cloud microphysics covariability in the northeast Pacific boundary layer estimated with ship-based and satellite remote sensing observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship measurements collected over the northeast Pacific along transects between the port of Los Angeles (33.7 degrees N, 118.2 degrees W) and Honolulu (21.3 degrees N, 157.8 degrees W) during May to August 2013 were utilized to investigate the covariability between marine low cloud microphysical and aerosol properties. Ship-based retrievals of cloud optical depth (tau) from a Sun photometer and liquid water path (LWP) from a microwave radiometer were combined to derive cloud droplet number concentration N-d and compute a cloud-aerosol interaction (ACI) metric defined as ACI(CCN) = partial derivative ln(N-d)/partial derivative ln(CCN), with CCN denoting the cloud condensation nuclei concentration measured at 0.4% (CCN0.4) and 0.3% (CCN0.3) supersaturation. Analysis of CCN0.4, accumulation mode aerosol concentration (N-a), and extinction coefficient (sigma(ext)) indicates that N-a and sigma(ext) can be used as CCN0.4 proxies for estimating ACI. ACI(CCN) derived from 10 min averaged N-d and CCN0.4 and CCN0.3, and CCN0.4 regressions using N-a and sigma(ext), produce high ACI(CCN): near 1.0, that is, a fractional change in aerosols is associated with an equivalent fractional change in N-d. ACI(CCN) computed in deep boundary layers was small (ACI(CCN) = 0.60), indicating that surface aerosol measurements inadequately represent the aerosol variability below clouds. Satellite cloud retrievals from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and GOES-15 data were compared against ship-based retrievals and further analyzed to compute a satellite-based ACI(CCN). Satellite data correlated well with their ship-based counterparts with linear correlation coefficients equal to or greater than 0.78. Combined satellite N-d and ship-based CCN0.4 and N-a yielded a maximum ACI(CCN) = 0.88-0.92, a value slightly less than the ship-based ACI(CCN), but still consistent with aircraft-based studies in the eastern Pacific.

TI  - Two global data sets of daily fire emission injection heights since 2003
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) assimilates fire radiative power (FRP) observations from satellite-based sensors to produce daily estimates of biomass burning emissions. It has been extended to include information about injection heights derived from fire observations and meteorological information from the operational weather forecasts of ECMWF.Injection heights are provided by two distinct methods: the Integrated Monitoring and Modelling System for wildland fires (IS4FIRES) parameterisation and the one-dimensional plume rise model (PRM). A global database of daily biomass burning emissions and injection heights at 0.1 degrees resolution has been produced for 2003-2015 and is continuously extended in near-real time with the operational GFAS service of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS).In this study, the two injection height data sets were compared with the new MPHP2 (MISR Plume Height Project 2) satellite-based plume height retrievals. The IS4FIRES parameterisation showed a better overall agreement than the observations, while the PRM was better at capturing the variability of injection heights. The performance of both parameterisations is also dependent on the type of vegetation.Furthermore, the use of biomass burning emission heights from GFAS in atmospheric composition forecasts was assessed in two case studies: the South AMerican Biomass Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) campaign which took place in September 2012 in Brazil, and a series of large fire events in the western USA in August 2013. For these case studies, forecasts of biomass burning aerosol species by the Composition Integrated Forecasting System (C-IFS) of CAMS were found to better reproduce the observed vertical distribution when using PRM injection heights from GFAS compared to aerosols emissions being prescribed at the surface.The globally available GFAS injection heights introduced and evaluated in this study provide a comprehensive data set for future fire and atmospheric composition modelling studies.

TI  - The Oasis impact structure, Libya: geological characteristics from ALOS PALSAR-2 data interpretation
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical and infrared remote sensing may provide first-order clues for the identification of potential impact structures on the Earth. Despite the free availability of at least optical image data at highest resolution, research has shown that remote sensing analysis always remains inconclusive and extensive groundwork is needed for the confirmation of the impact origin of such structures. Commonly, optical image data and digital terrain models have been employed mainly for such remote sensing studies of impact structures. With the advent of imaging radar data, a few excursions have been made to also employ radar datasets. Despite its long use, capabilities of imaging radar for studying surface and subsurface structures have not been exploited quantitatively when applied for the identification and description of such features due to the inherent complexity of backscatter processes. In this work, we make use of higher-level derived radar datasets in order to gain clearer qualitative insights that help to describe and identify potential impact structures. We make use of high-resolution data products from the ALOS PALSAR-1 and ALOS PALSAR-2 L-band sensors to describe the heavily eroded Oasis impact structure located in the Libyan Desert. While amplitude radar data with single polarization have usually been utilized to accompany the suite of remote sensing datasets when interpreting impact structures in the past, we conclude that the integration of amplitude data with HH/HV/HH-HV polarization modes in standard and, in particular, in Ultra-Fine mode, as well as entropy-alpha decomposition data, significantly helps to identify and discriminate surface units based on their consolidation. Based on the overarching structural pattern, we determined the diameter of the eroded Oasis structure at 15.6 +/- 0.5 km.

TI  - Comparing the diurnal and seasonal variabilities of atmospheric and surface urban heat islands based on the Beijing urban meteorological network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compared the diurnal and seasonal cycles of atmospheric and surface urban heat islands (UHIs) based on hourly air temperatures (T-a) collected at 65 out of 262 stations in Beijing and land surface temperature (T-s) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer in the years 2013-2014. We found that the nighttime atmospheric and surface UHIs referenced to rural cropland stations exhibited significant seasonal cycles, with the highest in winter. However, the seasonal variations in the nighttime UHIs referenced to mountainous forest stations were negligible, because mountainous forests have a higher nighttime Ts in winter and a lower nighttime Ta in summer than rural croplands. Daytime surface UHIs showed strong seasonal cycles, with the highest in summer. The daytime atmospheric UHIs exhibited a similar but less seasonal cycle under clear-sky conditions, which was not apparent under cloudy-sky conditions. Atmospheric UHIs in urban parks were higher in daytime. Nighttime atmospheric UHIs are influenced by energy stored in urban materials during daytime and released during nighttime. The stronger anthropogenic heat release in winter causes atmospheric UHIs to increase with time during winter nights, but decrease with time during summer nights. The percentage of impervious surfaces is responsible for 49%-54% of the nighttime atmospheric UHI variability and 31%-38% of the daytime surface UHI variability. However, the nighttime surface UHI was nearly uncorrelated with the percentage of impervious surfaces around the urban stations.

TI  - An agricultural biomass burning episode in eastern China: Transport, optical properties, and impacts on regional air quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural biomass burning (ABB) has been of particular concern due to its influence on air quality and atmospheric radiation, as it produces large amounts of gaseous and aerosol emissions. This paper presents an integrated observation of a significant ABB episode in Nanjing, China, during early June 2011, using combined ground-based and satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, Atmospheric Infrared Sounder, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), and Ozone Monitoring Instrument products). The time-height distribution, optical properties, sources and transport of smoke, and its impacts on air quality are investigated. Lidar profiles indicate that the smoke aerosols are confined to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and have a depolarization ratio of less than 0.08. The aerosol optical depths increase from 0.5 to 3.0 at 500 nm, while the extinction-related Angstrom exponent increases from 1.1 to 1.6 at the wavelength pair of 440-870 nm. The single-scattering albedo becomes lower at 670-1020nm following the ABB intrusion and particularly shows a decreasing tendency between wavelengths of 440 to 1020 nm. The absorption Angstrom exponent (0.7) is smaller than 1.0, which may indicate the aged smoke particles mixed or coated with the urban aerosols. Surface particular matter PM10 and PM2.5 show a dramatic increase, reaching hourly mean of 800 mu g/m(3) and 485 mu g/m(3), respectively, which results in a heavy air pollution event. The stagnant and high-moisture weather provides favorable conditions for the aerosols to accumulate near the surface. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) also illustrate that the large-scale aerosols are primarily present in the PBL and transported to the ocean, but some dense smoke plumes are misclassified as cloud or polluted dust. By comparing with the observations, we found that the Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry model captured the accumulation and downwind transport of surface PM2.5 from 20: 00 on 2 June to 10: 00 on 3 June (phase 1) but showed a dramatic underestimate from 20: 00 on 3-4 June (phase 2) when dense aerosols are present. Such a discrepancy in the model is associated with the improper vertical apportion of transported smoke and atmospheric diffusion conditions when comparing with the observed aerosol and wind profiles. In addition, the model simulations indicate that the transported smoke can contribute to 50-70% of the ground-level PM2.5 in Nanjing.

TI  - Intercomparisons of marine boundary layer cloud properties from the ARM CAP-MBL campaign and two MODIS cloud products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - From April 2009 to December 2010, the Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program carried out an observational field campaign on Graciosa Island, targeting the marine boundary layer (MBL) clouds over the Azores region. In this paper, we present an intercomparison of the MBL cloud properties, namely, cloud liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud-droplet effective radius (CER), among retrievals from the ARM mobile facility and two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products (Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC)-MODIS and Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System-MODIS). A total of 63 daytime single-layer MBL cloud cases are selected for intercomparison. Comparison of collocated retrievals indicates that the two MODIS cloud products agree well on both COT and CER retrievals, with the correlation coefficient R>0.95, despite their significant difference in spatial sampling. In both MODIS products, the CER retrievals based on the 2.1 mu m band (CER2.1) are significantly larger than those based on the 3.7 mu m band (CER3.7). The GSFC-MODIS cloud product is collocated and compared with ground-based ARM observations at several temporal-spatial scales. In general, the correlation increases with more precise collocation. For the 63 selected MBL cloud cases, the GSFC-MODIS LWP and COT retrievals agree reasonably well with the ground-based observations with no apparent bias and correlation coefficient R around 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. However, GSFC-MODIS CER3.7 and CER2.1 retrievals have a lower correlation (R similar to 0.5) with the ground-based retrievals. For the 63 selected cases, they are on average larger than ground observations by about 1.5 mu m and 3.0 mu m, respectively. Taking into account that the MODIS CER retrievals are only sensitive to cloud top reduces the bias only by 0.5 mu m.

TI  - Flood risk assessment of Panchganga River (Kolhapur district, Maharashtra) using GIS-based multicriteria decision technique
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood hazard causes great loss to lives and properties leading to disturbance in human society. Flood is the single most hydrometeorological hazard causing substantial losses. To gain better understanding of the flood phenomena especially for planning and mitigation purposes, flood risk analysis is often required. For the present study, the middle part of Panchganga river of Kolhapur district, Maharashtra was selected. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential flood risk areas of Panchganga river using GIS-based multicriteria decision analysis. The flood scenario across the Panchganga river was analysed using RADARSAT SAR data of 5 August 2005. To remove the speckle of SAR image, a median filtered technique was used. Thresholding technique was applied on RADARSAT SAR data to segregate flooded areas from non-flooded areas. Factors considered for evaluation of the flood risk analysis were flood layer, elevation, infrastructure and land use/land cover analysis. The spatial multicriteria analysis with ranking, rating and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to compute the priority weights of each criterion. Accuracy assessment reveals that AHP is the most accurate technique to assess flood risk of Panchganga river.

AB  - Coastal zones are dynamic interfaces of land and water of high ecological diversity and critical economic importance. The boundaries, shape and size of this coast change constantly under the influence of both natural and anthropogenic factors. The study area, Tupilipalem is one of the proposal sites for constructing a major port, to be named Dugarajapatnam Port, along the east coast of Andhra Pradesh, India. We have used multitemporal satellite images of IRS P6 LISS-III and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data from 2011 to 2015 to delineate changes in Tupilipalem coast. The subsequent short-term lagoon mouth closure and the long-term coastal erosion and accretion rates have been calculated for the periods between 2011 and 2015. Low river inflow, wind, tides, the movement of the waves and littoral currents play a key role in the closure of the lagoon mouth and also for the dynamic activities of erosion and accretion. Moreover, the impact on socio-economy and ecology of the study area during the lagoon mouth closure period has been studied.

TI  - Improving volcanic ash predictions with the HYSPLIT dispersion model by assimilating MODIS satellite retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) runs the HYSPLIT dispersion model with a unit mass release rate to predict the transport and dispersion of volcanic ash. The model predictions provide information for the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) to issue advisories to meteorological watch offices, area control centers, flight information centers, and others. This research aims to provide quantitative forecasts of ash distributions generated by objectively and optimally estimating the volcanic ash source strengths, vertical distribution, and temporal variations using an observation-modeling inversion technique. In this top-down approach, a cost functional is defined to quantify the differences between the model predictions and the satellite measurements of column-integrated ash concentrations weighted by the model and observation uncertainties. Minimizing this cost functional by adjusting the sources provides the volcanic ash emission estimates. As an example, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite retrievals of the 2008 Kasatochi volcanic ash clouds are used to test the HYSPLIT volcanic ash inverse system. Because the satellite retrievals include the ash cloud top height but not the bottom height, there are different model diagnostic choices for comparing the model results with the observed mass loadings. Three options are presented and tested. Although the emission estimates vary significantly with different options, the subsequent model predictions with the different release estimates all show decent skill when evaluated against the unassimilated satellite observations at later times. Among the three options, integrating over three model layers yields slightly better results than integrating from the surface up to the observed volcanic ash cloud top or using a single model layer. Inverse tests also show that including the ash-free region to constrain the model is not beneficial for the current case. In addition, extra constraints on the source terms can be given by explicitly enforcing "no-ash" for the atmosphere columns above or below the observed ash cloud top height. However, in this case such extra constraints are not helpful for the inverse modeling. It is also found that simultaneously assimilating observations at different times produces better hindcasts than only assimilating the most recent observations.

TI  - Exploring Google Earth Engine Platform for Big Data Processing: Classification of Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery for Crop Mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many applied problems arising in agricultural monitoring and food security require reliable crop maps at national or global scale. Large scale crop mapping requires processing andmanagement of large amount of heterogeneous satellite imagery acquired by various sensors that consequently leads to a "Big Data" problem. The main objective of this study is to explore efficiency of using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform when classifying multi-temporal satellite imagery with potential to apply the platform for a larger scale (e.g., country level) and multiple sensors (e.g., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2). In particular, multiple state-of-the-art classifiers available in the GEE platformare compared to produce a high resolution (30 m) crop classification map for a large territory (similar to 28,100 km(2) and 1.0 M ha of cropland). Though this study does not involve large volumes of data, it does address efficiency of the GEE platform to effectively execute complex workflows of satellite data processing required with large scale applications such as crop mapping. The study discusses strengths and weaknesses of classifiers, assesses accuracies that can be achieved with different classifiers for the Ukrainian landscape, and compares them to the benchmark classifier using a neural network approach that was developed in our previous studies. The study is carried out for the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) test site in Ukraine covering the Kyiv region (North of Ukraine) in 2013. We found that GEE provides very good performance in terms of enabling access to the remote sensing products through the cloud platform and providing pre-processing; however, in terms of classification accuracy, the neural network based approach outperformed support vector machine (SVM), decision tree and random forest classifiers available in GEE.

TI  - Transcriptome of the floral transition in <i>Rosa chinensis</i> 'Old Blush'
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The floral transition plays a vital role in the life of ornamental plants. Despite progress in model plants, the molecular mechanisms of flowering regulation remain unknown in perennial plants. Rosa chinensis 'Old Blush' is a unique plant that can flower continuously year-round. In this study, gene expression profiles associated with the flowering transition were comprehensively analyzed during floral transition in the rose.Results: According to the transcriptomic profiles, 85,663 unigenes and 1,637 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, among which 32 unigenes were involved in the circadian clock, sugar metabolism, hormone, and autonomous pathways. A hypothetical model for the regulation of floral transition was proposed in which the candidate genes function synergistically the floral transition process. Hormone contents and biosynthesis and metabolism genes fluctuated during the rose floral transition process. Gibberellins (GAs) inhibited rose floral transition, the content of GAs gradually decreased and GA2ox and SCL13 were upregulated from vegetative (VM) meristem to floral meristem (FM). Auxin plays an affirmative part in mediating floral transition, auxin content and auxin-related gene expression levels were gradually upregulated during the floral transition of the rose. However, ABA content and ABA signal genes were gradually downregulated, suggesting that ABA passively regulates the rose floral transition by participating in sugar signaling. Furthermore, sugar content and sugar metabolism genes increased during floral transition in the rose, which may be a further florigenic signal that activates floral transition. Additionally, FRI, FY, DRM1, ELIP, COP1, CO, and COL16 are involved in the circadian clock and autonomous pathway, respectively, and they play a positively activating role in regulating floral transition. Overall, physiological changes associated with genes involved in the circadian clock or autonomous pathway collectively regulated the rose floral transition.Conclusions: Our results summarize a valuable collective of gene expression profiles characterizing the rose floral transition. The DEGs are candidates for functional analyses of genes affecting the floral transition in the rose, which is a precious resource that reveals the molecular mechanism of mediating floral transition in other perennial plants.

TI  - Quantifying groundwater exploitation induced subsidence in the Rafsanjan plain, southeastern Iran, using InSAR time-series and in situ measurements
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Decades of groundwater overexploitation for agriculture and industrial development have resulted in substantial land subsidence in the Rafsanjan plain of southeastern Iran. This work presents the results of an InSAR time series analysis obtained by the exploitation of Envisat, ALOS and Sentinel-1 (S1) SAR data archives between June 2004, and May 2016, to investigate land subsidence in the plain. The InSAR analysis revealed an area of approximately 1000 km(2) within the study area showing subsidence of >5 cm/year and locally exceeding 30 cm/yr in the last decade. This area of significant subsidence is limited in its spatial extent to the agricultural land and is partly influenced by Quaternary faults. The temporal and areal relationships of subsidence and groundwater level data suggest that a significant part of the observed subsidence in the Rafsanjan region is caused by intense groundwater extraction that has led to widespread compaction within the upper parts of the up to 300 m thick unconsolidated sediments, causing irreversible and inelastic deformation of the aquifer. The average volume storage loss of the aquifer system due to overexploitation is estimated to have been approximately 300 million cubic metre (mcm)/yr over the last decade. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A comprehensive biomass burning emission inventory with high spatial and temporal resolution in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning injects many different gases and aerosols into the atmosphere that could have a harmful effect on air quality, climate, and human health. In this study, a comprehensive biomass burning emission inventory including domestic and in-field straw burning, firewood burning, livestock excrement burning, and forest and grassland fires is presented, which was developed for mainland China in 2012 based on county-level activity data, satellite data, and updated source-specific emission factors (EFs). The emission inventory within a 1 x 1 km(2) grid was generated using geographical information system (GIS) technology according to source-based spatial surrogates. A range of key information related to emission estimation (e.g. province-specific proportion of domestic and in-field straw burning, detailed firewood burning quantities, uneven temporal distribution coefficient) was obtained from field investigation, systematic combing of the latest research, and regression analysis of statistical data. The established emission inventory includes the major precursors of complex pollution, greenhouse gases, and heavy metal released from biomass burning. The results show that the emissions of SO2, NO x, PM10, PM2.5, NMVOC, NH3, CO, EC, OC, CO2, CH4, and Hg in 2012 are 336.8 Gg, 990.7 Gg, 3728.3 Gg, 3526.7 Gg, 3474.2 Gg, 401.2 Gg, 34 380.4 Gg, 369.7 Gg, 1189.5 Gg, 675 299.0 Gg, 2092.4 Gg, and 4.12 Mg, respectively. Domestic straw burning, in-field straw burning, and firewood burning are identified as the dominant biomass burning sources. The largest contributing source is different for various pollutants. Domestic straw burning is the largest source of biomass burning emissions for all the pollutants considered, except for NH3, EC (firewood), and NO x (in-field straw). Corn, rice, and wheat represent the major crop straws. The combined emission of these three straw types accounts for 80% of the total straw-burned emissions for each specific pollutant mentioned in this study. As for the straw burning emission of various crops, corn straw burning has the largest contribution to all of the pollutants considered, except for CH4; rice straw burning has highest contribution to CH4 and the second largest contribution to other pollutants, except for SO2, OC, and Hg; wheat straw burning is the second largest contributor to SO2, OC, and Hg and the third largest contributor to other pollutants. Heilongjiang, Shandong, and Henan provinces located in the north-eastern and central-southern regions of China have higher emissions compared to other provinces in China. Gridded emissions, which were obtained through spatial allocation based on the gridded rural population and fire point data from emission inventories at county resolution, could better represent the actual situation. High biomass burning emissions are concentrated in the areas with more agricultural and rural activity. The months of April, May, June, and October account for 65% of emissions from in-field crop residue burning, while, regarding EC, the emissions in January, February, October, November, and December are relatively higher than other months due to biomass domestic burning in heating season. There are regional differences in the monthly variations of emissions due to the diversity of main planted crops and climatic conditions. Furthermore, PM2.5 component results showed that OC, Cl-, EC, K+, NH4+, elemental K, and SO42- are the main PM2.5 species, accounting for 80% of the total emissions. The species with relatively high contribution to NMVOC emission include ethylene, propylene, toluene, mp-xylene, and ethyl benzene, which are key species for the formation of secondary air pollution. The detailed biomass burning emission inventory developed by this study could provide useful information for air-quality modelling and could support the development of appropriate pollution-control strategies.

TI  - Large-scale radiation and energy balances with Landsat 8 images and agrometeorological data in the Brazilian semiarid region
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming to subsidize the rational water resources management, four Landsat 8 (L8) images along different conditions of the year 2014 were used for modeling the radiation and energy balances in the mixed agroecosystems inside a Brazilian reference semiarid area. The SAFER algorithm was applied to calculate the latent heat flux (lambda E); net radiation (R-n) was acquired by the Slob equation; ground heat flux (G) was considered a fraction of R-n; and the sensible heat flux (H) was retrieved by residue in the energy balance equation. For classifying the vegetation, the surface resistance algorithm (SUREAL) was used to estimate the surface resistance to the water fluxes (r(s)) with threshold values for r(s). Clearly, one could see higher lambda E values from irrigated crops (ICs) than those for natural vegetation (NV) with some situations of heat horizontal advection. The respective lambda E, H, and G average ratios to R-n for the ICs ecosystem were 64% to 79%, 18% to 28%, and 3%, respectively. For the NV ecosystem, the corresponding fractions were 4% to 37%, 60% to 94%, and 4%, respectively. The algorithms proved to have strong sensibility to quantifying the large-scale energy and mass exchanges by applying L8 images in mixed agroecosystems of semiarid environments.

TI  - Impact of adding additional providers to resident workload and the resident experience on a medical consultation rotation
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Excellence in Graduate Medical Education requires the right clinical environment with an appropriate workload where residents have enough patients to gain proficiency in medicine with optimal time for reflection. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has focused more on work hours rather than workload; however, high resident workload has been associated with lower resident participation in education and fatigue-related errors. Recognizing the potential risks associated with high resident workload and being mindful of the costs of reducing resident workload, we sought to reduce residents' workload by adding an advanced practice provider (APP) to the surgical comanagement service (SCM) and study its effect on resident satisfaction and perceived educational value of the rotation.Methods: In Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 and 2015, an additional faculty member was added to the SCM rotation. In FY 2014, the faculty member was a staff physician, and in FY 2015, the faculty member was an APP.. Resident workload was assessed using billing data. We measured residents' perceptions of the rotation using an anonymous electronic survey tool. We compared FY2014-2015 data to the baseline FY2013.Results: The number of patients seen per resident per day decreased from 8.0(SD 3.3) in FY2013 to 5.0(SD 1.9) in FY2014 (p < 0.001) and 5.7(SD 2.0) in FY2015 (p < 0.001). A higher proportion of residents reported "just right" patient volume (64. 4%, 91.7%, 96.7% in FY2013, 2014, 2015 respectively p < 0.001), meeting curricular goals (79.9%, 95.0%, 97.2%, in FY2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively p < 0.001), and overall educational value of the rotation (40.0%, 72.2%, 72.6% in FY2013, 2014, 2015 respectively, p < 0.001).Conclusions: Decreasing resident workload through adding clinical faculty (both staff physician and APPs) was associated with improvements on resident perceived educational value and clinical experience of a medical consultation rotation.

TI  - Hepatitis C virus and HIV co-infection among pregnant women in Rwanda
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a pandemic causing disease; more than 185 million people are infected worldwide. An HCV antibody (Ab) prevalence of 6.0% was estimated in Central African countries. The study aimed at providing HCV prevalence estimates among pregnant women in Rwanda.Methods: HCV surveillance through antibody screening test among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics was performed in 30 HIV sentinel surveillance sites in Rwanda.Results: Among 12,903 pregnant women tested at antenatal clinics, 335 (2.6% [95% Confidence Interval 2.32-2.87]) tested positive for HCV Ab. The prevalence of HCV Ab in women aged 25-49 years was 2.8% compared to 2.4% in women aged 15-24 years (aOR = 1.3; [1.05-1.59]); This proportion was 2.7% [2.37-2.94] in pregnant women in engaged in non-salaried employment compared to 1.2% [0.24-2.14] in those engaged in salaried employment (aOR = 3.2; [1.60-6.58]). The proportion of HCV Ab-positive co-infected with HIV was estimated at 3.9% (13 cases). Women in urban residence were more likely to be associated with HCV-infection (OR = 1.3; 95% CI [1.0-1.6]) compared to those living in rural setting.Conclusion: HCV is a public health problem in pregnant women in Rwanda. Few pregnant women were co-infected with HCV and HIV. Living in urban setting was more likely to associate pregnant women with HCV infection.

TI  - Assessment of lymphatic filariasis prior to re-starting mass drug administration campaigns in coastal Kenya
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating disease associated with extensive disfigurement and is one of a diverse group of diseases referred to as neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) which mainly occur among the poorest populations. In line with global recommendations to eliminate LF, Kenya launched its LF elimination programme in 2002 with the aim to implement annual mass drug administration (MDA) in order to interrupt LF transmission. However, the programme faced financial and administrative challenges over the years such that sustained annual MDA was not possible. Recently, there has been renewed interest to eliminate LF and the Kenyan Ministry of Health, through support from World Health Organization (WHO), restarted annual MDA in 2015. The objective of this study was to evaluate the current status of LF infection in the endemic coastal region of Kenya before MDA campaigns were restarted.Results: Ten sentinel sites in Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu, and Taita-Taveta counties in coastal Kenya were selected for participation in a cross-sectional survey of LF infection prevalence. At least 300 individuals in each sentinel village were sampled through random house-to-house visits. During the day, the point-of-care immunochromatographic test (ICT) was used to detect the presence of Wuchereria bancrofti circulating filarial antigen in finger prick blood samples collected from residents of the selected sentinel villages. Those individuals who tested positive with the ICT test were requested to provide a night-time blood sample for microfilariae (MF) examination. The overall prevalence of filarial antigenaemia was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.9-1.8%). Ndau Island in Lamu County had the highest prevalence (6.3%; 95% CI: 4.1-9.7%), whereas sites in Kilifi and Kwale counties had prevalences < 1.7%. Mean microfilarial density was also higher in Ndau Island (234 MF/ml) compared to sentinel sites in Kwale and Kilifi counties (< 25 MF/ml). No LF infection was detected in Tana River and Taita-Taveta counties. Overall, more than 88% of the study participants reported to have used a bed net the previous night.Conclusions: Prevalence of LF infection is generally very low in coastal Kenya, but there remain areas that require further rounds of MDA if the disease is to be eliminated as a public health problem in line with the ongoing global elimination efforts. However, areas where there was no evidence of LF transmission should be considered for WHO-recommended transmission assessment surveys in view of stopping MDA.

TI  - Soluble iron nutrients in Saharan dust over the central Amazon rainforest
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The intercontinental transport of aerosols from the Sahara desert plays a significant role in nutrient cycles in the Amazon rainforest, since it carries many types of minerals to these otherwise low-fertility lands. Iron is one of the micronutrients essential for plant growth, and its long-range transport might be an important source for the iron-limited Amazon rainforest. This study assesses the bioavailability of iron Fe(II) and Fe(III) in the particulate matter over the Amazon forest, which was transported from the Sahara desert (for the sake of our discussion, this term also includes the Sahel region). The sampling campaign was carried out above and below the forest canopy at the ATTO site (Amazon Tall Tower Observatory), a near-pristine area in the central Amazon Basin, from March to April 2015. Measurements reached peak concentrations for soluble Fe(III) (48 ng m(-3)), Fe(II) (16 ng m(-3)), Na (470 ng m(-3)), Ca (194 ng m(-3)), K (65 ng m(-3)), and Mg (89 ng m(-3)) during a time period of dust transport from the Sahara, as confirmed by ground-based and satellite remote sensing data and air mass backward trajectories. Dust sampled above the Amazon canopy included primary biological aerosols and other coarse particles up to 12 mu m in diameter. Atmospheric transport of weathered Saharan dust, followed by surface deposition, resulted in substantial iron bioavailability across the rainforest canopy. The seasonal deposition of dust, rich in soluble iron, and other minerals is likely to assist both bacteria and fungi within the topsoil and on canopy surfaces, and especially benefit highly bioabsorbent species. In this scenario, Saharan dust can provide essential macronutrients and micronutrients to plant roots, and also directly to plant leaves. The influence of this input on the ecology of the forest canopy and topsoil is discussed, and we argue that this influence would likely be different from that of nutrients from the weathered Amazon bedrock, which otherwise provides the main source of soluble mineral nutrients.

TI  - The interactions between soil-biosphere-atmosphere land surface model with a multi-energy balance (ISBA-MEB) option in SURFEXv8-Part 1: Model description
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface models (LSMs) are pushing towards improved realism owing to an increasing number of observations at the local scale, constantly improving satellite data sets and the associated methodologies to best exploit such data, improved computing resources, and in response to the user community. As a part of the trend in LSM development, there have been ongoing efforts to improve the representation of the land surface processes in the interactions between the soil-biosphere-atmosphere (ISBA) LSM within the EXternalized SURFace (SURFEX) model platform. The force-restore approach in ISBA has been replaced in recent years by multi-layer explicit physically based options for sub-surface heat transfer, soil hydrological processes, and the composite snowpack. The representation of vegetation processes in SURFEX has also become much more sophisticated in recent years, including photosynthesis and respiration and biochemical processes. It became clear that the conceptual limits of the composite soil-vegetation scheme within ISBA had been reached and there was a need to explicitly separate the canopy vegetation from the soil surface. In response to this issue, a collaboration began in 2008 between the high-resolution limited area model (HIRLAM) consortium and Meteo-France with the intention to develop an explicit representation of the vegetation in ISBA under the SURFEX platform. A new parameterization has been developed called the ISBA multi-energy balance (MEB) in order to address these issues. ISBA-MEB consists in a fully implicit numerical coupling between a multi-layer physically based snow-pack model, a variable-layer soil scheme, an explicit litter layer, a bulk vegetation scheme, and the atmosphere. It also includes a feature that permits a coupling transition of the snowpack from the canopy air to the free atmosphere. It shares many of the routines and physics parameterizations with the standard version of ISBA. This paper is the first of two parts; in part one, the ISBA-MEB model equations, numerical schemes, and theoretical background are presented. In part two (Napoly et al., 2016), which is a separate companion paper, a local scale evaluation of the new scheme is presented along with a detailed description of the new forest litter scheme.

TI  - Prevalence of syphilis among female sex workers and their clients in Togo in 2011
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During the last ten years, a resurgence of syphilis has occurred in many countries worldwide, including Togo. Previous studies have shown a wide range of syphilis infection among the female sex workers (FSWs), from 1.5 to 42.1%. In Togo, Key populations, including FSWs, are rarely involved in the sentinel surveillance programs to determine the prevalence of HIV and syphilis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of syphilis among female sex workers (FSWs) and their clients in Togo.Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in December 2011 targeting FSWs and their clients in Togo. Among participant who consented, we collected blood samples for syphilis and HIV testing.Results: In total, 1,836 participants (1,106 FSWs and 730 clients) were included in the survey. Their mean age was 28.6 +/- 9 years. The prevalence of syphilis was 2.2% (2.2% among FSWs compare to 2.3% among their clients, p = 0. 82). This prevalence was higher among FSWs over 30 years old compare to those less than 30 years old (Odd Ratio (OR) = 5.03; 95% CI [1.95-13.49]). Single FSWs were three times less likely to have syphilis than those living in couple or married (OR = 3.11; CI 95% [ 1.16-8.83]). Brothel based or declared FSWs were 4 times more likely to be infected by syphilis than secret ones (OR = 3.89; CI 95% [ 1.60-9.54]). Out of the 1,836 participants of the survey, 165 (8.9%) were HIV positive. Having syphilis was associated with HIV infection (OR = 3.41; IC 95% [ 1.53-7.41]).Conclusion: This study showed that: i) the prevalence of syphilis among FSWs and their clients was high; ii) syphilis was significantly associated with HIV infection. It is necessary to increase awareness campaigns and emphasize on condom use among this key population group.

TI  - Characterization and classification of freshwater marshy wetland using synthetic aperture radar polarimetry: a case study from Loktak wetland, Northeast India
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Loktak is the largest natural wetland of Northeast India, the last home of endangered brow-antlered deer, and a site of global significance recognized under Ramsar convention. Ecological and human-meditated spatial patterns of Loktak wetland were characterized and classified using a Radarsat-2 C band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data. Radarsat-2 quad-pol scene of dry season was preprocessed and classified using PolSARpro software. Eigen vector-eigen value decomposition of coherency matrix (T3) was performed to characterize the scattering properties of wetland targets based on entropy (H)/anisotropy (A)/alpha angle (alpha) segmentation. Results illustrate that RGB color display of H/A/a images is a useful indicator of wetland structure and composition, and provide clear visual discrimination of open water, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi cover, and associated man-made features. Six classes, namely, floating phumdi, permanent phumdi, scrub/shrub, fallow land, built-up, and open water were mapped using Wishart classification of H/A/a images. Scattering mechanisms of natural and man-made targets synthesized from PolSAR data, and their classification using Wishart algorithm have been validated through a visually classified map and field reference points. The land cover generated would be useful for conservation and management of Loktak wetland and brow-antlered deer population. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Impacts of the July 2012 Siberian fire plume on air quality in the Pacific Northwest
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning emissions emit a significant amount of trace gases and aerosols and can affect atmospheric chemistry and radiative forcing for hundreds or thousands of kilometres downwind. They can also contribute to exceedances of air quality standards and have negative impacts on human health. We present a case study of an intense wildfire plume from Siberia that affected the air quality across the Pacific Northwest on 6-10 July 2012. Using satellite measurements (MODIS True Colour RGB imagery and MODIS AOD), we track the wildfire smoke plume from its origin in Siberia to the Pacific Northwest where subsidence ahead of a subtropical Pacific High made the plume settle over the region. The normalized enhancement ratios of O-3 and PM1 relative to CO of 0.26 and 0.08 are consistent with a plume aged 6-10 days. The aerosol mass in the plume was mainly submicron in diameter (PM1 / PM2.5 = 0.96) and the part of the plume sampled at the Whistler High Elevation Monitoring Site (2182 m a.s.l.) was 88% organic material. Stable atmospheric conditions along the coast limited the initial entrainment of the plume and caused local anthropogenic emissions to build up. A synthesis of air quality from the regional surface monitoring networks describes changes in ambient O-3 and PM2.5 during the event and contrasts them to baseline air quality estimates from the AURAMS chemical transport model without wildfire emissions. Overall, the smoke plume contributed significantly to the exceedances in O-3 and PM2.5 air quality standards and objectives that occurred at several communities in the region during the event. Peak enhancements in 8 h O-3 of 34-44 ppbv and 24 h PM2.5 of 10-32 mu g m(-3) were attributed to the effects of the smoke plume across the Interior of British Columbia and at the Whistler Peak High Elevation Site. Lesser enhancements of 10-12 ppbv for 8 h O-3 and of 4-9 mu g m(-3) for 24 h PM2.5 occurred across coastal British Columbia and Washington State. The findings suggest that the large air quality impacts seen during this event were a combination of the efficient transport of the plume across the Pacific, favourable entrainment conditions across the BC interior, and the large scale of the Siberian wildfire emissions. A warming climate increases the risk of increased wildfire activity and events of this scale reoccurring under appropriate meteorological conditions.

TI  - Discharge estimation under uncertainty using variational methods with application to the full Saint-Venant hydraulic network model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN FLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating river discharge from in situ and/or remote sensing data is a key issue for evaluation of water balance at local and global scales and for water management. Variational data assimilation (DA) is a powerful approach used in operational weather and ocean forecasting, which can also be used in this context. A distinctive feature of the river discharge estimation problem is the likely presence of significant uncertainty in principal parameters of a hydraulic model, such as bathymetry and friction, which have to be included into the control vector alongside the discharge. However, the conventional variational DA method being used for solving such extended problems often fails. This happens because the control vector iterates (i.e., approximations arising in the course of minimization) result into hydraulic states not supported by the model. In this paper, we suggest a novel version of the variational DA method specially designed for solving estimation-under-uncertainty problems, which is based on the ideas of iterative regularization.The method is implemented with SIC2, which is a full Saint-Venant based 1D-network model. The SIC2 software is widely used by research, consultant and industrial communities for modeling river, irrigation canal, and drainage network behavior. The adjoint model required for variational DA is obtained by means of automatic differentiation. This is likely to be the first stable consistent adjoint of the 1D-network model of a commercial status in existence.The DA problems considered in this paper are offtake/tributary estimation under uncertainty in the cross-device parameters and inflow discharge estimation under uncertainty in the bathymetry defining parameters and the friction coefficient. Numerical tests have been designed to understand identifiability of discharge given uncertainty in bathymetry and friction. The developed methodology, and software seems useful in the context of the future Surface Water and Ocean Topography satellite mission. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Atmospheric correction for retrieving ground brightness temperature at commonly-used passive microwave frequencies
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - An analysis of the atmospheric impact on ground brightness temperature (T-g) is performed for numerous land surface types at commonly-used frequencies (i.e., 1.4 GHz, 6.93 GHz, 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz, 23.8 GHz, 36.5 GHz and 89.0 GHz). The results indicate that the atmosphere has a negligible impact on Tg at 1.4 GHz for land surfaces with emissivities greater than 0.7, at 6.93 GHz for land surfaces with emissivities greater than 0.8, and at 10.65 GHz for land surfaces with emissivities greater than 0.9 if a root mean square error (RMSE) less than 1 K is desired. To remove the atmospheric effect on T-g, a generalized atmospheric correction method is proposed by parameterizing the atmospheric transmittance tau and upwelling atmospheric brightness temperature T-ba up arrow. Better accuracies with T-g RMSEs less than 1 K are achieved at 1.4 GHz, 6.93 GHz, 10.65 GHz, 18.7 GHz and 36.5 GHz, and worse accuracies with RMSEs of 1.34 K and 4.35 K are obtained at 23.8 GHz and 89.0 GHz, respectively. Additionally, a simplified atmospheric correction method is developed when lacking sufficient input data to perform the generalized atmospheric correction method, and an emissivity-based atmospheric correction method is presented when the emissivity is known. Consequently, an appropriate atmospheric correction method can be selected based on the available data, frequency and required accuracy. Furthermore, this study provides a method to estimate tau and T-ba up arrow of different frequencies using the atmospheric parameters (total water vapor content in observation direction L-wv, total cloud liquid water content L-clw and mean temperature of cloud T-clw), which is important for simultaneously determining the land surface parameters using multi-frequency passive microwave satellite data.

TI  - Regional surface soil heat flux estimate from multiple remote sensing data in a temperate and semiarid basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional surface soil heat flux (G(0)) estimation is very important for the large-scale land surface process modeling. However, most of the regional G(0) estimation methods are based on the empirical relationship between G(0) and the net radiation flux. A physical model based on harmonic analysis was improved (referred to as "HM model") and applied over the Heihe River Basin northwest China with multiple remote sensing data, e.g., FY-2C, AMSR-E, and MODIS, and soil map data. The sensitivity analysis of the model was studied as well. The results show that the improved model describes the variation of G(0) well. Land surface temperature (LST) and thermal inertia (Gamma) are the two key input variables to the HM model. Compared with in situ G(0), there are some differences, mainly due to the differences between remote-sensed LST and the in situ LST. The sensitivity analysis shows that the errors from -7 to -0.5 K in LSTamplitude and from -300 to 300 Jm(-2) K-1 s(-0.5) in Gamma will cause about 20% errors, which are acceptable for G(0) estimation.

TI  - Daily Landsat-scale evapotranspiration estimation over a forested landscape in North Carolina, USA, using multi-satellite data fusion
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - As a primary flux in the global water cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) connects hydrologic and biological processes and is directly affected by water and land management, land use change and climate variability. Satellite remote sensing provides an effective means for diagnosing ET patterns over heterogeneous landscapes; however, limitations on the spatial and temporal resolution of satellite data, combined with the effects of cloud contamination, constrain the amount of detail that a single satellite can provide. In this study, we describe an application of a multi-sensor ET data fusion system over a mixed forested/agricultural landscape in North Carolina, USA, during the growing season of 2013. The fusion system ingests ET estimates from the Two-Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) applied to thermal infrared remote sensing retrievals of land surface temperature from multiple satellite platforms: hourly geostationary satellite data at 4 km resolution, daily 1 km imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and biweekly Landsat thermal data sharpened to 30 m. These multiple ET data streams are combined using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) to estimate daily ET at 30m resolution to investigate seasonal water use behavior at the level of individual forest stands and land cover patches. A new method, also exploiting the STARFM algorithm, is used to fill gaps in the Land-sat ET retrievals due to cloud cover and/or the scan-line corrector (SLC) failure on Landsat 7. The retrieved daily ET time series agree well with observations at two AmeriFlux eddy covariance flux tower sites in a managed pine plantation within the modeling domain: US-NC2 located in a mid-rotation (20-year-old) loblolly pine stand and US-NC3 located in a recently clear-cut and replanted field site. Root mean square errors (RMSEs) for NC2 and NC3 were 0.99 and 1.02 mm day(-1), respectively, with mean absolute errors of approximately 29% at the daily time step, 12% at the monthly time step and 0.7% over the full study period at the two flux tower sites. Analyses of water use patterns over the plantation indicate increasing seasonal ET with stand age for young to mid-rotation stands up to 20 years, but little dependence on age for older stands. An accounting of consumptive water use by major land cover classes representative of the modeling domain is presented, as well as relative partitioning of ET between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) components obtained with the TSEB. The study provides new insights about the effects of management and land use change on water yield over forested landscapes.

TI  - Video monitoring of brown planthopper predation in rice shows flaws of sentinel methods
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Immobilized preys are routinely used in agro-ecological exposure studies to quantify predation of pests under field conditions, but this method has not been validated. Our purpose was to determine the validity of using immobilized adults of the major rice pest Nilaparvata lugens, brown plant hopper (BPH), as sentinels. We used direct observation by video recording to determine the causal agents of removal of field exposed BPH sentinels with two experiments: 1) we recorded removal events of dead, immobilized BPH; and 2) we compared removal of (i) dead, immobilized BPH, (ii) live, immobilized BPH, and (iii) live, mobile BPH. Long-horned grasshoppers were responsible for most removals of dead, immobilized BPH, in both experiments. Predatory ground beetles removed most of the live, immobilized BPH, whereas frogs were the major predators of live, mobile BPH. Overall, we showed that removal of immobilized sentinel prey is not representative for predation of live, mobile prey, stressing the need for a critical assessment of commonly used sentinel methods. In addition, we found that frogs played the major role in predation of BPH in rice. As current strategies to enhance biocontrol of planthoppers in rice focus on arthropod natural enemies, this finding could have major implications.

TI  - Deep convective cloud characterizations from both broadband imager and hyperspectral infrared soundermeasurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convective storms have contributed to airplane accidents, making them a threat to aviation safety. The most common method to identify deep convective clouds (DCCs) is using the brightness temperature difference (BTD) between the atmospheric infrared (IR) window band and the water vapor (WV) absorption band. The effectiveness of the BTD method for DCC detection is highly related to the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the WV band. In order to understand the sensitivity of BTD to spectral resolution and SNR for DCC detection, a BTD to noise ratio method using the difference between the WV and IR window radiances is developed to assess the uncertainty of DCC identification for different instruments. We examined the case of AirAsia Flight QZ8501. The brightness temperatures (Tbs) over DCCs from this case are simulated for BTD sensitivity studies by a fast forward radiative transfer model with an opaque cloud assumption for both broadband imager (e. g., Multifunction Transport Satellite imager, MTSAT-2 imager) and hyperspectral IR sounder (e. g., Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) instruments; we also examined the relationship between the simulated Tb and the cloud top height. Results show that despite the coarser spatial resolution, BTDs measured by a hyperspectral IR sounder are much more sensitive to high cloud tops than broadband BTDs. As demonstrated in this study, a hyperspectral IR sounder can identify DCCs with better accuracy.

AB  - The 2016/17 mid-season vaccine effectiveness estimate against influenza A(H3N2) was 15% (95% confidence interval: -11 to 35) in Navarre. Comparing to individuals unvaccinated in the current and four prior seasons, effectiveness was 24% for current and 3-4 prior doses, 61% for current and 1-2 prior doses, 42% for only current vaccination, and 58% for 3-4 prior doses. This suggests moderate effectiveness for different combinations of vaccination in the current and prior seasons.During the early 2016/17 influenza season, influenza A(H3N2) was the main circulating virus in Europe [1]. Although most of the A(H3N2) viruses characterised genetically matched the vaccine component, a high incidence of severe cases was detected [1,2]. We present the 2016/17 mid-season vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H3N2), relative to different combinations of current and prior seasonal influenza vaccinations.

TI  - Multiday evolution of convective bursts during western North Pacific tropical cyclone development and nondevelopment using geostationary satellite measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclones (TCs) develop through latent heating from a series of deep convection. To investigate the evolution of diurnal convective burst (CB) activities prior to TC formation, we analyzed 463 tropical disturbances that developed (80) or not developed (383) into TCs over the western North Pacific during the 2007-2009 period. Geostationary satellite data allowed defining deep convection where infrared (IR) brightness temperature is lower than that of water vapor (WV). Diurnal expansions from time series of IR minusWV< 0 areas near disturbance vortex centers for 5 days are defined as CB events. Combined analysis with the Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis shows that the multiday convective-environmental evolution for TC formation is entirely different from nonformation processes in terms of the occurrence of two consecutive diurnal CB events. Multiday CBs (mCB) are observed in 67.5% of the 80 TC formation cases and in 13.8% of the 383 nonformation cases. Intensities of the middle-to-low tropospheric relative vorticity of these two groups are comparable on 4 to 5 days prior to TC formation. However, vorticity intensification is weak for nondeveloping disturbances in environments of strong vertical wind shear; these disturbances eventually decay. The vorticity of developing disturbances continuously intensifies to TC strengths. The remaining 32.5% of the TC cases without mCB show weaker initial vorticity, but rapid intensification over 3 day periods before TC formation. The present results reveal that mCB is a common feature in pre-TC stages, and large-scale environments of weak vertical wind shear are critical for the formation of TC-strength circulations.

TI  - Cloud and Sun-glint statistics derived from GOES and MODIS observations over the Intra-Americas Sea for GEO-CAPE mission planning
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of cloud cover, frequency, and duration is not only important to study cloud dynamics, but also critical in determiningwhenand where to take ocean measurements from geostationary orbits such as the Geostationary Coastal and Air Pollution Events (GEO-CAPE) mission due to the challenges in achieving complete hemispheric coverage of coastal oceans, estuaries, and inland waters at hourly frequency. Using GOES hourly measurements at 4 km nadir resolution between 2006 and 2011, the number of cloud-free hourly observations per day (N-cf) for solar zenith angle theta(o) < 80 degrees was estimated for each 0.1 degrees location of the Intra-Americas Sea. The number of Sun-glint-affected hourly observations per day (N-sg) was also calculated based on the planned GEO-CAPE observation geometry and realistic wind speed. High-latitude and equatorial oceans showed the lowest N-cf (< 2.4) in all climatological months, and highest N-cf was observed in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) and Caribbean (> 4.5). Different regions showed differences in seasonality of cloud-free conditions and also showed differences in the hour of a day at which the satellite observations would have the maximal cloud-free and glint-free probability (T-max). Cloud cover from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km measurements are > 10% higher than those from the MODIS 250m measurements, supporting ocean color missions at subkilometer resolutions to enhance both spatial coverage and temporal frequency. These findings provide valuable information for GEO-CAPE mission planning to maximize its science value through minimizing the impacts of clouds and Sun glint.

TI  - SoilGrids250m: Global gridded soil information based on machine learning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods D random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression D as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10 -fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56% (coarse fragments) and 83% (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61%. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230%. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.

TI  - The magic of money and the illusion of biofuels: toward an interdisciplinary understanding of technology
T2  - EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - For several centuries, the dominant worldview in industrial societies has held that various problems -such as those recently identified as relating to sustainability-can be solved through technological progress. Technological progress has been conceived as the fruits of engineering science, new knowledge, and innovation. While knowledge of the principles of physics is certainly a necessary condition for technological development, it is not a sufficient condition. Technology is not only a product of engineering, but, ultimately, also of asymmetric transfers of biophysical resources. In other words, the feasibility of technological progress is contingent on world market prices. The history of technology has been written from the perspective of advancing ingenuity, rather than that of unequal global exchange. The implicit world view underlying dominant historiography and economic science ignores the deepening global inequalities which are prerequisite to what some sectors of world society can celebrate as technological progress, including visions of replacing fossil fuels with biofuels and other renewable energy sources. This observation should prompt us to conceptualize technological progress as an inherently unequal capacity to locally save time and space at the expense of human time and natural space lost elsewhere. It implies that the physical agency of technology ultimately rests on prices, i.e. subjective human conceptions about the value of market commodities, and thus finally on the magical artifact we know as money. The purpose of this article is to show how current deliberations on biofuels illustrate the insufficiencies of mainstream understandings of the phenomenon of technology, and to indicate why an adequate understanding of technology must be interdisciplinary, combining insights on both Nature and Society.

AB  - We measured early 2016/17 season influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) in Europe using multicentre case control studies at primary care and hospital levels. IVE at primary care level was 44.1%, 46.9% and 23.4% among 0-14, 15-64 and >= 65 year-olds, and 25.7% in the influenza vaccination target group. At hospital level, IVE was 2.5%, 7.9% and 2.4% among >= 65, 65-79 and >= 80 year-olds. As in previous seasons, we observed suboptimal IVE against influenza A(H3N2).

TI  - The global aerosol-cloud first indirect effect estimated using MODIS, MERRA, and AeroCom
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) represent a significant source of forcing uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs). Estimates of radiative forcing due to ACI in Fifth Assessment Report range from -0.5 to -2.5 W m(-2). A portion of this uncertainty is related to the first indirect, or Twomey, effect whereby aerosols act as nuclei for cloud droplets to condense upon. At constant liquid water content this increases the number of cloud droplets (Nd) and thus increases the cloud albedo. In this study we use remote-sensing estimates of Nd within stratocumulus regions in combination with state-of-the-art aerosol reanalysis from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA2) to diagnose how aerosols affect Nd. As in previous studies, Nd is related to sulfate mass through a power law relationship. The slope of the log-log relationship between Nd and SO4 in maritime stratocumulus is found to be 0.31, which is similar to the range of 0.2-0.8 from previous in situ studies and remote-sensing studies in the pristine Southern Ocean. Using preindustrial emissions models, the change in Nd between preindustrial and present day is estimated. Nd is inferred to have more than tripled in some regions. Cloud properties from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are used to estimate the radiative forcing due to this change in Nd. The Twomey effect operating in isolation is estimated to create a radiative forcing of -0.97 +/- 0.23 W m(-2) relative to the preindustrial era.

TI  - A photosynthesis-based two-leaf canopy stomatal conductance model for meteorology and air quality modeling with WRF/CMAQ PX LSM
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model with single-layer sunlit and shaded leaf canopy scaling is implemented and evaluated in a diagnostic box model with the Pleim-Xiu land surface model (PX LSM) and ozone deposition model components taken directly from the meteorology and air quality modeling system-WRF/CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecast model and Community Multiscale Air Quality model). The photosynthesis-based model for PX LSM (PX PSN) is evaluated at a FLUXNET site for implementation against different parameterizations and the current PX LSM approach with a simple Jarvis function (PX Jarvis). Latent heat flux (LH) from PX PSN is further evaluated at five FLUXNET sites with different vegetation types and landscape characteristics. Simulated ozone deposition and flux from PX PSN are evaluated at one of the sites with ozone flux measurements. Overall, the PX PSN simulates LH as well as the PX Jarvis approach. The PX PSN, however, shows distinct advantages over the PX Jarvis approach for grassland that likely result from its treatment of C-3 and C-4 plants for CO2 assimilation. Simulations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI) rather than LAI measured at each site assess how the model would perform with grid averaged data used in WRF/CMAQ. MODIS LAI estimates degrade model performance at all sites but one site having exceptionally old and tall trees. Ozone deposition velocity and ozone flux along with LH are simulated especially well by the PX PSN compared to significant overestimation by the PX Jarvis for a grassland site.

TI  - Frontal destabilization of Stonebreen, Edgeoya, Svalbard
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In consideration of the strong atmospheric warming that has been observed since the 1990s in polar regions there is a need to quantify mass loss of Arctic ice caps and glaciers and their contribution to sea level rise. In polar regions a large part of glacier ablation is through calving of tidewater glaciers driven by ice velocities and their variations. The Svalbard region is characterized by glaciers with rapid dynamic fluctuations of different types, including irreversible adjustments of calving fronts to a changing mass balance and reversible, surge-type activities. For large areas, however, we do not have much past and current information on glacier dynamic fluctuations. Recently, through frequent monitoring based on repeat optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data, a number of zones of velocity increases have been observed at formerly slow-flowing calving fronts on Svalbard. Here we present the dynamic evolution of the southern lobe of Stonebreen on Edgeoya. We observe a slowly steady retreat of the glacier front from 1971 until 2011, followed by a strong increase in ice surface velocity along with a decrease of volume and frontal extension since 2012. The considerable losses in ice thickness could have made the tide-water calving glacier, which is grounded below sea level some 6 km inland from the 2014 front, more sensitive to surface meltwater reaching its bed and/or warm ocean water increasing frontal ablation with subsequent strong multi-annual ice-flow acceleration.

TI  - Observational evidence against strongly stabilizing tropical cloud feedbacks
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a method to attribute cloud radiative feedbacks to convective processes, using subcloud layer buoyancy as a diagnostic of stable and deep convective regimes. Applying this approach to tropical remote sensing measurements over years 2000-2016 shows that an inferred negative short-term cloud feedback from deep convection was nearly offset by a positive cloud feedback from stable regimes. The net cloud feedback was within statistical uncertainty of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with historical forcings, with discrepancies in the partitioning of the cloud feedback into convective regimes. Compensation between high-cloud responses to tropics-wide warming in stable and unstable regimes resulted in smaller net changes in high-cloud fraction with warming. In addition, deep convection and associated high clouds set in at warmer temperatures in response to warming, as a consequence of nearly invariant subcloud buoyancy. This invariance further constrained the magnitude of cloud radiative feedbacks and is consistent with climate model projections.

TI  - Generation of real-time mode high-resolution water vapor fields from GPS observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Pointwise GPS measurements of tropospheric zenith total delay can be interpolated to provide high-resolution water vapor maps which may be used for correcting synthetic aperture radar images, for numeral weather prediction, and for correcting Network Real-time Kinematic GPS observations. Several previous studies have addressed the importance of the elevation dependency of water vapor, but it is often a challenge to separate elevation-dependent tropospheric delays from turbulent components. In this paper, we present an iterative tropospheric decomposition interpolation model that decouples the elevation and turbulent tropospheric delay components. For a 150 km x 150 km California study region, we estimate real-time mode zenith total delays at 41 GPS stations over 1 year by using the precise point positioning technique and demonstrate that the decoupled interpolation model generates improved high-resolution tropospheric delay maps compared with previous tropospheric turbulence-and elevation-dependent models. Cross validation of the GPS zenith total delays yields an RMS error of 4.6mm with the decoupled interpolation model, compared with 8.4mm with the previous model. On converting the GPS zenith wet delays to precipitable water vapor and interpolating to 1 km grid cells across the region, validations with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer near-IR water vapor product show 1.7mm RMS differences by using the decoupled model, compared with 2.0mm for the previous interpolation model. Such results are obtained without differencing the tropospheric delays or water vapor estimates in time or space, while the errors are similar over flat and mountainous terrains, as well as for both inland and coastal areas.

TI  - Alloimmunization in Patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Thalassemia: Experience of a Single Centre in Oman
T2  - MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Blood transfusion is an integral part of the supportive care for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and thalassaemia. The hazard of red cell alloimmunization, however, is one of the main complications of this therapy.Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of red cell alloimmunization in Omani patients with sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia.Methods: This study included 262 patients whose historical transfusion records were available. One hundred and twenty-nine patients with thalassaemia who were attending the day care unit for regular transfusions, and 133 SCD patients admitted at our hospital were included in this study. The Diamed r gel system was used for the screening and identification of atypical antibodies.Results: The rate of alloimmunization in SCD patients was 31.6% (n=42, 95% CI, 24.87-40.66), whereas in patients with thalassaemia it was 20% (n=26; 95% CI, 13.9-27.6). Antibodies to E, e, C, c, D, K, S, Fy(a), Kp(a), Jk(a) and C-w were observed; 85% of the patients were also immunised with Rh and Kell antigens. Considering the two groups together, 8 developed nonspecific antibodies and 12 developed more than one antibody.Conclusions: Red cell transfusions were associated with a significant risk of alloimmunization. It is, therefore, imperative to perform an initial extended red cell phenotyping for both donors and recipients, and carefully select ABO, Rh and Kell matched donors. The higher incidence of alloimmunization in SCD patients is related to the inherent SCD-specific inflammatory state.

T2  - BIOSENSORS & BIOELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 26th Anniversary World Congress on Biosensors (Biosensors)
CL  - Gothenburg, SWEDEN
AB  - An integrated device for real-time monitoring of glucose and phenols absorption, that consists of a sensors/biosensors system (SB) and a Caco-2TC7 human intestinal cell culture, is described in this study. The SB is composed of a glucose oxidase-based biosensor, a sentinel platinum sensor, a laccase/tyrosinase-based biosensor and a sentinel carbon sensor, all located in the basolateral compartment (BC) of a cell culture plate. Caco-2TC7 cells, differentiated on culture inserts, separated the apical compartment that simulates the intestinal lumen, from the BC which represented the bloodstream. The system recorded currents relative to glucose (1 mM) absorption, obtaining bioavailability values (5.1%) comparable to HPLC analysis (4.8%). Phloridzin and phloretin, specific phenolic inhibitors of SGLT1 and GLUT2 glucose transporters, reduced the glucose transport of almost 10 times. They were minimally absorbed in the BC with a bioavailability of 0.13% and 0.49% respectively. The hypoglycemic potential of blueberry and pomegranate juices was also studied. In particular, the amount of glucose absorbed through the Caco-2TC7 monolayer was 8 parts per thousand for pomegranate and 1.7 parts per thousand for blueberry, demonstrating the potential hypoglycemic effect of the juices. Polyphenols absorption was also monitored by the SB and an increase was recorded during the first 50 min in presence of both blueberry and pomegranate juices, then a constant decrease occurred. The proposed device has been developed as innovative tool for the dynamic monitoring of natural compounds effects on glucose absorption, in order to manage postprandial hyperglycemia.

M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need for understanding the timing of wood formation in relation to the dynamics of bud phenology at wide geographical scale. This study analysed the relationships between long-term chronologies of xylem growth and the timing of plant phenology detected by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in five permanent stands across the latitudinal distribution of black spruce [Picea mariana (Mill.) BPS] in the boreal forest of Quebec, Canada. Xylogenesis was studied weekly from April to October for thirteen years (2002-2014) on anatomical sections derived by wood microcores. The timing of the growing season detected by remote sensing was extracted from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m 16-days NDVI data. The NDVI time-series were fitted using a double logistic curve. Phenological chronologies from remote sensing and xylem phenology showed a latitudinal trend. The models correlating the data inferred from satellite sensors and the spring observations of xylem phenology were significant (p < 0.0001). The length of NDVI growing season and the duration of xylogenesis showed a close correlation. This study demonstrated that the timing of xylem formation could be suitably estimated at wide geographical scale using remote sensing data. However, the inter annual phenological variability remained unexplained, which might limit the application of the models only to the years considered by our chronologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A comparison of two adaptive multivariate analysis methods (PLSR and ANN) for winter wheat yield forecasting using Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An assumption that the non-linear method is more reasonable than the linear method when canopy reflectance is used to establish the yield prediction model was proposed and tested in this study. For this purpose, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural networks (ANN), represented linear and non-linear analysis method, were applied and compared for wheat yield prediction. Multi-period Landsat-8 OLT images were collected at two different wheat growth stages, and a field campaign was conducted to obtain grain yields at selected sampling sites in 2014. The field data were divided into a calibration database and a testing database. Using calibration data, a cross-validation concept was introduced for the PLSR and ANN model construction to prevent over-fitting. All models were tested using the test data. The ANN yield-prediction model produced R-2, RMSE and RMSE% values of 0.61, 979 kg ha(-1), and 10.38%, respectively, in the testing phase, performing better than the PLSR yield-prediction model, which produced R-2, RMSE, and RMSE% values of 0.39, 1211 kg ha(-1), and 12.84%, respectively. Non-linear method was suggested as a better method for yield prediction. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Surface deformation associated with the 2015 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 8.3 Illapel earthquake revealed by satellite-based geodetic observations and its implications for the seismic cycle
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present inter-, co- and post-seismic displacements observed in the 2015 Illapel earthquake area by Global Positioning System (GPS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR). RADARSAT-2, ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1A interferograms capture the co- and post-seismic displacements due to the Illapel earthquake. Based on a layered Earth structure, we modeled both co- and post seismic faulting behaviors on the subduction interface of central Chile. The best-fit model shows that the coseismic rupture broke a 200 km x 200 km area with a maximum slip of 10 m at a depth of 20 km. Two distinct slip centers, likely controlled by local ramp-flat structure, are revealed. The total coseismic geodetic moment is 2.76 x 10(21) N m, equivalent to a moment magnitude 8.3. The accumulated afterslip in the first two months after the mainshock is observed on both sides of the coseismic rupture zone with both ascending and descending Sentinel-1A interferograms. A limited overlap zone between co- and post-seismic slip models can be observed, suggesting partitioning of the frictional properties within the Illapel earthquake rupture zone. The total afterslip releases similar to 5.0 x 10(20) N m geodetic moment, which is equivalent to an earthquake of M-w 7.7. The 2010 M-w 8.8 Maule earthquake that occurred similar to 400 km away from the Illapel earthquake epicenter could have exerted certain effects on the seismic cycle of the Illapel earthquake area. The seismic records from 2000 to 2015 imply that the rate of annual seismic moment release in the Illapel earthquake area dropped from 0.4 to 0.2 x 10(19) Nm/yr after the Maule earthquake. Based on the forward modeling with the best-fit slip models determined in this study, we reproduce the local surface displacements before, during and after the Illapel earthquake. A rough deformation cycle, 105 +/- 29 yr, calculated by using the coseismic displacements and interseismic rate is basically identical with the revisit interval of M8 events in the adjacent areas of the Illapel earthquake, suggesting that elastic rebound theory is applicable for the long-term prediction in this region.

TI  - Satellite detection of wastewater diversion plumes in Southern California
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor satellite observations proved useful in detecting surfacing wastewater plumes during the 2006 Hyperion Treatment Plant (HTP) and 2012 Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) wastewater diversion events in Southern California. Satellite sensors were capable of detecting biophysical signatures associated with the wastewater, compared to ambient ocean waters, enabling monitoring of environmental impacts over a greater spatial extent than in situ sampling alone. Thermal satellite sensors measured decreased sea surface temperatures (SSTs) associated with the surfacing plumes. Ocean color satellite sensors did not measure a distinguishable biological response in terms of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations during the short lived, three-day long, 2006 HTP diversion. A period of decreased chl-a concentration was observed during the three-week long 2012 OCSD diversion, likely in association with enhanced chlorination of the discharged wastewater that suppressed the phytoplankton response and/or significant uptake by heterotrophic bacteria. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data were able to identify and track the 2006 HTP wastewater plume through changes in surface roughness related to the oily components of the treated surfacing wastewater. Overall, it was found that chl-a and SST values must have differences of at least 1 mg m(-3) and 0.5 degrees C, respectively, in comparison with adjacent waters for wastewater plumes and their biophysical impact to be detectable from satellite. For a wastewater plume to be identifiable in SAR imagery, wind speeds must range between similar to 3 and 8 m s(-1). The findings of this study illustrate the benefit of utilizing multiple satellite sensors to monitor the rapidly changing environmental response to surfacing wastewater plumes, and can help inform future wastewater diversions in coastal areas.

TI  - Arthropod communities and biological control in soybean fields: Forest cover at landscape scale is more influential than forest proximity
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural habitats surrounding annual crops influence biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem services within the cultivated habitats. Soybean, an important crop worldwide and the main crop in Argentina, is affected by several pest species, including stink-bugs that damage soybean pods. Here, we studied the effects of Chaco Serrano forests on arthropod herbivores and natural enemies and on biologital control of stink bugs on soybean, at landscape (forest cover) and local (forest proximity) scales. We sampled arthropods on soybean plants by using the beating-sheet method, on nine landscapes (with low and high forest cover) and at 5, 25, 50 and 100 m from the forest, during soybean flowering and pod-filling stages. Biological control of stink bug eggs was assessed via sentinel-egg experiments in soybean and forest habitats. We found that landscapes with high forest cover presented higher richness and abundance of natural enemies and higher levels of biological control on stink bug eggs (both in the cropland and in the forest), while a similar trend for herbivores was restricted to soybean flowering stage. Community composition of both functional groups was also affected by forest cover and crop phenological stage. Forest proximity had more limited effects: natural enemies showed more species and individuals at 5 m from the forest than at larger distances and, conversely, stink bug abundance was lower at the closest distance to the forest. We conclude than forest amount at landscape scale is more influential for arthropod biodiversity and biological control in soybean than forest proximity. Moreover, our results suggest that maintaining remnants of forest in agricultural landscapes can be effective for conservation of arthropod biodiversity while contributing to biological control of stink bugs in soybean fields.

TI  - Effects of ambient temperature on stroke hospital admissions: Results from a time-series analysis of 104,432 strokes in Guangzhou, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Stroke is a main cause of death and public health burden in China. The evidence on the burden of different strokes attack attribute to ambient temperature in China is limited. This study aimed to show the characteristics of stroke attack and the attributable risk due to temperature based on hospital admission data in Guangzhou, one of the most developed cities in China.Material and methods: From January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015, 104,432 stroke hospitalizations in Guangzhou residents from 67 hospitals for stroke sentinel surveillance were registered. Characteristics of hospital admissions by gender, age group, calendar year and stroke subtype were analyzed, and distributed lag non-linear models were applied to evaluate the effects of temperature on stroke attack admissions.Results: Stroke attack admissions increased from 31,851 to 36,755 through 2013 to 2015, increasing by 15.4%. An increasing trend in the risk of stroke attack with age was observed, irrespectively of stroke subtype and calendar year. People with hypertension were more likely to have an associated stroke than people without that. The effects of cold temperature on attack admissions for CBI and ICH strokes were significant. Overall, the percentages of CBI and ICH attack admissions attribute to cold temperature were 9.06% (95% CI: 1.84,15.00) and 15.09% (95% CI: 5.86, 21.96), respectively. Besides, elderly people were more vulnerable to cold temperature than the young.Conclusions: Measures should be taken to increase public awareness about the ill effects of cold temperature on stroke attack, and educate the public about self-protection.

TI  - A complete glacier inventory of the Antarctic Peninsula based on Landsat 7 images from 2000 to 2002 and other preexisting data sets
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) potentially make a large contribution to sea level rise. However, this contribution has been difficult to estimate since no complete glacier inventory (outlines, attributes, separation from the ice sheet) is available. This work fills the gap and presents a new glacier inventory of the AP north of 70 degrees S, based on digitally combining preexisting data sets with geographic information system (GIS) techniques. Rock outcrops have been removed from the glacier basin outlines of Cook et al. (2014) by intersection with the latest layer of the Antarctic Digital Database (Burton-Johnson et al., 2016). Glacier-specific topographic parameters (e.g., mean elevation, slope and aspect) as well as hypsometry have been calculated from the DEM of Cook et al. (2012). We also assigned connectivity levels to all glaciers following the concept by Rastner et al. (2012). Moreover, the bedrock data set of Huss and Farinotti (2014) enabled us to add ice thickness and volume for each glacier.The new inventory is available from the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) database (doi: 10.7265/N5V98602) and consists of 1589 glaciers covering an area of 95 273 km(2), slightly more than the 89 720 km(2) covered by glaciers surrounding the Greenland Ice Sheet. Hence, compared to the preexisting data set of Cook et al. (2014), this data set covers a smaller area and one glacier less due to the intersection with the rock outcrop data set. The total estimated ice volume is 34 590 km3, of which one-third is below sea level. The hypsometric curve has a bimodal shape due to the unique topography of the AP, which consists mainly of ice caps with outlet glaciers. Most of the glacierized area is located at 200-500ma. s.l., with a secondary maximum at 1500-1900 m. Approximately 63% of the area is drained by marine-terminating glaciers, and ice-shelf tributary glaciers cover 35% of the area. This combination indicates a high sensitivity of the glaciers to climate change for several reasons: (1) only slightly rising equilibrium-line altitudes would expose huge additional areas to ablation, (2) rising ocean temperatures increase melting of marine terminating glaciers, and (3) ice shelves have a buttressing effect on their feeding glaciers and their collapse would alter glacier dynamics and strongly enhance ice loss (Rott et al., 2011). The new inventory should facilitate modeling of the related effects using approaches tailored to glaciers for a more accurate determination of their future evolution and contribution to sea level rise.

TI  - Fine-scale spatial and seasonal rangeland use by cattle in a foot-and-mouth disease control zones
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overgrazing of ranglands and foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are persistent problems in the communal lands bordering the Kruger National Park (KNP) and the adjacent private game reserves in South Africa. Improved livestock management is needed to address these problems, and detailed understanding of cattle ranging behaviour in the FMD control zones is central to improving livestock management. We used environmental data on seasonal variation in forage quality (nitrogen content) and quantity (biomass) derived from high resolution satellite imagery, coupled with cattle GPS locations, to develop a resource utilization function of cattle space use patterns and predicted spatial patterns of their probability of occurrence in the wet and dry seasons. We calculated cattle resource utilization distributions and delineated home ranges of cattle from six villages by applying utilization kernels using the plug-in method as a bandwidth estimator. The overlap between seasonal home ranges was 61% and between core areas 49%, indicating seasonal selectivity mainly within the home ranges. Cattle selected forage with higher quantity and quality during the dry season but behaved like bulk grazers in the wet season. Furthermore, we found that herds in the dry season usually have smaller home ranges and stay closer to water sources and villages than in the wet season. Our prediction maps highlight seasonal differences in probability of cattle occurrence, with implications for rangelands management strategies to minimalize overgrazing and FMD transmission.

TI  - Improved modeling of gross primary production from a better representation of photosynthetic components in vegetation canopy
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-photosynthetic components within the canopy (e.g., dry leaves and stem) contribute little to photosynthesis and therefore, remote sensing of gross primary production (GPP) could be improved by the removal of these components. A scaled enhanced vegetation index (EVI), which is usually regarded as a linear function of EVI, was found to have the strongest relationship with chlorophyll level fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPARchI) and can help improve GPP estimation in croplands compared to canopy level FPAR (FPARcanopy). However, the application of the FPARchI theory to other plant functional types (PFTs) and the underlying reasons remain largely unknown. In this study, based on standard MODIS algorithm we comprehensively assessed the performances of FPARcanopy, scaled EVI (FPARch11), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), scaled NDVI (FPARch12) and EVI as proxies of FPAR for estimating GPP at four forest and six non-forest sites (e.g., grasslands, croplands and wetlands) from ChinaFLUX, representing a wide range of ecosystems with different canopy structures and eco-climatic zones. Our results showed that the scaled EVI (FPARch11) as FPAR effectively improved the accuracy of estimated GPP for the entire PFTs. FPARch11 substantially improved forest GPP estimations with higher coefficient of determination (R2), lower root mean square error (RMSE) and lower bias. In comparison, for non-forest PFTs, the improvement in R2 between estimated GPP based on FPARchl1 (GPPchl1) and flux tower GPP was less evident than those between flux GPP and GPP estimations from FPARcanopy (GPPcanopy), FPARchl2, NDVI and EVI. The temperature and water attenuation scalars played important roles in reducing the difference of various GPP and indirectly reducing the impact of different FPARs on GPP in non-forest PFTs. Even so, FPARchl1 is an ecologically more meaningful parameter since FPARchl1 and flux tower GPP dropped to zero more synchronously in both forest and non-forest sites. In particular, we found that the improvement of GPPchl1 relative to GPPcanopy was positively correlated with the maximum leaf area index (LAI), implying the importance of site characteristic in regulating the strength of the improvement. This is encouraging for remote sensing of GPP for which vegetation parameter retrieval has often been found to be less successful at high LAI due to saturations in reflective and scattering domains. Our results demonstrate the significance of accurate and ecologically meaningful FPAR parameterization for improving our current capability in GPP modeling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Daily estimation of ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations at 4 km resolution over Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei by fusing MODIS AOD and ground observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-borne Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) is widely used to estimate ground-level fine ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations to evaluate their health effects. The associated estimation accuracy is often reduced by AOD missing values and by insufficiently accounting for the spatio-temporal PM2.5 variations. In this study, we aim to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at a fine resolution with improved accuracy by fusing fine-scale satellite and ground observations in the populated and polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area of China in 2014. We employed a Bayesian-based statistical downscaler to model the spatio-temporal linear AOD-PM2.5 relationships. We used a 3 km MODIS AOD product, which was resampled to a 4 km resolution in a Lambert conic confortnal projection, to assist comparison and fusion with predictions by atmospheric chemistry models. A two-step method was used to fill the missing AOD values to obtain a full AOD dataset with complete spatial coverage. The downscaler has a good performance in the fitting procedure (R-2 = 0.75) and in the cross Validation procedure (R-2 = 0.58 by random method and R-2 = 0.47 by city-specific method). The number of missing AOD values Was serious and related to elevated PM2.5 concentrations. The gap-filled AOD values corresponded well with our understanding of PM2.5 pollution conditions in BTH. The prediction accuracy of PM2.5 concentrations were improved in terms of their annual and seasonal mean. As a result of its fine spatio-temporal resolution and complete spatial coverage, the daily PM2.5 estimation dataset could provide extensive and insightful benefits to related studies in the BTH area. This may include understanding the formation processes of regional PM2.5 pollution episodes, evaluating daily human exposure, and establishing pollution controlling measures.

TI  - Severity of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Lower Respiratory Tract Infection With Viral Coinfection in HIV-Uninfected Children
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Molecular diagnostics enable sensitive detection of respiratory viruses, but their clinical significance remains unclear in pediatric lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). We aimed to determine whether viral coinfections increased life-threatening disease in a large cohort.Methods. Molecular testing was performed for respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children aged < 5 years within 24 hours of hospital admission during sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalization conducted in South Africa during February 2009-December 2013. The primary outcome was life-threatening disease, defined as mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, or death.Results. Of 2322 HIV-uninfected children with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-associated LRTI, 1330 (57.3%) had RSV monoinfection, 38 (1.6%) had life-threatening disease, 575 (24.8%) had rhinovirus, 347 (14.9%) had adenovirus (ADV), and 30 (1.3%) had influenza virus. RSV and any other viral coinfection was not associated with severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], OR, 0.74; 95% CI,.39-1.4), ADV coinfection had increased odds of life-threatening disease (adjusted OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.6-7.2; P =.001), and influenza coinfection had increased odds of life-threatening disease and prolonged length of stay (adjusted OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0-4.5; P =.05) compared with RSV monoinfection.Conclusions. RSV coinfection with any respiratory virus is not associated with more severe disease when compared to RSV alone in this study. However, increased life-threatening disease in RSV-ADV and RSV-influenza coinfection warrants further study.

We aimed to describe the early and 12-month results after MitraClip device implantation regarding the 2 etiologies. From January 2011 to December 2012, the Transcatheter Valve Treatment Sentinel Pilot Registry included 452 patients with MR who underwent MitraClip procedure in 25 centers across Europe. The prevalent etiology was I-MR (235 patients, 52.0%). I-MR group had a significantly higher proportion of men (74.9 vs 59.9%, p <0.001) and surgical risk (logistic EuroSCORE 24.8 +/- 18.2 vs 18.8 +/- 16.3, p <0.001). Acute procedural success was high (96%) and similar between groups (p = 0.48). Patients with I-MR required a higher, albeit not significant, number of clips to reduce MR (p = 0.08). Inhospital mortality was low (2.0%) without significant differences between etiologies. The estimated 1-year mortality and rehospitalization rates were 15.0% and 25.8%, respectively, without significant differences between groups. Paired echocardiographic data showed a persistent improvement of MR at 1 year inboth etiologies. Despite a significant overall reverse atrial remodeling after clip, there were no significant changes in left ventricular volumes. In conclusion, this large independent cohort showed that percutaneous "edge-to-edge" therapy was associated with early- and long-term improvement of MR severity and functional condition both in patients with I-MR and nonischemic MR. There were no significant differences between the 2 etiologies regarding survival and freedom from rehospitalization due to heart failure at the 1-year follow-up. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Glider and remote sensing observations of the upper ocean response to an extended shallow coastal diversion of wastewater effluent
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orange County Sanitation District (OCSD) diverted wastewater discharge (5.3 x 10(8) I d(-1)) from its primary deep (56 m) outfall 8 km offshore, to a secondary shallower (16 m) outfall 1.6 km offshore for a period of three weeks. It was anticipated that the low salinity and density of the effluent would cause it to rise to the surface with limited dilution, elevating nutrient concentrations in near-surface waters and stimulating phytoplankton blooms in the region. Three Teledyne Webb Slocum gliders and a Liquid Robotics surface wave glider were deployed on transects near the outfalls to acquire high spatial and temporal coverage of physical and chemical parameters before, during, and after the wastewater diversion. Combined autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) and MODIS-Aqua satellite ocean color data indicated that phytoplankton biomass increased in the upper water column in response to the diversion, but that the magnitude of the response was spatially patchy and significantly less than expected. Little evidence of the plume or its effects was detectable 72 h following the diversion. The effluent plume exhibited high rates of dilution and mixed throughout the upper 20 m and occasionally throughout the upper 40 m during the diversion. Rapid plume advection and dilution appeared to contribute to the muted impact of the nutrient-rich effluent on the phytoplankton community in this coastal ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatio-temporal approach to moving window block kriging of satellite data v1.0
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous existing satellites observe physical or environmental properties of the Earth system. Many of these satellites provide global-scale observations, but these observations are often sparse and noisy. By contrast, contiguous, global maps are often most useful to the scientific community (i.e., Level 3 products). We develop a spatio-temporal moving window block kriging method to create contiguous maps from sparse and/or noisy satellite observations. This approach exhibits several advantages over existing methods: (1) it allows for flexibility in setting the spatial resolution of the Level 3 map, (2) it is applicable to observations with variable density, (3) it produces a rigorous uncertainty estimate, (4) it exploits both spatial and temporal correlations in the data, and (5) it facilitates estimation in real time. Moreover, this approach only requires the assumption that the observable quantity exhibits spatial and temporal correlations that are inferable from the data. We test this method by creating Level 3 products from satellite observations of CO2 (XCO2 ) from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite(GOSAT), CH4 (XCH4) from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). We evaluate and analyze the difference in performance of spatio-temporal vs. recently developed spatial kriging methods.

TI  - Remote sensing of plant trait responses to field-based plant-soil feedback using UAV-based optical sensors
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant responses to biotic and abiotic legacies left in soil by preceding plants is known as plant-soil feedback (PSF). PSF is an important mechanism to explain plant community dynamics and plant performance in natural and agricultural systems. However, most PSF studies are short term and small-scale due to practical constraints for field-scale quantification of PSF effects, yet field experiments are warranted to assess actual PSF effects under less controlled conditions. Here we used unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)based optical sensors to test whether PSF effects on plant traits can be quantified remotely. We established a randomized agro-ecological field experiment in which six different cover crop species and species combinations from three different plant families (Poaceae, Fabaceae, Brassicaceae) were grown. The feedback effects on plant traits were tested in oat (Avena sativa) by quantifying the cover crop legacy effects on key plant traits: height, fresh biomass, nitrogen content, and leaf chlorophyll content. Prior to destructive sampling, hyperspectral data were acquired and used for calibration and independent validation of regression models to retrieve plant traits from optical data. Subsequently, for each trait the model with highest precision and accuracy was selected. We used the hyperspectral analyses to predict the directly measured plant height (RMSE = 5.12 cm, R-2 = 0.79), chlorophyll content (RMSE = 0.11 gm(-2), R-2 = 0.80), N-content (RMSE = 1.94 gm(-2), R-2 = 0.68), and fresh biomass (RMSE = 0.72 kg m(-2), R-2 = 0.56). Overall the PSF effects of the different cover crop treatments based on the remote sensing data matched the results based on in situ measurements. The average oat canopy was tallest and its leaf chlorophyll content highest in response to legacy of Vicia sativa monocultures (100cm, 0.95 gm(-2), respectively) and in mixture with Raphanus sativus (100cm, 1.09 gm(-2), respectively), while the lowest values (76cm, 0.41 gm(-2), respectively) were found in response to legacy of Lolium perenne monoculture, and intermediate responses to the legacy of the other treatments. We show that PSF effects in the field occur and alter several important plant traits that can be sensed remotely and quantified in a non-destructive way using UAV-based optical sensors; these can be repeated over the growing season to increase temporal resolution. Remote sensing thereby offers great potential for studying PSF effects at field scale and relevant spatial-temporal resolutions which will facilitate the elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - The high-resolution version of TM5-MP for optimized satellite retrievals: description and validation
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We provide a comprehensive description of the high-resolution version of the TM5-MP global chemistry transport model, which is to be employed for deriving highly resolved vertical profiles of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), formaldehyde (CH2O), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) for use in satellite retrievals from platforms such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Sentinel-5 Precursor, and the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (tropOMI). Comparing simulations conducted at horizontal resolutions of 3 degrees x 2 degrees and 1 degrees x 1 degrees reveals differences of +/- 20% exist in the global seasonal distribution of Rn-222, being larger near specific coastal locations and tropical oceans. For tropospheric ozone (O-3), analysis of the chemical budget terms shows that the impact on globally integrated photolysis rates is rather low, in spite of the higher spatial variability of meteorological data fields from ERA-Interim at 1 degrees x 1 degrees. Surface concentrations of O-3 in high-NOx regions decrease between 5 and 10% at 1 degrees x 1 degrees due to a reduction in NOx recycling terms and an increase in the associated titration term of O-3 by NO. At 1 degrees x 1 degrees, the net global stratosphere-troposphere exchange of O3 decreases by similar to 7 %, with an associated shift in the hemispheric gradient. By comparing NO, NO2, HNO3 and peroxy-acetyl-nitrate (PAN) profiles against measurement composites, we show that TM5-MP captures the vertical distribution of NOx and long-lived NOx reservoirs at background locations, again with modest changes at 1 degrees x 1 degrees. Comparing monthly mean distributions in lightning NOx and applying ERA-Interim convective mass fluxes, we show that the vertical re-distribution of lightning NOx changes with enhanced release of NOx in the upper troposphere. We show that surface mixing ratios in both NO and NO2 are generally underestimated in both low-and high-NO x scenarios. For Europe, a negative bias exists for [NO] at the surface across the whole domain, with lower biases at 1 degrees x 1 degrees at only similar to 20% of sites. For NO2, biases are more variable, with lower (higher) biases at 1 degrees x 1 degrees occurring at similar to 35% (similar to 20 %) of sites, with the remainder showing little change. For CH2O, the impact of higher resolution on the chemical budget terms is rather modest, with changes of less than 5 %. The simulated vertical distribution of CH2O agrees reasonably well with measurements in pristine locations, although column-integrated values are generally underestimated relative to satellite measurements in polluted regions. For SO2, the performance at 1 degrees x 1 degrees is principally governed by the quality of the emission inventory, with limited improvements in the site-specific biases, with most showing no significant improvement. For the vertical column, improvements near strong source regions occur which reduce the biases in the integrated column. For remote regions missing biogenic source terms are inferred.

TI  - Land surface phenology derived from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at global FLUXNET sites
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is an important indicator of annual plant growth and is also widely incorporated in ecosystem models to simulate interannual variability of ecosystem productivity under climate change. A comprehensive understanding of the potentials of current algorithms to detect the start and end for growing season (SOS and EOS) from remote sensing is still lacking. This is particularly true when considering the diverse interactions between phenology and climate change among plant functional types as well as potential influences from different sensors. Using data from 60 flux tower sites (376 site-years in total) from the global FLUXNET database, we applied four algorithms to extract plant phenology from time series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from both MODIS and SPOT-VGT sensors. Results showed that NDVI-simulated phenology had overall low correlation (R-2 <0.30) with flux-derived SOS/EOS observations, but this predictive strength substantially varied by fitting algorithm, sensor and plant functional type. Different fitting algorithms can produce significantly different phenological estimates, but this difference can also be influenced by sensor type. SPOT-VGT simulated better EOS but no difference in the accuracy of SOS was found with different sensors. It may be due to increased frequency of data sampling.(1 0 days for SPOT-VGT vs. 16 days for MODIS) during spring season when rapid plant growth does not help SPOT-VGT more sensitive to growth. In contrast, more frequent data acquisition favors better modeling of plant growth in autumn when a gradual decrease in photosynthesis occurs. Our study results highlight that none of these algorithm can provide consistent good accuracy in modeling SOS and EOS with respect to both plant functional types and sensors. More importantly, a rigorous validation of phenology modeling against ground data is necessary before applying these algorithms at regional or global scales and consequently previous conclusions on regional SOS/EOS trends should be viewed with caution if independent validation is lacking.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To explore the technique of maximum entropy model for extracting Oncomelania hupensis snail habitats in Poyang Lake zone. Methods The information of snail habitats and related environment factors collected in Poyang Lake zone were integrated to set up the maximum entropy based species model and generate snail habitats distribution map. Two Land sat 7 ETM+ remote sensing images of both wet and drought seasons in Poyang Lake zone were obtained, where the two indices of modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were applied to extract snail habitats. The ROC curve, sensitivities and specificities were applied to assess their results. Furthermore, the importance of the variables for snail habitats was analyzed by using Jackknife approach. Results The evaluation results showed that the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of testing data by the remote sensing-based method was only 0.56, and the sensitivity and specificity were 0.23 and 0.89 respectively. Nevertheless, those indices above-mentioned of maximum entropy model were 0.876, 0.89 and 0.74 respectively. The main concentration of snail habitats in Poyang Lake zone covered the northeast part of Yongxiu County, northwest of Yugan County, southwest of Poyang County and middle of Xinjian County, and the elevation was the most important environment variable affecting the distribution of snails, and the next was land surface temperature (LST). Conclusions The maximum entropy model is more reliable and accurate than the remote sensing-based method for the sake of extracting snail habitats, which has certain guiding significance for the relevant departments to carry out measures to prevent and control high-risk snail habitats.

TI  - Derivation of temporally continuous LAI reference maps through combining the LAINet observation system with CACAO
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) products are now routinely generated from remote sensing and widely used in most land surface process models. Assessing the uncertainties associated with these LAI products is essential for their proper application. In validation activities, LAI reference maps serve as the bridge to upscale the field measurements to coarse resolution. Currently, the temporally continuous validation is attracting increasing attention. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for the temporally continuous LAI reference maps. However, two main problems hinder the generation of temporally continuous LAI reference maps: 1) How to obtain temporally continuous field measurements, effectively and inexpensively? 2) How to obtain temporally continuous and fine spatial resolution satellite images which are synchronous with the field measurements? This paper proposed a method to address the above two problems based on the combination of the wireless sensor network technology and a data blending approach. Firstly, the temporally continuous effective LAI was obtained through the analysis of multi-angle gap fraction measured by LAINet observation system (developed with wireless sensor network technology), and the temporally continuous NDVI was reconstructed through CACAO (Consistent Adjustment of the Climatology to Actual Observations, a data blending approach). Then, a transfer function relating reconstructed NDVI to field measured LAI was calibrated through exponential function fitting. Finally, the temporally continuous LAI reference maps were generated by applying the calibrated transfer function to the reconstructed NDVI. Performances of the proposed method were evaluated over a crop site. Results show that the reconstructed LAI reference maps agree well with the original LAI reference maps derived from the Landsat-8 OLI NDVI (R-2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.27 at 30 m resolution, R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 0.09 at 1 km resolution). The derived temporally continuous LAI reference maps were then used as benchmark to validate the MOD15A2 LAI product. Generally, the MOD15A2 LAI has a relatively high accuracy (R-2=0.53, RMSE= 0.31), and captures the overall vegetation phenology well. But its value shows an obvious underestimation with a bias of -0.30. The results of this study contribute to the assessment of temporal dynamics of uncertainty in LAI products, which will benefit the long-term vegetation monitoring and data assimilation.

TI  - Variations in Aerosol Optical Depth over Three Northeastern Provinces of China, in 2003-2014
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the MODIS-Aqua aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from 2003 to 2014, Nighttime Lights Time data from DMSP satellites and basic meteorological data, the AOD spatial distributions of interannual and seasonal variations over three northeastern provinces of China(Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang) were analyzed. It was found that there was a northeast-southwest area of high annual average AOD composed of Dalian, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin and other cities, the 12-year average AOD value was 0.4-0.8. The low AOD occurred in the eastern and northern areas of the three northeastern provinces of China, where the forest covering rate was high, and the 12-year average AOD value was less than 0.3. The seasonal variations of annual average AOD showed an increasing trend from spring to summer, then decreased in autumn and increased again in winter. The interannual variations of AOD over three northeastern provinces of China showed a decreasing trend in most areas, but the increasing trend occurred in the northeast southwest region with the axis formed, by Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin, revealing the polarization in recent 10 years over three northeastern provinces of China. la addition, spatial distribution of annual average AOD over three northeastern provinces of China in the years of strong and weak Western North Pacific Summer Monsoon was studied. Affected by the surface wind field, annual average AOD in weak monsoon years was higher than that in strong monsoon years.

TI  - Analysis of bloom conditions in fall 2013 in the Strait of Hormuz using satellite observations and model simulations
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study an algal bloom event in fall 2013 in the Strait of Hormuz was thoroughly investigated using satellite remote sensing and hydrodynamic modeling. The motivation of this study is to deduce ambient conditions prior to and during the bloom outbreak and understand its trigger. Bloom tracking was achieved by sequential MODIS imagery and numerical simulations. Satellite observations showed that the bloom was initiated in late October 2013 and dissipated in early June 2014. Trajectories of bloom patches were simulated using a Lagrangian transport model. Model-based predictions of bloom patches' trajectories were in good agreement with satellite observations with a probability of detection (POD) reaching 0.85. Analysis of ancillary data, including sea surface temperature, ocean circulation, and wind, indicated that the bloom was likely caused by upwelling conditions in the Strait of Hormuz. Combined with numerical models, satellite observations provide an essential tool for investigating bloom conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Application of ASTER and Landsat 8 imagery data and mathematical evaluation method in detecting iron minerals contamination in the Chadormalu iron mine area, central Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images are widely used to map geological and environmental features at different map scales. The ability of visible to near-infrared (VNIR) scanner systems to map gossans, rich in iron and associated with weathered sulfide occurrences, as well as to characterize regoliths, is perhaps one of the most important current applications of this technology. Initial results of this study show that advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection (ASTER), VNIR, and short-wave infrared radiometer scanner systems can be used successfully to map iron ores. By applying internal average relative reflectance, false color composite, minimum noise fraction transform, and mathematical evaluation method (MEM) techniques, iron contaminations were successfully detected in the Chadormalu iron mine area of central Iran. An attempt was also made to discriminate between the geogenic and anthropogenic iron contaminations in the vicinity of the Chadormalu iron deposit. This research compares ASTER and Landsat 8 data images and the MEM with the band ratio method in a full scope view scale and demonstrates ASTER image data capability in detecting iron contaminations in the Chadormalu area. This indicates that ASTER bands 3, 2, and 1 have a higher spatial (15 m) resolution compared with sensors used in previous works. In addition, the capability of the MEM in detecting Fe-contaminants, unlike the color judgments of the band ratio method, can discriminate between iron pollution in an alluvial plain and the Fe-contents of the host and country rocks in the study area. This study proved that Landsat 8 data illustrate exaggeration both in the MEM and band ratio final results (outputs) and cannot display iron contamination in detail.

TI  - Outcome of Sentinel Hospital-based and CDC-based ART Service Delivery: A Prospective Open Cohort of People Living with HIV in China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to obtain insights into the outcomes of people living with HIV who accessed services through HIV/AIDS sentinel hospital-based and ART service delivery in China. Post-hoc analyses of an open cohort from an observational database of 22 qualified HIV/AIDS sentinel hospital-based and two CDC-based drug delivery facilities (DDFs) in Guangdong Province was completed. Linkage to care, mortality and survival rates were calculated according to WHO criteria. 12,966 individuals received ART from HIV/AIDS sentinel hospitals and 1,919 from DDFs, with linkage to care rates of 80.7% and 79.9%, respectively (P > 0.05). Retention rates were 94.1% and 84.0% in sentinel hospitals and DDFs, respectively (P < 0.01). Excess mortality was 1.4 deaths/100 personyears (95% CI: 1.1, 1.8) in DDFs compared to 0.4 deaths/100 person-years (95% CI: 0.3, 0.5) in hospitals (P < 0.01). A Cox-regression analysis revealed that mortality was much higher in patients receiving ART from the DDFs than sentinel hospitals, with an adjusted HR of 3.3 (95% CI: 2.3, 4.6). A crude HR of treatment termination in DDFs was 7.5 fold higher (95% CI: 6.3, 9.0) compared to sentinel hospitals. HIV/AIDS sentinel hospital had better retention, and substantially lower mortality compared to DDFs.

TI  - Long-lived contrails and convective cirrus above the tropical tropopause
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has two objectives: (1) it characterizes contrails at very low temperatures and (2) it discusses convective cirrus in which the contrails occurred. (1) Long-lived contrails and cirrus from overshooting convection are investigated above the tropical tropopause at low temperatures down to -88 degrees C from measurements with the Russian high-altitude research aircraft M-55 "Geophysica", as well as related observations during the SCOUT-O3 field experiment near Darwin, Australia, in 2005. A contrail was observed to persist below ice saturation at low temperatures and low turbulence in the stratosphere for nearly 1 h. The contrail occurred downwind of the decaying convective system "Hector" of 16 November 2005. The upper part of the contrail formed at 19 km altitude in the tropical lower stratosphere at similar to 60% relative humidity over ice at -82 degrees C. The similar to 1 h lifetime is explained by engine water emissions, slightly enhanced humidity from Hector, low temperature, low turbulence, and possibly nitric acid hydrate formation. The long persistence suggests large contrail coverage in case of a potential future increase of air traffic in the lower stratosphere. (2) Cirrus observed above the strongly convective Hector cloud on 30 November 2005 was previously interpreted as cirrus from overshooting convection. Here we show that parts of the cirrus were caused by contrails or are mixtures of convective and contrail cirrus. The in situ data together with data from an upward-looking lidar on the German research aircraft "Falcon", the CPOL radar near Darwin, and NOAA-AVHRR satellites provide a sufficiently complete picture to distinguish between contrail and convective cirrus parts. Plume positions are estimated based on measured or analyzed wind and parameterized wake vortex descent. Most of the non-volatile aerosol measured over Hector is traceable to aircraft emissions. Exhaust emission indices are derived from a self-match experiment of the Geophysica in the polar stratosphere in 2010. The number of ice particles in the contrails is less than 1% of the number of non-volatile aerosol particles, possibly because of sublimation losses and undetected very small ice particles. The radar data show that the ice water content in convective overshoots is far higher than measured along the flight path. These findings add insight into overshooting convection and are of relevance with respect to hydration of the lower stratosphere.

TI  - Analysing trends and forecasting malaria epidemics in Madagascar using a sentinel surveillance network: a web-based application
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The use of a malaria early warning system (MEWS) to trigger prompt public health interventions is a key step in adding value to the epidemiological data routinely collected by sentinel surveillance systems.Methods: This study describes a system using various epidemic thresholds and a forecasting component with the support of new technologies to improve the performance of a sentinel MEWS. Malaria-related data from 21 sentinel sites collected by Short Message Service are automatically analysed to detect malaria trends and malaria outbreak alerts with automated feedback reports.Results: Roll Back Malaria partners can, through a user-friendly web-based tool, visualize potential outbreaks and generate a forecasting model. The system already demonstrated its ability to detect malaria outbreaks in Madagascar in 2014.Conclusion: This approach aims to maximize the usefulness of a sentinel surveillance system to predict and detect epidemics in limited-resource environments.

TI  - A population-based study of chronic hepatitis C in immigrants and non-immigrants in Quebec, Canada
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Immigrants originating from intermediate and high HCV prevalence countries may be at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis C infection (HCV) in their countries of origin, however they are not routinely screened after arrival in most low HCV prevalence host countries. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of HCV in immigrants compared to the Canadian born population.Methods: Using the reportable infectious disease database linked to the landed immigration database and several provincial administrative databases, we assembled a cohort of all reported cases of HCV in Quebec, Canada (1998-2008). Underlying co-morbidities were identified in the health services databases. Stratum specific rates of reported cases/100,000, rate ratios (RRs) and trends over the study period were estimated.Results: A total of 20,862 patients with HCV were identified, among whom 1922 (9.2%) were immigrants. Immigrants were older and diagnosed a mean of 9.8 +/- 7 years after arrival. The Canadian born population was more likely to have behavior co-morbidities (problematic alcohol or drug use) and HIV co-infection. Immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe had the highest HCV reported rates with RRs compared to non-immigrants ranging from 1.5 to 1.7. The age and sex adjusted rates decreased by 4.9% per year in non-immigrants but remained unchanged in immigrants. The proportion of HCV occurring in immigrants doubled over the study period from 5 to 11%.Conclusions: Immigrants from intermediate and high HCV prevalence countries are at increased risk for HCV and had a mean delay in diagnosis of almost 10 years after arrival suggesting that they may benefit from targeted HCV screening and earlier linkage to care.

TI  - MUSICA MetOp/IASI {H<sub>2</sub>O, δD} pair retrieval simulations for validating tropospheric moisture pathways in atmospheric models
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The project MUSICA (MUlti-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water) has shown that the sensor IASI aboard the satellite MetOp can measure the free tropospheric {H2O, delta D} pair distribution twice per day on a quasi-global scale. Such data are very promising for investigating tropospheric moisture pathways, however, the complex data characteristics compromise their usage in the context of model evaluation studies. Here we present a tool that allows for simulating MUSICA MetOp/IASI {H2O, delta D} pair remote sensing data for a given model atmosphere, thereby creating model data that have the remote sensing data characteristics assimilated. This model data can then be compared to the MUSICA data.The retrieval simulation method is based on the physical principles of radiative transfer and we show that the uncertainty of the simulations is within the uncertainty of the MUSICA MetOp/IASI products, i. e. the retrieval simulations are reliable enough. We demonstrate the working principle of the simulator by applying it to ECHAM5-wiso model data. The few case studies clearly reveal the large potential of the MUSICA MetOp/IASI {H2O, delta D} data pairs for evaluating modelled moisture pathways. The tool is made freely available in form of MATLAB and Python routines and can be easily connected to any atmospheric water vapour isotopologue model.

TI  - Post-processing to remove residual clouds from aerosol optical depth retrieved using the Advanced Along Track Scanning Radiometer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud misclassification is a serious problem in the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), which might considerably bias the AOD results. On the one hand, residual cloud contamination leads to AOD overestimation, whereas the removal of high-AOD pixels (due to their misclassification as clouds) leads to underestimation. To remove cloudcontaminated areas in AOD retrieved from reflectances measured with the (Advanced) Along Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSR-2 and AATSR), using the ATSR dual-view algorithm (ADV) over land or the ATSR single-view algorithm (ASV) over ocean, a cloud post-processing (CPP) scheme has been developed at the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) as described in Kolmonen et al. (2016). The application of this scheme results in the removal of cloudcontaminated areas, providing spatially smoother AOD maps and favourable comparison with AOD obtained from the ground-based reference measurements from the AERONET sun photometer network. However, closer inspection shows that the CPP also removes areas with elevated AOD not due to cloud contamination, as shown in this paper. We present an improved CPP scheme which better discriminates between cloud-free and cloud-contaminated areas. The CPP thresholds have been further evaluated and adjusted according to the findings. The thresholds for the detection of high-AOD regions (> 60% of the retrieved pixels should be high-AOD (> 0.6) pixels), and cloud contamination criteria for lowAOD regions have been accepted as the default for AOD global post-processing in the improved CPP. Retaining elevated AOD while effectively removing cloud-contaminated pixels affects the resulting global and regional mean AOD values as well as coverage. Effects of the CPP scheme on both spatial and temporal variation for the period 2002-2012 are discussed. With the improved CPP, the AOD coverage increases by 10-15% with respect to the existing scheme. The validation versus AERONET shows an improvement of the correlation coefficient from 0.84 to 0.86 for the global data set for the period 2002-2012. The global aggregated AOD over land for the period 2003-2011 is 0.163 with the improved CPP compared to 0.144 with the existing scheme. The aggregated AOD over ocean and globally (land and ocean together) is 0.164 with the improved CPP scheme (compared to 0.152 and 0.150 with the existing scheme, for ocean and globally respectively). Effects of the improved CPP scheme on the 10-year time series are illustrated and seasonal and temporal changes are discussed. The improved CPP method introduced here is applicable to other aerosol retrieval algorithms. However, the thresholds for detecting the high-AOD regions, which were developed for AATSR, might have to be adjusted to the actual features of the instruments.

TI  - Assessment of remote sensing-based classification methods for change detection of salt-affected areas (Biskra area, Algeria)
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Wadi Biskra arid and semiarid areas, sustainable development is restricted by land degradation processes such as secondary salinization of soils. Being an important highquality date production region of Algeria, this area needs continuous monitoring of desertification indicators, hence highly exposed to climate-related risks. Given the limited access to field data, appropriate methods were assessed for the identification and change detection of salt-affected areas, involving image interpretation and automated classifications employing Landsat imagery, ancillary and multisource ground truth data. First, a visual photointerpretation study of the land cover and land use classes was undergone according to acknowledged methodologies. Second, two automated classification approaches were developed: a customized decision tree classification (DTC) and an unsupervised one applied to the principal components of Knepper ratios composite. Five indices were employed in the DTC construction, among which also is a salinity index. The diachronic analysis was undergone for the 1984 to 2015 images (including seasonal approach), being supported by the interpreted land cover/land use map for error estimation. Considering also biophysical and socioeconomic data, comprehensive results are discussed. One of the most important aspects that emerged was that the accelerated expansion of agricultural land in the last three decades has led and continues to contribute to a secondary salinization of soils.

TI  - Geospatial multicriteria approach for solid waste disposal site selection in Dehradun city, India
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Solid waste generation is increasing rapidly in urban areas of India as well as globally. As land resources for waste disposal are limited in highly populated countries like India, identification of solid waste disposal sites in urban centres is a challenging task, as this involves physical, socio-economic and environmental factors. Dehradun, the capital city of Uttarakhand at present has only one disposal site which is not having good spatial accessibility for all the locations in the city and also it is an environmentally vulnerable site. The present study aims to find suitable sites for decentralized solid waste disposal using geo-spatial techniques with multi spatio-temporal remote sensing data. A geospatial multicriteria analysis was performed with weighted overlay technique by considering various criteria such as physical, social and demographic aspects of the city for locating the solid waste disposal site(s).

AB  - PurposeTo provide current recommendations on the use of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) for patients with early-stage breast cancer.MethodsPubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines from 2012 through July 2016. An Update Panel reviewed the identified abstracts.ResultsOf the eight publications identified and reviewed, none prompted a change in the 2014 recommendations, which are reaffirmed by the updated literature review.ConclusionWomen without sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases should not receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Women with one to two metastatic SLNs who are planning to undergo breast-conserving surgery with whole-breast radiotherapy should not undergo ALND (in most cases). Women with SLN metastases who will undergo mastectomy should be offered ALND. These three recommendations are based on randomized controlled trials. Women with operable breast cancer and multicentric tumors, with ductal carcinoma in situ, who will undergo mastectomy, who previously underwent breast and/or axillary surgery, or who received preoperative/neoadjuvant systemic therapy may be offered SNB. Women who have large or locally advanced invasive breast cancer (tumor size T3/T4), inflammatory breast cancer, or ductal carcinoma in situ (when breast-conserving surgery is planned) or are pregnant should not undergo SNB.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the characteristics of acute hepatitis B inpatients reported by the hepatitis B surveillance pilot points and to estimate the consistency between the diagnosed and reported types of hepatitis B by the clinicians involved. Methods: Data related to acute hepatitis B was from the NNDRS and the characteristics of acute hepatitis B were classified by querying Hospital Information System. We recorded the results based on clinical diagnosis and analyzed the consistency between the reported and diagnosed types that the clinicians made, on hepatitis B. Results: A total of 179 patients were included in this study with all of them as acute hepatitis B reported through NNDRS in 2015-2016. In terms of the durations of disease, among the 179 cases who were HBsAg positive, 32.40% (58/179) of them exceeding 6 months, 2.79% (5/179) within 6 months and 64.80% (116/179) tested the first time or never. Among the 179 cases who claimed having the history of hepatitis, 33.52% (60/179) of them identified as having hepatitis B, 1.12% (2/179) were hepatitis A, C or E, 41.34% (74/179) did not have the signs on hepatitis, while the rest 24.02% (43/179) did not know the situation. Only 79.89% (143/179) of the patients showed the symptoms or signs of hepatitis, but the rest 20.11% (36/179) did not. Among the 179 reported acute hepatitis patients, 67 of them were diagnosed as acute hepatitis B while 112 cases were as non-acute hepatitis B. The consistent rate of acute hepatitis B was 37.43% (67/179). Among the 112 cases that were diagnosed as non-acute hepatitis B, proportions of chronic hepatitis B and cirrhosis were 49.11%(55/112) and 16.07%(18/112) respectively. Conclusion: Consistency between the reported type of acute hepatitis B inpatients and the types diagnosed by clinicians was poor. Our results suggested that clinicians should make the accurate diagnosis at first place and then report to the Network in accordance with the clinical diagnosis classification criterfia, set by the government.

TI  - Fast Radio Bursts with Extended Gamma-Ray Emission?
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider some general implications of bright gamma-ray. counterparts to fast radio bursts (FRBs). We show that even if these manifest in only a fraction of FRBs, gamma-ray. detections with current satellites (including Swift) can provide stringent constraints on cosmological FRB models. If the energy is drawn from the magnetic energy of a compact object such as a magnetized neutron star, the sources should be nearby and be very rare. If the intergalactic medium is responsible for the observed dispersion measure, the required gamma-ray. energy is comparable to that of the early afterglow or extended emission of short gamma-ray. bursts. While this can be reconciled with the rotation energy of compact objects, as expected in many merger scenarios, the prompt outflow that yields the gamma-rays is too dense for radio waves to escape. Highly relativistic winds launched in a precursor phase, and forming a wind bubble, may avoid the scattering and absorption limits and could yield FRB emission. Largely independent of source models, we show that detectable radio afterglow emission from gamma-ray. bright FRBs can reasonably be anticipated. Gravitational wave searches can also be expected to provide useful tests.

TI  - A cut-off of 2150 cytokeratin 19 mRNA copy number in sentinel lymph node may be a powerful predictor of non-sentinel lymph node status in breast cancer patients
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2007, one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) has been used as a diagnostic system for sentinel lymph node (SLN) examination in patients with breast cancer. This study aimed to define a new clinical cut-off of CK19 mRNA copy number based on the calculation of the risk that an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) will be positive. We analyzed 1529 SLNs from 1140 patients with the OSNA assay and 318 patients with positive SLNs for micrometastasis (250 copies) and macrometastasis (5000 copies) underwent ALND. Axillary non-SLNs were routinely examined. ROC curves and Youden's index were performed in order to identify a new cut-off value. Logistic regression models were performed in order to compare OSNA categorical variables created on the basis of our and traditional cut-off to better identify patients who really need an axillary dissection. 69% and 31% of OSNA positive patients had a negative and positive ALND, respectively. ROC analysis identified a cutoff of 2150 CK19 mRNA copies with 95% sensitivity and 51% specificity. Positive and negative predictive values of this new cut-off were 47% and 96%, respectively. Logistic regression models indicated that the cut-off of 2150 copies better discriminates patients with node negative or positive in comparison with the conventional OSNA cut-off (p<0.0001). This cutoff identifies false positive and false negative cases and true-positive and true negative cases very efficiently, and therefore better identifies which patients really need an ALND and which patients can avoid one. This is why we suggest that the negative cut-off should be raised from 250 to 2150. Furthermore, we propose that for patients with a copy number that ranges between 2150 and 5000, there should be a multidisciplinary discussion concerning the clinical and bio-morphological features of primary breast cancer before any decision is taken on whether to perform an ALND or not.

TI  - Active-layer thickness estimation from X-band SAR backscatter intensity
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The active layer above the permafrost, which seasonally thaws during summer, is an important parameter for monitoring the state of permafrost. Its thickness is typically measured locally, but a range of methods which utilize information from satellite data exist. Mostly, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from optical satellite data is used as a proxy. The applicability has been demonstrated mostly for shallow depths of active-layer thickness (ALT) below approximately 70 cm. Some permafrost areas including central Yamal are, however, characterized by larger ALT. Surface properties including vegetation structure are also represented by microwave backscatter intensity. So far, the potential of such data for estimating ALT has not been explored. We therefore investigated the relationship between ALT and X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR)backscatter of TerraSAR-X (averages for 10 x 10m window) in order to examine the possibility of delineating ALT with continuous and larger spatial coverage in this area and compare it to the already-established method of using NDVI from Landsat (30 m). Our results show that the mutual dependency of ALT and TerraSAR-X backscatter on land cover types suggests a connection of both parameters. A range of 5 dB can be observed for an ALT range of 100 cm (40-140 cm), and an R-2 of 0.66 has been determined over the calibration sites. An increase of ALT with increasing backscatter can be determined. The root mean square error (RMSE) over a comparably heterogeneous validation site with maximum ALT of > 150 cm is 20 cm. Deviations are larger for measurement locations with mixed vegetation types (especially partial cover-age by cryptogam crust) with respect to the spatial resolution of the satellite data.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) infections are not reportable in Germany and limited data on prevalence are available. CT screening has been offered free of charge to pregnant women since 1995 and to all women under 25 years since 2008. For symptomatic women and men, diagnostic testing is covered by statutory health insurance. We describe the establishment of a nationwide, laboratory-based, voluntary sentinel that electronically collects information on all performed CT tests with test results, test reason and patient information. The sentinel represents one third of all performed CT tests in Germany. In the period from 2008 to 2014, 3,877,588 CT tests were reported, 93% in women. Women aged 20-24 years and men aged 25-29 years were the most frequently tested age groups. The overall proportion of positive tests (PPT) among women was 3.9% and among men 11.0%. The highest PPT among women was in the age groups 15-19 (6.8%) and 20-24 years (5.9%), and among men in the age groups 20-24 (19.2%), 15-19 (15.4%) and 25-29 years (14.8%). The PPT for CT was high among women and men younger than 25 years. Prevention is urgently needed. Monitoring of CT infection in Germany should be continued.

T2  - Fishes
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern waters off Java-Bali were recognized as spawning and potential fishing ground for tuna species. However, few studies have been conducted on this area. In this paper, the environmental preference of bigeye tuna was assessed based on catch data and three main environmental satellite data; namely; sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface chlorophyll (SSC), and sea surface height deviation (SSHD). Then, the relationship between bigeye tuna catches and environmental satellite data was analyzed by using a simplified method of the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) which is called scatterplot smoothers. This method is the forerunner of GAM and has not yet been applied for fisheries analysis. The aim of this study was to evaluate its performance for/in analyzing bigeye tuna habitat preference. The result indicated that SST, SSC, and SSHD had a high correlation with the bigeye tuna's spatial patterns. Furthermore, spatial patterns of bigeye tuna preference display typical characteristics of low SST, low SSC, and low positive SSHD as well as areas with extreme SSHD values, which are almost the same results as those identified with GAM analysis in the same study area.

TI  - Assessment of the aerosol optical depths measured by satellite-based passive remote sensors in the Alberta oil sands region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are assessed in terms of their data quality in the Alberta oil sands region. The instruments consist of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances), MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer), and AATSR (Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer). The AOD data products are examined in terms of multiplicative and additive biases determined using local Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) (AEROCAN) stations. Correlation with ground-based data is used to assess whether the satellite-based AODs capture day-to-day, month-to-month, and spatial variability. The ability of the satellite AOD products to capture interannual variability is assessed at Albian mine and Shell Muskeg River, two neighbouring sites in the northern mining region where a statistically significant positive trend (2002-2015) in PM2.5 mass density exists. An increasing trend of similar amplitude (similar to 5% year(-1)) is observed in this northern mining region using some of the satellite AOD products.

TI  - ENSO elicits opposing responses of semi-arid vegetation between Hemispheres
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semi-arid ecosystems are key contributors to the global carbon cycle and may even dominate the inter-annual variability (IAV) and trends of the land carbon sink, driven largely by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The linkages between dynamics of semi-arid ecosystems and climate at the hemispheric scale however are not well known. Here, we use satellite data and climate observations from 2000 to 2014 to explore the impacts of ENSO on variability of semi-arid ecosystems, using the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition method. We show that the responses of semi-arid vegetation to ENSO occur in opposite directions, resulting from opposing controls of ENSO on precipitation between the Northern Hemisphere (positively correlated to ENSO) and the Southern Hemisphere (negatively correlated to ENSO). Also, the Southern Hemisphere, with a robust negative coupling of temperature and precipitation anomalies, exhibits stronger and faster responses of semi-arid ecosystems to ENSO than the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings suggest that natural coherent variability in semi-arid ecosystem productivity responded to ENSO in opposite ways between two hemispheres, which may imply potential prediction of global semi-arid ecosystem variability, particularly based on variability in tropical Pacific Sea Surface Temperatures.

TI  - Effects of atmospheric dynamics and aerosols on the fraction of supercooled water clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 8 years of (January 2008-December 2015) cloud phase information from the GCM-Oriented Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP), aerosol products from CALIPSO and meteorological parameters from the ERA-Interim products, the present study investigates the effects of atmospheric dynamics on the supercooled liquid cloud fraction (SCF) during nighttime under different aerosol loadings at global scale to better understand the conditions of supercooled liquid water gradually transforming to ice phase.Statistical results indicate that aerosols' effect on nucleation cannot fully explain all SCF changes, especially in those regions where aerosols' effect on nucleation is not a first-order influence (e.g., due to low ice nuclei aerosol frequency). By performing the temporal and spatial correlations between SCFs and different meteorological factors, this study presents specifically the relationship between SCF and different meteorological parameters under different aerosol loadings on a global scale. We find that the SCFs almost decrease with increasing of aerosol loading, and the SCF variation is closely related to the meteorological parameters but their temporal relationship is not stable and varies with the different regions, seasons and isotherm levels. Obviously negative temporal correlations between SCFs versus vertical velocity and relative humidity indicate that the higher vertical velocity and relative humidity the smaller SCFs. However, the patterns of temporal correlation for lower-tropospheric static stability, skin temperature and horizontal wind are relatively more complex than those of vertical velocity and humidity. For example, their close correlations are predominantly located in middle and high latitudes and vary with latitude or surface type. Although these statistical correlations have not been used to establish a certain causal relationship, our results may provide a unique point of view on the phase change of mixed-phase cloud and have potential implications for further improving the parameterization of the cloud phase and determining the climate feedbacks.

TI  - The role of <i>Nucularia perrinii</i> Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) in the camel-based Sahrawi social-ecological system
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Pastoral social-ecological systems (SESs) are adaptive and complex systems rooted in the extensive exploitation of forage plants for livestock-based livelihoods and culture. There are species and relations that are foundational to the existence of these SESs. Nucularia perrinii Batt. (Chenopodiaceae) is an endemic halophyte plant of central and western Sahara seldom cited in the scientific literature. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of this plant in the SES of the Sahrawi camel nomads of Western Sahara.Methods: The data analyzed were collected in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Algeria and in Western Sahara between 2006 and 2010. Fieldwork included semi-structured (n = 38) and retrospective (n = 12) interviews with Sahrawi refugees, nomads, and camel owners about N. perrinii and associated topics (e.g. distribution, importance for camels, camel diseases, associated grazing practices, other forage plants, etc.).Results: Askaf, as the Sahrawi call the plant, is crucial to camels' survival, providing salts and water even during dry spells. It holds a pivotal role in the Sahrawi culture, defining the geographical boundaries of the Sahrawi SES and relating the grazing territory with the taste it gives to camel milk, which support the inclusion of askaf as a main element of Sahrawi cultural identity.Conclusions: We argue that N. perrinii ties the ecology of the western Sahara desert with camel husbandry and associated livelihoods, and further with the culture and worldview of the Sahrawi nomads. We stress the keystone role that some forage plants may have in extensive pastoral SESs worldwide.

TI  - The predictive value of methylene blue dye as a single technique in breast cancer sentinel node biopsy: a study from Dharmais Cancer Hospital
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been the standard treatment of breast cancer axillary staging in Indonesia. The limited facilities of radioisotope tracer and isosulfan or patent blue dye (PBD) have been the major obstacles to perform sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in our country. We studied the application of 1% methylene blue dye (MBD) alone for SNB to overcome the problem.Methods: This prospective study enrolled 108 patients with suspicious malignant lesions or breast cancer stages I-III. SNB was performed using 2-5 cc of 1% MBD and proceeded with ALND. The histopathology results of sentinel nodes (SNs) were compared with axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) for diagnostic value assessments.Results: There were 96 patients with invasive carcinoma from July 2012 to September 2014 who were included in the final analysis. The median age was 50 (25-69) years, and the median pathological tumor size was 3 cm (1-10). Identification rate of SNs was 91.7%, and the median number of the identified SNs was 2 (1-8). Sentinel node metastasis was found in 53.4% cases and 89.4% of them were macrometastases. The negative predictive value (NPV) of SNs to predict axillary metastasis was 90% (95% CI, 81-99%). There were no anaphylactic reactions, but we found 2 cases with skin necrosis.Conclusions: The application of 1% MBD as a single technique in breast cancer SNB has favorable identification rates and predictive values. It can be used for axillary staging, but nevertheless the technique should be applied with attention to the tumor size and grade to avoid false negative results.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Mapping of Heat Health Risk Utilizing Environmental and Socioeconomic Data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme heat events, a leading cause of weather-related fatality worldwide, are expected to intensify, last longer, and occur more frequently in the near future. In heat health risk assessments, a spatiotemporal mismatch usually exists between hazard (heat stress) data and exposure (population distribution) data. Such mismatch is present because demographic data are generally updated every couple of years and unavailable at the subcensus unit level, which hinders the ability to diagnose human risks. In the present work, a human settlement index based on multisensor remote sensing data, including nighttime light, vegetation index, and digital elevation model data, was used for heat exposure assessment on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, the nighttime urban heat island effect was considered in heat hazard assessment. The heat-related health risk was spatially explicitly assessed and mapped at the 250 m x 250 m pixel level across Zhejiang Province in eastern China. The results showed that the accumulated heat risk estimates and the heat-related deaths were significantly correlated at the county level (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.76, P <= 0.01). Our analysis introduced a spatially specific methodology for the risk mapping of heat-related health outcomes, which is useful for decision support in preparation and mitigation of heat -related risk and potential adaptation.

TI  - DCIS and axillary nodal evaluation: compliance with national guidelines
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) provide guidelines regarding axillary nodal evaluation in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), but data regarding national compliance with these guidelines remains incomplete.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) analyzing all surgical approaches to axillary evaluation in patients with DCIS. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the multivariate relationship between patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and probability of axillary evaluation.Results: We identified 88,083 patients diagnosed with DCIS between 1998 and 2011; 31,912 (37%) underwent total mastectomy (TM) and 55,349 (63%) had breast conserving therapy (BCT). Axillary evaluation increased from 44.4% in 1998 to 63.3% in 2011. In TM patients, axillary evaluation increased from 74.3% in 1998 to 93.4% in 2011. This correlated with an increase in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) from 24.3 to 77.1%, while ALND decreased from 50.0 to 16.3% (p < 0.01). In BCT patients, evaluation increased from 20.1 to 43.9%; SLNB increased from 7.2 to 39.4% and ALND decreased from 12.9 to 4.5%. Factors associated with axillary nodal evaluation in BCT patients included practice type and facility location. Among TM patients, use of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for axillary staging was associated with earlier year of diagnosis, black race, and older age, as well as community practice setting and practice location in the Southern US.Conclusions: Compliance with national guidelines regarding axillary evaluation in DCIS remains varied. Practice type and location-based differences suggest opportunities for education regarding the appropriate use of axillary nodal evaluation in patients with DCIS.

TI  - Drainage of Southeast Greenland Firn Aquifer Water through Crevasses to the Bed
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A firn aquifer in the Helheim Glacier catchment of Southeast Greenland lies directly upstream of a crevasse field. Previous measurements show that a 3.5-km long segment of the aquifer lost a large volume of water (26,000-65,000 m(2) in cross section) between spring 2012 and spring 2013, compared to annual meltwater accumulation of 6000-15,000 m(2). The water is thought to have entered the crevasses, but whether the water reached the bed or refroze within the ice sheet is unknown. We used a thermo-visco-elastic model for crevasse propagation to calculate the depths and volumes of these water-filled crevasses. We compared our model output to data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which reveals the near-surface geometry of specific crevasses, and WorldView images, which capture the surface expressions of crevasses across our 1.5-km study area. We found a best fit with a shear modulus between 0.2 and 1.5 GPa within our study area. We show that surface meltwater can drive crevasses to the top surface of the firn aquifer (similar to 20m depth), whereupon it receives water at rates corresponding to the water flux through the aquifer. Our model shows that crevasses receiving firn-aquifer water hydrofracture through to the bed, similar to 1000m below, in 10-40 days. Englacial refreezing of firn-aquifer water raises the average local ice temperature by similar to 4 degrees C over a ten-year period, which enhances deformational ice motion by similar to 50m year(-1), compared to the observed surface velocity of similar to 200m year(-1). The effect of the basal water on the sliding velocity remains unknown. Were the firn aquifer not present to concentrate surface meltwater into crevasses, we find that no surface melt would reach the bed; instead, it would refreeze annually in crevasses at depths < 500 m. The crevasse field downstream of the firn aquifer likely allows a large fraction of the aquifer water in our study area to reach the bed. Thus, future studies should consider the aquifer and crevasses as part of a common system. This system may uniquely affect ice-sheet dynamics by routing a large volume of water to the bed outside of the typical runoff period.

TI  - Application of CryoSat-2 altimetry data for river analysis and modelling
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of in situ river monitoring data, especially of data shared across boundaries, is decreasing, despite growing challenges for water resource management across the entire globe. This is especially valid for the case study of this work, the Brahmaputra Basin in South Asia. Commonly, satellite altimeters are used in various ways to provide information about such river basins. Most missions provide virtual station time series of water levels at locations where their repeat orbits cross rivers. CryoSat-2 is equipped with a new type of altimeter, providing estimates of the actual ground location seen in the reflected signal. It also uses a drifting orbit, challenging conventional ways of processing altimetry data to river water levels and their incorporation in hydrologic-hydrodynamic models. However, CryoSat-2 altimetry data provides an unprecedentedly high spatial resolution. This paper suggests a procedure to (i) filter CryoSat-2 observations over rivers to extract water-level profiles along the river, and (ii) use this information in combination with a hydrologic-hydrodynamic model to fit the simulated water levels with an accuracy that cannot be reached using information from globally available digital elevation models (DEMs) such as from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) only. The filtering was done based on dynamic river masks extracted from Landsat imagery, providing spatial and temporal resolutions high enough to map the braided river channels and their dynamic morphology. This allowed extraction of river water levels over previously unmonitored narrow stretches of the river. In the Assam Valley section of the Brahmaputra River, CryoSat-2 data and Envisat virtual station data were combined to calibrate cross sections in a 1-D hydrodynamic model of the river. The hydrologic-hydrodynamic model setup and calibration are almost exclusively based on openly available remote sensing data and other global data sources, ensuring transferability of the developed methods. They provide an opportunity to achieve forecasts of both discharge and water levels in a poorly gauged river system.

TI  - A Principle of Intentionality
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The mainstream theories and models of the physical sciences, including neuroscience, are all consistent with the principle of causality. Wholly causal explanations make sense of how things go, but are inherently value-neutral, providing no objective basis for true beliefs being better than false beliefs, nor for it being better to intend wisely than foolishly. Dennett (1987) makes a related point in calling the brain a syntactic (procedure-based) engine. He says that you cannot get to a semantic (meaning-based) engine from there. He suggests that folk psychology revolves around an intentional stance that is independent of the causal theories of the brain, and accounts for constructs such as meanings, agency, true belief, and wise desire. Dennett proposes that the intentional stance is so powerful that it can be developed into a valid intentional theory. This article expands Dennett's model into a principle of intentionality that revolves around the construct of objective wisdom. This principle provides a structure that can account for all mental processes, and for the scientific understanding of objective value. It is suggested that science can develop a far more complete worldview with a combination of the principles of causality and intentionality than would be possible with scientific theories that are consistent with the principle of causality alone.

TI  - Geomorphology of Mount Ararat/Agri Dagi (Agri Dagi Milli Parki, Eastern Anatolia, Turkey)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a geomorphological map of Mount Ararat/Agri Dagi in Eastern Anatolia (Turkey). Mount Ararat/Agri Dagi is a volcanic complex covered by a unique ice cap in the Near East. The massif is the result of multiple volcanic phases, and present day landforms are the result of subsequent and overlapping glacial, periglacial, and slope processes. The geomorphological mapping of Mount Ararat/Agri Dagi was firstly performed on the basis of desktop studies, by applying remote-sensing investigations using high-resolution satellite imagery (PLEIADES and SPOT images). A preliminary draft of the map was crosschecked and validated in the field as part of an interdisciplinary campaign carried out in the 2014 summer season. All the collected data suggest that the Mount Ararat/Agri Dagi glaciation played a crucial role in the evolution of the landscape and that even today glaciers are significant features in this area. Currently, ice bodies cover 7.28 km(2) and include peculiar glacier types. Among these are three well-developed debris-covered glaciers, flowing down along the flanks of the volcano.

TI  - Shifting of phytoplankton community in the frontal regions of Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean using <i>in situ</i> and satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The phytoplankton pigment indices were used to characterize the spatial succession of the community composition in the frontal regions of the subtropical front (STF), sub-Antarctic front (SAF), and polar front (PF) in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean during austral summer 2013. Diagnostic indices revealed that the flagellates were dominant in STF (51%) and progressively declined toward SAF (39%) and PF (11%). Similarly, the prokaryotes were highest in STF (43%) and decreased to SAF (32%) and PF (28%). In contrast, the diatoms were gradually increased from STF (6%) to SAF (29%) and PF (61%). The variability of flagellates and diatoms from the STF to PF is attributed to the variability of photosynthetically available radiation, sea surface temperature, and sea surface wind speed. The in-situ pigment indices were then compared to the NASA Ocean Biogeochemical model that shows the similar patterns of frontal community distribution except their magnitude. Similarly, the satellite retrieved phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a) was checked for its consistency after comparing with the in-situ observations and the result shows underestimation of satellite measured values. The result suggests that the conjunctive analysis of in-situ, satellite, and model archive is suitable to study the impact of climate variability on the structure of marine ecosystems.

TI  - First On-Site True Gamma-Ray Imaging-Spectroscopy of Contamination near Fukushima Plant
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed an Electron Tracking Compton Camera (ETCC), which provides a well-defined Point Spread Function (PSF) by reconstructing a direction of each gamma as a point and realizes simultaneous measurement of brightness and spectrum of MeV gamma-rays for the first time. Here, we present the results of our on-site pilot gamma-imaging-spectroscopy with ETCC at three contaminated locations in the vicinity of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plants in Japan in 2014. The obtained distribution of brightness (or emissivity) with remote-sensing observations is unambiguously converted into the dose distribution. We confirm that the dose distribution is consistent with the one taken by conventional mapping measurements with a dosimeter physically placed at each grid point. Furthermore, its imaging spectroscopy, boosted by Compton-edge-free spectra, reveals complex radioactive features in a quantitative manner around each individual target point in the background-dominated environment. Notably, we successfully identify a "micro hot spot" of residual caesium contamination even in an already decontaminated area. These results show that the ETCC performs exactly as the geometrical optics predicts, demonstrates its versatility in the field radiation measurement, and reveals potentials for application in many fields, including the nuclear industry, medical field, and astronomy.

TI  - Using a community based survey of healthcare seeking behavior to estimate the actual magnitude of influenza among adults in Beijing during 2013-2014 season
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Due to a lack of survey of health care seeking behavior for influenza, the actual magnitude of influenza in Beijing of China has not been well described.Methods: During 2013- 2014 influenza season, two cross-sectional household surveys were carried out respectively during the epidemic and non- epidemic season of influenza. A structured survey was undertaken with individuals who were = 18 years selected by a multistage random sampling method in the study. Health care seeking behaviors were then examined to estimate the actual case number of influenza, using a multiplier model.Results: A total of 14,665 adults were interviewed. 61.9% of ILI cases consulted a physician. The consultation rate during epidemic period is higher than that during non- epidemic period (67.9% vs. 52.3%). Similarly, the proportion of healthcare usage of general hospital during epidemic period is higher than that was during non- epidemic period (27.1% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.008). Lack of insurance and education reduced healthcare seeking significantly in this study. It was estimated that there were 379,767 (90% CI = [ 281,934, 526,565]) confirmed cases of influenza amongst adults in Beijing, during 2013- 2014 influenza season, with an incidence rate of 2.0%.Conclusions: The surveillance system for ILI and virological data has the potential to provide baseline case number to estimate the actual annual magnitude of influenza. Given the changes in healthcare seeking behavior over time, sentinel surveillance on healthcare seeking behavior are required to be established for better estimate of the true case number of influenza.

TI  - Feedback Activation of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor Signaling via the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway in Skin Fibroblasts
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Skin wound healing is a complex process requiring the coordinated behavior of many cell types, especially in the proliferation and migration of fibroblasts. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a member of the FGF family that promotes fibroblast migration, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. The present RNA sequencing study showed that the expression levels of several canonical Wnt pathway genes, including Wnt2b, Wnt3, Wnt11, T-cell factor 7 (TCF7), and Frizzled 8 (FZD8) were modified by bFGF stimulation in fibroblasts. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis also showed that Wnt pathway was activated under bFGF treatment. Furthermore, treatment of fibroblasts with lithium chloride or IWR-1, an inducer and inhibitor of the Wnt signaling pathway, respectively, promoted and inhibited cell migration. Also, levels of cytosolic glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta phosphorylated at serine(9) (pGSK3 beta Ser(9)) and nuclear fy-catenin were increased upon exposure to bFGF. Molecular and biochemical assays indicated that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activated the GSK3 beta/beta-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway via activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), suggesting that PI3K and JNK act at the upstream of beta-catenin. In contrast, knock-down of beta-catenin delayed fibroblast cell migration even under bFGF stimulation. RNA sequencing analysis of 1-catenin knock-down fibroblasts demonstrated that f)-catenin positively regulated the transcription of bFGF and FGF21. Moreover, FGF21 treatment activated AKT and JNK, and accelerated fibroblast migration to a similar extent as bFGF does. In addition, ELISA analysis demonstrated that both of bFGF and FGF21 were auto secretion factor and be regulated by Wnt pathway stimulators. Taken together, our analyses define a feedback regulatory loop between bFGF (FGF21) and Wnt signaling acting through beta-catenin in skin fibroblasts.

TI  - Study protocol on establishment of sentinel sites network for contraceptive and abortion trends, needs and utilization of services in Zika virus affected countries
T2  - REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: ZIKV(Zika Virus) during pregnancy can result in many adverse events such as fetal deaths or newborns with congenital abnormalities including microcephaly and other neural irregularities. Due to these harmful outcomes of pregnancy associated with the Zika virus, we can expect to see a change in the type and scale of demand for family planning and safe abortion services in areas affected by the Zika virus. The monitoring and reporting capacities of the local health clinics in these areas could benefit from the introduction of infrastructural improvements necessary to establish a sentinel site network. Through these sites, the WHO will collect data on the situation from local health professionals to get real time information from the population group and act accordingly to mitigate the consequences of the Zika virus outbreak in a localized and culturally appropriate way. The objectives are to establish a sentinel sites surveillance network for reporting on uptake and utilization of contraception and safe abortion care services; to strengthen monitoring, and data quality assurance in the selected sentinel surveillance sites; and finally to assess the contraception and safe abortion care service utilization trends in the affected sites on a regular basis.Methods: The proposal includes a set of objectives and actions that enable the creation of a set of criteria for the selection of the sentinel sites, as well the implementation of monitoring and reporting systems that will be used in data collection.Discussion: The data collected will be used to better understand the changing demand for family planning and safe abortion needs. This will ultimately be used to inform local health workers and policy makers as to how best to track the continued Zika virus outbreak and mitigate the consequences. The learning from establishment of surveillance sentinel sites will help to strengthen health systems at regional and subregional levels that are more adaptable and capable of providing reproductive healthcare services and of responding to future emergencies.

TI  - Using spatio-temporal surveillance data to test the infectious environment of children before type 1 diabetes diagnosis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The "hygiene hypothesis" postulates that reduced exposure to infections favours the development of autoimmunity and childhood type 1 diabetes (T1D). But on the other side, viruses, notably enteroviruses, are suspected to trigger T1D. The assessment of the possible relationships between infections and T1D still defies the classical tools of epidemiology. We report the methods and results of a geographical approach that maps the addresses of patients to a communicable diseases surveillance database. We mapped the addresses of patients at birth, infancy and T1D diagnosis to the weekly estimates of the regional incidences of 5 frequent communicable diseases routinely collected since 1984 by the French Sentinel network. The pre-diagnostic infectious environment of 3548 patients with T1D diagnosed between 0.5 and 15 years was compared to those of 100 series of age-matched "virtual controls" drawn randomly on the map. Associations were classified as "suggestive" (summer diarrhea, SD, and varicella, V) when p<0.05, or "significant" (influenza-like infections, ILI) when they passed the Bonferroni correction for FDR. Exposure to ILI and SD were associated with T1D risk, while V seemed protective. In the subset of 2521 patients for which we had genome wide data, we used a case-only approach to search for interactions between SNPs and the infectious environment as defined by the Sentinel database. Two SNPs, rs116624278 and rs77232854, showed significant interaction with exposure to V between 1 and 3 years of life. The infectious associations found should be taken as possible markers of patients' environment, not as direct causative factors of T1D. They require replication in other populations. The increasing public availability of geographical environmental databases will expand the present approach to map thousands of environmental factors to the lifeline of patients affected by various diseases.

TI  - Age, extent and carbon storage of the central Congo Basin peatland complex
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are carbon-rich ecosystems that cover just three per cent of Earth's land surface(1), but store one-third of soil carbon(2). Peat soils are formed by the build-up of partially decomposed organic matter under waterlogged anoxic conditions. Most peat is found in cool climatic regions where unimpeded decomposition is slower, but deposits are also found under some tropical swamp forests(2,3). Here we present field measurements from one of the world's most extensive regions of swamp forest, the Cuvette Centrale depression in the central Congo Basin(4). We find extensive peat deposits beneath the swamp forest vegetation (peat defined as material with an organic matter content of at least 65 per cent to a depth of at least 0.3 metres). Radiocarbon dates indicate that peat began accumulating from about 10,600 years ago, coincident with the onset of more humid conditions in central Africa at the beginning of the Holocene(5). The peatlands occupy large interfluvial basins, and seem to be largely rain-fed and ombrotrophic-like (of low nutrient status) systems. Although the peat layer is relatively shallow (with a maximum depth of 5.9 metres and a median depth of 2.0 metres), by combining in situ and remotely sensed data, we estimate the area of peat to be approximately 145,500 square kilometres (95 per cent confidence interval of 131,900-156,400 square kilometres), making the Cuvette Centrale the most extensive peatland complex in the tropics. This area is more than five times the maximum possible area reported for the Congo Basin in a recent synthesis of pantropical peat extent(2). We estimate that the peatlands store approximately 30.6 petagrams (30.6 x 10(15) grams) of carbon belowground (95 per cent confidence interval of 6.3-46.8 petagrams of carbon)-a quantity that is similar to the above-ground carbon stocks of the tropical forests of the entire Congo Basin(6). Our result for the Cuvette Centrale increases the best estimate of global tropical peatland carbon stocks by 36 per cent, to 104.7 petagrams of carbon (minimum estimate of 69.6 petagrams of carbon; maximum estimate of 129.8 petagrams of carbon(2)). This stored carbon is vulnerable to land-use change and any future reduction in precipitation(7,8).

TI  - The Hotspot for (Global) One Health in Primary Food Production: Aflatoxin M1 in Dairy Products
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - One Health involves the multifaceted environment-animal-human web: nevertheless, the role of toxicological issues has yet to be fully explored in this context. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination of feeds is a risk for the health of several farm animals, including fishes; milk is the only food of animal origin where a significant feed-food carry over may occur. The main AFB1-related compound present in milk is the hydroxy-metabolite aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). Besides contamination of raw milk, AFM1 is of concern for the whole dairy chain; AFM1 may also contaminate the milk of several other ruminants used for milk/dairy production. In a One Health perspective, milk represents a sentinel matrix for AFB1 vulnerability of the agro-food system, that is crucial in a phase when food/nutritional security becomes a global issue and climatic changes may affect agricultural productions. In the global setting, food chain exposure to long-term toxicants, such as AFM1, is a growing concern for economically developing countries, whereas global trade and climatic change makes AFM1 an emerging hot issue in economically developed countries as well. We critically review the state of the art on AFM1 risk assessment and risk management using two scenarios as case studies: a European Union country where the health system aims at ensuring a high-level protection of food chain (Italy) and the world's largest (and economically developing) producer of dairy products by volume (India). The case studies are used to provide building blocks for a global One Health framework.

TI  - The Genetic Architecture of Gene Expression in Peripheral Blood
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the mRNA levels for 36,778 transcript expression traits (probes) from 2,765 individuals to comprehensively investigate the genetic architecture and degree of missing heritability for gene expression in peripheral blood. We identified 11,204 cis and 3,791 trans independent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) by using linear mixed models to perform genome-wide association analyses. Furthermore, using information on both closely and distantly related individuals, heritability was estimated for all expression traits. Of the set of expressed probes (15,966), 10,580 (66%) had an estimated narrow-sense heritability (h(2)) greater than zero with a mean (median) value of 0.192 (0.142). Across these probes, on average the proportion of genetic variance explained by all eQTL (h(COlO)(2)) was 31% (0.060/0.192), meaning that 69% is missing, with the sentinel SNP of the largest eQTL explaining 87 A, (0.052/0.060) of the variance attributed to all identified cis- and trans-eQTL. For the same set of probes, the genetic variance attributed to genome-wide common (MAF > 0.01) HapMap 3 SNPs (h(q)(2)) accounted for on average 48% (0.093/0.192) of h(2). Taken together, the evidence suggests that approximately half the genetic variance for gene expression is not tagged by common SNPs, and of the variance that is tagged by common SNPs, a large proportion can be attributed to identifiable eQTL of large effect, typically in cis. Finally, we present evidence that, compared with a meta-analysis, using individual-level data results in an increase of approximately 50% in power to detect eQTL.

TI  - Mapping the soil loss in Marqya basin: Syria using RUSLE model in GIS and RS techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil loss by water is the most important eco-environmental threat in Marqya basin without conservation measures. Mapping the soil loss is a useful and necessary in planning and maintenance works in Marqya river basin. At present study, the soil loss model, revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) integrated with GIS and RS techniques (DEM and Landsat 8 OLI image) remote sensing data) to map soil loss in the Marqya basin, located in the west part of Syria. The Marqya basin is a Mediterranean coastal humid area, and covers a drainage area of 384 km(2). Soil loss affected by rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, topography, vegetation, and conservation support practice factors. According to RUSLE model, soil loss was mapped through the production of raster maps of previous factors and then was multiplied by using GIS and RS techniques. The results show that 58% of the study basin has a low loss of soil, 27% moderate loss, 11% high loss, and 4% a very high loss, respectively. Marqya basin is in the extremely severe level of soil erosion rates with about 15% of land affected by high and very high soil loss risk. Consequently, the produced map represents the first step in the right direction to start taking the maintenance and support procedures with spatial implementations.

TI  - Prediction of Dominant Forest Tree Species Using QuickBird and Environmental Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling the spatial distribution of plants is one of the indirect methods for predicting the properties of plants and can be defined based on the relationship between the spatial distribution of vegetation and environmental variables. In this article, we introduce a new method for the spatial prediction of the dominant trees and species, through a combination of environmental and satellite data. Based on the basal area factor (BAF) frequency for each tree species in a total of 518 sample plots, the dominant tree species were determined for each plot. Also, topographical maps of primary and secondary properties were prepared using the digital elevation model (DEM). Categories of soil and the climate maps database of the Doctor Bahramnia Forestry Plan were extracted as well. After pre-processing and processing of spectral data, the pixel values at the sample locations in all the independent factors such as spectral and non-spectral data, were extracted. The modelling rates of tree and shrub species diversity using data mining algorithms of 80% of the sampling plots were taken. Assessment of model accuracy was conducted using 20% of samples and evaluation criteria. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) algorithms were used for spatial distribution modelling of dominant species groups using environmental and spectral variables from 80% of the sample plots. Results showed physiographic factors, especially altitude in combination with soil and climate factors as the most important variables in the distribution of species, while the best model was created by the integration of physiographic factors (in combination with soil and climate) with an overall accuracy of 63.85%. In addition, the results of the comparison between the algorithms, showed that the RF algorithm was the most accurate in modelling the diversity.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of Siachen Glacier (East Karakoram), in terms of its area and elevation change, velocity variations and mass budget, utilizing different satellite datasets including Landsat, Hexagon, Cartosat-I, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar and Japanese Advanced Land Observing Satellite Phased Array-type L-band SAR. The total areal extent of Siachen Glacier did not change significantly between 1980 and 2014; however the exposed-ice area decreased during that period. The terminus of the glacier has experienced substantial downwasting (on average 30 m) over the period of 1999-2007, followed by a retreat of the transition between exposed and debris-covered ice by a distance of 1.3 km during the short span 2007-14. The spatial patterns of the elevation difference and velocity are heterogeneous over the large areal extent of Siachen Glacier. The average velocity of the entire glacier, as computed between 11 December 2008 and 26 January 2009, was 12.3 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1), while those estimated separately for the accumulation and ablation regions were 9.7 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1) and 20.4 +/- 0.4 cm d(-1), respectively. The mass budget of Siachen Glacier is estimated to be -0.03 +/- 0.21 m w.e. a(-1) for the period of 1999-2007.

TI  - Determining Pleiades satellite data capability for tree diversity modeling
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling of the spatial distribution of tree species based on survey data has recently been applied to conservation planning. Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Pleiades satellite data for modeling tree species diversity of Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran (Mazandaran Province). One-hundred sample plots were established over an area of 2,600 ha and surveyed for tree diversity, and the Simpson's index (D), Shannon's index (H') and the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) were calculated for each plot. Spectral variables and several parameters derived by texture analysis were obtained from multispectral images of the study area and used as predictors of tree diversity of sample plots. Two different methods, including generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used for modeling. The results revealed a fairly good prediction of plot tree diversity obtained using the developed models (adj-R-2 = 0.542-0.731). Shannon's H' and Simpson's 1/D indices were more accurately predicted using GAM-based methods, while MARS models were more suitable for predicting Simpson's D. We concluded that Pleiades satellite data can be conveniently used for estimating, assessing and monitoring tree species diversity in the mixed hardwood Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran.

TI  - Potential CO<sub>2</sub> Emission Due to Loss of Above Ground Biomass from the Indian Sundarban Mangroves During the Last Four Decades
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sundarban, the largest single patch of mangrove forest of the world is shared by Bangladesh (similar to 60 %) and India (similar to 40 %). Loss of mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide is reported from different parts of the world. We estimated the loss of above ground mangrove biomass and subsequent potential emission of carbon dioxide in the Indian part of the Sundarban during the last four decades. The loss of mangrove area has been estimated with the help of remotely sensed data and potential emission of carbon dioxide has been evaluated with the help of published above ground biomass data of Indian Sundarban. Total loss of mangrove area was found to be 107 km(2) between the year 1975 and 2013. Amongst the total loss similar to 60 % was washed away in the water by erosion, similar to 23 % was converted into barren lands and the rest were anthropogenically transformed into other landforms. The potential carbon dioxide emission due to the degradation of above ground biomass was estimated to be 1567.98 +/- 551.69 Gg during this period, which may account to 64.29 million $ in terms of the social cost of carbon. About three-forth of the total mangrove loss was found in the peripheral islands which are much more prone to erosion. Climate induced changes and anthropogenic land use change could be the major driving force behind this loss of 'blue carbon'.

TI  - Delineation of riparian vegetation from Landsat multi-temporal imagery using PCA
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - A deficiency in crucial digital data, such as vegetation cover, in remote regions is a challenging issue for water management and planning, especially for areas undergoing rapid development, such as mining in the Pilbara, Western Australia. This is particularly relevant to riparian vegetation, which provides important ecological services and, as such, requires regional protection. The objective of this research was to develop an approach to riparian vegetation mapping at a regional scale using remotely sensed data. The proposed method was based on principal component analysis applied to multi-temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index datasets derived from Landsat TM 5 imagery. To delimit the spatial extent of riparian vegetation, a thresholding method was required and various thresholding algorithms were tested. The accuracy of results was estimated for various Normalized Difference Vegetation Index multi-temporal datasets using available ground-truth data. The combination of a 14-dry-date dataset and Kittler's thresholding method provided the most accurate delineation of riparian vegetation.

TI  - A comparison between London and Baghdad surface urban heat islands and possible engineering mitigation solution
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study adopts remote sensing techniques to compare the Surface urban Heat Island (SUHI) in Baghdad and London as they represent different climatic conditions, natural environments and levels of urban development. It tests the reported correlation of land surface temperature (LST) with land cover in the literature under different conditions and, based on the findings, suggests engineering mitigation strategies for each city. The land surface was characterized using supervised classification and spectral indices, using the Landsat 8 optical bands (27), and the LST was retrieved from Landsats thermal band 10 after emissivity calibration. Two Landsat 8 satellite images were used, acquired in July 2013 when maximum surface temperature would be expected in both these capital cities. Image processing included radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction and various land surface indices were then calculated. The independent validation of land cover types was performed using higher spatial resolution optical data, and LST patterns were validated using ASTER thermal images. Land cover types or indices and land surface temperature display high correlations, with most having a positive relationship with LST, but vegetation has a negative relationship. The hottest surface type also differs for the two cities. Consequently, covering the soil in Baghdad with new construction, for example, reduces the surface temperature and hence urban heat island effect, while the same action in London increases it. Thus, engineering solutions to urban heat island issues need to take local factors into account. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The meaning of being in uncertainty after heart transplantation - an unrevealed source to distress
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: As many as 88% of heart transplant recipients (HTRs) suffer from psychological distress. Both psychosocial factors and physical health are associated with increased psychological distress. However, the causes and impacts of psychological distress are unclear. HTRs strive for a sense of control over their health and daily lives in order to improve their psychological well-being. Perceived control was found to be related to the patients' construction of normality, their emotional state, as well as their thoughts and feelings of uncertainty about the future.Aim: An in-depth exploration of the meaning of uncertainty during the first year after a heart transplantation (HTX).Method: A phenomenological-hermeneutic method was employed. Interviews were conducted with 14 patients, four women and ten men, with a mean age of 51 years (range: 28-67 years).Results: Being in uncertainty after HTX means losing a sense of coherence, which shatters the HTR's whole worldview. The HTRs search for meaning and strive for coherence, which is no longer achievable. By using a nursing theory, we understand that uncertainty should be seen as a natural state among HTRs. It constitutes the starting point from which the HTRs can reorganise their self-structure and find a new view of life. When striving for normality, certainty and predictability (i.e., the healthcare professional's perspective), we block or prolong this process, thus causing distress among HTRs because they are unable to create a new orientation in life.Conclusion: This study presents a hypothesis of the primary cause of psychological distress after HTX and provides a useful framework for how to approach this condition.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important qualitative aspects of wetland ecosystem management is preserving the natural quality of water in such environments. This would not be achievable unless continuous water quality monitoring is implemented. With the recent advances in remote sensing technology, this technology could assist us to produce accurate models for estimating water quality variables in the ecosystem of wetlands. The present study was carried out to evaluate the capability of remote sensing data to estimate the water quality variables [pH, total suspended solids (TSS), total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, chloride and the concentration of chlorophyll a] in Zarivar International Wetland using linear regression (LR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models. For this purpose, spectral reflectance of bands 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the OLI sensor of Landsat 8 was utilized as the input data and the collected chemical and physical data of water samples were selected as the objective data for both ANN and LR models. Based on our results overall, ANN model was the proper model compared with LR model. The spectral reflectance in bands 5 and 4 of OLI sensor revealed the best results to estimate TDS, TSS, turbidity and chlorophyll in comparison with other used bands in ANN model, respectively. We conclude that OLI sensor data are an excellent means for studying physical properties of water quality and comparing its chemical properties.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Djelfa area in the central Saharan Atlas is characterized by its high lithological diversity with different facies from the Triassic to the Tertiary. The lack of published geological maps of the region ( Djelfa) prompted us to test specific processing of satellite images ( ratio bands, principal component analysis) in order to establish a lithological discrimination of the region. Several treatments allowed us to map the lineaments highlighting the various tectonic structures of the region. The combination of field and remote sensing data pointed out the double influence of the E-W Eocene and N-S Miocene phases in the structuration of these regions. As a large part of the Djelfa area is inaccessible, the obtained results undeniably contribute to a better understanding of the local geology.

TI  - Land cover changes as impacted by spatio-temporal rainfall variability along the Ethiopian Rift Valley escarpment
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnitudes of land cover changes nowadays can be assessed properly, but their driving forces are subject to many discussions. Next to the accepted role of human influence, the impact of natural climate variability is often neglected. In this paper, the impact of rainfall variability on land cover changes (LCC) is investigated for the western escarpment of the Raya Graben along the northern Ethiopian Rift Valley. First, LCC between 2000 and 2014 were analysed at specific time steps using Landsat imagery. Based on the obtained LCC maps, the link was set with rainfall variability, obtained by means of the satellite-derived rainfall estimates (RFEs) from NOAA-CPC. After a correction by the incorporation of local meteorological station data, these estimates prove to be good estimators for the actual amount of precipitation (rho (RFE1.0) = 0.85, p = 0.00, n = 126; rho (RFE2.0) = 0.76, p = 0.00, n = 934). By performing several linear regression analyses, a significant positive relationship between the precipitation parameter DIFF 5Y (i.e. the at-RFE pixel scale difference in five-year average annual precipitation for the two periods preceding the land cover maps) and the changes in the woody vegetation cover was found (standardised regression coefficient beta = 0.23, p = 0.02, n = 108). Despite the dominance of direct human impact, further greening of the study area can be expected for the future concomitantly to a wetter climate, if all other factors remain constant.

TI  - Measuring ocean waves in sea ice using SAR imagery: A quasi-deterministic approach evaluated with Sentinel-1 and in situ data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of wave heights in marginal ice zones are limited to very few in situ data. Here we revisit the linear and quasilinear theories of Synthetic Aperture Radar imaging of waves in the particular case of waves in sea ice. Instead of only working with spectra, we have developed an iterative nonlinear algorithm to estimate phase-resolved deterministic maps of wave-induced orbital velocities, from which elevation spectra can be derived. Application of this algorithm to Sentinel lA wave mode images in the Southern Ocean shows that it produces reasonable results for swells in all directions except when they propagate at a few degrees off the range direction. The estimate of wave parameters is expected to work best when the shortest wave components, those which cause a pixel displacement of the order of the dominant wavelength in azimuth, can be neglected. Otherwise short waves produce a blurring of the image, increasing exponentially with the azimuthal wavenumber and reducing the estimated wave amplitude. Given the expected spatial attenuation of waves in ice-covered regions, our deterministic method should apply beyond a few tens of kilometers in the ice, without any correction for short wave effects. In situ data collected around the ice edge as part of the 2015 SeaState DRI cruise in the Beaufort confirm the progressive image blurring caused by such short waves, and the apparent reduction in the wave modulation. When short waves propagate from the open ocean towards the ice, this blurring can produce an unrealistic apparent increase of wave height, from the open ocean up to a few tens of kilometers inside the ice.

TI  - Regional Features of Long-term Variability of the Black Sea Surface Temperature
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional features of long-term variability of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Black Sea are analyzed using the satellite data for 1982-2014. It is demonstrated that the maximum intraannual and interannual variability of SST is registered on the northwestern shelf of the Black Sea. The high level of interannual variability of SST and maximum linear trends are observed in the northeastern part of the sea. The qualitative connection is revealed between the long-term variability of SST and the variations in the intensity of the Black Sea Rim Current in the long-term seasonal cycle. An increase in the level of interannual variability of SST is observed in summer, when the Black Sea Rim Current weakens. The significant negative correlation is revealed between the interannual anomalies of SST and the NAO index. The highest correlation coefficients are obtained for the eastern part of the Black Sea and near the Crimean coast.

TI  - Relative contribution of monsoon precipitation and pumping to changes in groundwater storage in India
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The depletion of groundwater resources threatens food and water security in India. However, the relative influence of groundwater pumping and climate variability on groundwater availability and storage remains unclear. Here we show from analyses of satellite and local well data spanning the past decade that long-term changes in monsoon precipitation are driving groundwater storage variability in most parts of India either directly by changing recharge or indirectly by changing abstraction. We find that groundwater storage has declined in northern India at the rate of 2 cm yr(-1) and increased by 1 to 2 cm yr(-1) in southern India between 2002 and 2013. We find that a large fraction of the total variability in groundwater storage in north-central and southern India can be explained by changes in precipitation. Groundwater storage variability in northwestern India can be explained predominantly by variability in abstraction for irrigation, which is in turn influenced by changes in precipitation. Declining precipitation in northern India is linked to Indian Ocean warming, suggesting a previously unrecognized teleconnection between ocean temperatures and groundwater storage.

TI  - A New Cloud Computing Architecture for the Classification of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new distributed architecture for supervised classification of large volumes of earth observation data on a cloud computing environment. The architecture supports distributed execution, network communication, and fault tolerance in a transparent way to the user. The architecture is composed of three abstraction layers, which support the definition and implementation of applications by researchers from different scientific investigation fields. The implementation of architecture is also discussed. A software prototype (available online), which runs machine learning routines implemented on the cloud using the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA), a popular free software licensed under the GNU General Public License, is used for validation. Performance issues are addressed through an experimental analysis in which two supervised classifiers available in WEKA were used: random forest and support vector machines. This paper further describes how to include other classification methods in the available software prototype

TI  - Application of Remotely-Sensed Data to Estimate a Water Budget for Data-Scarce Endorheic Basins: A Case Study of Lake Urmia basin, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the water budgets of large basins is a challenge because of the lack of data and information. It becomes more complicated in endorheic basins that consist of separate land and water phases. The application of remotely-sensed data is one solution in this regard. The present study addresses this issue and develops a modeling framework to evaluate a water budget based on remotely-sensed data for endorheic basins. To explore the methodology, Lake Urmia basin was selected as a case study. The lake water level has declined steeply since 1995 and stakeholders have agreed to allocate 3100 MCM of water per year to the lake. This makes it necessary to monitor river inflow into the lake to fulfill the agreement. Gauging stations have been employed around the lake, but they could not account for shortages such as water uptake below the stations. To do this, separate water budgets for the water body and the land were required. More specifically, it was necessary to estimate actual evapotranspiration (ET (a) ) from freshwater (E (f) ) and saltwater (E (s) ) estimated using the SEBAL model. Different methods were applied to estimate soil moisture, groundwater exploitation, and surface-groundwater inflow into the lake. A comparison of the observed and estimated amounts showed good agreement. For instance, the coefficient of determination for the observed/reported and estimated ET (a) and E (f) were 0.83 and 0.84, respectively. The average annual inflow was estimated to be 2.2 BCM/year for 2002-2008 using the RS model, which is about 84 % of the total inflow from the last recording stations before the lake and shows influence of water exploitation after these stations. Future study should focus on increasing temporal and spatial resolution of the method.

TI  - Temperature and light patterns at four reefs along the Great Barrier Reef during the 2015-2016 austral summer: understanding patterns of observed coral bleaching
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from real-time sensor networks along the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) over the 2015-2016 austral summer showed that reef water temperatures exceeded empirical coral bleaching thresholds at a number of sites. Temperatures in the southern GBR were within historically normal limits with temperatures below the empirical bleaching threshold. The central GBR just reached the empirical bleaching threshold while, in the north, Lizard Island recorded four consecutive days above the bleaching threshold. Thursday Island in the far northern GBR experienced 10 days above the bleaching threshold. The in situ data predicted only slight bleaching in the southern GBR, moderate bleaching in the central GBR, widespread bleaching in the north and severe bleaching in the far north, which compares well with the initial survey data. Peak temperatures occurred later in the year in the north (mid-March 2016) than in the south (early February 2015) with temperatures remaining above the long-term mean well into the austral autumn. Comparison against satellite sea surface temperature data highlighted issues of cloud cover with data only being available for 30-40% of days over the summer. While the agreement with the in situ data was good, the satellite data missed fine-scale events and under-estimated the event at Thursday Island.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Urban Microclimate Change in L'Aquila City (Italy) after Post-Earthquake Depopulation in an Open Source GIS Environment
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work reports a first attempt to use Landsat satellite imagery to identify possible urban microclimate changes in a city center after a seismic event that affected L'Aquila City (Abruzzo Region, Italy), on 6 April 2009. After the main seismic event, the collapse of part of the buildings, and the damaging of most of them, with the consequence of an almost total depopulation of the historic city center, may have caused alterations to the microclimate. This work develops an inexpensive work flow-using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) scenes-to construct the evolution of urban land use after the catastrophic main seismic event that hit L'Aquila. We hypothesized, that, possibly, before the event, the temperature was higher in the city center due to the presence of inhabitants (and thus home heating); while the opposite case occurred in the surrounding areas, where new settlements of inhabitants grew over a period of a few months. We decided not to look to independent meteorological data in order to avoid being biased in their investigations; thus, only the smallest dataset of Landsat ETM+ scenes were considered as input data in order to describe the thermal evolution of the land surface after the earthquake. We managed to use the Landsat archive images to provide thermal change indications, useful for understanding the urban changes induced by catastrophic events, setting up an easy to implement, robust, reproducible, and fast procedure.

TI  - Assessing agricultural drought in summer over Oklahoma Mesonet sites using the water-related vegetation index from MODIS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought, a common phenomenon in most parts of the world, is one of the most challenging natural hazards to monitor effectively. Land surface water index (LSWI), calculated as a normalized ratio between near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR), is sensitive to vegetation and soil water content. This study examined the potential of a LSWI-based, drought-monitoring algorithm to assess summer drought over 113 Oklahoma Mesonet stations comprising various land cover and soil types in Oklahoma. Drought duration in a year was determined by the number of days with LSWI < 0 (DNLSWI) during summer months (June-August). Summer rainfall anomalies and LSWI anomalies followed a similar seasonal dynamics and showed strong correlations (r (2) = 0.62-0.73) during drought years (2001, 2006, 2011, and 2012). The DNLSWI tracked the east-west gradient of summer rainfall in Oklahoma. Drought intensity increased with increasing duration of DNLSWI, and the intensity increased rapidly when DNLSWI was more than 48 days. The comparison between LSWI and the US Drought Monitor (USDM) showed a strong linear negative relationship; i.e., higher drought intensity tends to have lower LSWI values and vice versa. However, the agreement between LSWI-based algorithm and USDM indicators varied substantially from 32 % (D (2) class, moderate drought) to 77 % (0 and D (0) class, no drought) for different drought intensity classes and varied from similar to 30 % (western Oklahoma) to > 80 % (eastern Oklahoma) across regions. Our results illustrated that drought intensity thresholds can be established by counting DNLSWI (in days) and used as a simple complementary tool in several drought applications for semi-arid and semi-humid regions of Oklahoma. However, larger discrepancies between USDM and the LSWI-based algorithm in arid regions of western Oklahoma suggest the requirement of further adjustment in the algorithm for its application in arid regions.

TI  - Impact of anomalous forest fire on aerosol radiative forcing and snow cover over Himalayan region
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are very common in tropical region during February May months and are known to have significant impact on ecosystem dynamics. Moreover, aerosols emitted from these burning activities significantly modulate the Earth's radiation budget. In present study, we investigated the anomalous forest fire events and their impact on atmospheric radiation budget and glaciated snow cover over the Himalayan region. We used multiple dataset derived from satellites [Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO)] and reanalysis models [Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS), Second Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Application (MERRA-2) and ERA-interim] to evaluate the effect of biomass burning aerosols on radiation budget. April 2016 is associated with anomalous fire activities over lower Himalayan region in the last fourteen years (2003-2016). The model estimated organic carbon (OC) and black carbon (BC) emission reaches up to similar to 3 x 10(4) and similar to 2 x 10(3) mu g/m(2)/day, respectively during the biomass burning period of April 2016. The meteorological data analysis accompanied with CALIOP aerosol vertical profile shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could reach up to similar to 5-7 km altitude and could be transported towards glaciated region of upper Himalayas. The large amount of BC/OC from biomass burning significantly modulates the atmospheric radiation budget. The estimated columnar heating rate shows that these carbonaceous aerosols could heat up the atmosphere by similar to 0.04-0.06 K/day in April-2016 with respect to non-burning period (2015). The glaciated snow cover fractions are found to be decreasing by similar to 5-20% in 2016 as compared to long term mean (2003-2016). The combined analyses of various climatic factors, fires and associated BC emissions show that the observed snow cover decrease could be results of increased surface/atmospheric temperature due to combined effect of large scale climatic changes and BC absorption. Our results suggest that biomass burning can have significant effects on the Himalayan region, particularly in view of its importance in hydrological cycle and ecosystem. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - <i>Mille modis morimur</i>: We die in a thousand ways
T2  - APOPTOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dying cells subjected to apoptotic programs are engulfed by neighboring cells or by professional phago-cytes, without inflammation or immunological reactions in the tissue where apoptosis takes place. Apoptotic cells release danger-associated project signals to their neighbours, through different molecular patterns, stimulate antigen production and immune responses. Microenvironmental effects with several functional consequences indicate that cell death is a complex process and may take place in several ways. This idea is expressed by the title of the Special Issue and by the title of the guest editorial "Mille modis morimur" meaning that not only multicellular organisms, but also single cells may die in a thousand ways. This idea is demonstrated by the papers serving as examples for cell death. Apoptosis was induced by clary sage oil in Candida cells. Heavy metal (Gd) induced cell motility and apoptosis was found in mammalian cells. RNA oxidation enhanced the reversion frequency of apoptosis in yeast mutants. The frequency of apoptotic micronucleus formation increased in a concentration-dependent manner by methotrexate. The antioxidant coenzyme Q10 protected renal proximal tubule cells against nicotine-induced apoptosis. The synergy of 2-deoxy-d-glucose combined with berberine induced lysosome/ autophagy. The mitochondrial apoptotic pathway could be regulated by glucocorticoid receptor in collaboration with Bcl-2 family proteins in developing T cells. Cylindrospermopsin induced biochemical changes led to apoptosis in plants. Mechanisms of stress seriously impacted the risk of apoptosis. Transcriptional control of apoptotic cell clearance was achieved by macrophage nuclear receptors. Finally, the clinical aspects of apoptosis-induced lymphopenia were reviewed in sepsis and other severe injuries. These examples not only support the view of many ways of cell death, but predict further potential ways to induce or reduce the risk of cell death.

TI  - Dynamic Programming Model for the System of a Non-Uniform Deficit Irrigation and a Reservoir
T2  - IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes two optimization models for uniform and non-uniform deficit irrigation. In the first model, the objective function consists of a benefit-cost ratio. The deficit irrigation ratio was determined by dynamic programming, according to the reservoir releases, and minimized a damage function (objective function). The second model used dynamic programming to develop an integrated optimization of non-uniform deficit irrigation and reservoir operation. The comparison between the results of the models shows that when applying the second model the cropping area, volume of water regulated by the reservoir, annual production, gross income and benefit-cost ratio increased by 48, 43, 48, 47 and 2.4%, respectively. Therefore, integrated dynamic programming of a non-uniform deficit irrigation and reservoir system can be recommended to increase the integrated productivity of a storage dam and irrigation system.

TI  - Impact of Autocidal Gravid Ovitraps on Chikungunya Virus Incidence in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Areas With and Without Traps
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Puerto Rico detected the first confirmed case of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in May 2014 and the virus rapidly spread throughout the island. The invasion of CHIKV allowed us to observe Aedes aegypti (L.) densities, infection rates, and impact of vector control in urban areas using CDC autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGO traps) for mosquito control over several years. Because local mosquitoes can only get the virus from infectious residents, detecting the presence of virus in mosquitoes functions as a proxy for the presence of virus in people. We monitored the incidence of CHIKV in gravid females of Ae. aegypti in four neighborhoods- two with three AGO traps per home in most homes and two nearby neighborhoods without AGO mosquito control traps. Monitoring of mosquito density took place weekly using sentinel AGO traps from June to December 2014. In all, 1,334 pools of female Ae. aegypti (23,329 individuals) were processed by real- time reverse transcription PCR to identify CHIKV and DENV RNA. Density of Ae. aegypti females was 10.5 times lower (91%) in the two areas with AGO control traps during the study. Ten times (90.9%) more CHIKV- positive pools were identified in the nonintervention areas (50/55 pools) than in intervention areas (5/55). We found a significant linear relationship between the number of positive pools and both density of Ae. aegypti and vector index (average number of expected infected mosquitoes per trap per week). Temporal and spatial patterns of positive CHIKV pools suggested limited virus circulation in areas with AGO traps.

TI  - Lymphocyte function following radium-223 therapy in patients with metastasized, castration-resistant prostate cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Therapy with the alpha-emitter radium-223 chloride (Ra-223) is an innovative therapeutic option in patients with metastasized, castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, radiotherapy can lead to hematopoietic toxicity. The aim of this study was to determine if Ra-223 therapy induces an impairment of cellular antimicrobial immune responses.In 11 patients receiving Ra-223 treatment, lymphocyte proliferation and the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma and interleukin-10) were determined, using lymphocyte transformation testing and ELISpot, respectively. Lymphocyte function after stimulation with mitogens and microbial antigens was assessed prior to therapy and at day 1, 7 and 28 after therapy.Lymphocyte proliferation and the production of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 towards mitogens and antigens remained unchanged after therapy. Consistent with these in vitro data, we did not observe infectious complications after treatment.The results argue against an impairment of lymphocyte function after Ra-223 therapy. Thus, immune responses against pathogens should remain unaffected.

TI  - Effects of drought on child health in Marsabit District, Northern Kenya
T2  - ECONOMICS & HUMAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses five years of panel data (2009-2013) for Northern Kenya's Marsabit district to analyze the levels and extent of malnutrition among children aged five and under in that area. We measure drought based on the standardized normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and assess its effect on child health using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). The results show that approximately 20 percent of the children in the study area are malnourished and a one standard deviation increase in NDVI z-score decreases the probability of child malnourishment by 12-16 percent. These findings suggest that remote sensing data can be usefully applied to develop and evaluate new interventions to reduce drought effects on child malnutrition, including better coping strategies and improved targeting of food aid.

TI  - Phenology from Landsat when data is scarce: Using MODIS and Dynamic Time-Warping to combine multi-year Landsat imagery to derive annual phenology curves
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Green-leaf phenology describes the development of vegetation throughout a growing season and greatly affects the interaction between climate and the biosphere. Remote sensing is a valuable tool to characterize phenology over large areas but doing at fine- to medium resolution (e.g., with Landsat data) is difficult because of low numbers of cloud-free images in a single year. One way to overcome data availability limitations is to merge multi-year imagery into one time series, but this requires accounting for phenological differences among years. Here we present a new approach that employed a time series of a MODIS vegetation index data to quantify interannual differences in phenology, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to re-align multi-year Landsat images to a common phenology that eliminates year-to-year phenological differences. This allowed us to estimate annual phenology curves from Landsat between 2002 and 2012 from which we extracted key phenological dates in a Monte-Carlo simulation design, including green-up (GU), start-of-season (SoS), maturity (Mat), senescence (Sen), end-of-season (EoS) and dormancy (Dorm). We tested our approach in eight locations across the United States that represented forests of different types and without signs of recent forest disturbance. We compared Landsat-based phenological transition dates to those derived from MODIS and ground-based camera data from the PhenoCam-network. The Landsat and MODIS comparison showed strong agreement. Dates of green-up, start-of-season and maturity were highly correlated (r 0.86-0.95), as were senescence and end-of-season dates (r > 0.85) and dormancy (r > 0.75). Agreement between the Landsat and PhenoCam was generally lower, but correlation coefficients still exceeded 0.8 for all dates. In addition, because of the high data density in the new Landsat time series, the confidence intervals of the estimated keydates were substantially lower than in case of MODIS and PhenoCam. Our study thus suggests that by exploiting multi-year Landsat imagery and calibrating it with MODIS data it is possible to describe green-leaf phenology at much finer spatial resolution than previously possible, highlighting the potential for fine scale phenology maps using the rich Landsat data archive over large areas.

TI  - Culturally Adapted Behavioral Activation: A Treatment Approach for a Latino Family
T2  - CLINICAL CASE STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The scarcity of accessible culturally competent service providers and a general sense of mistrust in Eurocentric-based mental health settings exacerbate the lack of help seeking and effective therapeutic engagement for Latinos. Thus, clinical interventions that account for diverse values and worldviews may be an important step in the helpful treatment of U.S. Latino populations. Behavioral activation (BA), an evidence-based intervention for the treatment of depression, was recently evaluated through a preliminary clinical trial study in a community clinic primarily serving Spanish-speaking Latinos, and the results were promising. A culturally adapted version of BA was developed for Latinos, which took into consideration the cultural value of familismo (a collectivist worldview and preference for maintaining close connections to family); however, BA has not been previously applied to Latino families. The current case study presents the clinical treatment of a Mexican American family living in the southwest of the United States experiencing numerous stressors resulting in depressive symptoms. Specifically, this family sought therapy having experienced many negative life events, including stressors associated with institutionalized racism, their financial situation, and acculturation process. This led to a disruption of the family hierarchy, anger, unhappiness, fear, and isolation among family members. Outcomes of the intervention include a decrease in depressive symptoms and improved family communication and relationships by their involvement in activities such as attending cultural events in their community, family outings, and the children's participation in extracurricular activities.

TI  - Spatial diversity of a coastal seascape: Characterization, analysis and application for conservation
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent conservation approaches have focused on the landscape as either a conservation target or a mechanism by which conservation can be achieved. A seascape is a spatially heterogeneous surface that is generally represented as a mosaic of patches (homogeneous units of natural vegetation) with spatial and functional relationships that are organized as puzzle pieces, which represent one or several ecosystems. Spatial analysis using a landscape ecology approach offers a wide range of tools to study, monitor, manage, and conserve these areas. The objective of this study was to identify the benthic community and spatially characterize the submarine habitats of the shallow coast along the Yucatan, Mexico, to identify priority conservation areas. The study area was divided into 3 zones based on their environmental qualities, and a total of 290 sampling sites were defined from a stratified random sample based on the unsupervised classification of Landsat ETM + images. For each site, a video was taken; the substrate type was identified; and the organisms present were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. Training groups were defined by ordination analysis for the supervised classification of spectral bands and bathymetric modeling to obtain maps of the seascape, and the composition and configuration of the seascape were analyzed using spatial diversity metrics and indices. A total of 40 benthic morphotypes, predominantly brown algae and seagrass, were identified. Seven habitat types were defined along the coast based on the arrangement and spatial organization of the benthic community: bare substrate (A), sand with seagrass (B), seagrass meadow (C), seagrass with macroalgae (D), macroalgae on sand (E), flagstone with macroalgae (F), and macroalgal forest (G). The spatial configuration of the coastal seascape reflected the geomorphological characteristics of the study area and was significantly different among the three zones. Habitats G and F were present everywhere along the coast and dominated the seascape, whereas habitat C only occurred in Zone 3. Due to their structural complexity and biological richness, habitats C, D, F, and G are potentially critical for turtle, grouper, octopus, and lobster species, so these habitats are suggested as priority conservation areas to promote the conservation of these species as well as the productivity and functionality of these ecosystems.

TI  - Modified Dual Winner Takes All Approach for Tri-Stereo Image Matching Using Disparity Space Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research paper, a new framework is proposed to increase the total number of correct matches for stereo correspondence using tri-stereo images. The research work investigates some of the less explored properties of Disparity Space Image (DSI), and considers the local maxima in addition to the global maximum of the cost function and propose a new tri-stereo matching method as Modified Dual Winner Takes All (MDWTA) using edges of disparity space image. Conventionally using a single DSI from a stereo pair optimization techniques are applied to get the disparity, whereas the proposed approach uses Winner Takes All (WTA) approach using two DSIs from a triplet. The dual property of DSI that is the manner in which it stores cost for rows and columns for forward and reverse matching is introduced. This property is applied to check consistency for forward and reverse matching in a single pass, which gives initial correct matches. Next a left-centre-right consistency check is applied to discard inconsistent disparities obtained from these three views. Subsequently to obtain disparity for gaps thus generated a rule is formulated using local maxima, edges and adjacent global maximum to find correct disparity. Evaluation of the results obtained is carried by comparing them with block matching WTA method and other recent methods such as, Dynamic Programming (DP) and Semi-Global Matching (SGM) applied on images from Terrain Mapping Camera of Chandrayaan-1 and PRISM sensor of the ALOS mission. Methodology proposed is also verified using standard Middlebury stereo dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method gives an increased number of correct matches by 10-15 % as compared to basic WTA and DP. However the results obtained are better to SGM for certain regions and features.

TI  - Characterization of absorbing aerosol types using ground and satellites based observations over an urban environment
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, for the first time, an effort has been made to seasonally characterize the absorbing aerosols into different types using ground and satellite based observations. For this purpose, optical properties of aerosol retrieved from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) were utilized over Karachi for the period 2012 to 2014. Firstly, OMI AOD(abs) was validated with AERONET AODabs and found to have a high degree of correlation. Then, based on this validation, characterization was conducted by analyzing aerosol Fine Mode Fraction (FMF), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Absorption Angstrom Exponent (ME), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA) and Aerosol Index (AI) and their mutual correlation, to identify the absorbing aerosol types and also to examine the variability in seasonal distribution. The absorbing aerosols were characterized into Mostly Black Carbon (BC), Mostly Dust and Mixed BC & Dust. The results revealed that Mostly BC aerosols contributed dominantly during winter and postmonsoon whereas, Mostly Dust were dominant during summer and premonsoon. These types of absorbing aerosol were also confirmed with MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) observations.

TI  - Global Volcano Monitoring: What Does It Mean When Volcanoes Deform?
T2  - ELEMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, it is only possible to look inside an active volcano using indirect geophysical methods. One such method is to measure surface deformation, which results from subsurface magmatic or hydrothermal processes. Modern satellite data allows deformation to be measured at hundreds of volcanoes without relying on limited ground instrumentation. As a result, the number of known deforming volcanoes has increased from 44 in 1997 to over 220 in 2016. This article reviews the diverse ways by which volcanoes can deform, the typical rates and durations of such deformations, and the processes that drive deformation.

T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th Asian Aerosol Conference (AAC)
CL  - Kanazawa, JAPAN
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has recently gained attention worldwide as being responsible for severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, but point based ground monitoring stations are inadequate for understanding the spatial distribution of PM2.5 over complex urban surfaces. In this study, a new approach is introduced for prediction of PM2.5 which uses satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) and binning of meteorological variables. AOD from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C006) aerosol products, MOD04_ 3k Dark-Target (DT) at 3 km, MOD04 DT at 10 km, and MOD04 Deep-Blue (DB) at 10 km spatial resolution, and the Simplified Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) at 500 m resolution were obtained for Hong Kong and the industrialized Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The SARA AOD at 500 m alone achieved a higher correlation (R = 0.72) with PM2.5 concentrations than the MODIS C6 DT AOD at 3 km (R = 0.60), the DT AOD at 10 km (R = 0.61), and the DB AOD at 10 km (R = 0.51). The SARA binning model ([PM2.5] = 110.5 [AOD] + 12.56) was developed using SARA AOD and binning of surface pressure (996-1010 hPa). This model exhibits good correlation, accurate slope, low intercept, low errors, and accurately represents the spatial distribution of PM2.5 at 500 m resolution over urban areas. Overall, the prediction power of the SARA binning model is much better than for previous models reported for Hong Kong and East Asia, and indicates the potential value of applying meteorologically-specific empirical models and incorporating boundary layer height in operational PM2.5 forecasting from satellite AOD retrievals.

TI  - Sustainable strategies for smart cities: Analysis of the town development effect on surface urban heat island through remote sensing methodologies
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years the use of satellite remote sensing techniques has proven to be a useful tool for monitoring urban surface parameters: data provided on the reflective and thermal state of the urban texture, both at local and global scale, give fundamental information on the surface urban heat island (SUHI) control of the urban planning.In this work, the retrieval of the urban albedo and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 7 satellite data is performed over a selected area of a town in Central Italy (Terni), exhibiting a significant urban change during the last 10 years. Comparing two satellite images on 2005 and on 2015, the spatial pattern of albedo and LST shows an average albedo decrease of 0.03 during this period and a daytime SUHI increase of 2.3 degrees C.As highlighted by a focused local scale analysis, built-up area modifications moved towards both a reduction and an increase of the surface albedo, comparing the previous situation of the area and the reflective properties of materials chosen for the new settlements or refurbishments.The proposed analysis with remote sensing data may be considered an effective indicator able to point out if urban changes like interventions and new constructions move towards an urban sustainable development in terms of SUHI mitigation.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Scientific Meeting on Geoecology in Extreme Environments - Mountains and Semiarid Areas
CL  - Logrono, SPAIN
AB  - As a member of the European Union, Italy has committed to the maintenance and protection of its forests based on sustainable forest development and management practices. According to Eurostat, Italy has the seventh largest forest surface available for wood supply in the EU-28, which is equal to 8.086 million hectares. For 2012, the Italian National Institute of Statistics estimated the total roundwood production of Italy to be 7.7 million m(3), from a harvested forest surface of 61,038 ha. Large parts of the country's forests, mainly located in vulnerable mountainous landscapes that are highly sensitive to environmental changes, are subject to anthropogenic disturbance driven by wood supply interests. Despite the extensive logging activities and the well-known impacts that such management practices have on the soil-related forest ecosystems, there is a lack of spatially and temporally explicit information about the removal of trees. Hence, this study aims to: i) assess the soil loss by water erosion in Italian forest areas, ii) map forest harvests and.iii) evaluate the effects of logging activities in terms of soil loss by means of comprehensive remote sensing and GIS modelling techniques. The study area covers about 785.6 x 10(4) ha, which corresponds, to the main forest units of the CORINE land cover 2006 database (i.e. broad-leaved forests, coniferous forests and mixed forests). Annual forest logging activities were mapped using Landsat iinagery. Validation procedures were applied. A revised version of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was used to predict the soil loss potential due to rill and inter-till processes. To ensure a thorough modelling approach, the input parameters were calculated using the original methods reported in the USDA handbooks. The derived high-resolution data regarding forest cover change shows that 317,535 ha (4.04% of the total forest area in Italy) were harvested during the period under review. The predicted long-term annual average soil loss rate was 0.54 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). The average rate of soil loss in forests that remained undisturbed during the modelled period is equal to 0.33 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1). Notably, about half of the soil loss (45.3%) was predicted for the logged areas, even-though these cover only about 10.6% of the Italian forests. The identified erosion hotspots may represent a serious threat for the soil-related forest ecosystems, and are in contrast to the EC Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection and Water Framework Directive.

TI  - Atmospheric Water Balance and Variability in the MERRA-2 Reanalysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Closing and balancing Earth's global water cycle remains a challenge for the climate community. Observations are limited in duration, global coverage, and frequency, and not all water cycle terms are adequately observed. Reanalyses aim to fill the gaps through the assimilation of as many atmospheric water vapor observations as possible. Former generations of reanalyses have demonstrated a number of systematic problems that have limited their use in climate studies, especially regarding low-frequency trends. This study characterizes the NASA Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) water cycle relative to contemporary reanalyses and observations. MERRA-2 includes measures intended to minimize the spurious global variations related to inhomogeneity in the observational record. The global balance and cycling of water from ocean to land is presented, with special attention given to the water vapor analysis increment and the effects of the changing observing system. While some systematic regional biases can be identified, MERRA-2 produces temporally consistent time series of total column water and transport of water from ocean to land. However, the interannual variability of ocean evaporation is affected by the changing surface-wind-observing system, and precipitation variability is closely related to the evaporation. The surface energy budget is also strongly influenced by the interannual variability of the ocean evaporation. Furthermore, evaluating the relationship of temperature and water vapor indicates that the variations of water vapor with temperature are weaker in satellite data reanalyses, not just MERRA-2, than determined by observations, atmospheric models, or reanalyses without water vapor assimilation.

TI  - Cumulative patterns of logging and fire (1940-2009): consequences on the structure of the eastern Canadian boreal forest
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although logging has affected circumboreal forest dynamics for nearly a century, very few studies have reconstructed its influence on landscape structure at the subcontinental scale.This study aims to document spatiotemporal patterns of logging and fire since the introduction of logging in the early twentieth-century, and to evaluate the effects of these disturbances on landscape structure.We used historical (1940-2009) logging and fire maps to document disturbance patterns across a 195,000-km(2) boreal forest landscape of eastern Canada. We produced multitemporal (1970s-2010s) mosaics providing land cover status using Landsat imagery.Logging significantly increased the rate of disturbance (+74 %) in the study area. The area affected by logging increased linearly with time resulting in a significant rejuvenation of the landscape along the harvesting pattern (south-north progression). From 1940 to 2009, fire was the dominant disturbance and showed a more random spatial distribution than logging. The recent increase of fire influence and the expansion of the proportion of area classified as unproductive terrestrial land suggest that regeneration failures occurred.This study reveals how logging has modified the disturbances dynamics, following the progression of the logging frontier. Future management practices should aim for a dispersed spatial distribution of harvests to generate landscape structures that are closer to natural conditions, in line with ecosystem-based management. The challenges of defining sustainable practices will remain complex with the predicted increase in fire frequency, since this factor, in combination with logging, can alter both the structure and potentially the resilience of boreal forest.

TI  - College Students' Appreciative Attitudes Toward Atheists
T2  - RESEARCH IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atheists are often marginalized in discussions of religious and spiritual pluralism on college campuses and beyond. As with other minority worldview groups, atheists face challenges with hostile campus climates and misunderstanding of their views. The present study used a large, multi-institutional sample to explore predictors of non-atheist college students' appreciative attitudes toward atheists. Substantial differences were found across identities; secular and spiritual worldview groups hold the most positive views, whereas Christians and Muslims have the most negative attitudes. Interactions with worldview diversity-but not general religious/spiritual engagement-consistently predict more positive attitudes, and these relationships sometimes vary based on students' own worldviews. These results suggest that colleges and universities can create more inclusive environments for atheists, who constitute a sizable minority group on today's college campuses.

TI  - Relationships between hyperspectral data and components of vegetation biomass in Low Arctic tundra communities at Ivotuk, Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming in the Arctic has resulted in a lengthening of the growing season and changes to the distribution and composition of tundra vegetation including increased biomass quantities in the Low Arctic. Biomass has commonly been estimated using broad-band greenness indices such as NDVI; however, vegetation changes in the Arctic are occurring at spatial scales within a few meters. The aim of this paper is to assess the ability of hyperspectral remote sensing data to estimate biomass quantities among different plant tissue type categories at the North Slope site of Ivotuk, Alaska. Hand-held hyperspectral data and harvested biomass measurements were collected during the 1999 growing season. A subset of the data was used as a training set, and was regressed against the hyperspectral bands using LASSO. LASSO is a modification of SPLS and is a variable selection technique that is useful in studies with high collinearity among predictor variables such as hyperspectral remote sensing. The resulting equations were then used to predict biomass quantities for the remaining Ivotuk data. The majority of significant biomass-spectra relationships (65%) were for shrubs categories during all times of the growing season and bands in the blue, green, and red edge wavelength regions of the spectrum. The ability to identify unique biomass-spectra relationships per community is decreased at the height of the growing season when shrubs obscure lower-lying vegetation such as mosses. The results of this study support previous research arguing that shrubs are dominant controls over spectral reflectance in Low Arctic communities and that this dominance results in an increased ability to estimate shrub component biomass over other plant functional types.

TI  - Seasonal Change in Wetland Coherence as an Aid to Wetland Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is an essential natural resource, and information about surface water conditions can support a wide variety of applications, including urban planning, agronomy, hydrology, electrical power generation, disaster relief, ecology and preservation of natural areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is recognized as an important source of data for monitoring surface water, especially under inclement weather conditions, and is used operationally for flood mapping applications. The canopy penetration capability of the microwaves also allows for mapping of flooded vegetation as a result of enhanced backscatter from what is generally believed to be a double-bounce scattering mechanism between the water and emergent vegetation. Recent investigations have shown that, under certain conditions, the SAR response signal from flooded vegetation may remain coherent during repeat satellite over-passes, which can be exploited for interferometric SAR (InSAR) measurements to estimate changes in water levels and water topography. InSAR results also suggest that coherence change detection (CCD) might be applied to wetland monitoring applications. This study examines wetland vegetation characteristics that lead to coherence in RADARSAT-2 InSAR data of an area in eastern Canada with many small wetlands, and determines the annual variation in the coherence of these wetlands using multi-temporal radar data. The results for a three-year period demonstrate that most swamps and marshes maintain coherence throughout the ice-/snow-free time period for the 24-day repeat cycle of RADARSAT-2. However, open water areas without emergent aquatic vegetation generally do not have suitable coherence for CCD or InSAR water level estimation. We have found that wetlands with tree cover exhibit the highest coherence and the least variance; wetlands with herbaceous cover exhibit high coherence, but also high variability of coherence; and wetlands with shrub cover exhibit high coherence, but variability intermediate between treed and herbaceous wetlands. From this knowledge, we have developed a novel image product that combines information about the magnitude of coherence and its variability with radar brightness (backscatter intensity). This product clearly displays the multitude of small wetlands over a wide area. With an interpretation key we have also developed, it is possible to distinguish different wetland types and assess year-to-year changes. In the next few years, satellite SAR systems, such as the European Sentinel and the Canadian RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), will provide rapid revisit capabilities and standard data collection modes, enhancing the operational application of SAR data for assessing wetland conditions and monitoring water levels using InSAR techniques.

TI  - Effect of Build Orientation of Electron Beam Melting on Microstructure and Mechanical Properties of Ti-6Al-4V
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Build orientation influences thermal activity during the EBM process, thus affecting the resultant bulk material properties of the part being produced. This work focuses on EBM build orientation with respect to the X, Y and Z axes and its effect on microstructure and mechanical performance of Ti-6Al-4V parts. A series of EBM Ti-6Al-4V specimens were fabricated using an Arcam S12 setup in different build orientations: XY, ZX, ZY, XY 30A degrees and XY 60A degrees inclination to the start plate. Using conventionally wrought Ti-6Al-4V as a benchmark, EBM specimens were tensile and impact tested. Furthermore, microhardness measurements, optical and electron microscopy were used for characterization. Horizontally oriented EBM Ti-6Al-4V parts develop finer lamellar microstructures as a result of higher cooling rates, however exhibiting comparable strength and rather lower ductility and toughness when compared to vertically oriented parts. Solidification defects, resulting from inconsistencies in melting due to high cooling rates but also related to specimen geometry, have countered the influence of a finer microstructure. This study has also shown that EBM parts develop columnar prior-beta grains which follow build direction. Benchmark wrought Ti-6Al-4V specimens show higher tensile properties while offering increased resistance to crack nucleation due to their homogeneous equiaxed microstructure.

TI  - Adjacency effects in satellite radiometric products from coastal waters: a theoretical analysis for the northern Adriatic Sea
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biases induced by land perturbations in satellite-derived water-leaving radiance are theoretically estimated for typical observation conditions in a coastal area of the northern Adriatic Sea hosting the Aqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) validation site. Two different correction procedures are considered: not deriving (AC-1) or alternatively deriving (AC-2) the atmospheric properties from the remote sensing data. In both cases, biases due to adjacency effects largely increase by approaching the coast and with the satellite viewing angle. Conversely, the seasonal and spectral dependence of biases significantly differ between AC-1 and AC-2 schemes. For AC-1 schemes average biases are within +/- 5% throughout the transect at yellow-green wavelengths, but at the coast they can reach -21% and 34% at 412 and 670 nm, respectively, and exceed 100% at 865 nm. For AC-2 schemes, adjacency effects at those wavelengths from which atmospheric properties are inferred add significant perturbations. For the specific case of a correction scheme determining the atmospheric properties from the near-infrared region and by adopting a power-law spectral extrapolation of adjacency perturbations on the derived atmospheric radiance, average biases become all negative with values up to -60% and -74% at 412 and 670 nm at the coast, respectively. The seasonal trend of estimated biases at the AAOT is consistent with intra-annual variation of biases from match ups between insitu and satellite products derived with SeaDAS from SeaWiFS and MODIS data. Nevertheless, estimated biases at blue wavelengths exceed systematic differences determined from match-up analysis. This may be explained by uncertainties and approximations in the simulation procedure, and by mechanisms of compensation introduced by the turbid water correction algorithm implemented in SeaDAS.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Temperature Variability over the Tibetan Plateau: Altitudinal Dependence Associated with the Global Warming Hiatus
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent slowdown in global warming has initiated a reanalysis of temperature data in some mountainous regions for understanding the consequences and impact that a hiatus has on the climate system. Spatiotemporal temperature variability is analyzed over the Tibetan Plateau because of its sensitivity to climate change with a station network updated to 2014, and its linkages to remote sensing-based variability of MODIS daytime and nighttime temperature are investigated. Results indicate the following: 1) Almost all stations have experienced a notable warming in the time interval 1961-2014, with most obvious warming in winter, which depends on the selected time intervals. 2) There is no clear shift from a predominant warming to a near stagnation during the most recent period (2001-present). 3) Uniform altitudinal dependence of temperature change trends could not be confirmed for all regions, time intervals, and seasons, but sometimes an altitude threshold around 3 kmis apparent. 4) Most of the meteorological stations are associated with MODIS temperature warming pixels, and thus regional cooling is missing when considering only the locations of meteorological stations. In summarizing, previous studies based on station observations do not provide a complete picture for the temperature change over the Tibetan Plateau. Remote sensing-based analyses have the potential to find early signals of regional climate changes and assess the impact of global climate changes in complex regional, seasonal, and altitudinal environments.

TI  - Land use and land cover change analysis in predominantly man-made coastal wetlands: towards a methodological framework
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In areas with a long history of human occupation, coastal wetlands have undergone extensive modification to accommodate extractive activities as salt-extraction and aquaculture. These man-made wetlands maintain some of the ecological functions of natural wetlands in spite of their artificial character: their suitability as complimentary waterbird habitat is well documented. In cases of wetlands composed of mixed natural and man-made areas, similarities in substrate-vegetation-water compositions may pose challenges in the applicability of remote sensing and GIS techniques for the study of landscape changes, requiring tailor-made, case-specific methods. We explored this supposition by testing these techniques for the study of the Bahia de Cadiz Nature Park (Spain). Using Landsat imagery spanning the 1985-2011 period, natural and man-made marsh areas were classified separately and results merged to produce land cover classification maps. Different change dynamics were observed for the natural and man-made areas, the latter exhibiting prominent changes, including widespread vegetative succession. Further, through the overlay of ancillary land use data for 2011, an integrated land use and cover map was produced for this year. Different scenarios arising from the abandonment of extractive activity and structural negligence were highlighted. Furthermore, a methodological framework for the classification of predominantly man-made wetlands was designed. The method is cost-effective and open for integration of additional datasets, and is considered a beneficial input to conservation and land use management. Its applicability for monitoring of landscape change not only pertains to the study area, but also extends to other coastal wetland areas of a similar nature.

TI  - An Empirical Ocean Colour Algorithm for Estimating the Contribution of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter in North-Central Western Adriatic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of empirical band ratio models were evaluated for the estimation of Coloured Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) using MODIS ocean colour sensor images and data collected on the North-Central Western Adriatic Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Relationships between in situ measurements (2013-2016) of CDOM absorption coefficients at 355 nm (a(CDOM)355) with several MODIS satellite band ratios were evaluated on a test data set. The prediction capability of the different linear models was assessed on a validation data set. Based on some statistical diagnostic parameters (R-2, APD and RMSE), the best MODIS band ratio performance in retrieving CDOM was obtained by a simple linear model of the transformed dependent variable using the remote sensing reflectance band ratio R-rs(667)/R-rs(488) as the only independent variable. The best-retrieved CDOM algorithm provides very good results for the complex coastal area along the North-Central Western Adriatic Sea where the Po River outflow is the main driving force in CDOM and nutrient circulation, which in winter mostly remains confined to a coastal boundary layer, whereas in summer it spreads to the open sea as well.

TI  - Salt Marsh Monitoring in Jamaica Bay, New York from 2003 to 2013: A Decade of Change from Restoration to Hurricane Sandy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Quickbird-2 and Worldview-2, high resolution satellite imagery, in a multi-temporal salt marsh mapping and change analysis of Jamaica Bay, New York. An object-based image analysis methodology was employed. The study seeks to understand both natural and anthropogenic changes caused by Hurricane Sandy and salt marsh restoration, respectively. The objectives of this study were to: (1) document salt marsh change in Jamaica Bay from 2003 to 2013; (2) determine the impact of Hurricane Sandy on salt marshes within Jamaica Bay; (3) evaluate this long term monitoring methodology; and (4) evaluate the use of multiple sensor derived classifications to conduct change analysis. The study determined changes from 2003 to 2008, 2008 to 2012 and 2012 to 2013 to better understand the impact of restoration and natural disturbances. The study found that 21 ha of salt marsh vegetation was lost from 2003 to 2013. From 2012 to 2013, restoration efforts resulted in an increase of 10.6 ha of salt marsh. Hurricane Sandy breached West Pond, a freshwater environment, causing 3.1 ha of freshwater wetland loss. The natural salt marsh showed a decreasing trend in loss. Larger salt marshes in 2012 tended to add vegetation in 2012-2013 (F-4,F-6 = 13.93, p = 0.0357 and R-2 = 0.90). The study provides important information for the resource management of Jamaica Bay.

TI  - Assessment of three wind reanalyses in the North Atlantic Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates three surface wind reanalyses in the North Atlantic Ocean: Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR/NOAA), ERA-Interim/ECMWF and the Hindcast of Dynamic Processes of the Ocean and Coastal Areas of Europe (HIPOCAS) based on the regional atmospheric model (REMO). The assessment is performed using satellite data from the GlobWave Project. The first part of this study compares the reanalyses in spatial and temporal domains. Furthermore, the analysis is also divided into overall conditions and extreme events. The second part evaluates each reanalysis independently using satellite data. In order to compare and evaluate the three datasets, coincident periods and grid domain were determined, which corresponds to the interval between 1979 and 2001, latitudes between 15 degrees and 72 degrees North and longitudes between 66 degrees West and 7 degrees East. The comparison results show that under calm winds the agreement among reanalyses is good. However, an increasing difference is found under extreme conditions. For extreme events, HIPOCAS (REMO) has the strongest winds, followed by CFSR and ERA-Interim. The assessment using measurements indicates underestimation of winds at mid-high latitudes above 45 degrees North and overestimation at low latitudes. The monthly analysis suggests a strong seasonal cycle with overestimation of all reanalyses in the summer and underestimation in the winter. The lowest errors and best performance was obtained by CFSR, followed by HIPOCAS (REMO) at mid-high latitudes and ERA-Interim at low latitudes. A significant underestimation of ERA-Interim for the peak of the storms was found, which can be associated with its coarse time and space resolution.

TI  - Development of an operational land water mask for MODIS Collection 6, and influence on downstream data products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) on-board the Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua satellites are processed using a land water mask to determine when an algorithm no longer needs to be run or when an algorithm needs to follow a different pathway. Entering the fourth reprocessing (Collection 6 (C6)) the MODIS team replaced the 1 km water mask with a 500 m water mask for improved representation of the continental surfaces. The new water mask represents more small water bodies for an overall increase in water surface from 1% to 2% of the continental surface. While this is still a small fraction of the overall global surface area the increase is more dramatic in certain areas such as the Arctic and Boreal regions where there are dramatic increases in water surface area in the new mask. MODIS products generated by the on-going C6 reprocessing using the new land water mask show significant impact in areas with high concentrations of change in the land water mask. Here differences between the Collection 5 (C5) and C6 water masks and the impact of these differences on the MOD04 aerosol product and the MOD11 land surface temperature product are shown.

TI  - Colonisation of poultry by <i>Salmonella</i> Enteritidis S1400 is reduced by combined administration of <i>Lactobacillus salivarius</i> 59 and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> PXN-33
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmonella Enteritidis remains a significant issue within the poultry industry and one potential solution is to use probiotic bacteria to prevent Salmonella colonisation through competitive exclusion (CE). We demonstrate that combined administration of Lactobacillus salivarius 59 and Enterococcus faecium PXN33 were effective competitive excluders of Salmonella Enteritidis S1400 in poultry. Two models were developed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotic where birds received Salmonella Enteritidis 51400 by a) oral gavage and b) sentinel bird to bird transmission. A statistically significant (p < 0.001) 2 log reduction of Salmonella Enteritidis 51400 colonisation was observed in the ileum, caecum and colon at day 43 using combined administration of the two probiotic bacteria. However, no Salmonella Enteritidis 51400 colonisation reduction was observed when either probiotic was administered individually. In the sentinel bird model the combined probiotic administered at days 12 and 20 was more effective than one-off or double administrations at age 1 and 12 days. In vitro cell free culture supernatant studies suggest the mechanism of Salmonella Enteritidis 51400 inhibition was due to a reduction in pH by the probiotic bacteria. Our current study provides further evidence that probiotics can significantly reduce pathogenic bacterial colonisation in poultry and that mixed preparation of probiotics provide superior performance when compared to individual bacterial preparations.

AB  - A new methodology for the mapping of intertidal terrain morphology is presented. It is based on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and the temporal correlation between the SAR backscatter intensity and the water level on the intertidal zone. The proposed methodology does not require manual editing, providing a set of geolocated pixels that can be used to generate a digital elevation model of the intertidal zone. The methodology is validated using TerraSAR-X SAR images acquired over Tagus estuary. This methodology can be useful for the regular updating of intertidal bathymetric models useful for both flood hazard mitigation and morphodynamics modeling.

TI  - Soil Carbon Stock and Particle Size Fractions in the Central Amazon Predicted from Remotely Sensed Relief, Multispectral and Radar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils from the remote areas of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil are poorly mapped due to the presence of dense forest and lack of access routes. The use of covariates derived from multispectral and radar remote sensors allows mapping large areas and has the potential to improve the accuracy of soil attribute maps. The objectives of this study were to: (a) evaluate the addition of relief, and vegetation covariates derived from multispectral images with distinct spatial and spectral resolutions (Landsat 8 and RapidEye) and L-band radar (ALOS PALSAR) for the prediction of soil organic carbon stock (CS) and particle size fractions; and (b) evaluate the performance of four geostatistical methods to map these soil properties. Overall, the results show that, even under forest coverage, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and ALOS PALSAR backscattering coefficient improved the accuracy of CS and subsurface clay content predictions. The NDVI derived from RapidEye sensor improved the prediction of CS using isotopic cokriging, while the NDVI derived from Landsat 8 and backscattering coefficient were selected to predict clay content at the subsurface using regression kriging (RK). The relative improvement of applying cokriging and RK over ordinary kriging were lower than 10%, indicating that further analyses are necessary to connect soil proxies (vegetation and relief types) with soil attributes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) has the capability to monitor railway tracks and embankments with millimeter-level precision over wide areas. The potential of detecting differential deformation along the tracks makes it one of the most powerful and economical means for monitoring the safety and stability of the infrastructure on a weekly basis. Yet, the mere capability to detect such small deformations is not sufficient for an operational application of the technique. Handling huge data volumes, homogenizing independent datasets, and the connection with expert knowledge to identify risk areas are challenges to overcome. Here, we use a probabilistic method for InSAR time series postprocessing to efficiently scrutinize the data and detect railway instability. Moreover, to detect high-strain segments of the railway, we propose a short-arc-based method to focus on localized differential deformation between nearby InSAR measurement points. Our approach is demonstrated over the entire railway network of the Netherlands, more than 3000 km long, using hundreds of Radarsat-2 acquisitions between 2010 and 2015, leading to the first satellite-based nationwide railway monitoring system.

TI  - Characteristics and origins of a typical heavy haze episode in Baotou, China: implications for the spatial distribution of industrial sources
T2  - JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE A
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution has become the predominant environmental problem caused by rapid industrialization and urbanization in China. In this study, measurements of the concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O-3 at six monitoring stations in Baotou, China were used to investigate the characteristics of heavy haze pollution in Dec. 12-25, 2013. Source locations of PM2.5 in Baotou were identified using satellite remote sensing data, an air mass trajectory model, and a conditional probability function (CPF). The results showed that the average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were (113.8 +/- 84.0) mu g/m(3) and (211.1 +/- 149.2) mu g/m(3), respectively. The similar trends in temporal variation of the air pollutants PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and CO suggested they may share common sources. The results of satellite observations and backward trajectories supported the hypothesis that the pollutants causing the haze event originated mainly from local anthropogenic sources. According to the CPF analysis, low-speed winds from the south and southwest, upwind industrial emissions, and the northern mountains were mainly responsible for the formation of haze in Baotou. The study provides some insights to help governments optimize industrial layouts for improving air quality in the future.

TI  - Multi-source remotely sensed data fusion for improving land cover classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many advances have been made in past decades, land cover classification of fine-resolution remotely sensed (RS) data integrating multiple temporal, angular, and spectral features remains limited, and the contribution of different RS features to land cover classification accuracy remains uncertain. We proposed to improve land cover classification accuracy by integrating multi-source RS features through data fusion. We further investigated the effect of different RS features on classification performance. The results of fusing Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), China Environment lA series (HJ-1A), and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) data, showed that the fused data integrat-ing temporal, spectral, angular, and topographic features achieved better land cover classification accu-racy than the original RS data. Compared with the topographic feature, the temporal and angular features extracted from the fused data played more important roles in classification performance, espe-cially those temporal features containing abundant vegetation growth information, which markedly increased the overall classification accuracy. In addition, the multispectral and hyperspectral fusion suc-cessfully discriminated detailed forest types. Our study provides a straightforward strategy for hierarchi-cal land cover classification by making full use of available RS data. All of these methods and findings could be useful for land cover classification at both regional and global scales. (C) 2016 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

TI  - Uncertainties in mapping forest carbon in urban ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit urban forest carbon estimation provides a baseline map for understanding the variation in forest vertical structure, informing sustainable forest management and urban planning. While high resolution remote sensing has proven promising for carbon mapping in highly fragmented urban landscapes, data cost and availability are the major obstacle prohibiting accurate, consistent, and repeated measurement of forest carbon pools in cities. This study aims to evaluate the uncertainties of forest carbon estimation in response to the combined impacts of remote sensing data resolution and neighborhood spatial patterns in Charlotte, North Carolina. The remote sensing data for carbon mapping were resampled to a range of resolutions, i.e., LiDAR point cloud density - 5.8, 4.6, 2.3, and 1.2 pt s/m(2), aerial optical NAIP (National Agricultural Imagery Program) imagery - 1, 5, 10, and 20 m. Urban spatial patterns were extracted to represent area, shape complexity, dispersion/interspersion, diversity, and connectivity of landscape patches across the residential neighborhoods with built-up densities from low, medium-low, medium-high, to high. Through statistical analyses, we found that changing remote sensing data resolution introduced noticeable uncertainties (variation) in forest carbon estimation at the neighborhood level. Higher uncertainties were caused by the change of LiDAR point density (causing 8.7 -11.0% of variation) than changing NAIP image resolution (causing 6.2-8.6% of variation). For both LiDAR and NAIP, urban neighborhoods with a higher degree of anthropogenic disturbance unveiled a higher level of uncertainty in carbon mapping. However, LiDAR-based results were more likely to be affected by landscape patch connectivity, and the NAIP-based estimation was found to be significantly influenced by the complexity of patch shape.

TI  - Aerosol Retrieval Sensitivity and Error Analysis for the Cloud and Aerosol Polarimetric Imager on Board TanSat: The Effect of Multi-Angle Measurement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol scattering is an important source of error in CO2 retrievals from satellite. This paper presents an analysis of aerosol information content from the Cloud and Aerosol Polarimetric Imager (CAPI) onboard the Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite (TanSat) to be launched in 2016. Based on optimal estimation theory, aerosol information content is quantified from radiance and polarization observed by CAPI in terms of the degrees of freedom for the signal (DFS). A linearized vector radiative transfer model is used with a linearized Mie code to simulate observation and sensitivity (or Jacobians) with respect to aerosol parameters. In satellite nadir mode, the DFS for aerosol optical depth is the largest, but for mode radius, it is only 0.55. Observation geometry is found to affect aerosol DFS based on the aerosol scattering phase function from the comparison between different viewing zenith angles or solar zenith angles. When TanSat is operated in target mode, we note that multi-angle retrieval represented by three along-track measurements provides additional 0.31 DFS on average, mainly from mode radius. When adding another two measurements, the a posteriori error decreases by another 2%-6%. The correlation coefficients between retrieved parameters show that aerosol is strongly correlated with surface reflectance, but multi-angle retrieval can weaken this correlation.

TI  - Analyzing Parcel-Level Relationships between Urban Land Expansion and Activity Changes by Integrating Landsat and Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth is a process that imposes profound physical and socioeconomic restructuring on cities. Urban land expansion as an immediate physical manifestation of urban growth has been extensively studied using a variety of remote sensing methods. However, little research addresses the interactions between urban land expansion and corresponding activity changes, especially at local scales. We propose an innovative analytical framework that integrates Landsat and nighttime light data to capture the parcel-level relationships between urban land expansion and activity changes. The urban land data are acquired based on the classification of Landsat images, whereas the activity changes are approximated by the nighttime light data. Using the Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) (local Moran's I) approach, four types of local relationships between land expansion and activity changes are defined at the parcel level. The proposed analytical framework is applied in Guangzhou, China, as a case study. The results reveal the mismatched growth between urban land and activity intensity at the parcel level, where the increase in urban land area outpaces the increase of activity intensity. Such results are expected to provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban growth, and can be used to assist urban planning and related decision-making.

TI  - Impacts of urban landscape patterns on urban thermal variations in Guangzhou, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of surface urban thermal variations (SUTV). Understanding the effects of urban landscape features on SUTV is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. In this study, an investigation was conducted to detect urban landscape patterns and assess their impact on surface temperature. Landsat images: Thematic Mapper was used to calculate land surface temperature (LST) in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong Province in southern China. SUTV zones, including surface urban heat islands (SUHI) and surface urban heat sinks (SUHS), were then empirically identified. The composition and configuration of landscape patterns were measured by a series of spatial metrics at the class and landscape levels in the SUHI and SUHS zones. How both landscape composition and configuration influence urban thermal characteristics was then analysed. It was found that landscape composition has the strongest effect on SUTV, but that urban landscape configuration also influences SUTV. These findings are helpful for achieving a comprehensive understanding of how urban landscape patterns impact SUTV and can help in the design of effective urban landscape patterns to minimize the effects of SUHI.

TI  - Algorithm Development for Land Surface Temperature Retrieval: Application to Chinese Gaofen-5 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable in the study of the energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. Among the different methods proposed to estimate LST, the quadratic split-window ( SW) method has achieved considerable popularity. This method works well when the emissivities are high in both channels. Unfortunately, it performs poorly for low land surface emissivities (LSEs). To solve this problem, assuming that the LSE is known, the constant in the quadratic SW method was calculated by maintaining the other coefficients the same as those obtained for the black body condition. This procedure permits transfer of the emissivity effect to the constant. The result demonstrated that the constant was influenced by both atmospheric water vapour content (W) and atmospheric temperature (T0) in the bottom layer. To parameterize the constant, an exponential approximation between Wand T0 was used. A LST retrieval algorithm was proposed. The error for the proposed algorithm was RMSE = 0.70 K. Sensitivity analysis results showed that under the consideration of NE Delta T = 0.2 K, 20% uncertainty in W and 1% uncertainties in the channel mean emissivity and the channel emissivity difference, the RMSE was 1.29 K. Compared with AST 08 product, the proposed algorithm underestimated LST by about 0.8 K for both study areas when ASTER L1B data was used as a proxy of Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite data. The GF-5 satellite is scheduled to be launched in 2017.

TI  - Comparison of Influenza Epidemiological and Virological Characteristics between Outpatients and Inpatients in Zhejiang Province, China, March 2011-June 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the rapid rate of global spread and consequently healthcare costs related to influenza, surveillance plays an important role in monitoring the emerging pandemics in China. However,the characteristics of influenza in Southeast of China haven't been fully studied. Our study use the surveillance data collected from 16 sentinel hospitals across Zhejiang Province during March 2011 through June 2015, including the demographic information and respiratory specimens from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) patients. As analysis results, most SARI and ILI patients were in the age group of 0-4 years old (62.38% of ILI and 71.54% of SARI). The respiratory specimens have statistically significantly higher positive rate for influenza among ILI patients than that among SARI patients (p < 0.001). The comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significantly difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype. The SARI and ILI patients were found to be positively correlated for overall positive rate (r = 0.63, p < 0.001), the weekly percentage of A(H1N1)pdm09 (r = 0.51, p < 0.001), influenza B virus (r = 0.17, p = 0.013), and A/H3N2 (r = 0.43, p < 0.001) among all the positive numbers. Our study demonstrated that the activities of influenza virus, including its subtypes, had a similar temporal pattern between ILI and SARI cases.

TI  - Fluxes all of the time? A primer on the temporal representativeness of FLUXNET
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - FLUXNET, the global network of eddy covariance flux towers, provides the largest synthesized data set of CO2, H2O, and energy fluxes. To achieve the ultimate goal of providing flux information '' everywhere and all of the time,'' studies have attempted to address the representativeness issue, i.e., whether measurements taken in a set of given locations and measurement periods can be extrapolated to a space-and time-explicit extent (e.g., terrestrial globe, 1982-2013 climatological baseline). This study focuses on the temporal representativeness of FLUXNET and tests whether site-specific measurement periods are sufficient to capture the natural variability of climatological and biological conditions. FLUXNET is unevenly representative across sites in terms of the measurement lengths and potentials of extrapolation in time. Similarity of driver conditions among years generally enables the extrapolation of flux information beyond measurement periods. Yet such extrapolation potentials are further constrained by site-specific variability of driver conditions. Several driver variables such as air temperature, diurnal temperature range, potential evapotranspiration, and normalized difference vegetation index had detectable trends and/or breakpoints within the baseline period, and flux measurements generally covered similar and biased conditions in those drivers. About 38% and 60% of FLUXNET sites adequately sampled the mean conditions and interannual variability of all driver conditions, respectively. For long-record sites (>= 15 years) the percentages increased to 59% and 69%, respectively. However, the justification of temporal representativeness should not rely solely on the lengths of measurements. Whenever possible, site-specific consideration (e.g., trend, breakpoint, and interannual variability in drivers) should be taken into account.

TI  - The limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite intensive efforts directed at initial training in fetal heart rate interpretation, continuing medical education, board certification/recertification, team training, and the development of specific protocols for the management of abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, the goals of consistently preventing hypoxia-induced fetal metabolic acidemia and neurologic injury remain elusive.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to validate a recently published algorithm for the management of category II fetal heart rate tracings, to examine reasons for the birth of infants with significant metabolic acidemia despite the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring, and to examine critically the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring in the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia.STUDY DESIGN: The potential performance of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring under ideal circumstances was evaluated in an outcomes-blinded examination fetal heart rate tracing of infants with metabolic acidemia at birth (base deficit, >12) and matched control infants (base deficit, <8) under the following conditions: (1) expert primary interpretation, (2) use of a published algorithm that was developed and endorsed by a large group of national experts, (3) assumption of a 30-minute period of evaluation for noncritical category II fetal heart rate tracings, followed by delivery within 30 minutes, (4) evaluation without the need to provide patient care simultaneously, and (5) comparison of results under these circumstances with those achieved in actual clinical practice.RESULTS: During the study period, 120 infants were identified with an arterial cord blood base deficit of >12 mM/L. Matched control infants were not demographically different from subjects. In actual practice, operative intervention on the basis of an abnormal fetal heart rate tracings occurred in 36 of 120 fetuses (30.0%) with metabolic acidemia. Based on expert, algorithm-assisted reviews, 55 of 120 patients with acidemia (45.8%) were judged to need operative intervention for abnormal fetal heart rate tracings. This difference was significant (P=.016). In infants who were born with a base deficit of >12 mM/L in which blinded, algorithm-assisted expert review indicated the need for operative delivery, the decision for delivery would have been made an average of 131 minutes before the actual delivery. The rate of expert intervention for fetal heart rate concerns in the nonacidemic control group (22/120; 18.3%) was similar to the actual intervention rate (23/120; 19.2%; P= 1.0) Expert review did not mandate earlier delivery in 65 of 120 patients with metabolic acidemia. The primary features of these 65 cases included the occurrence of sentinel events with prolonged deceleration just before delivery, the rapid deterioration of nonemergent category II fetal heart rate tracings before realistic time frames for recognition and intervention, and the failure of recognized fetal heart rate patterns such as variability to identify metabolic acidemia.CONCLUSIONS: Expert, algorithm-assisted fetal heart rate interpretation has the potential to improve standard clinical performance by facilitating significantly earlier recognition of some tracings that are associated with metabolic acidemia without increasing the rate of operative intervention. However, this improvement is modest. Of infants who are born with metabolic acidemia, only approximately one-half potentially could be identified and have delivery expedited even under ideal circumstances, which are probably not realistic in current US practice. This represents the limits of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring performance. Additional technologies will be necessary if the goal of the prevention of neonatal metabolic acidemia is to be realized.

TI  - A comparison of Mott cell morphology of three avian species. II. - Bad behavior by plasmacytes?
T2  - POULTRY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mott cells are atypical plasmacytes recognized microscopically by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distensions (Russell bodies) a result of retained secretory product (antibody). Originally associated with parasitism, they are observed in a broad spectrum of immunopathology, sometimes involving hypergammaglobulinemia. Few descriptions of Mott cells appear in avian literature. The purpose of the manuscript is to provide examples identified by light microscopy in three poultry species. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of plasmacytes from the turkey oviduct mucosa are included for comparison with Mott cell light microscopic images. Wright's stained blood and bone marrow from commercial and specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens, ducks, and turkeys are the sources. Mott cell positive samples commonly occurred with leukocytosis or leukemoid reactions, polymicrobial bacteremia, and fungemia. Atypical granulocytes and leukocytes regularly accompanied Mott cells. It is proposed that circulating Mott cells are "sentinels" indicative of stress, dyscrasia, and pathology. Moreover, Mott cells, like other atypia, complicate the interpretation of simple heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratios. As Mott cells are defective plasmacytes these observations address hematology, immunology, pathology, and welfare issues.

TI  - Paraguay's Atlantic Forest cover loss Satellite-based change detection and fragmentation analysis between 2003 and 2013
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The subtropical Atlantic Forest is a highly diverse ecosystem in South America and one of the most endangered rain forests in the world. The present study focuses specifically on the Paraguayan part of the tri-national Atlantic Forest. Over the last decades, the Paraguayan Atlantic Forest presented one of the highest deforestation rates in the world, and today, only a small share remains. Hence, forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest was detected and analysed through remote sensing and GIS methodologies based on Landsat images obtained in 2003 and 2013. The objective of this study was to examine the spatial impact of forest loss in Paraguay's Atlantic Forest over the past decade with a special focus on biodiversity conservation. Classifications results obtained overall accuracies above 83% and revealed that over 6000 km(2) of forest was cleared during the study period. The forest landscape and its fragmentation level were characterised through a set of landscape metrics, in particular the proximity analysis which support the identification of forest priority areas for nature conservation and potential biological corridors. In summary, the study revealed that deforestation and fragmentation of the Atlantic Forest area continued, but at a slower pace than that in the previous decade. Protected areas were conserved very effectively; however, forest core areas without any protection status require further attention. Intact forest patches and their connectivity are a crucial prerequisite to biodiversity conservation in a highly fragmented forest area. The combination of different remote sensing and GIS methods provides valuable information for sustainable forest management in the region. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Urban hypotheses and spatiotemporal characterization of urban growth in the Treasure Valley of Idaho, USA
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth can help identify impacts of urbanization, assess conceptual models of that growth, help predict future change, and inform associated urban management policies. Using multi-temporal spatial data (1938-2014), we categorized the newly urbanized area in Treasure Valley, Idaho into four urban growth forms and six urban land use classes. A time series analysis of new development revealed the existence of decadal-scale variability of urbanization at various levels of urban land use. Alternating dominance of dispersion and compaction processes were observed at the urban patch level. A similar periodicity was observed between edge-expansion and infill in terms of growth forms, and between residential and commercial development at the land use level. Our observations also indicate that recent urban densification is occurring in the Treasure Valley, similar to some other metropolitan regions in the United States. 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Global patterns of drought deciduous phenology in semi-arid and savanna-type ecosystems
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal variations in vegetation have direct and indirect impacts on biogeochemical cycling, net primary productivity, and the global climate. While leaf phenology in many high latitude ecosystems can be predicted based on a four-season cycle, semi-arid and savanna-type (SAST) ecosystems are thought to be much less consistent and interannual variability can be quite large. While leaf phenology in SAST ecosystems is often attributed to soil moisture availability, different plants appear to respond to different signals, and predicting drought deciduous phenology, especially at large scales, as in land surface models (LSMs), continues to be a challenge. Here we undertook a meta-analysis of published research on leaf phenology in SAST ecosystems to assess whether any consistent patterns would be revealed across the SAST regions of the world. After reviewing 188 papers and correlating green-up and brown-down dates with a number of possible drivers, including latitude, temperature, precipitation, continent, and plant functional type (PFT), we found that latitude, then continent and PFT, were the best predictors of phenological timing. This result suggests that solar radiation may be an important driver of phenology even in the low latitudes, and that biogeographic differences among continents and PFTs may be critical to improving our predictions of SAST phenology. All global LSMs lump plant species into functional groups, and these groups typically span continents despite known physiological differences between species on different continents. Our review suggests that more research is needed into SAST phenology at both field and remotely sensed scales, but that LSM predictions could be improved by simply developing continent- and latitude-specific model parameterizations. With a large fraction of the world's human population living in and relying on services from SAST ecosystems, it is critical that we focus more attention on these understudied systems and improve their representations in global models.

TI  - A Scheme for Rain Gauge Network Design Based on Remotely Sensed Rainfall Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A remarkable decline in the number of rain gauges is being faced in many areas of the world, as a compromise to the expensive cost of operating and maintaining rain gauges. The question of how to effectively deploy new or remove current rain gauges in order to create optimal rainfall information is becoming more and more important. On the other hand, larger-scaled, remotely sensed rainfall measurements, although poorer quality compared with traditional rain gauge rainfall measurements, provide an insight into the local storm characteristics, which are sought by traditional methods for designing a rain gauge network. Based on these facts, this study proposes a new methodology for rain gauge network design using remotely sensed rainfall datasets that aims to explore how many gauges are essential and where they should be placed. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the redundancy of the radar grid network and to determine the number of rain gauges while the potential locations are determined by cluster analysis (CA) selection. The proposed methodology has been performed on 373 different storm events measured by a weather radar grid network and compared against an existing dense rain gauge network in southwestern England. Because of the simple structure, the proposed scheme could be easily implemented in other study areas. This study provides a new insight into rain gauge network design that is also a preliminary attempt to use remotely sensed data to solve the traditional rain gauge problems.

TI  - The Suitability of Different Nighttime Light Data for GDP Estimation at Different Spatial Scales and Regional Levels
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nighttime light data offer a unique view of the Earth's surface and can be used to estimate the spatial distribution of gross domestic product (GDP). Historically, using a simple regression function, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) has been used to correlate regional and global GDP values. In early 2013, the first global Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data were released. Compared with DMSP/OLS, they have a higher spatial resolution and a wider radiometric detection range. This paper aims to study the suitability of the two nighttime light data sources for estimating the GDP relationship between the provincial and city levels in Mainland China, as well as of different regression functions. First, NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data for 2014 are corrected with DMSP/OLS data for 2013 to reduce the background noise in the original data. Subsequently, three regression functions are used to estimate the relationship between nighttime light data and GDP statistical data at the provincial and city levels in Mainland China. Then, through the comparison of the relative residual error (RE) and the relative root mean square error (RRMSE) parameters, a systematical assessment of the suitability of the GDP estimation is provided. The results show that the NPP/VIIRS nighttime light data are better than the DMSP/OLS data for GDP estimation, whether at the provincial or city level, and that the power function and polynomial models are better for GDP estimation than the linear regression model. This study reveals that the accuracy of GDP estimation based on nighttime light data is affected by the resolution of the data and the spatial scale of the study area, as well as by the land cover types and industrial structures of the study area.

TI  - What is new in pediatric surgical oncology?
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PEDIATRICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewAs pediatric oncology has become more complex, designing and maintaining pediatric surgical protocols require greater expertise. The primary purpose of this review is to summarize the changes in protocols and new study findings, which have changed surgical practice for children with solid tumors.Recent findingsThe most common solid tumors treated by surgery are reviewed. There are new methods of surgical techniques such as the use of sentinel lymph node techniques for the assessment of lymph nodes in pediatric sarcoma. New studies showing excellent outcomes for the nonoperative treatment for young patients with neuroblastoma are discussed. Surgical quality with the prevention of tumor rupture and the assessment of lymph nodes is essential for good outcomes in patients with Wilm's tumor. The international collaborations within germ cell and liver tumors have provided excellent new study regimens and welcomed a new era of studies that are robust and have the power to change the outcomes for these rare tumors.SummarySurgical practice is evolving with the molecular advances in pediatric oncology. Technical advances and quality improvement endeavors to ensure protocol adherence are essential. International partnerships have allowed for greater advances particularly for rare tumors and improve overall surgical outcomes.

TI  - Combining Airborne Laser Scanning and Aerial Imagery Enhances Echo Classification for Invasive Conifer Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of exotic conifers from commercial plantation forests has significant economic and ecological implications. Accurate methods for invasive conifer detection are required to enable monitoring and guide control. In this research, we combined spectral information from aerial imagery with data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) to develop methods to identify invasive conifers using remotely-sensed data. We examined the effect of ALS pulse density and the height threshold of the training dataset on classification accuracy. The results showed that adding spectral values to the ALS metrics/variables in the training dataset led to significant increases in classification accuracy. The most accurate models (kappa range of 0.773-0.837) had either four or five explanatory variables, including ALS elevation, the near-infrared band and different combinations of ALS intensity and red and green bands. The best models were found to be relatively invariant to changes in pulse density (1-21 pls/m(2)) or the height threshold (0-2 m) used for the inclusion of data in the training dataset. This research has extended and improved the methods for scattered single tree detection and offered valuable insight into campaign settings for the monitoring of invasive conifers (tree weeds) using remote sensing approaches.

TI  - Best Practice in Provider/Parent Interaction
T2  - QUALITATIVE HEALTH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this 3-year prospective grounded theory study in three pediatric settings, we aimed to develop a conceptualization of best practice health care providers (BPHCPs) in interaction with parents of children with complex, chronic, life-threatening conditions. Analysis of semistructured interviews with 34 parents and 80 health care professionals (HCPs) and 88 observation periods of HCP/parent interactions indicated that BPHCPs shared a broad worldview; values of equity, family-centered care, and integrity; and a commitment to authentic engagement. BPHCPs engaged in direct care activities, in connecting behaviors, and in exquisitely attuning to particularities of the situation in the moment, resulting in positive outcomes for parents and HCPs. By focusing on what HCPs do well, findings showed that not only is it possible for HCPs to practice in this way, but those who do so are also recognized as being the best at what they do. We provide recommendations for practice and initial and ongoing professional education.

TI  - Ten-year report on axillary recurrence after negative sentinel node biopsy for breast cancer from the Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with breast cancer with a negative finding on sentinel node biopsy (SNB) has reduced armmorbidity substantially. Early follow-up reports have shown the rate of axillary recurrence to be significantly lower than expected, with a median false-negative rate of 7 per cent for SNB. Long-term follow-up is needed as recurrences may develop late.Methods: The Swedish Multicentre Cohort Study included 3518 women with breast cancer and a clinically negative axilla, in whom SNB was planned. ALND was performed only in patients with sentinel node metastasis. Twenty-six centres contributed to enrolment between September 2000 and January 2004. The primary endpoint was the axillary recurrence rate and the secondary endpoint was breast cancer-specific survival, calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates.Results: Some 2216 sentinel node-negative patients with 2237 breast cancers were analysed. The median follow-up time was 126 (range 0-174) months. Isolated axillary recurrence was found in 35 patients (1.6 per cent). High histological grade and multifocal tumours were risk factors for axillary recurrence, whereas the removal of more than two sentinel nodes decreased the risk. Fourteen (40 per cent) of 35 patients died as a consequence of axillary recurrence.Conclusion: The risk of axillary recurrence remains lower than expected after a negative finding on SNB at 10-year follow-up. Axillary recurrences may occur long after primary surgery, and lead to a significant risk of breast cancer death.

TI  - Four decades of urban sprawl and population growth in Teresina, Brazil
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of medium-sized cities in Brazil has increased significantly since the 80-90's decades. In that period, most of the urbanization process was represented by the agglomeration of the population in the major metropolitan areas such as Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Nowadays, the rural-urban movement in Brazil is predominantly affecting cities with less than 1 million inhabitants, located particularly in the Center-West and in the Semiarid Northeast regions. The city of Teresina, the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Piaui, is one example that has shown an accelerated process of urban development. In this context, this paper seeks to discuss the urban sprawl of Teresina over the last four decades (1974 2014), associating its trends of urban expansion and population growth with their social and environmental implications. The results of our work indicate that urban sprawl in Teresina has been continuous over the years and getting faster in the 2010-2014 period. High demographic density areas are located mostly in peripheral zones, where the low-income population dominates. The population density varies across the city, and it is far from the standard proposed by the urban legislation. Thus, urbanization in Teresina is characterized by the sprawl of its municipal boundaries, infra-urban densification and verticalization, and an increase in population, especially in areas of low-income neighborhoods.

TI  - PROTECT - trial: a multicentre prospective pragmatic RCT and health economic analysis of the effect of tailored repositioning to prevent pressure ulcers - study protocol
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCED NURSING
M3  - Article
AB  - AimThe aims of this trial were as follows: (1) to compare the (cost-) effectiveness of a turning and repositioning system and an algorithm for a tailored repositioning vs. usual care to improve reposition frequency in patients at risk; and (2) to compare the (cost-) effectiveness of standardized incontinence care vs. usual care.BackgroundPressure ulcers are a serious and common problem for hospitalized patients. In many countries, pressure ulcers are recognized as a national health issue and governments designate pressure ulcers as one of the most important sentinel events for health care. International guidelines recommend the use of pressure redistributing support surfaces, systematic patient repositioning and preventive skin care to prevent pressure ulcers. Interventions should be patient-tailored and based on a thorough assessment of both the patient and contextual risk factors. There is a lack of rigorous research addressing the effectiveness of a turning and repositioning system and it is unclear how to tailor the frequency and posture to specific patient needs.DesignMulticentre, cluster, three-arm, randomized, controlled pragmatic trial and a cost-effectiveness analysis. The ward is the unit of randomization.MethodsTailored repositioning, the use of a device to facilitate patient repositioning and an optimal procedure for incontinence care will be combined. Participating wards will be intensive care units, geriatric and rehabilitation wards. A sample size calculation was performed (80% power, =005). This study is approved by the Ethics Committee (February 2016).DiscussionData collection is currently ongoing. The results are expected to be obtained in March 2017.

TI  - Landscape-fragmentation change due to recent agricultural expansion in the Brazilian Savanna, Western Bahia, Brazil
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim in this study was detect changes in landscape-fragmentation patterns resulting from the expansion of agriculture in the Cerrado region (Brazilian Savanna) during the period 1988-2011. The study area covers 7,559,783.69 ha and is restricted to the limits of the Urucuia Group (Upper Cretaceous), a geological unit formed by sedimentary rocks of continental deposits where there has been intense agricultural expansion due to favorable conditions for the use of mechanized farming. The temporal analysis considered land-use/land-cover data from Landsat TM image classification for the years 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2011. Fragmentation quantification was performed from the morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) and traditional landscape metrics analysis. The calculation of MSPA attributes considered 10 edge widths, between 30 and 300 m. Traditional landscape metrics were obtained from Path Analyst and V-Late software. Change detection in MSPA classes was obtained through cross-tabulation. Cerrado deforestation in the study area increased from 795,502.61 ha in 1988 to 2804,679.75 ha in 2011. The spatial pattern of Cerrado deforestation and fragmentation has a spatial concentration in the western region of the study area that gradually progresses toward the east. Our results emphasize the fragmentation process with a reduction in the following fragmentation indicators over the past two decades: area, number of patches, core, and edge. In addition, the indicators increased in: complexity, size variation, and coreless fragments. Change detection enabled the description of spatial evolution of fragmentation indicators. The results can help define strategies for landscape planning and decision making for conservation priorities.

TI  - Deforestation analysis in protected areas and scenario simulation for structural corridors in the agricultural frontier of Western Bahia, Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim in this paper was to evaluate the spatial distribution of protected areas defined by law and their importance as structural corridors. The study area was 7,559,783.69 ha located in Western Bahia (Northeast Brazil), restricted to the limits of the Urucuia Group (Upper Cretaceous), where there is strong agribusiness growth. Currently, a major dilemma in Brazilian public policy arises from the conflicting interests of environmental conservation and increased food production. Brazilian environmental protection policies include the implantation of Protected Areas (Full Protection Units and Sustainable Use Units) and the adoption of the National Forest Act (Permanent Preservation Areas and Legal Reserves). In this context, we delimited illegal land-use in Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs) adopting the intersection between land-use/land-cover data from PRISM/ALOS image classification for the years 2007-2010 and PPA vectors. We performed the temporal analysis in PAs considering land-use/land-cover data from Landsat TM image classification for the years 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2011. Finally, we performed a Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) to evaluate whether PPAs alone are sufficient as structural corridors. Hypothetical scenarios were simulated to increase the potential of PPAs as structural corridors. The calculation of MSPA attributes was conducted considering 3 edge widths: 15 m (1 pixel), 510 m (34 pixels), and 1005 m (67 pixels). Four scenarios were simulated, considering a gradual increase in preserved areas. The results show that illegal land use is contained within PPA and protected areas. The scenario simulations present alternatives to increase the connectivity of the fragments and ensure the maintenance of ecological and hydrological services. Rapid agricultural expansion without proper landscape planning can compromise the sustainability of ecosystem services and the recharge zone of the Urucuia aquifer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Synergistic use of an oil drift model and remote sensing observations for oil spill monitoring
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In case of oil spills due to disasters, one of the environmental concerns is the oil trajectories and spatial distribution. To meet these new challenges, spill response plans need to be upgraded. An important component of such a plan would be models able to simulate the behaviour of oil in terms of trajectories and spatial distribution, if accidentally released, in deep water. All these models need to be calibrated with independent observations. The aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that significant support to oil slick monitoring can be obtained by the synergistic use of oil drift models and remote sensing observations. Based on transport properties and weathering processes, oil drift models can indeed predict the fate of spilled oil under the action of water current velocity and wind in terms of oil position, concentration and thickness distribution. The oil spill event that occurred on 31 May 2003 in the Baltic Sea offshore the Swedish and Danish coasts is considered a case study with the aim of producing three-dimensional models of sea circulation and oil contaminant transport. The High-Resolution Limited Area Model (HIRLAM) is used for atmospheric forcing. The results of the numerical modelling of current speed and water surface elevation data are validated by measurements carried out in Kalmarsund, Simrishamn and Kungsholmsfort stations over a period of 18 days and 17 h. The oil spill model uses the current field obtained from a circulation model. Near-infrared (NIR) satellite images were compared with numerical simulations. The simulation was able to predict both the oil spill trajectories of the observed slick and thickness distribution. Therefore, this work shows how oil drift modelling and remotely sensed data can provide the right synergy to reproduce the timing and transport of the oil and to get reliable estimates of thicknesses of spilled oil to prepare an emergency plan and to assess the magnitude of risk involved in case of oil spills due to disaster.

TI  - Efficiency of end effect probes for <i>in-situ</i> permittivity measurements in the 0.5-6 GHz frequency range and their application for organic soil horizons study
T2  - SENSORS AND ACTUATORS A-PHYSICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote signatures measured at microwave frequency above land surfaces are strongly dependent on the permittivity of the soil, which is linked to its moisture content. Thus, soil permittivity is a key parameter when algorithms are developed for the retrieval of hydrologic parameters from remote sensing data. Soil permittivity measurements are generally carried,out in the laboratory because in-situ measurements are more difficult to obtain. The study presents the development of two probes (N and SMA probes) for in situ soil permittivity measurements (i.e. measurements of dielectric properties). They are based on the end effect phenomenon of a coaxial waveguide and so are called end effect probes in this paper. Results obtained on well-known materials (water and polytetrafluoroethene) are compared with corresponding data obtained by laboratory approaches (Von Hippel's method and resonant cavity) and show good agreement from 0.5 GHz up to similar to 3.5 GHz and 6 GHz for N and SMA probes respectively. Then measurements made on concrete and mineral soil are reported to underline the efficiency of end effect probes for in-situ dielectric measurements. Finally, through work undertaken in the framework of the European Space Agency's SMOSHiLat project, we demonstrate the applicability of the two probes for measurements performed within these frequency ranges in complex material such as organic soil horizons.

TI  - Additional non-sentinel lymph node metastases in early oral cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To determine risk factors for additional non-sentinel lymph node metastases in neck dissection specimens of patients with early stage oral cancer and a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). A retrospective analysis of 36 previously untreated SLNB positive patients in our institution and investigation of currently available literature of positive SLNB patients in early stage oral cancer was done. Degree of metastatic involvement [classified as isolated tumor cells (ITC), micro- and macrometastasis] of the sentinel lymph node (SLN), the status of other SLNs, and additional non-SLN metastases in neck dissection specimens were analyzed. Of 27 studies, comprising 511 patients with positive SLNs, the pooled prevalence of non-SLN metastasis in patients with positive SLNs was 31 %. Non-SLN metastases were detected (available from 9 studies) in 13, 20, and 40 % of patients with ITC, micro-, and macrometastasis in the SLN, respectively. The probability of non-SLN metastasis seems to be higher in the case of more than one positive SLN (29 vs. 24 %), the absence of negative SLNs (40 vs. 19 %), and a positive SLN ratio of more than 50 % (38 vs. 19 %). Additional non-SLN metastases were found in 31 % of neck dissections following positive SLNB. The presence of multiple positive SLNs, the absence of negative SLNs, and a positive SLN ratio of more than 50 % may be predictive factors for non-SLN metastases. Classification of SLNs into ITC, micro-, and macrometastasis in the future SLNB studies is important to answer the question if treatment of the neck is always needed after positive SLNB.

TI  - Remote estimation of shelterbelt width from SPOT5 imagery
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Width is one of the key parameters of a shelterbelt. Traditional methods to acquire this width are mainly based on field measurement, which is impractical for monitoring shelterbelts at regional scale. There are many studies analyzing linear objects, but they are not directly applicable to width detection of such objects. In this paper, we analyzed relationships among vegetation fractions retrieved from SPOT5 remote sensing imagery with 10 m x 10 m spatial resolution, shelterbelt area, and shelterbelt width in one pixel. Based on this analysis, we developed a method for recognizing shelterbelt width from a remote sensing image of central western Jilin Province, China. The result was validated by field measurement data and measurement from an aerial image of 0.5 m x 0.5 m spatial resolution. Mean absolute error was 2.40 and 2.73 m respectively, suggesting that the proposed method is feasible and its accuracy is acceptable. The study provides a valuable method for monitoring shelterbelt width across large spatial scales and an accurate input parameter for the recognition of shelterbelt porosity from remote sensing data in future research.

TI  - The impact of inguinal lymph node micrometastases in patients with vulvar cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Inguinofemoral metastases are a major determinant of vulvar cancer relapse. Until today, the impact of micrometastases of inguinal nodes on local recurrence rates of patients with vulvar cancer remains unknown. The purpose of this retrospective study is to evaluate the rates of micrometastases in a series of patients with vulvar cancer treated with radical vulvectomy and inguinofemoral LND and to assess the probability of cancer relapse among this specific category. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study on patients with vulvar cancer who attended the gynaecological department of Anticancer Hospital of St. Savvas between January 1989 and January 2007. Ultra-staging of lymph nodes for micrometastases was performed after cutting the remaining specimens with a microtome in multiple slices of 3 mu m. Subsequently they were stained with traditional hematoxylin and eosin and CK AE1/AE3 antibodies for immunohistochemichal analysis. Results Ninety-two patients with primary vulvar malignancies were included in the present retrospective study. Ultrastaging of the lymph nodes revealed micrometastases in five patients (5.4%). Neither the duration of the procedure, nor the number of retrieved lymph nodes was directly associated with the presence of micrometastases. The patients were followed up for more than 5 years. Sixteen recurrences (17.4%) occurred during this period. The presence of micrometastases did not influence the recurrence rate (OR 3.57, 95% CI 0.55-23.36, p = 0.184). Conclusion Ultrastaging of inguinal nodes does not seem to add any benefit in the prediction of local recurrence rates. Future multicenter studies are needed in the field to corroborate our findings.

TI  - Comparison of Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography-Computed Tomography (SPECT/CT) and Conventional Planar Lymphoscintigraphy for Sentinel Node Localization in Patients with Cutaneous Malignancies
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is vital to performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for cutaneous malignancies. Potential advantages of single-photon emission computed tomography with integrated computed tomography (SPECT/CT) include the ability to readily identify aberrant drainage patterns as well as provide the surgeon with three-dimensional anatomic landmarks not seen on conventional planar lymphoscintigraphy (PLS).Patients with cutaneous malignancies who underwent SLNB with preoperative imaging using both SPECT/CT and PLS from 2011 to 2014 were identified.Both SPECT/CT and PLS were obtained in 351 patients (median age, 69 years; range, 5-94 years) with cutaneous malignancies (melanoma = 300, Merkel cell carcinoma = 33, squamous cell carcinoma = 8, other = 10) after intradermal injection of (99m)technetium sulfur colloid (median dose 300 A mu Ci). A mean of 4.3 hot spots were identified on SPECT/CT compared to 3.0 on PLS (p < 0.001). One hundred fifty-three patients (43.6 %) had identical findings between SPECT/CT and PLS, while 172 (49 %) had additional hot spots identified on SPECT/CT compared to only 24 (6.8 %) additional on PLS. SPECT/CT demonstrated additional nodal basins in 103 patients (29.4 %), compared to only 11 patients (3.1 %) with additional basins on PLS.SPECT/CT is a useful adjunct that can help with sentinel node localization in challenging cases. It identified additional hot spots not seen on PLS in almost 50 % of patients. Because PLS identified hot spots not seen on SPECT/CT in 6.8 % of patients, we recommend using both modalities jointly. Long-term follow-up will be required to validate the clinical significance of the additional hot spots identified by SPECT/CT.

TI  - Study on the Relationship between Soil Emissivity Spectra and Content of Soil Elements
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, based on the measurements of soil elements content and infrared spectra of 26 soil samples collected in more than 10 places, the relationship between soil emissivity in mid-infrared bands and the content of 11 soil elements including organic matters such as NO3-N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn and pH are analyzed. The bands where the soil elements content are significantly correlated with emissivity are given. And soil elements content estimation method is established based on the soil emissivity spectra with the partial least squares regression model and multiple stepwise regression model. The results show that: (1) In 8 similar to 10 mu m, the correlation coefficient (R-2) between Ca and soil emissivity is the highest, followed by Mg, Mn and Fe, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0. 85 and the lowest, 0. 52. In the range of 6 similar to 8 mu m, the correlations between the contents of K, Fe, NO3-N, Zn and emissivity decrease gradually, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0. 75 and the lowest 0. 48. In 10 similar to 14 mu m, the correlation between soil elements contents and emissivity is the highest for Mn, followed successively by P and K. (2) The scatter plot of soil emissivity and pH value has a parabola relation basically. The emissivity is the highest when pH value is 7, while the emissivity decreases gradually with the gradual decrease of pH value. (3) The accuracy of the estimated soil elements content from the partial least squares regression method is higher than that from the multiple stepwise regression method. It is noted that R-2 between the measurements and the estimates for the elements of Cu, Fe and Ca from the partial least squares regression method are very high (larger than 0. 9). Additionally, using the simulated emissivity spectrum in the ASTER thermal infrared bands, modeling R-2 and validation R2 between the measurements and the estimates for the elements of Ca from the multiple stepwise regression method are high (0. 774 and 0. 892, respectively). Using the simulated emissivity spectrum in the MODIS infrared bands, modeling R-2 and validation R-2 for Ca and Fe are higher than 0. 85, and modeling R-2 and validation R-2 for Mg, K are higher than 0. 5. As a whole, the emissivity spectrum in ASTER band 10 and band 11 and MODIS bands 28, 29, 30 are more sensitive to soil elements content, and thus they are more suitable for the estimation of soil elements content.

TI  - Comparison of Two Simulation Methods of the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) for Drought Monitoring in Semi-Arid Regions of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), a drought monitoring index based on an empirical parameterization of the Land Surface Temperature (LST)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) space, has been widely implemented in a variety of ecosystems worldwide because it does not depend on ancillary data. However, the simulation of dry/wet edges in the TVDI model can be problematic because remote sensing images do not have sufficient pixels to identify the wetness and dryness extremes of different vegetation coverages. In this study, an improvement in dry/wet edge simulation was proposed, and a comparison of the original TVDI and the modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDIm) was performed for drought monitoring in Ningxia Province, which is a typical semi-arid region in China. First, the difference between the land surface temperatures in day and night (Delta LST) was used as an alternative to LST when building the TVDIm model. In addition, the wet edges were improved by removing outliers using a statistical method, and the dry edges were optimized by removing the "tail down" points in the NDVI range of 0.0-0.1. Here, the modeling process of TVDIm in 2005, one of recent extreme drought year is illustrated. The results show that both the TVDI and TVDIm can be used to monitor the temporal and spatial variations of drought, and the onset, duration, extent, and severity of drought can be reflected by TVDI and TVDIm maps. However, the magnitude of TVDI is higher than that of TVDIm, which could cause the TVDI-simulated drought condition to be elevated in normal years and underestimated in dry years. The TVDIm has higher coefficients of correlation with in situ meteorological drought index and agricultural drought statistical data than does the original TVDI, and it exhibits better performance in drought monitoring compared to that of the original TVDI in semi-arid regions of China.

TI  - Is sentinel lymph node biopsy warranted for desmoplastic melanoma? A systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Desmoplastic melanoma (DM) is an uncommon malignancy associated with a high local recurrence rate. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the positivity rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with DM. The secondary outcome was to establish if SLNB is warranted for both pure DM (PDM) and mixed DM (MDM). Methods: A full systematic literature review of SLNB in DM was performed by two authors in January 2016. Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched.Results: Sixteen studies involving 1519 patients having SLNB in DM were included, of which 99 patients had positive SLNB (6.5%). Two articles reported a significantly reduced disease-free survival (DFS) with positive SLNB and three published a reduced melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Six studies compared SLNB in MDM and PDM. Of the 275 patients, 38 (13.8%) had a positive SLNB in MDM compared to 17 of 313 patients (5.4%) with positive SLNB in PDM.Conclusions: Rates of positive SLNB in DM are reduced compared to other variants of melanoma; however, nodal status may still predict DFS and MSS. MDM is associated with a higher rate of micro-metastases to regional lymph nodes than PDM, and DFS and MSS may be lesser in MDM than in PDM. We would recommend the consideration of SLNB in MDM. However, with such low rates of positive SLNB in PDM, and in the absence of high-risk features to stratify patients, we would not recommend SLNB in PDM.

TI  - Characterizing Vegetation Canopy Structure Using Airborne Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation canopy structure plays an important role in the partitioning of incident solar radiation, photosynthesis, transpiration, and other scalar fluxes. The vertical foliage distribution of the plant canopy is represented by leaf area density (LAD), which is defined as the one-sided leaf area per unit volume. Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) offers the possibility to characterize the 3-D variation of LAD over space, which still remains a challenge to estimate. Moreover, the low density of point cloud data generally offered by airborne LiDAR may be insufficient for accurate LAD estimation in dense overlapping forest canopies. We develop a method for the estimation of the LAD profile using a combination of airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data using a feature-based data fusion approach. After identifying vegetation species using hyperspectral data, point cloud LiDAR data is used in a "tree-shaped" voxel approach to characterize the LAD of trees in a riparian forest setting. We also propose a set of relationships on simple geometry of overlap for the construction of tree shaped voxels. In a forest setting with overlapping canopies, the results indicate that the tree-shaped voxels are better able to attribute the LAD to the upper and middle parts of the overall canopy as well as individual tall and short trees compared with traditional cylindrical voxels.

TI  - Monitoring the 3-year thermal signatures of the Calbuco pre-volcano eruption event
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing to monitor volcanic eruption may not be very accurate. In this paper, we seek to describe supportive techniques to aid the efficiency of remote sensing in monitoring and predicting eruptions. The last three volcano eruptions in Calbuco occurred in 1961, 1976, and 2015. Calbuco is located on latitude 41.33 S and longitude 72.62 W. The duration of the research is 3 years before the eruption, that is, 1958-1960, 1973-1975, and 2012-2014. The specified duration was examined using the thermographic model and k factor analysis that is aided by the Global Land Data Assimilation System ( GLDAS), Landsat 8 OLI, Mosaic, and ETM imageries. This study adopts the thermal analysis parameters which includes average surface temperature, ground heat flux, latent heat flux, sensible heat flux, surface temperature at ground layer 3, surface temperature at ground layer 10, net longwave temperature, and net shortwave radiation. The combination of remotely sensed measurement with the chosen techniques corroborates each other with salient discoveries like the k factor properties, the period of thermal signature retrieval from either the satellite and ground observations or the cup-like ripple effect whose base is found at the lineament beyond the volcanic site.

TI  - AGREEMENT BETWEEN A SMARTPHONE PULSE SENSOR APPLICATION AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY FOR DETERMINING LNRMSSD
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the agreement between a smartphone pulse finger sensor (SPFS) and electrocardiography (ECG) for determining ultra-shortterm heart rate variability in 3 different positions. Thirty college-aged men (n = 15) and women (n = 15) volunteered to participate in this study. Sixty-second heart rate measures were simultaneously taken with the SPFS and ECG in supine, seated, and standing positions. The log transformed root mean square of successive R-R interval differences (lnRMSSD) was calculated from the SPFS and ECG. The lnRMSSD values were 81.5 +/- 11.7 using ECG and 81.6 +/- 11.3 using SPFS (p = 0.63, Cohen's d = 0.01) in the supine position, 76.5 +/- 8.2 using ECG and 77.5 +/- 8.2 using SPFS (p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.11) in the seated position, and 66.5 +/- 9.2 using ECG and 67.8 +/- 9.1 using SPFS (p<0.001, Cohen's d = 0.15) in the standing position. The SPFS showed a possibly strong correlation to the ECG in all 3 positions (r values from 0.98 to 0.99). In addition, the limits of agreement (constant error +/- 1.98 SD) were -0.13 +/- 2.83 for the supine values, -0.94 +/- 3.47 for the seated values, and -1.37 +/- 3.56 for the standing values. The results of the study suggest good agreement between the SPFS and ECG for measuring lnRMSSD in supine, seated, and standing positions. Although significant differences were noted between the 2 methods in the seated and standing positions, the effect sizes were trivial.

TI  - Catastrophic flash flood triggered by an extreme rainfall event in El Rodeo village, January 2014. Northwestern Pampean Ranges of Argentina
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash floods occur periodically in the hilly areas of Argentina, but since they generally occur at inhabited areas, these are rarely registered. Several factors contribute to the occurrence of flash floods: heavy seasonal rains, rugged topography and geological structures. On Thursday night, 23 January 2014 an extreme rainfall event, took place in El Rodeo, Catamarca Province, triggering an unexpected flash flood. This flood caused 14 fatalities and great economic losses in the main localities of the Ambato Department. Steep slope gradients facilitated the quick drainage of the precipitated volumes. Water, boulders and debris channeled downstream caused severe stream bank erosion and major damage to houses roads and bridges. This paper presents a morphometric analysis in order to determine some geomorphic characteristics of the Ambato River basin, together with a preliminary analysis of the flood hazard potentially damaging to inhabitants and infrastructure to downstream villages. The study was carried out using high-resolution satellite data acquired before and after the event. The drainage networks were derived from Aster GDEM V2 and satellite images.

TI  - Intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph node by one-step nucleic acid amplification in breast cancer patients after neoadjuvant treatment reduces the need for a second surgery for axillary lymph node dissection
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has been shownto be both accurate and feasible forwomenwho receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Intraoperative assessment of SLN by frozen sections can produce false negative results. The aim of this study was to compare two different techniques of intraoperative assessment of SLNinbreast cancerpatients treated withNAC: frozen section(FS) and molecular assay (OSNA).Methods: A multicenter cohort of 320 consecutive breast cancer patients treated with NAC between 2010 and 2014 was analyzed. FS was performed intraoperatively in 166 patients (H& E cohort) and OSNA in 154 patients (OSNA cohort).Results: A mean of 2.15 SLNs by FS and 1.22 SLNs by OSNA was assessed (p = 0.03). SLN metastasis was found in 44 patients (26.5%) by FS and in 48 (31.2%) by OSNA (p = 0.4). There was no statistical significance in rates of macrometastasis (75%), micrometastasis (20.5%) or ITCs (4.5%) when assessed by FS compared to OSNA (52.3%, 36.3% and 11.4%, respectively) (p = 0.06). There were 10 patients in the H& E cohort with positive-SLN in the definitive pathology assessment with negative intraoperative FS. When OSNA and definitive pathology were compared, there were no differences in rates of macrometastasis (61.1%), micrometastasis (33.3%) nor ITCs (5.6%) (p = 0.5). Fifty-four patients in the H& E cohort and 44 in the OSNA cohort had ALND after positive-SLNs. ALND was performed in a second surgery in 10 patients (18.5%) in the H& E cohort for intraoperative FS false negative results, 90% being micrometastasis. 42 out of 44 patients (95.5%) in the OSNA cohort had an ALND in the same surgery (p = 0.03).Conclusions: OSNA assay detects SLNs metastases as accurately as conventional pathology in the NAC setting. Intraoperative definitive assessment of the SLN by OSNA reduces the need for a second surgery for ALND in 18.5% of breast cancer patients with a positive-SLN after NAC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - A Network-Based Enhanced Spectral Diversity Approach for TOPS Time-Series Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For multitemporal analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired with a terrain observation by progressive scan (TOPS) mode, all acquisitions from a given satellite track must be coregistered to a reference coordinate system with accuracies better than 0.001 of a pixel (assuming full SAR resolution) in the azimuth direction. Such a high accuracy can be achieved through geometric coregistration, using precise satellite orbits and a digital elevation model, followed by a refinement step using a time-series analysis of coregistration errors. These errors represent the misregistration between all TOPS acquisitions relative to the reference coordinate system. We develop a workflow to estimate the time series of azimuth misregistration using a network-based enhanced spectral diversity (NESD) approach, in order to reduce the impact of temporal decorrelation on coregistration. Example time series of misregistration inferred for five tracks of Sentinel-1 TOPS acquisitions indicates a maximum relative azimuth misregistration of less than 0.01 of the full azimuth resolution between the TOPS acquisitions in the studied areas. Standard deviation of the estimated misregistration time series for different stacks varies from 1.1e-3 to 2e-3 of the azimuth resolution, equivalent to 1.6-2.8 cm orbital uncertainty in the azimuth direction. These values fall within the 1-sigma orbital uncertainty of the Sentinel-1 orbits and imply that orbital uncertainty is most likely the main source of the constant azimuth misregistration between different TOPS acquisitions. We propagate the uncertainty of individual misregistration estimated with ESD to the misregistration time series estimated with NESD and investigate the different challenges for operationalizing NESD.

TI  - A Set of Methods to Support Object-Based Distributed Analysis of Large Volumes of Earth Observation Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in the number of aerial and orbital Earth observation systems is generating a huge amount of remote sensing data that need to be readily transformed into useful information for policy and decision makers. This exposes an urgent demand for image interpretation tools that can deal efficiently with very large volumes of data. In this work, we introduce a set of methods that support distributed processing of georeferenced raster and vector data in a computer cluster, which may be a virtual cluster provided by cloud computing infrastructure services. The set of methods comprise a particular technique for indexing distributed georeferenced datasets, as well as strategies for distributing efficiently the processing of spatial context-aware operations. They provide the means for the development of scalable applications, capable of processing large volumes of geospatial data. We evaluated the proposed methods in a remote sensing image interpretation application, built on the MapReduce framework, and executed in a cloud computing infrastructure. The experimental results corroborate the capacity of the methods to support efficient handling of very large earth observation datasets.

TI  - Removal of curtaining effects by a variational model with directional forward differences
T2  - COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING
M3  - Article
AB  - Focused ion beam (FIB) tomography provides high resolution volumetric images on a micro scale. However, due to the physical acquisition process the resulting images are often corrupted by a so-called curtaining or waterfall effect. In this paper, a new convex variational model for removing such effects is proposed. More precisely, an infimal convolution model is applied to split the corrupted 3D image into the clean image and two types of corruptions, namely a striped part and a laminar one. In order to accomplish the decomposition we exploit the fact that the single parts have certain spatial structures, which are penalized by different first and second order differences. By doing so, our approach generalizes discrete unidirectional total variational (TV) approaches. A minimizer of the proposed model is computed by well-known primal dual techniques. Numerical examples show the very good performance of our new method for artificial as well as real-world data. Besides FIB tomography, we have also successfully applied our technique for the removal of pure stripes in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to track changes in training load (TL) and recovery status indicators throughout a 2-week preseason and to interpret the meaning of these changes on an individual basis among 8 division-1 female soccer players. Weekly averages for heart rate variability (logarithm of the root mean square of successive R-R interval differences [lnRMSSD]), TL, and psychometrics were compared with effect sizes (ESs) and magnitude-based inferences. Relationships were determined with Pearson correlations. Group analysis showed a very likely moderate decrease for total TL (TTL) (TTL week 1 = 1,203 +/- 198, TTL week 2 = 977 +/- 288; proportion = 1/2/97, ES = -0.93) and a likely small increase in lnRMSSD (week 1 = 74.2 +/- 11.1, week 2 = 78.1 +/- 10.5; proportion = 81/14/5, ES = 0.35). Fatigue demonstrated a very likely small improvement (week 1 = 5.03 +/- 1.09, week 2 = 5.51 +/- 1.00; proportion = 95/4/1; ES = 0.45), whereas the other psychometrics did not substantially change. A very large correlation was found between changes in TL and lnRMSSD (r = -0.85), whereas large correlations were found between lnRMSSD and perceived fatigue (r = 0.56) and soreness (r = 0.54). Individual analysis suggests that 2 subjects may benefit from decreased TL, 2 subjects may benefit from increased TL, and 4 subjects may require no intervention based on their psychometric and lnRMSSD responses to the TL. Individual weekly changes in lnRMSSD varied among subjects and related strongly with individual changes in TL. Training intervention based on lnRMSSD and wellness responses may be useful for preventing the accumulation of fatigue in female soccer players.

TI  - Distribution of <i>Salmonella</i> in Humans, Production Animal Operations and a Watershed in a FoodNet Canada Sentinel Site
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmonella is an important human pathogen, and production animals as well as water are known potential sources. This study helped provide insight into the epidemiology of Salmonella by comparing Salmonella strains found in humans to those detected in production animals and water in the same geographic area and time frame. Salmonella was found in 55% of broiler, 30% of swine, 13% of dairy, and 10% of beef manure samples and 23% of water samples. At the farm level, Salmonella was found on 93% of broiler, 81% of swine, 32% of beef and 30% of dairy farms. Salmonella strains of importance to public health were found in all sources tested; however, they appeared to be more common in the broilers. A number of the farms in this study were mixed farms, in that they had more than one production animal species on the farm. At both the sample and farm levels, beef-only farms had a significantly lower Salmonella prevalence (5% and 7%, respectively) than beef farms with additional production animal species (e.g. poultry) (12% and 42%, respectively) (P0.05). Additionally, a number of mixed farms had more than one commodity sampled for this study and similar Salmonella strains by phage type and PFGE were found in the poultry and the other sampled commodity on the farm. This information can help inform the evidence base needed to help target interventions and modify best practices in production agriculture.

TI  - Unexpectedly high leprosy seroprevalence detected using a random surveillance strategy in midwestern Brazil: A comparison of ELISA and a rapid diagnostic test
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Leprosy diagnosis is mainly based on clinical evaluation, although this approach is difficult, especially for untrained physicians. We conducted a temporary campaign to detect previously unknown leprosy cases in midwestern Brazil and to compare the performance of different serological tests.MethodsA mobile clinic was stationed at the main bus terminal in Brasilia, Brazil. Volunteers were quizzed and given a clinical exam to allow categorization as either patients, known contacts of patients or non-contacts, and blood was collected to determine anti-PGL-I and anti-LID-1 antibody titers by ELISA and by the NDO-LID rapid test. New cases of leprosy and the impact of performing this broad random surveillance strategy were evaluated. Accuracy values and concordance between the test results were evaluated among all groups.ResultsFour hundred thirty-four individuals were evaluated, and 44 (10.1%) were diagnosed with leprosy. Borderline forms were the most frequent presentation. Both tests presented higher positivity in those individuals with multibacillary disease. All tests demonstrated a specificity of approximately 90% but only a sensitivity for clinical disease of less than 20%. A substantial agreement between NDO-LID and ELISA with concomitant positive results was found within leprosy patients (Kappa index = 0.79 CI95% 0.36-1.22).ConclusionsThe unexpectedly high leprosy prevalence in this population indicates ongoing community-based exposure to Mycobacterium leprae antigens and high rates of subclinical infection. All tests showed high specificity but low sensitivity and therefore cannot be considered for use as stand-alone diagnostics. Rather, considering their positivity among MB patients and non-patients, these tests can be considered effective tools for screening and identifying individuals at high risk who might benefit from regular monitoring.

TI  - The Views of Informal Carers' Evaluation of Services (VOICES): Toward an adaptation for the New Zealand bicultural context
T2  - PALLIATIVE & SUPPORTIVE CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The Views of Informal Carers Experiences of Services (VOICES) instrument is a postal questionnaire that has been utilized internationally to capture the experiences of end-of-life care during the lastmonths of life. Aotearoa/New Zealand, traditionally a bicultural society, reflects both the European worldview and that of the indigenous Maori. The Maori collectivist worldview considers whanau (extended family) support as key at the end of life and privileges "kanohi ki te kanohi" (face-to-face) meetings. In such a context, how will VOICES be received? Our pilot study was designed to test the effectiveness of an adaptation of the VOICES questionnaire in the New Zealand social setting for both Maori and non-Maori.Method: Cognitive interviews were conducted with 20 bereaved whanau and family members whose relative died between January 1 and April 4, 2014, in one urban New Zealand hospital. Thematic analysis was conducted on the resulting transcripts.Results: We found that, although the questionnaire provides valuable information, administration of the current questionnaire within a bicultural context is problematic. These problems are related to its scope, cultural acceptability, structure, and content. Distribution of the VOICES questionnaire, either through the post or online, without prior consultation, also risks engaging Maori in a culturally inappropriate manner.Significance of results: These findings will prompt revisions to both the content and research approach to implementing VOICES in a bicultural context. Recommendations include prior consultation with local indigenous communities as well as utilization of a mixed-methods approach to utilizing VOICES in a bicultural context. The cognitive interview procedures employed (adjusted for a collectivist worldview) in this study may also prove useful to indigenous groups seeking to develop or adapt questionnaires within a bicultural or multicultural context.

TI  - Comparison of object-based and pixel-based Random Forest algorithm for wetland vegetation mapping using high spatial resolution GF-1 and SAR data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an integral component of wetland ecosystems. Mapping distribution, quality and quantity of wetland vegetation is important for wetland protection, management and restoration. This study evaluated the performance of object-based and pixel-based Random Forest (RF) algorithms for mapping wetland vegetation using a new Chinese high spatial resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite image, L-band PALSAR and C-band Radarsat-2 data. This research utilized the wavelet-principal component analysis (PCA) image fusion technique to integrate multispectral GF-1 and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Comparison of six classification scenarios indicates that the use of additional multi-source datasets achieved higher classification accuracy. The specific conclusions of this study include the followings:(1) the classification of GF-1, Radarsat-2 and PALSAR images found statistically significant difference between pixel-based and object-based methods; (2) object-based and pixel-based RF classifications both achieved greater 80% overall accuracy for both GF-1 and GF-1 fused with SAR images; (3) object-based classifications improved overall accuracy between 3%-10% in all scenarios when compared to pixel-based classifications; (4) object-based classifications produced by the integration of GF-1, Radarsat-2 and PALSAR images outperformed any of the lone datasets, and achieved 89.64% overall accuracy.

TI  - Possible mechanisms of the crosstalk between Langerhans cells and regulatory T cells in extramammary Paget disease by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand/RANK pathways
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a skin adenocarcinoma of apocrine gland origin, in which Paget cells express receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand (RANKL) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7, and release soluble (s) RANKL into the tumour microenvironment. We previously reported that about 60% of the RANK(+) cells among the stromal cells are M2 macrophages, but the identity of the remaining population of RANK+ cells is still unknown.Objectives To investigate the unknown subpopulation of RANK-expressing cells in EMPD.Methods The main population of RANK-expressing cells in the epidermis was composed of epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs). To explore the effects of RANKL on LCs, we stimulated LCs generated from human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells with graded concentrations of sRANKL. To further examine the correlation between LCs and regulatory T cells (Tregs) in EMPD, we employed immunohistochemical staining.Results sRANKL stimulation was shown to augment the production of C-C motif chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) from LCs. We additionally demonstrated CCL17 expression by CD1a(+) LCs in EMPD in an immunofluorescence study. Spearman's rank correlation test confirmed a correlation between the number of LCs and the number of Foxp3(+) Tregs in the lesional skin of invasive EMPD. In addition, the numbers of Foxp3(+) Tregs in the sentinel lymph nodes of metastatic EMPD were significantly higher than those of metastatic melanoma, which did not express RANKL.Conclusions The findings suggest that the RANKL/RANK pathway in EMPD might contribute to the recruitment of Tregs and to maintenance of the tumour microenvironment.

TI  - Topographical and hydrological effects on meso-scale vegetation in desert steppe, Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the seasonal variations of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and its relationships with climatic variables and topography in a small-scale (20 kmX20 km) area (i.e., Tsogt-Ovoo village) within the desert steppe zone of Mongolia using in-situ observed climate data and satellite remote sensing data. We found that the topography is very important for vegetation growth in the desert steppe although the summer precipitation is the constraining factor. The unexpectedly high NDVI (up to 0.56), as well as the high aboveground biomass, in the valley bottom was primarily resulted from the topography-modulated redistribution of overland flow after relatively heavy precipitation events during the growing season. This makes the valley bottoms in desert steppes not only reliable feeding resources for livestock but also heavens for wild lives. But, the detected large standard deviation of annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) from 2000 to 2013 in the valley bottom in response to rather variable precipitation implies that the valley bottoms under desert steppe climates are more vulnerable to climatic change.

TI  - Estimating forest carbon stocks in tropical dry forests of Zimbabwe: exploring the performance of high and medium spatial-resolution multispectral sensors
T2  - SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation and mapping of forest dendrometric characteristics such as carbon stocks using remote sensing techniques is fundamental for improved understanding of the role of forests in the carbon cycle and climate change. In this study, we tested whether and to what extent spectral transforms, i.e. vegetation indices derived from new generation high-spatial-resolution multispectral sensors (WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1), estimate carbon stocks when compared with medium-spatial-resolution broadband sensors (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper) based on two savanna woodland types in Zimbabwe. Subsequently, the best ordinary least squares regression model relating carbon stocks and vegetation indices was applied in mapping carbon stocks in two study sites. Based on k-fold cross-validated regression models, vegetation indices computed from new generation high-spatial-resolution multispectral sensors yielded high R2 values ranging between 82% and 73% (RMSEcv: 5.55-6.87%) for Mukuvisi and 62-73% (RMSEcv: 11.5-13.6) for Malipati compared with Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper derived vegetation indices, which yielded R2 values between 47% and 49% (RMSEcv: 9.6-10.1%) for Mukuvisi and 22-41% (RMSEcv: 11.5-19.1%) for Malipati. The findings demonstrated that medium-spatial-resolution sensors are less sensitive to attributes of sparsely distributed trees, especially in savanna woodlands, where the size of trees are often less that the spatial resolution of the mediumspatial-resolution sensors. These findings emphasise the importance of new generation high-spatial-resolution multispectral sensors in estimating forest structural attributes, such as carbon stocks in open woodlands.

TI  - Quantifying biomass consumption and carbon release from the California Rim fire by integrating airborne LiDAR and Landsat OLI data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying biomass consumption and carbon release is critical to understanding the role of fires in the carbon cycle and air quality. We present a methodology to estimate the biomass consumed and the carbon released by the California Rim fire by integrating postfire airborne LiDAR and multitemporal Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. First, a support vector regression (SVR) model was trained to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB) from LiDAR-derived metrics over the unburned area. The selected model estimated AGB with an R-2 of 0.82 and RMSE of 59.98 Mg/ha. Second, LiDAR-based biomass estimates were extrapolated to the entire area before and after the fire, using Landsat OLI reflectance bands, Normalized Difference Infrared Index, and the elevation derived from LiDAR data. The extrapolation was performed using SVR models that resulted in R-2 of 0.73 and 0.79 and RMSE of 87.18 (Mg/ha) and 75.43 (Mg/ha) for the postfire and prefire images, respectively. After removing bias from the AGB extrapolations using a linear relationship between estimated and observed values, we estimated the biomass consumption from postfire LiDAR and prefire Landsat maps to be 6.58 +/- 0.03 Tg (10(12) g), which translate into 12.06 +/- 0.06 Tg CO2(e) released to the atmosphere, equivalent to the annual emissions of 2.57 million cars.

TI  - Oil Slicks Detection From Polarimetric Data Using Stochastic Distances Between Complex Wishart Distributions
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (PolSAR) have been used to detect oil slicks at the sea surface. Different techniques to extract information from polarimetric data, using an adequate statistical distribution are currently available. A region-based classifier for PolSAR data - named PolClass - uses a supervised approach to compare stochastic distances between scaled complex Wishart distributions and hypothesis tests to associate confidence levels into the classification results. In this paper, the integrated use of these distances together with the uncertainty maps is applied for the first time to detect oil slicks. A quad-pol Radarsat-2 data, acquired during one open-water controlled exercise, was used to perform this test. The PolClass achieved similar overall accuracies for four stochastic distances, reaching 96.54% of global accuracy, the best result obtained by the Hellinger distance. A comparison between the full-and dual-pol matrices indicated that the results obtained with the VV-HH-HV, HH-HV, and VV-HV polarizations are statistically equivalent, but different from that obtained using the HH-VV. Therefore, the exclusion of the HV channel affected the detection of only mineral oils. The classifier demonstrated the potential to detect the three types of oils released, being more effective in detecting biogenic oils rather than mineral oils. The uncertainty levels increase from the center to the border of the mineral oil slicks, indicating the presence of transition regions, possibly related to different weathering mechanisms. The proposed approach will contribute to the understanding of where different physical and chemical processes may be acting, associating confidence levels to the classification results.

TI  - Correlation Between SUV<sub>max</sub> and CT Radiomic Analysis Using Lymph Node Density in PET/CT-Based Lymph Node Staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In patients with lung cancer (LC), malignant melanoma (MM), PET-indeterminate LNs. gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP NETs), and prostate cancer (PCA), lymph node (LN) staging is often performed by F-18-FDG PET/CT (LC and MM), Ga-68-DOTATOC PET/CT (GEP NET), and Ga-68-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT (PCA) but is sometimes not accurate because of indeterminate PET findings. To better evaluate malignant LN infiltration, additional surrogate parameters, especially in cases with indeterminate PET findings, would be helpful. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether SUVmax in the PET examination might correlate with semiautomated density measurements of LNs in the CT component of the PET/CT examination. Methods: After approval by the institutional review board, 1,022 LNs in the PET/CT examinations of 148 patients were retrospectively analyzed (LC: 327 LNs of 40 patients; MM: 224 LNs of 33 patients; GEP NET: 217 LNs of 35 patients; and PCA: 254 LNs of 40 patients). PET/CT was performed before surgery, biopsy, chem-otherapy, or internal or external radiation therapy, according to the clinical schedule; patients with prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy were excluded. SUVmax analyses were based on uptake 60 min after tracer injection, and volumetric CT histogram analyses were based on the unenhanced CT images of the PET/CT scan. Results: PET findings were considered positive or negative on the basis of SUVmax in the LN compared with that in the blood pool; histologic confirmation was not available. Of the 1,022 LNs, 331 were PET-positive (3 times the SUVmax of the blood pool), 86 were PET-indeterminate (1-3 times the SUVmax of the blood pool), and 605 were PET-negative (less than the SUVmax of the blood pool). PET-positive LNs had significantly higher CT densities than PET-negative LNs, irrespective of the type of cancer. Conclusion: CT density measurements of LNs in patients with LC, MM, GEP NET, and PCA correlated with (18)FFDG uptake, Ga-68-DOTATOC uptake, and Ga-68-PSMA uptake, respectively, and might therefore serve as an additional surrogate parameter for differentiating between malignant and benign LNs. The use of a 7.5-Hounsfield unit CT density threshold to differentiate between malignant and benign LN infiltration and 20 Hounsfield units to exclude benign LN processes might be possible in clinical routine and would be especially helpful for PET-indeterminate LNs.

AB  - There is a variety of concepts of the divine in the eastern and western theological and philosophical traditions. There is, however, not enough reflection on the logic behind concepts of God and their justification. I clarify some necessary and sufficient conditions any attempt to explicate a concept of God has to take into account. I argue that each concept of God is a cypher for a particular worldview and distinguishes three types of justification frequently used to bestow content on particular concepts of God: philosophical, theological, and scientific. I turn to four fundamental models of the God-world relation and argue that the most promising concept of God is panentheistic, on which the universe is essentially divine but is not exhaustive of the divine being.

TI  - The Participation Imperative in Co-operative Inquiry: Personal Reflections of an Initiating Researcher
T2  - SYSTEMIC PRACTICE AND ACTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Participation has become an imperative in international development. In particular, participatory approaches to development research are believed to support empowerment through collective development of knowledge and action. Yet there are broad interpretations of participation, ranging from passive participation and information exchange to empowered participation through self-mobilisation. As such, development researchers may claim to use a participatory approach without yielding power and agency to citizens involved in the research. This is a reflexive article about a development researcher's experience in applying a participatory worldview through co-operative inquiry, a research approach that attempts to engage emancipatory forms of participation. The article begins with a critical analysis of literature regarding participation, the participatory paradigm and participation in the co-operative inquiry. The author then analyses her personal experiences, challenges and strategies as initiating researcher to actualise empowering forms of participation in three co-operative inquiries. The article emphasises that researchers must "let go" of their power, control and personal agenda to support empowering participation.

TI  - Indocyanine green-assisted sentinel lymph node biopsy in melanoma using the "FOVIS" system
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metastatic involvement of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) represents a key prognostic factor in melanoma. The combined use of a radiocolloid (technetium-99m) and blue dye is the gold standard in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In this context, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (ICG) has been suggested as an alternative. The objective of the present study was to examine the potential advantages of fluorescence-guided SLNB - compared to the conventional method with respect to the visualization of lymphatic drainage pathways and the SLN. Particular focus was on the impact of the ICG dose used and the body mass index (BMI).Patients and methods: The study included ten patients who underwent the SLNB procedure using technetium-99m, blue dye, and ICG. Real-time fluorescence imaging of lymphatic drainage pathways and the SLN was done using the "FOVIS"-NIR system. Depending on the quality of the images achieved, ICG was intradermally administered at a dose ranging from 0.25 to 2.5 mg.Results: Nine SLNs were identified by fluorescence (90 %); (100 %) ten, by gamma probe; eight (80 %), by ICG or blue dye. Transdermal SLN detection was possible in one case (10 %). In correlation to the BMI, higher intradermal ICG doses - up to 2.5 mg overall - proved to be advantageous in the visualization of lymphatic vessels.Conclusions: Supplementing the technetium-99m method, fluorescence SLNB using ICG and the "FOVIS"-NIR system is a safe alternative to the blue-dye technique. Further studies on the optimal ICG dose and transdermal imaging in correlation to the BMI are required.

TI  - Correlation analysis between vegetation coverage and climate drought conditions in North China during 2001-2013
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the most important factors that affect vegetation distribution in North China. Among all climatic factors, drought is considered to have the most significant effect on the environment. Based on previous studies, the climate drought index can be used to assess the evolutionary trend of the ecological environment under various arid climatic conditions. It is necessary for us to further explore the relationship between vegetation coverage (index) and climate drought conditions. Therefore, in this study, based on MODIS-NDVI products and meteorological observation data, the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and vegetation coverage in North China were first calculated. Then, the interannual variations of PDSI and vegetation coverage during 2001-2013 were analyzed using a Theil-Sen slope estimator. Finally, an ecoregion perspective of the correlation between them was discussed. The experimental results demonstrated that the PDSI index and vegetation coverage value varied over different ecoregions. During the period 2001-2013, vegetation coverage increased in the southern and northern mountains of North China, while it showed a decreasing trend in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan City Circle area and suburban agricultural zone located in Hebei Province and Henan Province). Over 13 years, the climate of the northeastern part of North China became more humid, while in the southern part of North China, it tended to be dry. According to the correlation analysis results, 73.37% of North China showed a positive correlation between the vegetation coverage and climate drought index. A negative correlation was observed mainly in urban and suburban areas of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei Province, and Henan Province. In most parts of North China, drought conditions in summer and autumn had a strong influence on vegetation coverage.

TI  - Hospital-based screening tools in the identification of non-accidental trauma
T2  - SEMINARS IN PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over 700,000 children are victims of abuse and neglect each year in the United States. Effective screening programs that entail broad capture of suspected non:accidental trauma (NAT) may help to identify sentinel injuries. This can facilitate earlier detection and psychosocial interventions in hopes of decreasing recurrent NAT, which confers a higher mortality rate. The purpose of this article is to outline essential components of hospital-based NAT screening tools and highlight existing programs. In general, these tools should include several components: education sessions for healthcare providers on how to identify signs of NAT, automated notes or checklists within the electronic medical record to prompt specialty referrals, and a multidisciplinary team of experts that can address the needs of these children in the acute care setting.

AB  - HINTERGRUND: Der Nachweis metastatischer Infiltrate im Sentinel-Lymphkoten (SLN) gilt als wesentlicher prognostischer Faktor des Melanoms. Alternativ zur Farbstoffmethode mit Patentblau zum Goldstandard der SLN-Biopsie (SLNB) mittels Radiokolloid wird die fluoreszenzoptische Darstellung mit Hilfe von Indocyaningrun (ICG) und Nahinfrarot (NIR)-Kamerasystem kommuniziert. Im Vergleich zur konventionellen Methode wurde die Wertigkeit des ICG-/NIR-Verfahrens in Abhangigkeit vom Body-Mass-Index (BMI) des Patienten und der Konzentration von ICG bezuglich der Visualisierung des Lymphabstroms und des SLNs untersucht.PATIENTEN UND METHODIK: An zehn Patienten wurde die SLNB mittels Technetium-99m, Patentblau und ICG durchgefuhrt. Die Fluoreszenz-Darstellung von Lymphbahnen und SLN erfolgte in Echtzeit mittels der NIR-Kameratechnik "FOVIS". Je nach erzielter Bildqualitat wurde ICG in einer Dosis von 0,25mg bis 2,5mg intrakutan appliziert.ERGEBNISSE: Neun der zehn SLN wurden fluoreszenzoptisch identifiziert (90%), alle zehn radioaktiv (100%), nur acht (80%) mittels ICG-Grunfarbung bzw. Patenblau-Markierung. Transdermal wurde ein SLN dargestellt (10%). In Korrelation zum BMI waren hohere ICG-Mengen, bis zu 2,5mg intrakutan absolut, in der Darstellung der Lymphbahnen von Vorteil.SCHLUSSFOLGERUNGEN: Die SLN-Fluoreszenzmarkierung mit dem ICG/NIR-Kamera-System "FOVIS" stellt eine sichere Alternative zur Farbstoffmethode mit Patentblau erganzend zur Radiokolloidmethode mit Technetium-99m dar. Weitere Studien zur optimalen Dosierung von ICG und transdermalen Bildgebung in Relation zum BMI sind notwendig.

TI  - A Radiometric Uncertainty Tool for the Sentinel 2 Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the framework of the European Copernicus programme, the European Space Agency (ESA) has launched the Sentinel-2 (S2) Earth Observation (EO) mission which provides optical high spatial resolution imagery over land and coastal areas. As part of this mission, a tool (named S2-RUT, from Sentinel-2 Radiometric Uncertainty Tool) has been developed. The tool estimates the radiometric uncertainty associated with each pixel in the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance factor images provided by ESA. This paper describes the design and development process of the initial version of the S2-RUT tool. The initial design step describes the S2 radiometric model where a set of uncertainty contributors are identified. Each of the uncertainty contributors is specified by reviewing the pre- and post-launch characterisation. The identified uncertainty contributors are combined following the guidelines in the 'Guide to Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement' (GUM) model and this combination model is further validated by comparing the results to a multivariate Monte Carlo Method (MCM). In addition, the correlation between the different uncertainty contributions and the impact of simplifications in the combination model have been studied. The software design of the tool prioritises an efficient strategy to read the TOA reflectance factor images, extract the auxiliary information from the metadata in the satellite products and the codification of the resulting uncertainty image. This initial version of the tool has been implemented and integrated as part of the Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP).

TI  - Citizen Observatories and the New Earth Observation Science
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Earth observation is diversifying, and now includes new types of systems, such as citizen observatories, unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor networks. However, the Copernicus Programme vision of a seamless chain from satellite data to usable information in the hands of decision makers is still largely unrealized, and remote sensing science lacks a conceptual framework to explain why. This paper reviews the literatures on citizen science, citizen observatories and conceptualization of remote sensing systems. It then proposes a Conceptual Framework for Earth Observation which can be used in a new Earth observation science to explain blockages in the chain from collecting data to disseminating information in any Earth observation system, including remote sensing systems. The framework differs from its predecessors by including social variables as well as technological and natural ones. It is used here, with evidence from successful citizen science projects, to compare the factors that are likely to influence the effectiveness of satellite remote sensing systems and citizen observatories. The paper finds that constraints on achieving the seamless " Copernicus Chain" are not solely technical, as assumed in the new Space Strategy for Europe, but include social constraints too. Achieving the Copernicus Chain will depend on the balance between: (a) the 'forward' momentum generated by the repetitive functioning of each component in the system, as a result of automatic operation or human institutions, and by the efficiency of interfaces between components; and (b) the 'backward' flow of information on the information needs of end users. Citizen observatories will face challenges in components which for satellite remote sensing systems are: (a) automatic or straightforward, e. g., sensor design and launch, data collection, and data products; and (b) also challenging, e. g., data processing. Since citizen observatories will rely even more on human institutions than remote sensing systems to achieve repetitive functioning, one of their greatest strengths-using a "crowd" of hand-held sensors to cover large areas-could also be one of their greatest weaknesses.

TI  - Getting closure: The role of urban forest canopy density in moderating summer surface temperatures in a large city
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - With a growing number of people living in urban areas, city residents are more frequently exposed to stresses related to the built environment including elevated summer surface temperatures contributing to the urban heat island (UHI) effect. This study examines the role of urban tree density in moderating surface temperature variation in a densely populated city (Toronto, Canada). By applying parallel aspatial (OLS) and spatial regression (GWR) approaches with satellite derived data describing tree canopy density and surface temperature, one dimension of tree canopy quality (i.e., canopy density) is shown to contribute directly to a reduction in the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect at a local scale. Though the model fit differed between the two regression approaches, both exhibited moderately strong explanatory power and demonstrated that observed surface temperature decreases in locations with increasing high-density and closed tree canopy. Study findings provide an empirical basis to recommend that municipal urban forest strategies embrace canopy quality metrics, such as increasing the density of existing urban forest stands, as a part of tree planting objectives seeking to effectively deliver temperature moderation as a valuable ecosystem service.

TI  - Geochemistry and petrology of howardite Miller Range 11100: A lithologically diverse piece of the Vestan regolith
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) clan of meteorites, which most likely originate from the asteroid Vesta, provide an opportunity to combine in-depth sample analysis with the comprehensive remote-sensing data set from NASA's recent Dawn mission. Miller Range (MIL) 11100, an Antarctic howardite, contains diverse rock and mineral fragments from common HED lithologies (diogenites, cumulate eucrites, and basaltic eucrites). It also contains a rare pyroxferroite-bearing lithology-not recognized in HED until recently-and rare Mg-rich (Fo(86-91)) olivine crystals that possibly represent material excavated from the Vestan mantle. Clast components underwent different histories of thermal and impact metamorphism before being incorporated into this sample, reflecting the diversity in geological histories experienced by different parts of Vesta. The bulk chemical composition and petrography of MIL 11100 suggest that it is akin to the fragmental howardite meteorites. The strong lithological heterogeneity across this sample suggests that at least some parts of the Vestan regolith show heterogeneity on the mm-scale. We combine the outcomes of this study with data from NASA's Dawn mission and hypothesize on possible source regions for this meteorite on the surface of Vesta.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection to Select Clinically Node-negative Prostate Cancer Patients for Pelvic Radiation Therapy: Effect on Biochemical Recurrence and Systemic Progression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess the efficacy of robotic-assisted laparoscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) dissection (SLND) to select those patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who would benefit from additional pelvic external beam radiation therapy and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).Methods and Materials: Radioisotope-guided SLND was performed in 224 clinically node-negative patients scheduled to undergo external beam radiation therapy. Patients with histologically positive SLNs (pN1) were also offered radiation therapy to the pelvic lymph nodes, combined with 3 years of ADT. Biochemical recurrence (BCR), overall survival, and metastasis-free (including pelvic and nonregional lymph nodes) survival (MFS) rates were retrospectively calculated. The Briganti and Kattan nomogram predictions were compared with the observed pN status and BCR.Results: The median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value was 15.4 ng/mL (inter-quartile range [IQR] 8-29). A total number of 834 SLNs (median 3 per patient; IQR 2-5) were removed. Nodal metastases were diagnosed in 42% of the patients, with 150 SLNs affected (median 1; IQR 1-2). The 5-year BCR-free and MFS rates for pN0 patients were 67.9% and 87.8%, respectively. The corresponding values for pN1 patients were 43% and 66.6%. The PSA level and number of removed SLNs were independent predictors of BCR and MFS, and pN status was an additional independent predictor of BCR. The 5-year overall survival rate was 97.6% and correlated only with pN status. The predictive accuracy of the Briganti nomogram was 0.665. Patients in the higher quartiles of Kattan nomogram prediction of BCR had better than expected outcomes. The complication rate from SLND was 8.9%.Conclusions: For radioisotope-guided SLND, the high staging accuracy is accompanied by low morbidity. The better than expected outcomes observed in the lower quartiles of BCR prediction suggest a role for SLN biopsy as a potential selection tool for the addition of pelvic radiation therapy and ADT intensification in pN1 patients.

TI  - Finding the balance between over- and under-treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread adoption of population-based breast cancer screening, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) has come to represent 20-25% of all breast neoplastic lesions diagnosed. Current treatment aims at preventing invasive breast cancer, but the majority of DCIS lesions will never progress to invasive disease. Still, DCIS is treated by surgical excision, followed by radiotherapy as part of breast conserving treatment, and/or endocrine therapy. This implies over-treatment of the majority of DCIS, as less than 1% of DCIS patients will go on to develop invasive breast cancer annually. If we are able to identify which DCIS is likely to progress or recur as invasive breast cancer and which DCIS would remain indolent, we can treat the first group intensively, while sparing the second group from such unnecessary treatment (surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy) preserving the quality of life of these women. This review summarizes our current knowledge on DCIS and the risks involved regarding progression into invasive breast cancer. It also shows current knowledge gaps, areas where profound research is highly necessary for women with DCIS to prevent their over-treatment in case of a harmless DCIS, but provide optimal treatment for potentially hazardous DCIS.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Gaps in the diagnostic capacity and heterogeneity of national surveillance and reporting standards in Europe make it difficult to contain carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. We report the development of a consistent sampling framework and the results of the first structured survey on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in European hospitals.Methods National expert laboratories recruited hospitals with diagnostic capacities, who collected the first ten carbapenem non-susceptible clinical isolates of K pneumoniae or E coli and ten susceptible same-species comparator isolates and pertinent patient and hospital information. Isolates and data were relayed back to national expert laboratories, which made laboratory-substantiated information available for central analysis.Findings Between Nov 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, 455 sentinel hospitals in 36 countries submitted 2703 clinical isolates (2301 [85%] Kpneurnoniae and 402 (15%) Ecoli). 850 (37%) of 2301 Kpneumoniae samples and 77 (19%) of 402 Ecoli samples were carbapenemase (KPC, NDM, OXA-48-like, or VIM) producers. The ratio of K pneumoniae to E coli was 11:1.1.3 patients per 10000 hospital admissions had positive clinical specimens. Prevalence differed greatly, with the highest rates in Mediterranean and Balkan countries. Carbapenemase-producing K pneumoniae isolates showed high resistance to last-line antibiotics.Interpretation This initiative shows an encouraging commitment by all participants, and suggests that challenges in the establishment of a continent-wide enhanced sentinel surveillance for carbapenemase-producing Entero-bacteriaeceae can be overcome. Strengthening infection control efforts in hospitals is crucial for controlling spread through local and national health care networks.

AB  - To better understand the relationship between lightning activity and nitrogen oxides (NO (X) ) in the troposphere and to estimate lightning-produced NO (X) (LNO (X) ) production in China more precisely, spatial and temporal distributions of vertical column densities of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2 VCDs) and lightning activity were analyzed using satellite measurements. The results showed that the spatial distribution of lightning activity is greater in the east than in the west of China, as with NO2 VCDs. However, the seasonal and annual variation between lightning and NO2 density show different trends in the east and west. The central Tibetan Plateau is sparsely populated without modern industry, and NO2 VCDs across the plateau are barely affected by anthropogenic sources. The plateau is an ideal area to study LNO (X) . By analyzing 15 years of satellite data from that region, it was found that lightning density is in strong agreement with annual, spatial and seasonal variations of NO2 VCDs, with a correlation coefficient of 0.79 from the linear fit. Combining Beirle's method and the linear fit equation, LNO (X) production in the Chinese interior was determined to be 0.07 (0.02-0.27) TgN yr(-1) for 1997-2012, within the range of 0.016-0.384 TgN yr(-1) from previous estimates.

TI  - Impact of diurnal variability and meteorological factors on the PM<sub>2.5</sub> - AOD relationship: Implications for PM<sub>2.5</sub> remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 retrieval from space is still challenging due to the elusive relationship between PM2.5 and aerosol optical depth (AOD), which is further complicated by meteorological factors. In this work, we investigated the diurnal cycle of PM2.5 in China, using ground-based PM measurements obtained at 226 sites of China Atmosphere Watch Network during the period of January 2013 to December 2015. Results showed that nearly half of the sites witnessed a PM2.5 maximum in the morning, in contrast to the least frequent occurrence (5%). in the afternoon when strong solar radiation received at the surface results in rapid vertical diffusion of aerosols and thus lower mass concentration. PM2.5 tends to peak equally in the morning and evening in North China Plain (NCP) with an amplitude of nearly twice or three times that in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), whereas the morning PM2.5 peak dominates in Yangtze River Delta (YRD) with a magnitude lying between those of NCP and PRD. The gridded correlation maps reveal varying correlations around each PM2.5 site, depending on the locations and seasons. Concerning the impact of aerosol diurnal variation on the correlation, the averaging schemes of PM2.5 using 3-h, 5-h, and 24-h time windows tend to have larger R biases, compared with the scheme of 1-h time window, indicating diurnal variation of aerosols plays a significant role in the establishment of explicit correlation between PM2.5 and AOD. In addition, high cloud fraction and relative humidity tend to weaken the correlation, regardless of geographical location. Therefore, the impact of meteorology could be one of the most plausible alternatives in explaining the varying R values observed, due to its non-negligible effect on MODIS AOD retrievals. Our findings have implications for PM2.5 remote sensing, as long as the aerosol diurnal cycle, along with meteorology, are explicitly considered in the future. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Model for soybean production forecast based on prevailing physical conditions
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the reliability of the physiological meaning of the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data for the development of a remote sensing-based procedure to estimate soybean production prior to crop harvest. Time-series data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (Modis) were applied to investigate the relationship between local yield fluctuations of soybean and the prevailing physically-driven conditions in the state of Mato Grosso, located in the south of the Brazilian Amazon. The developed methodology was based on the coupled model (CM). The CM provides production estimates for early January, using images from the maximum crop development period. Production estimates were validated at three different spatial scales: state, municipality, and local. At the state and municipality levels, the results obtained from the CM were compared with official agricultural statistics from Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica and Companhia Nacional de Abastecimento, from 2001 to 2011. The coefficients of determination ranged from 0.91 to 0.98, with overall result of R-2= 0.96 (p <= 0.01), indicating that the model adheres to official statistics. At the local level, spatially distributed data were compared with production data from 422 crop fields. The coefficient of determination (R-2= 0.87) confirmed the reliability of the EVI for its applicability on remote sensing-based models for soybean production forecast.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the land surface temperature (LST) distribution from thermal infrared data for analyzing the characteristics of surface coverage using the Vegetation-Impervious-Soil (VIS) approach. A set of ten images, obtained from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper, between 2001 and 2010, were used to study the urban environmental conditions of 47 neighborhoods of Porto Alegre city, Brazil. Porto Alegre has had the smallest population growth rate of all 27 state capitals in the last two decades in Brazil, with an increase of 11.55% in inhabitants from 1.263 million in 1991 to 1.409 million in 2010. We applied the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) theory in order to test the influence of the economically-related scenario on the spatial nature of social-environmental arrangement of the city at neighborhood scale. Our results suggest that the economically-related scenario exerts a non-negligible influence on the physically driven characteristics of the urban environmental conditions as predicted by EKC theory. The linear inverse correlation R-2 between household income (HI) and LST is 0.36 and has shown to be comparable to all other studied variables. Future research may investigate the relation between other economically-related indicators to specific land surface characteristics.

TI  - Predictions of Tropical Forest Biomass and Biomass Growth Based on Stand Height or Canopy Area Are Improved by Landsat-Scale Phenology across Puerto Rico and the USVirgin Islands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely-sensed estimates of forest biomass are usually based on various measurements of canopy height, area, volume or texture, as derived from LiDAR, radar or fine spatial resolution imagery. These measurements are then calibrated to estimates of stand biomass that are primarily based on tree stem diameters. Although humid tropical forest seasonality can have low amplitudes compared with temperate regions, seasonal variations in growth-related factors like temperature, humidity, rainfall, wind speed and day length affect both tropical forest deciduousness and tree height-diameter relationships. Consequently, seasonal patterns in spectral measures of canopy greenness derived from satellite imagery should be related to tree height-diameter relationships and hence to estimates of forest biomass or biomass growth that are based on stand height or canopy area. In this study, we tested whether satellite image-based measures of tropical forest phenology, as estimated by indices of seasonal patterns in canopy greenness constructed from Landsat satellite images, can explain the variability in forest deciduousness, forest biomass and net biomass growth after already accounting for stand height or canopy area. Models of forest biomass that added phenology variables to structural variables similar to those that can be estimated by LiDAR or very high-spatial resolution imagery, like canopy height and crown area, explained up to 12% more variation in biomass. Adding phenology to structural variables explained up to 25% more variation in Net Biomass Growth (NBG). In all of the models, phenology contributed more as interaction terms than as single-effect terms. In addition, models run on only fully-forested plots performed better than models that included partially-forested plots. For forest NBG, the models produced better results when only those plots with a positive growth, from Inventory Cycle 1 to Inventory Cycle 2, were analyzed, as compared to models that included all plots.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring Urban Ecosystem Services Using Multitemporal High-Resolution Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at providing a new method to efficiently analyze detailed urban ecological conditions at the example of Shanghai, one of the world's most densely populated megacities. The main objective is to develop a method to effectively analyze high-resolution optical satellite data for mapping of ecologically important urban space and to evaluate ecological changes through the emerging ecosystem service supply and demand concept. Two IKONOS and GeoEye-1 scenes were used to determine land use/land cover change in Shanghai's urban core from 2000 to 2009. After preprocessing, the images were segmented and classified into seven distinct urban land use/land cover classes through SVM. The classes were then transformed into ecosystem service supply and demand budgets for regulating, provisioning and cultural services, and ecological integrity based on ecosystem functions. Decreases in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas in the favor of urban green sites and high-rise areas with commercial/residential function could be observed resulting in an increase of at least 20% in service supply budgets. Main contributor to the change is the decrease in continuous urban fabric and industrial areas. The overall results and outcome of the study strengthen the suggested application of the proposed method for urban ecosystem service budget mapping with hitherto for that purpose unutilized high-resolution data. The insights and results from this study might further contribute to sustainable urban planning, prove common grounds for interurban comparisons, or aid in enhancing ecological intraurban functionality by analyzing the distribution of urban ecospace and lead to improved accessibility and proximity to ecosystem services in urban areas.

TI  - Does the TNM classification of solitary internal mammary lymph node metastases in breast cancer still apply?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - TNM classification of solitary internal mammary lymph node metastases (IMLNMs) in breast cancer varies depending on their method of detection: sentinel lymph node biopsy (pN1b) or clinical examination including radiological and/or physical examination (pN2b). This study aimed to evaluate whether there is a difference in prognosis between both groups.Data of all patients diagnosed with primary invasive epithelial breast cancer between 2005 and 2008 were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients with IMLNMs were divided in groups according to their pN1b and pN2b status. The main outcome measures disease-free survival (DFS) after 5 years and overall survival (OS) after 8 years were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Cox regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors for DFS and OS.A total of 73 patients with pN1b status and 28 patients with pN2b status were included. DFS rate was 74.1% in the pN1b group compared to 85.0% in the pN2b group (p = 0.211). Regarding OS, 20.5% (pN1b) and 25.0% (pN2b) of the patients deceased within 8 years of follow-up (p = 0.589). In multivariable cox regression analysis, nodal status was not statistically significant for DFS (HR 0.29 [95% CI 0.04-2.33], p = 0.244) or OS (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.37-2.89], p = 0.947).Although the TNM classification considers pN1b and pN2b to be distinct prognostic entities, we did not observe any prognostic differences between these groups. Therefore, solitary IMLNMs may be regarded as a single category in the future and revision of TNM classification should be considered.

AB  - Assessment of streamflow trends in river catchment provides vital information for flood risk management and efficient use of water resources. This study aimed to compare the effects of anthropogenic and climatic changes on the streamflows of Kinta River Basin. The rainfall and land use data from 2001-2010 were used for the analysis and their impact on the streamflows were observed. The changes in land use were extracted from the classification of Landsat-7 images whereas; the rainfall and streamflows data were acquired from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage, Malaysia. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was used to investigate the trends in rainfall and streamflows. Assessment of change in streamflows was investigated by Pettitt's test. The results showed the constant trends in rainfall during the study period over Kinta River Basin. However, the streamflows demonstrated significant positive trends at 5% significance level. The significant changes in streamflows were started from November 2006 when the monthly mean increased from 1900 to 3700 m(3)/s. In the case of land use changes, deforestation showed a rapid increase (i.e., 1.18% annually), whereas, the urbanization increased during the period (i.e., 1.15% annually) during the study period. The comparison of the anthropogenic and climatic variable has revealed that land cover changes are one of the major factors in the alteration of surface runoff.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover is an important factor affecting the occurrence of shallow landslides triggered by high intensity rainfall. The objectives of this study are the analyses of the influences of land use and rainfall on shallow landslides using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and antecedent rainfall threshold. This research was conducted in Tanralili sub watershed, South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. The analysis of NDVI using Landsat time series data of 2000, 2003, 2006, 2009, 2011 and 2013. The result indicated that in the course of 14 years high vegetation density land cover (81% to 100%) has lost around 24.21% or 6219 ha. The vegetation density decrease is caused mainly by land use change, especially the conversion of shrubs and forests into mixed dryland farming. 76.67% of shallow landslides occurred are concentrated in mixed dryland farming on the low vegetation density (0 to 40%). The analysis of the absolute and calibrated antecedent rainfall associated with each major shallow landslide event showed that shallow landslides occurred in short duration (1 day) with a high intensity 225 mm/day and longer duration (1 month) with a lower intensity 13 mm/day. The rainfall threshold for shallow landslides in the study area are ruled by the function I = 25.5D-(1.10), where I is the average rainfall intensity in mm/day and D is duration of rainfall in days.

TI  - The One Health approach to identify knowledge, attitudes and practices that affect community involvement in the control of Rift Valley fever outbreaks
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral mosquito-borne disease with the potential for global expansion, causes hemorrhagic fever, and has a high case fatality rate in young animals and in humans.Using a cross-sectional community-based study design, we investigated the knowledge, attitudes and practices of people living in small village in Sudan with respect to RVF outbreaks. A special One Health questionnaire was developed to compile data from 235 heads of household concerning their knowledge, attitudes, and practices with regard to controlling RVF. Although the 2007 RVF outbreak in Sudan had negatively affected the participants' food availability and livestock income, the participants did not fully understand how to identify RVF symptoms and risk factors for both humans and livestock. For example, the participants mistakenly believed that avoiding livestock that had suffered spontaneous abortions was the least important risk factor for RVF. Although the majority noticed an increase in mosquito population during the 2007 RVF outbreak, few used impregnated bed nets as preventive measures. The community was reluctant to notify the authorities about RVF suspicion in livestock, a sentinel for human RVF infection. Almost all the respondents stressed that they would not receive any compensation for their dead livestock if they notified the authorities. In addition, the participants believed that controlling RVF outbreaks was mainly the responsibility of human health authorities rather than veterinary authorities. The majority of the participants were aware that RVF could spread from one region to another within the country. Participants received most their information about RVF from social networks and the mass media, rather than the health system or veterinarians. Because the perceived role of the community in controlling RVF was fragmented, the probability of RVF spread increased.

This situation is ideal to evaluate the effects of ore deposits on vegetation anomalies through geobotanical remote sensing. Here we present novel methods to detect vegetation anomalies caused by ore deposits and verify their usefulness by comparing the anomalies with a deposit potential map produced from multiple geological data. We use the reflectance spectra of Landsat ETM1 images acquired in summer and autumn to calculate a vegetation index for plant physiological activity. A key variable to detect the anomalies is a variation of vegetation index with time at each pixel. Difference in variation is enlarged by a sequence of image enhancement methods for the detection. We find that the vegetation anomalies, defined by the large ratios, correspond well to the high potential zones of ore deposits and known major deposits. Consequently, our methods can extend the applicability of remote sensing-based mineral exploration to the areas covered by thick vegetation, in addition to traditional arid and semiarid areas.

TI  - Modeling multidecadal surface water inundation dynamics and key drivers on large river basin scale using multiple time series of Earth-observation and river flow data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Periodically inundated floodplain areas are hot spots of biodiversity and provide a broad range of ecosystem services but have suffered alarming declines in recent history. Despite their importance, their long-term surface water (SW) dynamics and hydroclimatic drivers remain poorly quantified on continental scales. In this study, we used a 26 year time series of Landsat-derived SW maps in combination with river flow data from 68 gauges and spatial time series of rainfall, evapotranspiration and soil moisture to statistically model SW dynamics as a function of key drivers across Australia's Murray-Darling Basin (approximate to 1 million km(2)). We fitted generalized additive models for 18,521 individual modeling units made up of 10 x 10 km grid cells, each split into floodplain, floodplain-lake, and nonfloodplain area. Average goodness of fit of models was high across floodplains and floodplain-lakes (r(2)>0.65), which were primarily driven by river flow, and was lower for nonfloodplain areas (r(2)>0.24), which were primarily driven by rainfall. Local climate conditions were more relevant for SW dynamics in the northern compared to the southern basin and had the highest influence in the least regulated and most extended floodplains. We further applied the models of two contrasting floodplain areas to predict SW extents of cloud-affected time steps in the Landsat series during the large 2010 floods with high validated accuracy (r(2)>0.97). Our framework is applicable to other complex river basins across the world and enables a more detailed quantification of large floods and drivers of SW dynamics compared to existing methods.

TI  - Monitoring the changes in impervious surface ratio and urban heat island intensity between 1987 and 2011 in Szeged, Hungary
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series data make it possible to continuously map and examine urban land cover changes and effects on urban environments. The objectives of this study are (1) to map and analyse an impervious surface and its changes within a census district and (2) tomonitor the effects of increasing impervious surface ratios on population and environment. We used satellite images from 1987, 2003 and 2011 tomap the impervious surface ratio in the census district of Szeged, Hungary through normalized spectral mixture analysis. Significant increases were detected from 1987 to 2011 in industrial areas (5.7-9.1%) and inner residential areas (2.5-4.8%), whereas decreases were observed in the city centre and housing estates due to vegetation growth. Urban heat island (UHI) values were derived from the impervious surface fraction map to analyse the impact of urban land cover changes. In 2011, the average value in the industrial area was 1.76 degrees C, whereas that in the inner residential area was 1.35-1.69 degrees C. In the city centre zones and housing estates, values ranging from 1.4 to 1.5 degrees C and from 1.29 to 1.5 degrees C, respectively, were observed. Our study reveals that long-term land cover changes can be derived at the district level from Landsat images and that their effects can be identified and analysed, providing important information for city planners and policy makers.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study remote sensing techniques were employed to investigate the impact of land use/cover change on land surface temperatures (LST) for a highly dynamic landscape, i.e. the Nile Delta. Land use change was determined from analyzing a 15 years of bi-monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra satellite along with a synchronized 13 years of bi-monthly LST dataset retrieved from MODIS Aqua satellite. Time series analysis for NDVI and LST data was carried out at selected locations experiencing land use change. Mean LST change was determined for each location before and after the land use change. Results indicate that NDVI composite data for 15 years proved sufficient for delineating land use change. Significant spatial changes include the transformation from agriculture to urban land, which increased the LST by 1.7 degrees C during the 13 years and the transformation of bare land to agriculture, which decreased the LST by 0.52 degrees C for the same period. Due to the explosive population growth in the Nile Delta, urban encroachment upon agricultural land could, hence, promote a prolonged regional warming by modifying the micro-climate and other climate-related phenomena.

TI  - Raccoons (<i>Procyon lotor</i>) as Sentinels of Trace Element Contamination and Physiological Effects of Exposure to Coal Fly Ash
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic pollutants disrupt global biodiversity, and terrestrial sentinels of pollution can provide a warning system for ecosystem-wide contamination. This study sought to assess whether raccoons (Procyon lotor) are sentinels of local exposure to trace element contaminants at a coal fly ash site and whether exposure resulted in health impairment or changes in the intestinal helminth communities. We compared trace element accumulation and the impact on health responses and intestinal helminth communities of raccoons inhabiting contaminated and reference sites of the U. S. Department of Energy's Savannah River Site (South Carolina, USA). Data on morphometry, hematology, histopathology, helminth community and abundance, and liver trace element burdens were collected from 15 raccoons captured adjacent to a coal fly ash basin and 11 raccoons from a comparable uncontaminated site nearby. Of eight trace elements analyzed, Cu, As, Se, and Pb were elevated in raccoons from the contaminated site. Raccoons from the contaminated site harbored higher helminth abundance than animals from the reference site and that abundance was positively associated with increased Cu concentrations. While we found changes in hematology associated with increased Se exposure, we did not find physiological or histological changes associated with higher levels of contaminants. Our results suggest that raccoons and their intestinal helminths act as sentinels of trace elements in the environment associated with coal fly ash contamination.

TI  - Presumptive Spontaneous Lysosomal Storage-Like Disease in a Crl:CD1(ICR) Mouse
T2  - COMPARATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A clinically unremarkable 4.5-mo-old female Crl:CD1(ICR) VAF/Elite mouse was euthanized for scheduled sentinel processing. Gross necropsy findings included significant hepatosplenomegaly and visceral lymphadenomegaly, resulting in a preliminary gross diagnosis of lymphoma. Histology revealed florid accumulations of large, 'foamy' macrophages present in the bone marrow, small intestines, and viscera including liver, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, uterus, and ovaries. The cytoplasm of these cells was abundant, stained pale blue with Wright Giemsa and was periodic acid Schiff positive. Given these characteristic gross and histologic findings, a spontaneous lysosomal storage-like disease was diagnosed in this mouse. Cholesterol ester storage disease is likely, because of the visceral involvement with sparing of the CNS, but could not be diagnosed definitively. To our knowledge, this report is the first to describe a case of spontaneous lysosomal storage disease in an outbred mouse of the CD1(ICR) background.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of ocean deep convection using multisensors altimetry and ocean color satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep convection occurs in oceanic regions submitted to strong atmospheric buoyancy losses and results in the formation of deep water masses (DWF) of the ocean circulation. It shows a strong interannual variability, and could drastically weaken under the influence of climate change. In this study, a method is proposed to monitor quantitatively deep convection using multisensors altimetry and ocean color satellite data. It is applied and evaluated for the well-observed Northwestern Mediterranean Sea (NWMS) case study. For that, a coupled hydrodynamical-biogeochemical numerical simulation is used to examine the signature of DWF on sea level anomaly (SLA) and surface chlorophyll concentration. Statistically significant correlations between DWF annual indicators and the areas of low surface chlorophyll concentration and low SLA in winter are obtained, and linear relationships between those indicators and areas are established. These relationships are applied to areas of low SLA and low chlorophyll concentration computed, respectively, from a 27 year altimetry data set and a 19 year ocean color data set. The first long time series (covering the last 2 decades) of DWF indicators obtained for the NWMS from satellite observations are produced. Model biases and smoothing effect induced by the low resolution of gridded altimetry data are partly taken into account by using corrective methods. Comparison with winter atmospheric heat flux and previous modeled and observed estimates of DWF indicators suggests that those DWF indicators time series capture realistically DWF interannual variability in the NWMS. The advantages as well as the weaknesses and uncertainties of the method are finally discussed.

TI  - Quick Sampling Method for Large Area Vegetable Types Based on Remote Sensing Images A Case Study for Cold Temperate Coniferous Forest Region
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] To realize the quick access of the separable and representative training samples on large area remote sensing images. [Method] Based on the macroscopical character of remote sensing images, referring to the 1 :1 000 000 vegetation map and China land cover map (WESTDC), and combining the unsupervised classification results of experimental region from the 2001 MODIS time series NDVI images, the spatial features of vector and raster data were used and associated the unsupervised classification results as the random sample properties. Based on the unsupervised classification types and the random point ratio of different classification types, the sample purification was realized. By comparing the difference of the standard deviation and the separability index before and after the sample purification of different vegetable samples, the points which had relatively larger contribution to the supervised classification were saved. [Result] The results showed that the land cover spatial distribution in survey area was consistent with the WESTDC map, the overall accuracy of main types was 84.82%. By using the purred samples and applying the maximum likelihood classification method, the overall accuracy was 32.52% higher than that from initial samples. [Conclusion] The sampling method is suitable for quick access of remote sensing images of large area and could reduce the time, manpower and material costs.

TI  - Upscaling plot-scale soil respiration in winter wheat and summer maize rotation croplands in Julu County, North China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil respiration (R-s) data from 45 plots were used to estimate the spatial patterns of R-s during the peak growing seasons of winter wheat and summer maize in Julu County, North China, by combining satellite remote sensing data, field-measured data, and a support vector regression (SVR) model. The observed R-s values were well reproduced by the model at the plot scale, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.31 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.73. No significant difference was detected between the prediction accuracy of the SVR model for winter wheat and summer maize. With forcing from satellite remote sensing data and gridded soil property data, we used the SVR model to predict the spatial distributions of R-2, during the peak growing seasons of winter wheat and summer maize rotation croplands in Julu County. The SVR model captured the spatial variations of R-s at the county scale. The satellite-derived enhanced vegetation index was found to be the most important input used to predict R-s. Removal of this variable caused an RMSE increase from 0.31 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) to 0.42 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). Soil properties such as soil organic carbon (SOC) content and soil bulk density (SBD) were the second most important factors. Their removal led to an RMSE increase from 0.31 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) to 0.37 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1). The SVR model performed better than multiple regression in predicting spatial variations of R-s in winter wheat and summer maize rotation croplands, as shown by the comparison of the R-2 and RMSE values of the two algorithms. The spatial patterns of R-s are better captured using the SVR model than performing multiple regression, particularly for the relatively high and relatively low R-s values at the center and northeast study areas. Therefore, SVR shows promise for predicting spatial variations of R-s values on the basis of remotely sensed data and gridded soil property data at the county scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Hydrological Modelling Using Satellite-Based Crop Coefficients: A Comparison of Methods at the Basin Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The parameterization of crop coefficients (kc) is critical for determining a water balance. We used satellite-based and literature-based methods to derive kc values for a distributed hydrologic model. We evaluated the impact of different kc parametrization methods on the water balance and simulated hydrologic response at the basin and sub-basin scale. The hydrological model SPHY was calibrated and validated for a period of 15 years for the upper Segura basin (similar to 2500 km(2)) in Spain, which is characterized by a wide range of terrain, soil, and ecosystem conditions. The model was then applied, using six kc parameterization methods, to determine their spatial and temporal impacts on actual evapotranspiration, streamflow, and soil moisture. The parameterization methods used include: (i) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) observations from MODIS; (ii) seasonally-averaged NDVI patterns, cell-based and landuse-based; and (iii) literature-based tabular values per land use type. The analysis shows that the influence of different kc parametrization methods on basin-level streamflow is relatively small and constant throughout the year, but it has a bigger effect on seasonal evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In the autumn especially, deviations can go up to about 15% of monthly streamflow. At smaller, sub-basin scale, deviations from the NDVI-based reference run can be more than 30%. Overall, the study shows that modeling of future hydrological changes can be improved by using remote sensing information for the parameterization of crop coefficients.

TI  - An integrated approach for identification of potential aquifer zones in structurally controlled terrain: Wadi Qena basin, Egypt
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi Qena basin represents one of the most promising regions for future development in Egypt. Fresh water supplies are crucial for such plans. We provide an integrated remote sensing (Landsat, ASTER DEM, Geoeye-1), geophysical (aeromagnetic), isotopic (delta O-18, delta H-2), field (stratigraphic and structural interpretation) and geochemical (major dissolved ions) approach to delineate zones of potential groundwater resources in Wadi Qena basin. Four water-bearing horizons were sampled: fractured crystalline aquifer, Nubian Aquifer System (NAS), Post Nubian Aquifer System (PNAS) and the Quaternary aquifer. Findings include: (1) spatial analysis of remote sensing data in a GIS environment indicates extensive structural deformation by dextral faults trending NE-SW (i.e. Qena-Safaga shear zone [QS]) and sinistral faults trending NW-SE (i.e. Najd shear zone) and sufficient surface water supply from the east through Wadi Fattera sub-basin; (2) analysis of geophysical data indicates that these faults control the water-bearing horizons in the subsurface; (3) isotopic analysis reveals four isotopic groups including two end members, one mixed group and one mixed and evaporated group: group (I) highly depleted fossil Nubian waters (range: delta O-18 from -639 to -6.74 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -48.21 to -52.46 parts per thousand); group (II) modern waters in fractured basement (range: delta O-18 from -1.41 to -1.51 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -5.46 to -6.04 parts per thousand); group (III) a mixed cluster between NAS and modern waters (range: delta O-18 from -4.82 to -5.05 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -33.28 to -38.54 parts per thousand); and group (IV) samples which have both mixing between the Nubian and meteoric waters and also have a considerable deviation from the Global Meteoric Water Line (GMWL) (range: delta O-18 from -0.58 to -4.69 parts per thousand and delta H-2 from -19.59 to -38.68 parts per thousand), (4) samples with a mixed isotopic signature (in group III), which tap the NAS and are located along the main channel of Wadi Fattera (area 3600 km(2)) provide evidence for modern recharge along surface exposures of the NAS and enhanced infiltration along deep-seated faults; (5) samples with a mixed isotopic signature (in group IV), which tap the Quaternary and PNAS aquifers and are located along deep-seated faults provide evidence of artesian upward leakage from the deep NAS into the shallower Quaternary and PNAS aquifers. The present study improves our understanding of the role of structural control and modern recharge in exploration for aquifer potential in arid environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Fusion of High Resolution Multispectral Imagery in Vulnerable Coastal and Land Ecosystems
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems provide a wide variety of useful resources that enhance human welfare, but these resources are declining due to climate change and anthropogenic pressure. In this work, three vulnerable ecosystems, including shrublands, coastal areas with dunes systems and areas of shallow water, are studied. As far as these resources' reduction is concerned, remote sensing and image processing techniques could contribute to the management of these natural resources in a practical and cost-effective way, although some improvements are needed for obtaining a higher quality of the information available. An important quality improvement is the fusion at the pixel level. Hence, the objective of this work is to assess which pansharpening technique provides the best fused image for the different types of ecosystems. After a preliminary evaluation of twelve classic and novel fusion algorithms, a total of four pansharpening algorithms was analyzed using six quality indices. The quality assessment was implemented not only for the whole set of multispectral bands, but also for the subset of spectral bands covered by the wavelength range of the panchromatic image and outside of it. A better quality result is observed in the fused image using only the bands covered by the panchromatic band range. It is important to highlight the use of these techniques not only in land and urban areas, but a novel analysis in areas of shallow water ecosystems. Although the algorithms do not show a high difference in land and coastal areas, coastal ecosystems require simpler algorithms, such as fast intensity hue saturation, whereas more heterogeneous ecosystems need advanced algorithms, as weighted wavelet `a trous' through fractal dimension maps for shrublands and mixed ecosystems. Moreover, quality map analysis was carried out in order to study the fusion result in each band at the local level. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of these pansharpening techniques, advanced Object-Based (OBIA) support vector machine classification was applied, and a thematic map for the shrubland ecosystem was obtained, which corroborates wavelet `a trous' through fractal dimension maps as the best fusion algorithm for this ecosystem.

TI  - Large-scale indicators for monitoring forest diversity of the main forest types in Calabria (Italy).
T2  - Forest@
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Society's perception of forest resources has gone through significant changes. Forest ecosystems play a multifunctional role and host an important portion of the whole biodiversity, particularly in the Mediterranean area. Remote sensing technologies provide a unique way to obtain spatially extensive information on forest ecosystems, but relatively few studies used such information to evaluate forest habitat and biotic diversity. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of remote sensing to predict forest diversity by linking re motely sensed information with diversity metrics obtained from ground measurements of butterfly diversity. The field work was carried out in Calabria in four different forest types (beech, chestnut, black pine and silver fir forests). The sampling of Lepidoptera was carried out by LED light traps. We positioned 9 traps per forest type, for a total of 36 sites chosen to sample the different stages of forest succession in each forest type. Samples were carried out once a month from May to November 2015. Data from in situ butterfly measurements were compared with above ground forest biomass estimated from airborne LiDAR with NDVI estimated from Landsat 8. Results indicated that the Geometridae/Noctuideae ratio of lepidopteran communities was significantly correlated with the tree biomass, its distribution among tree size classes and the NDVI. The Geometridae/Noctuidae ratio, therefore, represents an index easy to calculate, which can be employed to integrate data acquired from remote sensing in order to obtain continuous spatial estimates of forest naturalness.

TI  - Assessing the effects of dam building on land degradation in central Iran with Landsat LST and LULC time series
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the impact of Zayandehrood Dam on desertification using the spatiotemporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) in an arid environment in central Iran from 1987 to 2014. The LULC and LST images were calculated from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI data, and their accuracies were assessed against reference data using error matrix and linear regression analysis. Results showed that salty and bare lands increased up to 57,302 ha, while agricultural lands declined substantially (28,275.58 ha) in the region. The changes in LULC classes resulted in dramatic variations in LST values. The average temperature showed a 5.03 degrees C increase, and the minimum temperature increased by 5.66 degrees C. LST had an increasing trend in bare lands (8.74 degrees C), poor rangelands (6.8 degrees C), agricultural lands (9.46 degrees C), salty lands (9.6 degrees C), and residential areas (3.18 degrees C) in this 27-year period. Rainfall and temperature trend analysis revealed that the main cause of these extreme changes in LULC and LST was largely attributed to the drying up of Zayandehrood River due to dam construction and allocating water mainly for industrial sectors. Results indicate that in addition to LULC changes, the spatio-temporal variations of LST can be used as an effective index in desertification assessment and monitoring in arid environments.

M3  - Article
AB  - Amplification of the epidermal growth factor 2 (ERBB2) gene, encoding the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has been implicated in several different malignancies, including breast cancer.More recently, research has indicated that a proportion of non-ERBB2 amplified breast cancers can harbor activating somatic mutations that render them susceptible to anti-HER2 agents.We present here a unique case of a patient with metastatic hormone receptorepositive, ERBB2-not amplified breast cancer, with a S310F activating mutation who responded to treatment with trastuzumab.This case highlights the increasing importance of genomic testing patients with nonamplified ERBB2 breast cancers.

TI  - Errors in spectral fingerprints and their effects on climate fingerprinting accuracy in the solar spectrum
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the Earth's reflected solar spectrum for climate change fingerprinting is an emerging research area. The spectral fingerprinting approach directly retrieves the changes in climate variables from the mean spectral data averaged across large space and time scales. To investigate this fingerprinting concept, we use ten years of satellite data to simulate the monthly and annual mean reflected solar spectra and the associated spectral fingerprints for different regions over the ocean. The interannual variations in the spectral data are derived and attributed to the interannual variations in the relevant climate variables. The fingerprinting retrieved changes in climate variables are then compared with the actual underlying variable changes from the observational data to evaluate the fingerprinting retrieval accuracy. Two important errors related to the fingerprinting approach, the nonlinearity error and the averaging error in the mean fingerprints, and their impact on the retrieval accuracy, are investigated. It is found that the averaging error increases but the nonlinearity error decreases as the region size increases. The averaging error has minimal effect on the fingerprinting retrieval accuracy in small regions but has more of an impact in large regions. In comparison, the effect of nonlinearity error on the retrieval accuracy decreases as the region size increases. It is also found that the fingerprinting retrieval accuracy is more sensitive to the nonlinearity error than to the averaging error. In addition, we compare the fingerprinting accuracy between using the monthly mean data and the annual mean data. The results show that on average higher retrieval accuracy is achieved when the annual mean data are used for the fingerprinting retrieval. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Field Comparisons of the Gravid <i>Aedes</i> Trap (GAT) and BG-Sentinel Trap for Monitoring <i>Aedes albopictus</i> (Diptera: Culicidae) Populations and Notes on Indoor GAT Collections in Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the use of the Gravid Aedes Trap (GAT) as a surveillance device for Aedes albopictus (Skuse) relative to the BG-Sentinel (BGS) trap in field studies conducted in Trenton, NJ, and on Hammond Island, Queensland, Australia. A parallel study conducted in Nha Trang, Vietnam, assessed the use of the GAT as an indoor surveillance device as well as the use of canola oil as a noninsecticide killing agent. In Trenton and Hammond Island, the GAT collected fewer male (0.40 +/- 0.12 and 0.43 +/- 0.30, respectively) and female (3.05 6 0.67 and 2.7 +/- 2.3, respectively) Ae. albopictus than the BGS trap (males: 3.54 +/- 1.26 and 3.75 +/- 0.83; females: 4.66 +/- 1.18 and 3.9 +/- 0.23) over their respective sampling periods (i. e., 24 h for the BGS and 1 wk for the GAT). Despite differences in capture rates, the percentage of traps positive for female Ae. albopictus was similar between the BGS and GAT (Trenton: 60.1 +/- 6.3% and 64.4 +/- 4.1%; Hammond: 87.5 +/- 6.9% and 80.0 +/- 8.2%). In Nha Trang, the GAT was equally effective indoors and outdoors with (10 g hay or 3 g fish food) and without (water or empty) infusion. Additionally, no significant decrease in collections was observed between GATs set with canola oil or long-lasting insecticidal net. In summary, both traps were successful in monitoring female Ae. albopictus over their respective trapping intervals, but would be best used to complement each other to monitor both sexes and all physiological stages of female Ae. albopictus. However, the versatility and low-cost of the GAT makes it an attractive alternative to the more expensive BGS trap.

TI  - Creative art and medical student development: a qualitative study
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES Although many medical schools include arts-based activities in their curricula, empirical evidence is lacking regarding how the creation of art might impact medical students and their professional development. We used a qualitative research design in order to understand this process.METHODS We conducted and analysed interviews with 16 medical students who had created and presented original artwork in the context of a required narrative-based undergraduate medical education programme. Teams of students collaborated to create interpretive projects based on common themes arising from conversations with individuals with chronic illness and their families. Open-ended questions were utilised to explore the conceptualisation and presentation of the projects, the dynamics of teamwork and the meaning(s) they might have for the students' professional development. We identified themes using repeated contextual reading of the transcripts, which also enhanced accuracy of the interpretations and ensured saturation of themes.RESULTS Several major themes and subthemes were identified. The creation of art led to a sense of personal growth and development, including reflection on past life experiences, self-discovery and an awareness of art as a creative outlet. Students also reported an enhanced sense of community and the development of skills in collaboration. Lastly, students reflected on the human dimensions of illness and medical care and identified an enhanced awareness of the experience of those with illness.CONCLUSIONS A programme involving the creation of art based on stories of illness encouraged students' explorations of conceptions of the self, family and society, as well as illness and medical care, while enhancing the development of a collaborative and patientcentred worldview. Creative art can be a novel educational tool to promote a reflective, humanistic medical practice.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of a Brazilian strain of yellow fever virus from an epizootic outbreak in 2009
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - During a series of epizootics caused by Yellow fever virus in Brazil between 2007 and 2009, a monkey was found dead (May 2009) in a sylvatic area in the State of Parana. Brain samples from this animal were used for immunohistochemical analysis and isolation of a wild-type strain of YFV. This viral strain was characterized, and sequence analyzes demonstrated that it is closely related with YFV strains of the recently identified subclade 1E of the South American genotype I. Further characterization included indirect-immunofluorescence of different infected cell lines and analysis of the kinetics of virus replication and infectivity inhibition by type I IFN. The generated data contributes to the knowledge of YFV evolution and phylogeny. Additionally, the reagents generated and characterized during this study, such as a panel of monoclonal antibodies, are useful tools for further studies on YFV. Lastly, this case stresses the importance of yellow fever surveillance through sentinel monkeys. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Initiating NTD programs targeting schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in two provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo: Establishment of baseline prevalence for mass drug administration
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) are widely distributed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and constitute a serious public health problem. As recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), before launching mass chemotherapy to control these diseases, parasitological surveys were conducted in sentinel sites in six health zones (HZs) in Bandundu and Maniema provinces. Baseline prevalence and intensity of infection for SCH and STH were determined to establish the appropriate treatment plan using Praziquantel (PZQ) and Albendazole (ALB).Methods: Parasitological surveys were conducted from April to May 2015 in twenty-six selected sampling units (schools) for baseline mapping in six HZs: Fifty school children (25 females and 25 males) aged 9-15 years were randomly selected per sampling unit. A total of 1300 samples (urine and stool) were examined using haematuria dipsticks, parasite-egg filtration and the point-of-care Circulating Cathodic Antigen (POC-CCA) assay for urine samples and the Kato-Katz technique for stool specimens.Results: Three species of schistosomes (S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. intercalatum) and three groups of STH (hookworm, Ascaris and Trichuris) were detected at variable prevalence and intensity among the schools, the HZs and the provinces. In Bandundu, no SCH was detected by either Kato-Katz or the POC-CCA technique, despite a high prevalence of STH with 68% and 80% at Kiri and Pendjua HZs, respectively. In Maniema, intestinal schistosomiasis was detected by both Kato Katz and POC-CCA with an average prevalence by Kato-Katz of 32.8% and by POC-CCA of 42.1%. Comparative studies confirmed the greater sensitivity (and operational feasibility) of the POC-CCA test on urine compared to Kato-Katz examination of stool for diagnosing intestinal schistosomiasis even in areas of comparatively light infections. STH was widely distributed and present in all HZs with a mean prevalence (95% CI) of 59.62% (46.00-65.00%). The prevalence of hookworm, roundworm and whipworm were 51.62% (32.40%-71.50%), 15.77% (0.50%-39.60%) and 13.46 (0.50%-33.20%), respectively.Conclusion: This study provided the evidence base for implementing programs targeting SCH and STH in these Health Zones. Observations also reinforce the operational value and feasibility of the POC-CCA test to detect S. mansoni and, for the first time, S. intercalatum infections in a routine NTD program setting.

TI  - Seasonal variation of near surface black carbon and satellite derived vertical distribution of aerosols over a semi-arid station in India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive measurements of aerosol black carbon mass concentration (BC) and vertical profiles of atmospheric aerosols have been carried out using Aethalometer and CALIPSO level - 2 satellite data from December 2012 to November 2014 over a semi-arid station, Anantapur. We found a bimodal distribution in the mass concentrations of BC aerosols on a diurnal scale. A sharp peak was observed during morning rush hours (7:00 to 8:00 LT) almost an hour after the local sunrise. After which, a broad nocturnal peak was found during similar to 21:00 to 22:00 LT. The seasonal mean BC concentrations (Mixed layer height (M-L)) were found to be 3.45 +/- 1.44 mu g/m(3) (676 +/- 117 m), 2.55 +/- 0.85 mu g/m(3) (1215 +/- 190 m), 1.22 +/- 0.31 mu g/m(3) (1134 +/- 194 m) and 1.75 +/- 0.70 mu g/m(3) (612 +/- 135 m), during the winter, summer, monsoon and post-monsoon respectively. The vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficient and back scattering ratio profiles were derived from Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) showed a strong seasonal variation with aerosols mostly confined below 2 km during the post-monsoon and winter seasons whereas in the other two seasons, the aerosol layer expands beyond 6 km. Depolarization ratios (>0.2) are higher during summer and monsoon at higher altitude regions demonstrate the presence of dust particles, which contribute to the large aerosol extinction at higher levels. These results are further supported by the backward trajectory cluster analysis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Vegetation phenology gradients along the west and east coasts of Greenland from 2001 to 2015
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to characterize the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation phenology along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients in Greenland, and to examine local and regional climatic drivers. Time-series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were analyzed to obtain various phenological metrics for the period 2001-2015. MODIS-derived land surface temperatures were corrected for the sampling biases caused by cloud cover. Results indicate significant differences between West and East Greenland, in terms of both observed phenology during the study period, as well as the climatic response. The date of the start of season (SOS) was significantly earlier (24 days), length of season longer (25 days), and time-integrated NDVI higher in West Greenland. The sea ice concentration during May was found to have a significant effect on the date of the SOS only in West Greenland, with the strongest linkage detected in mid-western parts of Greenland.

TI  - LiDAR-Assisted Multi-Source Program (LAMP) for Measuring Above Ground Biomass and Forest Carbon
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest measurement for purposes like harvesting planning, biomass estimation and mitigating climate change through carbon capture by forests call for increasingly frequent forest measurement campaigns that need to balance cost with accuracy and precision. Often this implies the use of remote sensing based measurement methods. For any remote-sensing based methods to be accurate, they must be validated against field data. We present a method that combines field measurements with two layers of remote sensing data: sampling of forests by airborne laser scanning (LiDAR) and Landsat imagery. The Bayesian model-based framework presented here is called Lidar-Assisted Multi-source Programme-or LAMP-for Above Ground Biomass estimation. The method has two variants: LAMP2 which splits the biomass estimation task into two separate stages: forest type stratification from Landsat imagery and mean biomass density estimation of each forest type by LiDAR models calibrated on field plots. LAMP3, on the other hand, estimates first the biomass on a LiDAR sample using models calibrated with field plots and then uses these LiDAR-based models to generate biomass density estimates on thousands of surrogate plots, with which a satellite image based model is calibrated and subsequently used to estimate biomass density on the entire forest area. Both LAMP methods have been applied to a 2 million hectare area in Southern Nepal, the Terai Arc Landscape or TAL to calculate the emission Reference Levels (RLs) that are required for the UN REDD+ program that was accepted as part of the Paris Climate Agreement. The uncertainty of these estimates is studied with error variance estimation, cross-validation and Monte Carlo simulation. The relative accuracy of activity data at pixel level was found to be 14 per cent at 95 per cent confidence level and the root mean squared error of biomass estimates to be between 35 and 39 per cent at 1 ha resolution.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Glacier Change in the Central Qinghai- Tibet Plateau and the Relationship with Changing Climate
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widely distributed glaciers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) represent important freshwater reserves and the meltwater feeds many major rivers of Asia. Glacier change over the QTP has shown high temporal and spatial variability in recent decades, and the driving forces of the variability are not yet clear. This study examines the area and thickness change of glaciers in the Dongkemadi (DKMD) region over central QTP by exploring all available Landsat images from 1976 to 2013 and satellite altimetry data over 20032008, and then analyzes the relationships between glacier variation and local and macroscale climate factors based on various remote sensing and re-analysis data. Results show that the variation of glacier area over 19762013 is characterized by significant shrinkage at a linear rate of -0.31 +/- 0.04 km2.year(-1). Glacier retreat slightly accelerated in the 2000s, and the mean glacier surface elevation lowered at a rate of -0.56 m.year(-1) over 20032008. During the past 38 years, glacier change in the DKMD area was dominated by the variation of mean annual temperature, and was influenced by the state of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The mechanism linking climate variability over the central QTP and the state of NAO is most likely via changes in the strength of westerlies and Siberian High. We found no evidence supporting the role of summer monsoons (Indian summer monsoon and East Asian monsoon) in driving local climate and glacier changes. In addition, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may be associated with the extreme weather (snow storm) in October 1986 and 2000 which might have led to significant glacier expansion in the following years. Further research is needed to better understand the physical mechanisms linking NAO, ENSO and climate variability over the mid-latitude central QTP.

TI  - Richer histories for more relevant policies: 42years of tree cover loss and gain in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understandings of contemporary forest cover loss are critical for policy but have come at the expense of long-term, multidirectional analyses of land cover change. This is a critical gap given (i) profound reconfigurations in land use and land control over the past several decades and (ii) evidence of widespread woodland resurgence' throughout the tropics. In this study, we argue that recent advancements within the field of land change science provide new opportunities to address this gap. In turn, we suggest that multidecadal and multidirectional analyses of land cover change can facilitate richer social analyses of land cover change and more relevant conservation policies and practice. Our argument is grounded in a case study from Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia. Using a novel analytical platform, Google Earth Engine, and open access to high-quality Landsat data, we map land cover change in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia, from 1972 to 2014. We find that tree cover loss constitutes the single largest net change over the period 1972-2014 but that gross rates of tree cover gain were three times higher than gross loss rates from 1972 to 1995 and equivalent to loss rates from 1995 to 2014. We suggest the smallholder tree crop economy likely produced both forest loss and Imperata grassland restoration in this region. This case points to the need to expand rather than collapse the baselines used to study carbon and biodiversity change in tropical regions. It also demonstrates the possible utility of applying such methods to other regions.

AB  - As the world continues to react and respond inefficiently to emerging infectious diseases, such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and the Ebola and Zika viruses, a growing transdisciplinary community has called for a more proactive and holistic approach to prevention and preparedness - One Health. Such an approach presents important opportunities to reduce the impact of disease emergence events and also to mitigate future emergence through improved cross-sectoral coordination. In an attempt to provide proof of concept of the utility of the One Health approach, the US Agency for International Development's PREDICT project consortium designed and implemented a targeted, risk-based surveillance strategy based not on humans as sentinels of disease but on detecting viruses early, at their source, where intervention strategies can be implemented before there is opportunity for spillover and spread in people or food animals. Here, we share One Health approaches used by consortium members to illustrate the potential for successful One Health outcomes that can be achieved through collaborative, transdisciplinary partnerships. PREDICT's collaboration with partners around the world on strengthening local capacity to detect hundreds of viruses in wild animals, coupled with a series of cutting-edge virological and analytical activities, have significantly improved our baseline knowledge on the zoonotic pool of viruses and the risk of exposure to people. Further testament to the success of the project's One Health approach and the work of its team of dedicated One Health professionals are the resulting 90 peer reviewed, scientific publications in under 5 years that improve our understanding of zoonoses and the factors influencing their emergence. The findings are assisting in global health improvements, including surveillance science, diagnostic technologies, understanding of viral evolution, and ecological driver identification. Through its One Health leadership and multi disciplinary partnerships, PREDICT has forged new networks of professionals from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors to promote global health, improving our understanding of viral disease spillover from wildlife and implementing strategies for preventing and controlling emerging disease threats.

TI  - Transit navigation through Northern Sea Route from satellite data and CMIP5 simulations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid Arctic sea ice decline over the last few decades opens new perspectives for Arctic marine navigation. Further warming in the Arctic will promote the Northern Sea Route (NSR) as an alternative to the conventional Suez or Panama Canal routes for intercontinental shipping. Here we use both satellite data and CMIP5 ensemble of climate models to estimate the NSR transit window allowing intercontinental navigation between Atlantic and Pacific regions. To this end, we introduce a novel approach to calculate start and end dates of the navigation season along the NSR. We show that modern climate models are able to reproduce the mean time of the NSR transit window and its trend over the last few decades. The selected models demonstrate that the rate of increase of the NSR navigation season will slow down over the next few decades with the RCP4.5 scenario. By the end of the 21st century ensemble-mean estimates show an increase of the NSR transit window by about 4 and 6.5 months according to RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Estimated trends for the end date of the navigation season are found to be stronger compared to those for the start date.

T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present research evaluated the relation between the normalized difference vegetation index ( NDVI) changes and the climate change during 2000-2014 in Qazvin Plain, Iran. Daily precipitation and mean temperature values during 2015-2040 and 2040-2065 were predicted using the statistical downscaling model ( SDSM), and these values were compared with the values of the base period ( 2000-2014). The MODIS images ( MOD13A2) were used for NDVI monitoring. In order to investigate the effects of climate changes on vegetation, the relationship between the NDVI and climatic parameters was assessed in monthly, seasonal, and annual time periods. According to the obtained results under the B2 scenario, the mean annual precipitation at Qazvin Station during 2015-2040 and 2040-2065 was 6.7 mm ( 9.3%) and 8.2 mm ( 11.36%) lower than the values in the base period, respectively. Moreover, the mean annual temperature in the mentioned periods was 0.7 and 0.92 degrees C higher than that in the base period, respectively. Analysis of the correlations between the NDVI and climatic parameters in different periods showed that there is a significant correlation between the seasonal temperature and NDVI ( P < 0.01). Moreover, the NDVI will increase 0.009 and 0.011 during 2015-2040 and 2040-2065, respectively.

TI  - The predictive accuracy of sentinel nodes mapping in the setting of pulmonary metastasectomy
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first study to evaluate the feasibility of mediastinal lymph node dissection (MLND) based on sentinel lymph node (SLN) status during pulmonary metastasectomy. A total of 22 patients (16 men, 6 women; age 63.3 +/- 7.01 years) who were candidates for metastasectomy through segmentectomy or lobectomy with MLND owing to cancers metastatic to the lung were enrolled in this study. Radiotracer was administered at the peritumoral region before surgery or soon after initiating surgery. During the operation, the radioactivity of the lymph nodes (ex vivo) was counted with a handheld gamma probe after MLND. Lobectomy was performed in 17 patients, and segmentectomy, in 5 patients. The number of dissected lymph nodes per patient was 14.4 +/- 8.69 (range, 5-36). In all patients, the SLN could be detected, and the number of SLNs identified was 2.0 +/- 1.15 (range, 1-5) per patient. Lymph node metastasis was identified in 3 of the 22 patients (13.6%), and none of the 3 patients with N1 or N2 disease had false-negative SLNs. SLN identification might be an indicator of whether or not MLND should be performed during pulmonary metastasectomy. However, further large-volume and multi-institutional studies are needed.

TI  - LAND COVER CHANGE AND WOODLAND DEGRADATION IN A CHARCOAL PRODUCING SEMI-ARID AREA IN KENYA
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Woodlands in Kenya are undergoing land cover change and degradation leading to loss of livelihoods. Uncontrolled charcoal production, although a livelihood source for communities living in woodland areas of Kenya, leads to woodland degradation. We used Landsat imagery, field plot data and household interviews to describe land cover change and the role of charcoal production in woodland degradation. An unsupervised classification was used to determine land cover change from woodland to open/farmland, and five 16-km transects were used to investigate the extent of charcoal production in the target woodlands. Semi-structured interviews were conducted on 117 households to understand their perceptions on woodland cover change and the role of charcoal production. The overall accuracy of our classification was 86%. Woodland areas decreased by 24% between 1986 and 2014. The trend of woodland area change compared well between remote sensing and interview data. The density of kilns, a proxy for charcoal-led woodland degradation, varied across the sample plots. Despite charcoal providing a livelihood for 66% of the households, the community felt that their environment, wealth and social relations have been affected by land cover changes caused by charcoal production. Based on these results, we recommend that appropriate measures aimed at improving the productivity of agriculture, adapting to climate change and reducing dependence on charcoal for sustenance should be encouraged to mitigate woodland cover loss and degradation.

TI  - Monitoring Agricultural Expansion in Burkina Faso over 14 Years with 30 m Resolution Time Series: The Role of Population Growth and Implications for the Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burkina Faso ranges amongst the fastest growing countries in the world with an annual population growth rate of more than three percent. This trend has consequences for food security since agricultural productivity is still on a comparatively low level in Burkina Faso. In order to compensate for the low productivity, the agricultural areas are expanding quickly. The mapping and monitoring of this expansion is difficult, even on the basis of remote sensing imagery, since the extensive farming practices and frequent cloud coverage in the area make the delineation of cultivated land from other land cover and land use types a challenging task. However, as the rapidly increasing population could have considerable effects on the natural resources and on the regional development of the country, methods for improved mapping of LULCC (land use and land cover change) are needed. For this study, we applied the newly developed ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) framework to generate high temporal (8-day) and high spatial (30 m) resolution NDVI time series for all of Burkina Faso for the years 2001, 2007, and 2014. For this purpose, more than 500 Landsat scenes and 3000 MODIS scenes were processed with this automated framework. The generated ESTARFM NDVI time series enabled extraction of per-pixel phenological features that all together served as input for the delineation of agricultural areas via random forest classification at 30 m spatial resolution for entire Burkina Faso and the three years. For training and validation, a randomly sampled reference dataset was generated from Google Earth images and based on expert knowledge. The overall accuracies of 92% (2001), 91% (2007), and 91% (2014) indicate the well-functioning of the applied methodology. The results show an expansion of agricultural area of 91% between 2001 and 2014 to a total of 116,900 km(2). While rainfed agricultural areas account for the major part of this trend, irrigated areas and plantations also increased considerably, primarily promoted by specific development projects. This expansion goes in line with the rapid population growth in most provinces of Burkina Faso where land was still available for an expansion of agricultural area. The analysis of agricultural encroachment into protected areas and their surroundings highlights the increased human pressure on these areas and the challenges of environmental protection for the future.

TI  - Rationale for Spiritually Oriented Cognitive Processing Therapy for Moral Injury in Active Duty Military and Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
T2  - JOURNAL OF NERVOUS AND MENTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wartime experiences have long been known to cause ethical conflict, guilt, self-condemnation, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, lack of meaning and purpose, and spiritual struggles. "Moral injury" (MI) (also sometimes called "inner conflict") is the term used to capture this emotional, cognitive, and behavioral state. In this article, we provide rationale for developing and testing Spiritually Oriented Cognitive Processing Therapy, a version of standard cognitive processing therapy for the treatment of MI in active duty and veteran service members (SMs) with posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms who are spiritual or religious (S/R). Many SMs have S/R beliefs that could increase vulnerability to MI. Because the injury is to deeply held moral standards and ethical values and often adversely affects spiritual beliefs and worldview, we believe that those who are S/R will respond more favorably to a therapy that directly targets this injury from a spiritually oriented perspective. An evidence-based treatment for MI in posttraumatic stress disorder that not only respects but also utilizes SMs' spiritual beliefs/behaviors may open the door to treatment for many S/R military personnel.

TI  - Phenology-Based Method for Mapping Tropical Evergreen Forests by Integrating of MODIS and Landsat Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Updated extent, area, and spatial distribution of tropical evergreen forests from inventory data provides valuable knowledge for research of the carbon cycle, biodiversity, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. However, acquiring these data in mountainous regions requires labor-intensive, often cost-prohibitive field protocols. Here, we report about validated methods to rapidly identify the spatial distribution of tropical forests, and obtain accurate extent estimates using phenology-based procedures that integrate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imagery. Firstly, an analysis of temporal profiles of annual time-series MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) was developed to identify the key phenology phase for extraction of tropical evergreen forests in five typical lands cover types. Secondly, identification signatures of tropical evergreen forests were selected and their related thresholds were calculated based on Landsat NDVI, EVI, and LSWI extracted from ground true samples of different land cover types during the key phenology phase. Finally, a map of tropical evergreen forests was created by a pixel-based thresholding. The developed methods were tested in Xishuangbanna, China, and the results show: (1) Integration of Landsat and MODIS images performs well in extracting evergreen forests in tropical complex mountainous regions. The overall accuracy of the resulting map of the case study was 92%; (2) Annual time series of high-temporal-resolution remote sensing images (MODIS) can effectively be used for identification of the key phenology phase (between Julian Date 20 and 120) to extract tropical evergreen forested areas through analysis of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of different land cover types; (3) NDVI and LSWI are two effective metrics (NDVI >= 0.670 and 0.447 >= LSWI >= 0.222) to depict evergreen forests from other land cover types during the key phenology phase in tropical complex mountainous regions. This method can make full use of the Landsat and MODIS archives as well as their advantages for tropical evergreen forests geospatial inventories, and is simple and easy to use. This method is suggested for use with other similar regions.

TI  - Sun glitter imagery of ocean surface waves. Part 1: Directional spectrum retrieval and validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A practical method is suggested to quantitatively retrieve directional spectra of ocean surface waves from high-resolution satellite sun glitter imagery (SSGI). The method builds on direct determination of the imaging transfer function from the large-scale smoothed shape of sun glitter. Observed brightness modulations are then converted into sea surface elevations to perform directional spectral analysis. The method is applied to the Copernicus Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) measurements. Owing to the specific instrumental configuration of MSI (which has a primary mission dedicated to mapping of land surfaces), a physical angular difference between channel detectors on the instrument focal plane array can be used to efficiently determine the surface brightness gradients in two directions, i.e., in sensor zenith and azimuthal directions. In addition, the detector configuration of MSI means that a small temporal lag between channel acquisitions exists. This feature can be exploited to detect surface waves and infer their space-time characteristics using cross-channel correlation. We demonstrate how this can be used to remove directional ambiguity in 2-D detected wave spectra and to obtain information describing local dispersion relation of surface waves. Directional spectra derived from Sentinel-2 MSI SSGI are compared with in situ buoy measurements. We report an encouraging agreement between SSGI-derived wave spectra and in situ measurements.

TI  - Sun glitter imagery of surface waves. Part 2: Waves transformation on ocean currents
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Under favorable imaging conditions, the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) can provide spectacular and novel quantitative ocean surface wave directional measurements in satellite Sun Glitter Imagery (SSGI). Owing to a relatively large-swath with high-spatial resolution (10 m), ocean surface roughness mapping capabilities, changes in ocean wave energy, and propagation direction can be precisely quantified at very high resolution, across spatial distances of 10 km and more. This provides unique opportunities to study ocean wave refraction induced by spatial varying surface currents. As expected and demonstrated over the Grand Agulhas current area, the mesoscale variability of near-surface currents, documented and reconstructed from satellite altimetry, can significantly deflect in-coming south-western swell systems. Based on ray-tracing calculations, and unambiguously revealed from the analysis of Sentinel-2 MSI SSGI measurements, the variability of the near-surface current explains significant wave-current refraction, leading to wavetrapping phenomenon and strong local enhancement of the total wave energy. In addition to its importance for wave modeling and hazard prediction, these results open new possibilities to combine different satellite measurements and greatly improve the determination of the upper ocean mesoscale vorticity motions.

AB  - The Taiwan Strait (TS) connects the East China Sea (ECS) and South China Sea (SCS). Flow circulation in the TS exhibits complicated patterns during winter. The cold China Coastal Current (CCC) flows southward into the northwestern side of the strait as the warm Kuroshio Branch (KB) enters the strait along the southeastern side. In addition to the control that the northeasterly monsoon exerts over the CCC intrusion strength, the complex topography modifies the circulation. The winter temperature gradient in the TS is nearly horizontal. The sea surface temperature (SST) data reveal the main circulation features, including a distinct SST front in the middle of the strait. A rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) analysis is applied to the advanced very-high-resolution radiometer data to define four SST regions: the CCC and KB sources as well as the regions influenced by the Taiwan Banks and the Chang-Yun Rise. The Mann-Kendall trend detection method indicated that the SST in the TS (except in the KB region) abruptly increased during 1992 - 1994. The warming tendency in the KB region was slower compared with that of the other regions. The relationship between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phase and SST variation in the TS exhibited spatial and decadal variations. The SST in the northern TS tended to be warmer (cooler) during El Nino (La Nina) years compared with normal years. However, the opposite relationship was found in the southern TS: SST cooling (warming) occurred during El Nino (La Nina) years and this phenomenon existed only after the SST warming regime shift (1992 - 1994).

TI  - A MODIS-Based Robust Satellite Technique (RST) for Timely Detection of Oil Spilled Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural crude-oil seepages, together with the oil released into seawater as a consequence of oil exploration/production/transportation activities, and operational discharges from tankers (i.e., oil dumped during cleaning actions) represent the main sources of sea oil pollution. Satellite remote sensing can be a useful tool for the management of such types of marine hazards, namely oil spills, mainly owing to the synoptic view and the good trade-off between spatial and temporal resolution, depending on the specific platform/sensor system used. In this paper, an innovative satellite-based technique for oil spill detection, based on the general robust satellite technique (RST) approach, is presented. It exploits the multi-temporal analysis of data acquired in the visible channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua satellite in order to automatically and quickly detect the presence of oil spills on the sea surface, with an attempt to minimize "false detections" caused by spurious effects associated with, for instance, cloud edges, sun/satellite geometries, sea currents, etc. The oil spill event that occurred in June 2007 off the south coast of Cyprus in the Mediterranean Sea has been considered as a test case. The resulting data, the reliability of which has been evaluated by both carrying out a confutation analysis and comparing them with those provided by the application of another independent MODIS-based method, showcase the potential of RST in identifying the presence of oil with a high level of accuracy.

TI  - Adjuvant Radiosurgery Versus Serial Surveillance Following Subtotal Resection of Atypical Meningioma: A Systematic Analysis
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical meningioma (AM) is an aggressive subtype of meningioma associated with a high recurrence rates (RR) following surgical resection. Recent studies have compared outcomes of various treatment strategies, but advantages of adjuvant radiosurgery (ARS) over serial surveillance (SS) following subtotal resection (STR) remain unclear. To further elucidate this issue, we systematically analyzed the current literature on AM and compared outcomes of ARS versus SS after STR.METHODS: Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were queried using relevant search terms. Retrospective case series that described patients with AM treated with ARS and SS after STR were included. Tests of proportions were performed to detect significant variations in RR, 5year progression-free survival (PFS), and 5-year overall survival (OS) between the treatment strategies (ARS vs. SS) and among individual studies.RESULTS: A total of 619 patients (263 in the ARS group and 356 in the SS group) were identified. Mean RR, 5-year PFS, and 5-year OS were 53.5%, 50.3%, and 74.9%, respectively, for ARS versus 89.8%, 19.1%, and 89.8% for SS. RR differed between treatment strategies and ARS studies (P < 0.001), and 5-year PFS differed among treatment strategies, ARS, and SS studies (P < 0.001, P=0.007, and P < 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: The data presented here show significant differences in RR and 5-year PFS between ARS and SS, suggesting a potential benefit of ARS. As our understanding of the clinical outcomes of various treatment strategies for AM increases, we also move closer to integrating modalities, such as radiosurgery, into management guidelines.

TI  - Comparison of Free Atmosphere Temperature Series from Radiosonde and Satellite Data<SUP>1</SUP>
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The series of air temperature anomalies in the free atmosphere from radiosonde and satellite data are compared. Along with the well-known datasets of leading foreign centers, the datasets are considered of monthly temperature anomalies for isobaric surfaces and tropospheric and lower tropospheric layers obtained in the All-Russian Research Institute of Hydrometeorological Information World Data Center (RIHMI-WDC) from the data of the global network of radiosonde observations. Following numerous literature sources, the study corroborates that it is impossible to detect the so called tropospheric amplification of warming in observational data. The results of the comparison of statistical parameters for different series of air temperature anomalies prove that the RIHMI-WDC dataset is appropriate for solving the problems of climate monitoring on the assessment of air temperature in the free atmosphere. A doubtless advantage of these datasets for the preparation of the data of monitoring and diagnosis of the current climate is that their operational update is possible by processing new monthly portions of radiosonde data for the global network. The other advantage is that they do not depend on the modes of series update in the foreign sources.

TI  - Increasing the Accuracy of Runoff and Streamflow Simulation in the Nzoia Basin, Western Kenya, through the Incorporation of Satellite-Derived CHIRPS Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrologic models will be an increasingly important tool for water resource managers as water availability dwindles and water security concerns become more pertinent in data-scarce regions. Fortunately, newly available satellite remote sensing technology provides an opportunity for improving the spatial resolution and quality of input data to hydrologic models in such regions. In particular, the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) dataset provides quasi-global high resolution precipitation information derived from a blend of in situ and active and passive remote sensing data sources. We piloted the incorporation of the CHIRPS dataset into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), a hydrologic model. Comparisons of results between estimation of streamflow using in situ rainfall gauge station data, the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) dataset, and the CHIRPS dataset in the data-scarce Nzoia Basin in western Kenya over the temporal range 1990-2000 were reported. Simulated streamflow estimates were poor with rainfall gauge station data but improved significantly with the CFSR and CHIRPS datasets. However, the use of the CHIRPS dataset in comparison with the CFSR dataset provided an improved statistical performance following model calibration with the exception of one streamflow gauge station in higher elevation regions. Overall, the use of the CHIRPS dataset had the greatest linear correlation, relative variability, and normalized bias despite overall average Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and R-2 values.

TI  - Potential and Limitation of SPOT-5 Ortho-Image Correlation to Investigate the Cinematics of Landslides: The Example of "Mare a Poule d'Eau" (Reunion, France)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 10 years, the accessibility of high spatial resolution remote sensing images has strongly increased. These images are available in ortho-rectified format which do not necessitate any further geometrical processing to be analyzed. In parallel, image correlation software has become more efficient and friendly. In this paper, image correlation methods are tested to evaluate their potential and limitations to measure the surface displacements in a complex case of a landslide located in a tropical environment. This studied landslide, called "Mare a Poule d'Eau", is located in the Salazie erosion watershed in Reunion Island (France). This landslide is monitored daily by a DGPS station which registers the south-north displacements. Two pairs of ortho-rectified SPOT-5 images at 2.5 m resolution provided by Kalideos (http://kalideos.cnes.fr) were selected. The first pair frames the period between 2002 and 2005 during which the landslide activity was low. The second pair of images (2006-2008) frames a period of time during which the landslide was more active. Fifty-nine Image Control Points (ICP) were selected on the images by the SIFT method (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) and visually controlled. The shifts of these points used as external control are estimated for the two time periods. Two image correlator softwares are used: MicMac and Cosi-Corr. The results obtained by the two correlators are similar. For the 2002-2005 period, the shift measured by correlators in the landslide is similar to the shift outside the landslide. This means that the displacement cannot be detected and estimated during periods of low activity of the landslide. The shift of the landslide for the 2006-2008 period is out of noise and reaches 8.5 m. The displacement can be estimated by applying a correction factor extracted from the ICP located in the stable areas. The potential and limits of the image correlation in such complex environments is discussed. A strategy is proposed to evaluate the quality of the results and to extract the displacement signal from the shift measurements.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection in VHR remote sensing imagery - an object-based clustering approach in a dynamic urban environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of changes is one of the most important inherent capabilities of remote sensing. The steadily increasing amount of available very-high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery requires highly automatic methods and thus, largely unsupervised concepts for change detection. In addition, new procedures that address this challenge should be capable of handling remote sensing data acquired by different sensors. Thereby, especially in rapidly changing complex urban environments, the high level of detail present in VHR data indicates the deployment of object-based concepts for change detection. This paper presents a novel object-based approach for unsupervised change detection with focus on individual buildings. First, a principal component analysis together with a unique procedure for determination of the number of relevant principal components is performed as a predecessor for change detection. Second, k-means clustering is applied for discrimination of changed and unchanged buildings. In this manner, several groups of object-based difference features that can be derived from multi-temporal VHR data are evaluated regarding their discriminative properties for change detection. In addition, the influence of deviating viewing geometries when using VHR data acquired by different sensors is quantified. Overall, the proposed workflow returned viable results in the order of kappa statistics of 0.8-0.9 and beyond for different groups of features, which demonstrates its suitability for unsupervised change detection in dynamic urban environments. With respect to imagery from different sensors, deviating viewing geometries were found to deteriorate the change detection result only slightly in the order of up to 0.04 according to kappa statistics, which underlines the robustness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Spillage sedimentation on large river floodplains
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Review
AB  - Active deposition across the floodplains of large rivers arises through a variety of processes; collectively these are here termed spillage sedimentation'. Three groups of 11 spillage sedimentation styles are identified and their formative processes described. Form presences on large river floodplains show different combinations of active spillage styles. Only some large floodplains have prominent levees; some have coarse splays; many have accessory channel dispersion and reworking, while still-water sedimentation in lacustrine environments dominates some lower reaches. Infills are also commonly funnelled into prior, and often linear, negative relief forms relating to former migration within the mainstream channel belt. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat 8 data are used to map spillage form types and coverage along a 1700km reach of the Amazon that has an active floodplain width of up to 110km with a systematic character transformation down-valley. Spillage forms associated directly with mainstream processes rarely account for more than 5% of the floodplain deposits. There is a marked decrease in floodplain point bar complexes (PBC) over 1700km downstream (from 34% to 5%), and an increase in the prevalence of large water bodies (2% to 37%) and accompanying internal crevasses and deltas (0% to 5%). Spillage sedimentation is likely within the negative relief associated with these forms, depending on mainstream sediment-laden floodwater inputs. Spillage style dominance depends on the balance between sediment loadings, hydrological sequencing, and morphological opportunity. Down-river form sequences are likely to follow gradient change, prior up-river sediment sequestration and the altered nature of spilled loads, but also crucially, local floodplain relief and incident water levels and velocities at spillage times. Considering style distribution quantitatively, as a spatially distributed set of identifiable forms, emphasizes the global variety to spillage phenomena along and between large rivers.

TI  - Extreme flood-driven fluvial bank erosion and sediment loads: direct process measurements using integrated Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) and hydro-acoustic techniques
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This methods paper details the first attempt at monitoring bank erosion, flow and suspended sediment at a site during flooding on the Mekong River induced by the passage of tropical cyclones. We deployed integrated mobile laser scanning (MLS) and multibeam echo sounding (MBES), alongside acoustic Doppler current profiling (aDcp), to directly measure changes in river bank and bed at high (similar to 0.05m) spatial resolution, in conjunction with measurements of flow and suspended sediment dynamics. We outline the methodological steps used to collect and process this complex point cloud data, and detail the procedures used to process and calibrate the aDcp flow and sediment flux data. A comparison with conventional remote sensing methods of estimating bank erosion, using aerial images and Landsat imagery, reveals that traditional techniques are error prone at the high temporal resolutions required to quantify the patterns and volumes of bank erosion induced by the passage of individual flood events. Our analysis reveals the importance of cyclone-driven flood events in causing high rates of erosion and suspended sediment transport, with a c. twofold increase in bank erosion volumes and a fourfold increase in suspended sediment volumes in the cyclone-affected wet season.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Fujian Province has been one of the most severe soil erosion regions since Ming and Qing Dynasty in China. Recently, several ecological restoration projects have been implemented and they have significantly. changed vegetation cover in this region.Methods We analyzed the four-decade vegetation cover change in Fujian Province using seven time-series data of Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) between 1975 and 2014. We further explored the possible drivers on vegetation cover change by incorporating statistical data of plantation, cropland and urbanized area.Important findings Vegetation coverage in Fujian Province has increased from 69.0% to 77.8% between 1975 and 2014. However, a slight decrease was observed between 1995 and 2005. Spatially, forest was the primary vegetation type in the northwest, where croplands and human settlements were scattered along rivers or oceans. Shrubs and bare lands were also scattered across the northwest. In southwest, the areas of bare land, shrub land and cropland decreased, while areas of forest and human settlements expanded. The vegetation coverage and urbanized area increased at the cost of cropland and bare land.

TI  - Quantifying Grazing Intensity in China Using High Temporal Resolution MODIS Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland as a distinct landscape type sustains biological and cultural diversity. However, its use at an unprecedentedly high intensity has had a disastrous impact on grassland ecosystems, with degeneration occurring nationwide. Traditional management policy, drafted according to the stocking rate from livestock statistics and/or in situ assessment, seems to have played no role in alleviating this trend. A major cause is the failure of decision making to consider spatial heterogeneity in the impact of grazing on grassland. To address this issue, high temporal resolution moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer data were used to develop a new indicator, named the grazing intensity index (GII), for quantifying grazing intensity (GI). The new index was compared with two traditional approaches and the results demonstrated that GII could substitute for both of them to quantify GI.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Column-Integrated Algal Biomass in Nonalgae Bloom Conditions: A Case Study of Lake Chaohu, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In shallow lakes, algal biomass is a fundamental indicator of eutrophication status. However, the vertical movement of phytoplankton within the water column can complicate the determination of total phytoplankton biomass using remotely sensed data of surface conditions. In this study, we develop, validate, and apply a new approach to use remotely sensed reflectance to estimate the variability of total algal biomass in shallow eutrophic lakes. Using the baseline normalized difference bloom index together with hydrological and bathymetric data, we determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of the total algal biomass in Lake Chaohu, a large shallow lake in eastern China under the nonalgae bloom conditions. Over an eleven-year period (2003-2013), the total phytoplankton biomass was highly variable, more than doubling between 2006 and 2007, from 19.95t to 39.50t. The seasonal decomposition of biomass dynamics indicated the highest biomass production occurred in June, while the lowest occurred in April. The estimates of total phytoplankton biomass were both consistent with in situ measurements and consistent for observations made on the same day and on consecutive days. The improved stability and reliability of total biomass estimations provided more complete information about lake conditions with respect to surface concentrations. This has implications for both management and modeling.

TI  - Two comparative approaches to identify the conservation priority areas impacted by heavy metals on Yellow Sea coasts
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to develop a practical approach to identify the priority areas with ecological significance along highly human disturbed coastal areas. Field surveys were used to assess and complement to the results of the remote sensing (RS)-based analysis. The RS-based biodiversity hotspot (BH) identification process was accomplished in three steps. The lands with native vegetation cover, including the national natural reserve lands, were first selected as the baseline BHs (BBHs). Then, after assigning resistance coefficients to each land use, the least accumulative cost (LAC) of the BBHs was calculated by distance analysis, while the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) from the Landsat Thematic Mapper was reclassified into 20 grades based on the Euclidean distance to the main anthropogenic sources. Finally, the RS-based BH identification was realized through the logistic calculation of LAC less than a series of thresholds and NDVI more than 10. While the field survey-based BH identification was through the logistic calculation between HM potential ecological risks of low to moderate and BHs acquired by NDVI-based integrated assessments. The results proved that RS-based analysis could be an important surrogate for necessary field surveys to manage BHs along coasts.

TI  - Integrating Multiple Textural Features for Remote Sensing Image Change Detection
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a multi-texture change detection method by integrating macro-and micro-texture features. Macro-textures are related to the information defined by the whole image scene, while micro-textures describe distributions and relationships of the gray levels within a local window. Moreover, we propose two strategies, random forests (RF) and a fuzzy set model, to integrate different characteristics of the textures. Experiments were conducted on ZY-3 (the first civilian high-resolution stereo mapping satellite of China) orthographic images of the cities of Wuhan and Tokyo, as well as WorldView-2 multi-spectral images of the city of Kuala Lumpur. Results showed that the wavelet-based features obtained the highest accuracy among the macro-textures, while the morphological attributes obtained the best results for the micro-textures. By integrating both micro-and macro-textures, the texture combination using both RF and a fuzzy set model can further improve the accuracy of change detection.

TI  - Detecting Sustainability of Desertification Reversion: Vegetation Trend Analysis in Part of the Agro-Pastoral Transitional Zone in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics are an important topic in the field of global environment change, which is of great significance to monitor temporal-spatial variability of desertification at regional or global scales. Following the reported desertification reversion in the late 1990s in the Horqin Sandy Land, an issue was concerned for desertification control by decreased water availability. To detect the desertification process, MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) sequences were investigated to analyze the effect on vegetation over the 2000-2015 growing season. Results showed that: (1) NDVI sequences exhibited a positive trend in most of the significant pixels (19.1%-44.7% of the total), particularly in the southeastern part of Horqin, while showing a negative trend of 2.2%-4.3%; (2) NDVI was weakly related to precipitation since 2000, because intensified anthropogenic activities have obscured the impacts of climate variables, with a rapid decrease in grassland, and increase in cropland and woodland; and (3) the improved NDVI was interpreted by expanding cropland and excessive groundwater irrigation, according to the positive effect of grain yield on NDVI all over the Horqin area. For persistent desertification reversion, a land use strategy should be more adaptive to the carrying capacity in this agro-pastoral transitional zone, particularly with respect to water capacity.

TI  - An Integrated Convective Cloud Detection Method Using FY-2 VISSR Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of convective clouds on infrared brightness temperature (BTIR) and brightness temperature difference (BTD) image were analyzed using successive Infrared and Visible Spin-Scan Radiometer (VISSR) data of FY-2, and an integrated detection method of convective clouds using infrared multi-thresholds in combination with tracking techniques was implemented. In this method, BT and BTD thresholds are used to detect severe convection and uncertain clouds, then the tracking technique including overlap ratio, minimum BT change and cross-correlation coefficient is used to detect convection activities in uncertain clouds. The Application test results show that our integrated detection method can effectively detect convective clouds in different life periods, which show a better performance than any single step in it. The statistical results show that the alpha-type clouds are mostly large-scale systems, and the beta-and gamma-type clouds have the highest proportion of general type. However, the proportion of weak convective cloud is higher than that of severe ones in gamma-type cloud, and an opposite result is found in the beta-type.

TI  - A MODIS-Based Novel Method to Distinguish Surface Cyanobacterial Scums and Aquatic Macrophytes in Lake Taihu
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing can be an effective alternative for mapping cyanobacterial scums and aquatic macrophyte distribution over large areas compared with traditional ship's site-specific samplings. However, similar optical spectra characteristics between aquatic macrophytes and cyanobacterial scums in red and near infrared (NIR) wavebands create a barrier to their discrimination when they co-occur. We developed a new cyanobacteria and macrophytes index (CMI) based on a blue, a green, and a shortwave infrared band to separate waters with cyanobacterial scums from those dominated by aquatic macrophytes, and a turbid water index (TWI) to avoid interference from high turbid waters typical of shallow lakes. Combining CMI, TWI, and the floating algae index (FAI), we used a novel classification approach to discriminate lake water, cyanobacteria blooms, submerged macrophytes, and emergent/floating macrophytes using MODIS imagery in the large shallow and eutrophic Lake Taihu (China). Thresholds for CMI, TWI, and FAI were determined by statistical analysis for a 2010-2016 MODIS Aqua time series. We validated the accuracy of our approach by in situ reflectance spectra, field investigations and high spatial resolution HJ-CCD data. The overall classification accuracy was 86% in total, and the user's accuracy was 88%, 79%, 85%, and 93% for submerged macrophytes, emergent/floating macrophytes, cyanobacterial scums and lake water, respectively. The estimated aquatic macrophyte distributions gave consistent results with that based on HJ-CCD data. This new approach allows for the coincident determination of the distributions of cyanobacteria blooms and aquatic macrophytes in eutrophic shallow lakes. We also discuss the utility of the approach with respect to masking clouds, black waters, and atmospheric effects, and its mixed-pixel effects.

TI  - Realization of strong backscattering homogeneous regions with known backscattering coefficient in synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The strong backscattering homogeneous region, i.e., a uniform region with a high and constant backscattering coefficient, is important for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image quality assessment and SAR radiometric calibration, which, however, is difficult to realize in practice with a known backscattering coefficient. We realize a strong backscattering homogeneous region with a known backscattering coefficient in SAR images by utilizing designed metal grids. First, we propose a manmade grid-structure target and realize it with aluminum in practice, which is named the metal grid. Then, the backscattering coefficient of the designed metal grid is simulated in the computer simulation technology (CST) microwave studio and measured by a radar crosssection ( RCS) measurement instrument in a microwave anechoic chamber. Both CST simulation results and RCS measurement results confirm the strong backscattering property of the designed target. In addition, by utilizing the designed target, we realize a test field consisting of several strong backscattering homogeneous regions with different sizes at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. The spaceborne experiments have been carried out by the TerraSAR-X sensor over the test field in two flight campaigns in X-band with VV polarization. Experimental results demonstrate the strong backscattering property and homogeneity of the realized regions. (C) The Authors.

TI  - The Application of GF-1 Imagery to Detect Ships on the Yangtze River
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various satellite data are currently used to detect ships on the sea surface. However, no study on the use of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data to monitor ships on the surface of inland rivers has been reported. Therefore, we proposed a method to extract inland river-surface ships from GF-1 imagery. The Normalized Differential Water Index was calculated to enhance the contrast between water and non-water areas after the preprocessing procedure. The multi-resolution segmentation method and object-oriented classification rule sets were used to detect the ships in the image. Results show that most of the ships, whose length-to-width ratio ranges from 3.0 to 7.2, could be identified correctly regardless of their size. The results also indicate that detecting ships on inland rivers using GF-1 imagery is feasible.

TI  - The asymmetric distribution of phytoplankton in anticyclonic eddies in the western South China Sea
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - An anticyclonic eddy's periphery is characterized by large horizontal density gradients, strain and vertical velocity. In this paper we document the asymmetric distribution of phytoplankton around the periphery of anticyclonic eddies in the western South China Sea based on 432 eddies detected from satellite data. The high level of phytoplankton occurs consistently at the northwestern periphery of eddies, with a maximum positive chlorophyll anomaly greater than 0.01 mg m(-3). The asymmetric distribution of phytoplankton primarily tags the non-uniform surface velocity field varying from 0.15 m s(-1) to 0.3 m s(-1) along the eddy's periphery. The coastal boundary and off-coast jet may be the primary cause of the non-uniform flow. Associated with the non-uniform flow speed, the combined effects of the velocity convergence and steepened northwestern part of the eddies act to sharpen the density fronts and tend to result in an ageostrophic secondary circulation at the northwestern edge of the eddy. The upward component of the ageostrophic secondary circulation can enhance the nutrient flux into the euphotic layer, thereby increasing phytoplankton productivity. Anticyclonic eddy induced ageostrophic secondary circulation appears to be an important mechanism for increasing phytoplankton productivity in the oligotrophic waters of the South China Sea.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo is an easy access parameter in reflecting the status of both human disturbed soil and indirectly influenced area, whose characteristic is an important indicator in sustainable development under the background of global climate change. In this study, we employed meteorological data, MODIS 8-day BRDF/Albedo and LAI products from 2000 to 2014 to show the amelioration and mechanism around the Badain Jaran Desert Results showed that the human-dominated afforestation activities significantly increased the leaf area index (LAI) in summer and autumn. Lower reflectance at visible band was sensed inside the desert compared with the ecozone and the lowest albedo at forested area. The contribution of soil and vegetation reflectance to surface albedo determined the linear sensitivity of albedo to LAI variation. Decreased albedo dominated the spatial-temporal pattern of the Badain Jaran Desert. This study suggested that surface albedo can be regarded as a useful index in indicating the change process and evaluating the sustainable development of biological management around the Badain Jaran Desert (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A Study on Predicting Model of Organic Matter Contend Incorporating Soil Moisture Variation
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is one of the most important measuring indexes of soil fertility. How to predict SOM spatial distribution precisely has great significance to soil carbon storage estimation and precision agriculture development. Traditional measurement of SOM, although with higher accuracy, consumes a lot of labor resources and costs long-term monitoring period, therefore, it is hard to achieve dynamic monitor of SOM. Spectroscopy technique has been used in SOM and other soil physicochemical parameters quick measurement. However spatial inversion model accuracy of SOM based on remote sensing images is relatively lower than laboratory model accuracy due to the influence of soil moisture, roughness and so on. In recent years, most studies have not eliminated the effect of moisture. Since moisture has great influence on SOM spectra reflectance, this study introduced the temporal information combined with the spectral information in order to solve this problem. Soil moisture has differences in multi period remote sensing images, and the spectra reflectance is also different. Based on the combination of reflectance from of two periods remote sensing images, the spectral index was constructed to predict SOM in this study. MODIS images of study area acquired in this study area (Blacksoil zone) because of the advantage of high temporal resolution. Spectra reflectance of MODIS images were used to analyze the effect of moisture on soil spectral reflectance, and then the spectral prediction models of SOM were built based on the comprehensive impacts of SOM and soil moisture. The results shows that: (1) the accuracy of SOM prediction model based on single image was lower without consideration of moisture effect, The Root mean square error (RMSE) of SOM prediction model were 0. 591, 0.522, 0.545, 0.553, and the determination coefficient (R-2) were 0. 505, 0. 614, 0.562, 0.568, 0.645 respectively based on the day of year (DOY) 117, 119, 130, 140, 143 single image. (2) Model with multi temporal images (DOY119 and 143) which considered the effect of moisture and SOM showed better predictive ability. RMSE was 0. 442 while R-2 was 0. 723. Therefore the accuracy and stability of the model were significantly improved, and it can be used to predict the spatial distribution of SOM in regional scale. This study provides important information for regional soil fertility evaluation, soil carbon storage estimation, and precision agriculture development.

TI  - Detecting spatiotemporal changes of peak foliage coloration in deciduous and mixedforests across the Central and Eastern United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of fall foliage coloration, especially peak coloration, is of great importance to the climate change research community as it has implications for carbon storage in forests. However, its long-term variation and response to climate change are poorly understood. To address this issue, we examined the long-term trends and breakpoints in satellite derived peak coloration onset from 1982 to 2014 using an innovative approach that combines Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) with Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST). The peak coloration trend was then evaluated using both field foliage coloration observations and flux tower measurements. Finally, interannual changes in peak coloration onset were correlated with temperature and precipitation variation. Results showed that temporal trends in satellite-derived peak coloration onset were comparable with both field observations and flux tower measurements of gross primary productivity. Specifically, a breakpoint in long-term peak coloration onset was detected in 25% of pixels which were mainly distributed at latitudes north of 37 degrees N. The breakpoint tended to occur between 1998 and 2004. Peak coloration onset was delayed before the breakpoint while it was transformed to an early trend after the breakpoint in nearly all pixels. The remaining 75% of pixels exhibited monotonic trends, 35% of which revealed a late trend and 40% an early trend. The results indicate that the onset of peak coloration experienced a late trend during the 1980s and 1990s in most deciduous and mixed forests. However, the trend was reversed during the most recent decade when the timing of peak coloration became earlier. The onset of peak coloration was significantly correlated with late summer and autumn temperature in 55.5% of pixels from 1982 to 2014. This pattern of temperature impacts was also verified using field observations and flux tower measurements. In the remaining 44.5% of pixels, 12.2% of pixels showed significantly positive correlation between the onset of peak coloration and cumulative precipitation during late summer and autumn period from 1982 to 2014. Our findings can improve understanding of the impact of changes in autumn phenology on carbon uptake in forests, which in turn facilitate more reliable measures of carbon dynamics in vegetation-climate interactions models.

TI  - Aerosol properties over an urban site in central East China derived from ground sun-photometer measurements
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sun-photometer measurements at Hefei, an urban site located in central East China, were examined to investigate the variations of aerosol loading and optical properties. It is found that aerosol optical thickness (AOT) keeps higher in winter/spring and gets relatively lower in summer/autumn. The large AOT in winter is caused by anthropogenic sulfate/nitrate aerosols, while in spring dust particles elevate the background aerosol loading and the excessive fine-mode particles eventually lead to severe pollution. There is a dramatic decline of AOT during summer, with monthly averaged AOT reaching the maximum in June and soon the minimum in August. Meanwhile, aerosol size decreases consistently and single scattering albedo (SSA) reaches its minimum in July. During summertime large-sized particles play a key role to change the air from clean to mild-pollution situation, while the presence of massive small-sized particles makes the air being even more polluted. These complicated summer patterns are possibly related to the three key processes that are active in the high temperature/humidity environment concentrating on sulfate/nitrate aerosols, i.e., gas-to-particle transformation, hygroscopic growth, and wet scavenging. Regardless of season, the increase of SSA with increasing AOT occurs across the visible and near-infrared bands, suggesting the dominant negative/cooling effect with the elevated aerosol loading. The SSA spectra under varying AOT monotonically decrease with wavelength. The relatively large slope arises in summer, reinforcing the dominance of sulfate/nitrate aerosols that induce severe pollution in summer season around this city.

TI  - Global evaluation of gap-filling approaches for seasonal NDVI with considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A variety of approaches are available to fill the gaps in the time series of vegetation parameters estimated from satellite observations. In this paper, a scheme considering vegetation growth trajectory, protection of key point, noise resistance and curve stability was proposed to evaluate the gap-filling approaches. Six approaches for gap filling were globally evaluated pixel-by-pixel based on a reference NDVI generated from MODIS observations during the past 15 years. The evaluated approaches include the Fourier-based approach (Fourier), the double logistic model (DL), the iterative interpolation for data reconstruction (IDR), the Whittaker smoother (Whit), the Savitzky-Golay filter (SG) andthe locally adjusted cubic spline capping approach (LACC). Considering the five aspects, the ranks of the overall performance are LACC > Fourier > IDR > DL > SG > Whit. The six approaches are similar in filling the gaps and remaining the curve stability but there are large difference in protection of key points and noise resistance. The SG is sensitive to noises and the Whit is poor in protection of key points. In the monsoon regions of India, all evaluated approaches don't work well. This paper provides some new views for evaluating the gap filling approaches that will be helpful in selecting the optimal approach to reconstruct the time series of parameters for data applications.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of resilience was integrated into post-earthquake ecological restoration assessments in 10 counties heavily impacted by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Ecological resilience was defined as the time interval required for the vegetation coverage to recover to pre-earthquake levels in damaged areas. MODIS-EVI data from May to August in 2000 to 2016 were used to calculate the ecological resilience by fitting the curve of recovery rate (RR) versus time. The following conclusions were reached: (1) An area of 424.1 km(2) sustained vegetation damage. (2) The vegetation recovery was found to be linear based on the statistical analysis of the most common components of the damaged areas; consequently, linear fitting was used to estimate the resilience. (3) In terms of vegetation coverage, 44.2% of the damaged areas have already recovered. The vast majority of damaged areas are predicted to achieve vegetation recovery by 2022, but 5.3% of the damaged areas will not recover within this time period and have no resilience. (4) The management of damaged areas near roads, rivers and mining operations, especially at elevations of 2000-2500 m, slopes greater than 30 degrees, and precipitation levels greater than 1200 mm, should be prioritized in the future. (5) The innovations of this study include the method used to extract earthquake-related vegetation damage and the prediction of vegetation succession based on resilience.

TI  - SCUBA divers above the waterline: Using participatory mapping of coral reef conditions to inform reef management
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs provide important ecological services such as biodiversity, climate regulation, and cultural benefits through recreation and tourism. However, many of the world's reefs are declining, with Caribbean reefs suffering a significant decline in living corals over the past half century. This situation emphasizes the need to assess and monitor reef conditions using a variety of methods. In this study, a new method for assessing reef conditions to inform management using participatory mapping by coral reef "experts" in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is described. Occupational SCUBA divers were recruited (n=87) to map coral reef conditions, uses, and threats (stressors) using an internet-based mapping website. The data reveal an uneven geographic distribution of reef conditions in the USVI with the most frequently mapped perceived healthy reef characteristics being: large amount of physical reef structure (n=872 markers); endangered or threatened species present (n=721); and large amount of live coral cover (n=615). The greatest perceived threats were: invasive species (n=606); water pollution (n=234); and unsustainable fishing (n=200). Areas of important reef characteristics, perceived threats to reefs, and perceived recovery potential were plotted to identify areas requiring critical management attention. The authors found that perceptions of healthy reef conditions outnumbered perceptions of reef threats for nine of the ten most familiar coral reefs; the most frequent activity type within the coral reefs was tourism diving; and for the most familiar coral reefs, the divers perceived a high recovery potential. Given the novelty of participatory mapping methods to assess coral reefs, the strengths and weaknesses of the method is evaluated. The authors further propose a management typology for categorizing reef areas to inform their future management. In the absence of primary data, or, as a supplement to underwater surveys and remotely-sensed data on reef condition, participatory mapping can provide a cost-effective means for assessing coral reef conditions while identifying place-specific reef locations requiring management attention.

TI  - Hydrological and depositional processes associated with recent glacier recession in Yanamarey catchment, Cordillera Blanca (Peru)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate changes in the glaciated surface and the formation of lakes in the headwater of the Querococha watershed in Cordillera Blanca (Peru) using 24 Landsat images from 1975 to 2014. Information of glacier retreat was integrated with available climate data, the first survey of recent depositional dynamics in proglacial Yanamarey Lake (4600 m a.s.l.), and a relatively short hydrological record (2002-2014) at the outlet of Yanamarey Lake. A statistically significant temperature warming (0.21 degrees C decade(-1) for mean annual temperature) has been detected in the region, and it caused a reduction of the glacierized area since 1975 from 3.5 to 1.4 km(-2). New small lakes formed in the deglaciated areas, increasing the flooded area from 1.8 ha in 1976 to 2.8 ha in 2014. A positive correlation between annual rates of glacier recession and runoff was found. Sediment cores revealed a high sedimentation rate (>1 cm yr(-1)) and two contrasted facies, suggesting a shift toward a reduction of meltwater inputs and higher hydrological variability likely due to an increasing role of precipitation on runoff during the last decades. Despite the age control uncertainties, the main transition likely occurred around 19982000, correlating with the end of the phase with maximum warming rates and glacier retreat during the 1980s and 1990s, and the slowing down of expansion of surface lake-covered surface. With this hydrological - paleolimnological approach we have documented the association between recent climate variability and glacier recession and the rapid transfer of hydroclimate signal to depositional and geochemical processes in high elevation Andean environments. This, study also alerts about water quality risks as proglacial lakes act as secondary reservoirs that trap trace and minor elements in high altitude basins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Modelling dasometric attributes of mixed and uneven- aged forests using Landsat-8 OLI spectral data in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensors can be used as a robust and effective means of monitoring isolated or inaccessible forest sites. In the present study, the multivariate adaptive regression splines ( MARS) technique was successfully applied to remotely sensed data collected by the Landsat-8 satellite to estimate mean diameter at breast height (R-2 = 0.73), mean crown cover (R-2 = 0.55), mean volume (R-2 = 0.57) and total volume per plot (R-2 = 0.41) in the forest monitoring sites. However, the spectral data yielded poor estimates of tree number per plot (R-2 = 0.22), the mean height (R-2 = 0.25) and the mean diameter at base (R-2 = 0.38). Seven spectral bands (band 1 to band 7), six vegetation indexes and other derived parameters (NDVI, SAVI, LAI, FPAR. ALB and ASR) and eight terrain variables derived from the digital elevation model (elevation, slope, aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, transformed aspect, terrain shape index and wetness index) were used as predictors in the fitted models. To prevent overparameterization only some of the predictor variables considered were included in each model. The results indicate the MARS technique is potentially suitable for estimating dasometric variables from using spectral data obtained by the Landsat-8 OLI sensor.

TI  - Substantial Mortality of Cabbage Looper (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) From Predators in Urban Agriculture Is not Influenced by Scale of Production or Variation in Local and Landscape-Level Factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As Midwestern (United States) cities experience population decline, there is growing interest in converting underutilized vacant spaces to agricultural production. Urban agriculture varies in area and scope, yet most growers use similar cultivation practices such as avoiding chemical control of crop pests. For community gardens and farms that sell produce commercially, effective pest suppression by natural enemies is important for both societal, economic, and marketing reasons. To gauge the amount of prey suppression at 28 urban food production sites, we measured removal of sentinel eggs and larvae of the cabbage looper Trichoplusia ni (Hubner), a caterpillar pest that defoliates Brassica. We investigated how landscape and local factors, such as scale of production, influence cabbage looper mortality caused by predators. Predators removed 50% of eggs and 25% of larvae over a 3-d period. Landscape factors did not predict mortality rates, and the amount of loss and damage to sentinel prey were similar across sites that differed in scale (residential gardens, community gardens, and farms). To confirm that removal of sentinel items was likely caused by natural enemies, we set up a laboratory assay that measured predation of cabbage looper eggs and larvae by several predators occurring in urban gardens. Lady beetles caused the highest mortality rates, suggesting their potential value for biocontrol; spiders and pirate bugs also consumed both eggs and larvae at high rates. Our results suggest that urban growers benefit from high consumption rates of cabbage looper eggs and larvae by arthropod predators.

TI  - Evaluation of spatiotemporal differences in suspended sediment concentration derived from remote sensing and numerical simulation for coastal waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing and numerical models are often used to monitor the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in coastal waters; however, the derived SSC varies between the two methods in both space and time. In this study, a method was proposed to assess the spatiotemporal differences in SSC derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and numerical simulation for coastal waters, using the Bohai Sea in China as an example. An empirical model for SSC retrieval from remote sensed images was initially established. A comparison of the temporal synchronicity over a single day period was performed between the observed data and the numerically simulated results. The range in the SSC at different observation sites was significantly different. Both the SSC values and their daily variation ranges were larger near the estuary of the Yellow River compared with the open area due to the concurrence of tidal flow and the introduction of fresh river water with high turbidity near the estuary. The areas that exhibited spatial differences were defined according to their differences in remotely sensed and numerically simulated SSC distribution patterns. Finally, the reasons for these spatiotemporal differences were discussed. The results provided understanding into the spatiotemporal differences that were introduced when multi-source data were used, thus improving the accuracy of the results when monitoring coastal environments for the management of coastal conservation.

TI  - Studying Vegetation Salinity: From the Field View to a Satellite-Based Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization of irrigated lands in the semi-arid Jezreel Valley, Northern Israel results in soil-structure deterioration and crop damage. We formulated a generic rule for estimating salinity of different vegetation types by studying the relationship between Cl/Na and different spectral slopes in the visible-near infrared-shortwave infrared (VIS-NIR-SWIR) spectral range using both field measurements and satellite imagery (Sentinel-2). For the field study, the slope-based model was integrated with conventional partial least squares (PLS) analyses. Differences in 14 spectral ranges, indicating changes in salinity levels, were identified across the VIS-NIR-SWIR region (350-2500 nm). Next, two different models were run using PLS regression: (i) using spectral slope data across these ranges; and (ii) using preprocessed spectral reflectance. The best model for predicting Cl content was based on continuum removal reflectance (R-2 = 0.84). Satisfactory correlations were obtained using the slope-based PLS model (R-2 = 0.77 for Cl and R-2 = 0.63 for Na). Thus, salinity contents in fresh plants could be estimated, despite masking of some spectral regions by water absorbance. Finally, we estimated the most sensitive spectral channels for monitoring vegetation salinity from a satellite perspective. We evaluated the recently available Sentinel-2 imagery's ability to distinguish variability in vegetation salinity levels. The best estimate of a Sentinel-2-based vegetation salinity index was generated based on a ratio between calculated slopes: the 490-665 nm and 705-1610 nm. This index was denoted as the Sentinel-2-based vegetation salinity index (SVSI) (band 4 band2)/(band 5 + band 11).

TI  - VHR GeoEye-1 imagery reveals an ancient water landscape at the Longcheng site, northern Chaohu Lake Basin (China)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study mainly focuses on revealing an ancient water landscape at the Longcheng site in the northern Chaohu Lake Basin using very high-resolution (VHR) GeoEye-1 imagery. First, prior to classification, the GeoEye-1 image was processed following atmospheric and geometric correction. The supervised classification was carried out in order to show the land-cover situation in the Longcheng area. The overall classification accuracy was 89.98%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.87. The moat system around the city walls was discovered by using rule-based object-oriented segmentation of the postclassified image, and the other walls of ancient Longcheng were manually identified from the pansharpened VHR GeoEye-1 image. Finally, a map of the ancient water landscape containing the ancient city, wall and moat at the Longcheng site was produced. This paper demonstrates that VHR remote sensing has the ability to uncover an ancient water landscape and provide new insights for archaeological and paleoenvironmental studies.

TI  - Fusion of airborne LiDAR data and hyperspectral imagery for aboveground and belowground forest biomass estimation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation biomass is a key biophysical parameter for many ecological and environmental models. The accurate estimation of biomass is essential for improving the accuracy and applicability of these models. Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been extensively used to estimate forest biomass. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in fusing LiDAR with other data sources for directly measuring or estimating vegetation characteristics. In this study, the potential of fused LiDAR and hyperspectral data for biomass estimation was tested in the middle Heihe River Basin, northwest China. A series of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were calculated to obtain the optimal biomass estimation model. To assess the prediction ability of the fused data, single and fused LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were regressed against field-observed belowground biomass (BGB), aboveground biomass (AGB) and total forest biomass (TB). The partial least squares (PIS) regression method was used to reduce the multicollinearity problem associated with the input metrics. It was found that the estimation accuracy of forest biomass was affected by LiDAR plot size, and the optimal plot size in this study had a radius of 22 m. The results showed that LiDAR data alone could estimate biomass with a relative high accuracy, and hyperspectral data had lower prediction ability for forest biomass estimation than LiDAR data. The best estimation model was using a fusion of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics (R-2 =0.785, 0.893 and 0.882 for BGB, AGB and TB, respectively, with p <0.0001). Compared with LiDAR metrics alone, the fused LiDAR and hyperspectral data improved R2 by 5.8%, 2.2% and 2.6%, decreased AIC value by 1.9%, 1.1% and 1.2%, and reduced RMSE by 8.6%, 7.9% and 8.3% for BGB, AGB and TB, respectively. These results demonstrated that biomass accuracies could be improved by the use of fused LiDAR and hyperspectral data, although the improvement was slight when compared with LiDAR data alone. This slight improvement could be attributed to the complementary information contained in LiDAR and hyperspectral data. In conclusion, fusion of LiDAR and other remotely sensed data has great potential for improving biomass estimation accuracy. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Saharan dust detection using multi-sensor satellite measurements.
T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Contemporary scientists have vested interest in trying to understand the climatology of the North Atlantic Basin since this region is considered as the genesis for hurricane formation that eventually get shipped to the tropical Atlantic region and the Caribbean. The effects of atmospheric water cycle and the climate of West Africa and the Atlantic basin are hugely impacted by the radiative forcing of Saharan dust. The focus area in this paper would be to improve the dust detection schemes by employing the use of multi sensor measurements in the thermal emissive wavelengths using legacy sensors such as Terra (T) and Aqua (A) MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), fusing with Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Previous work by Hao and Qu (2007) had considered a limited number of thermal infrared channels which led to a correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.765 between the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) at 550 nm and the modeled dust index. In this work, we extend the thermal infrared based dust detection by employing additional channels: the 8.55 mum which has shown high sensitivity to the Saharan dust, along with water vapor channel of 7.1 mum and cloud top channel of 13.1 mum. Also, the dust pixels were clearly identified using the OMI based aerosol types. The dust pixels were cleanly segregated from the other aerosol types such as sulfates, biomass, and other carbonaceous aerosols. These improvements led to a much higher correlation coefficient R2 value of 0.85 between the modified dust index and the AOT in comparison to the previous work. The key limitations from the current AOT products based on MODIS and were put to test by validating the improved dust detection algorithm. Two improvements were noted. First, the dust measurement radiometry using MODIS is significantly improved by at least an order of 2. Second the spatial measurements are enhanced by a factor of at least 10.

TI  - Estimation of gross primary production of irrigated maize using Landsat-8 imagery and Eddy Covariance data
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A study was conducted to understand the potential of Landsat-8 in the estimation of gross primary production (GPP) and to quantify the productivity of maize crop cultivated under hyper-arid conditions of Saudi Arabia. The GPP of maize crop was estimated by using the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) utilizing remote sensing data from Landsat-8 reflectance (GPPVPM) as well as the meteorological data provided by Eddy Covariance (EC) system (GPPEC), for the period from August to November 2015. Results revealed that the cumulative GPPEC for the entire growth period of maize crop was 1871 g C m(-2). However, the cumulative GPP determined as a function of the enhanced vegetation index - EVI (GPP(EVI)) was 1979 g C m(-2), and that determined as a function of the normalized difference vegetation index - NDVI (GPP(NDVI)) was 1754 g C m(-2). These results indicated that the GPPEVI was significantly higher than the GPPEC (R-2 = 0.96, P = 0.0241 and RMSE= 12.6%). While, the GPP(NDVI) was significantly lower than the GPPEC (R-2 = 0.93, P = 0.0384 and RMSE = 19.7%). However, the recorded relative error between the GPPEC and both the GPPEVI and the GPPNDVI was -6.22% and 5.76%, respectively. These results demonstrated the potential of the landsat-8 driven VPM model for the estimation of GPP, which is relevant to the productivity and carbon fluxes. (c) 2016 The Authors.

M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation can help to ensure that model results remain close to observations despite potential errors in the model, parameters, and inputs. In this study, we test whether assimilation of snow depth observations using the particle filter, a generic data assimilation method, improves the results of a multilayer energy-balance snow model, and compare the results against a direct insertion method. At the field site Col de Porte in France, the particle filter reduces errors in SWE, snowpack runoff, and soil temperature when forcing the model with coarse resolution reanalysis data, which is a typical input scenario for operational simulations. For those variables, the model performance after assimilation of snow depths is similar to model performance when forcing with high-quality, locally observed input data. Using the particle filter, we could also estimate a snowfall correction factor accurately at Col de Porte. The assimilation of snow depths also improves forecasts with lead-times of, at least, 7 days. At further 40 sites in Switzerland, the assimilation of snow depths in a model forced with numerical weather prediction data reduces the root-mean-squared-error for SWE by 64% compared to the model without assimilation. The direct insertion method shows similar performance as the particle filter, but is likely to produce inconsistencies between modeled variables. The particle filter, on the other hand, avoids such limitations without loss of performance. The methods proposed in this study efficiently reduces errors in snow simulations, seems applicable for different climatic and geographic regions, and are easy to deploy.

TI  - APDA Water Vapor Retrieval Validation for Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor is one of the main parameters for the atmospheric correction of Sentinel-2 imagery. Together with the aerosol retrieval, it determines the accuracy of the surface reflectance product. Since Sentinel-2A and soon Sentinel-2B are operational satellites with a free data policy, there is great interest in processing these data and using them for environmental studies. This letter performs a validation of Sentinel-2 retrieved water vapor over land by comparing the scene-derived water vapor column with the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurement as an independent source. The validation is performed for a large range of AERONET site elevations and solar zenith angles using the atmospheric precorrected differential absorption technique. Results show a high correlation with a low root-mean-square error of about 0.1 cm for water vapor values from 0.2 to 5 cm.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The 7th edition of the TNM American Joint Committee on Cancer classification incorporates mitotic rate (MR) only for primary cutaneous melanoma (PCM) with Breslow thickness (BT) <= 1 mm.Objective: To investigate whether and to what extent MR is able to predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) status and clinical outcome of PCM patients with BT >1 mm.Methods: The study included consecutive patients with PCM. Logistic regression and Cox regression model were used to analyze the impact of MR on SLN status, disease- free survival (DFS), and overall survival.Results: From 1998 to 2015, 1524 PCM (median age 57.8 years) cases were diagnosed with a BT >1 mm in six centers of the Italian Melanoma Intergroup. Median follow-up was 5.0 years. By multivariate analysis, MR was associated with SLN positivity (odds ratio 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-3.50, P = .018). After adjusting for BT, ulceration, age, sex, and SLN status, MR correlated with a poor DFS (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% CI 1.18-1.97, P = .002) and overall survival (hazard ratio 1.63, 95% CI 1.17-2.29, P = .004).Limitations: Retrospective analysis.Conclusion: MR is an independent prognostic factor for PCM patients with BT >1 mm. Incorporating this tissue biomarker could provide a better stratification of patients entering clinical trials in the adjuvant setting.

TI  - Estimating the spatial distribution and locating hotspots of forest biomass from harvest residues and fire-damaged stands in Canada's managed forests
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strategies for increasing the mobilization of forest biomass supply chains for bioenergy production require continuous assessments of the spatial and temporal availability of biomass feedstock. Using remote sensing products at a 250-m pixel resolution, estimates of theoretical biomass availability from harvest residues and fire-killed trees were computed by combining Canada-wide maps of forest attributes (2001) and of yearly (2002-2011) fires and harvests. At the national scale, biomass availability was estimated at 47 +/- 18 M ODT year from fire-killed trees and at 14 2 M ODT year(-1) from harvest residues. Mean biomass densities in burned and harvested pixels were estimated at 34 +/- 3.0 ODT ha(-1) and at 24 +/- 1.2 ODT ha (-1), respectively. Mean biomass densities also varied dramatically among ecozones, from 14 ODT ha(-1) to 206 ODT ha (-1) and from 6 ODT ha(-1) to 63 ODT ha (-1) for burned and harvested pixels, respectively. Spatial averaging with a 100-km radius window shows distinct hotspots of biomass availability across Canada. The largest hotspots from fire-killed trees reached 3.6 M ODT year (-1) in the Boreal Shield and the Boreal Plains ecozones of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, where fires are large and frequent The largest hotspots from harvest residues reached 1.2 M ODT year (-1) in the Montane Cordillera ecozone of British Columbia. The use of spatially explicit remote sensing products yields estimates of theoretical biomass availability that are methodologically consistent across Canada. Future development should include validations with on-the-ground forest inventories as well as the factoring in of environmental, technical and economic considerations to implement operational biomass supply chains.

TI  - Global water vapor content decreases from 2003 to 2012: An analysis based on MODIS data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor in the earth's upper atmosphere plays a crucial role in the radiative balance, hydrological process, and climate change. Based on the latest moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, this study probes the spatio-temporal variations of global water vapor content in the past decade. It is found that overall the global water vapor content declined from 2003 to 2012 (slope b = -0.0149, R = 0.893, P = 0.0005). The decreasing trend over the ocean surface (b = -0.0170, R = 0.908, P = 0.0003) is more explicit than that over terrestrial surface (b = -0.0100, R = 0.782, P = 0.0070), more significant over the Northern Hemisphere (b = -0.0175, R = 0.923, P = 0.0001) than that over the Southern Hemisphere (b = -0.0123, R = 0.826, P = 0.0030). In addition, the analytical results indicate that water vapor content are decreasing obviously between latitude of 36A degrees N and 36A degrees S (b = 0.0224, R = 0.892, P = 0.0005), especially between latitude of 0A degrees N and 36A degrees N (b = 0.0263, R = 0.931, P = 0.0001), while the water vapor concentrations are increasing slightly in the Arctic regions (b = 0.0028, R = 0.612, P = 0.0590). The decreasing and spatial variation of water vapor content regulates the effects of carbon dioxide which is the main reason of the trend in global surface temperatures becoming nearly flat since the late 1990s. The spatio-temporal variations of water vapor content also affect the growth and spatial distribution of global vegetation which also regulates the global surface temperature change, and the climate change is mainly caused by the earth's orbit position in the solar and galaxy system. A big data model based on gravitational-magmatic change with the solar or the galactic system is proposed to be built for analyzing how the earth's orbit position in the solar and galaxy system affects spatio-temporal variations of global water vapor content, vegetation and temperature at large spatio-temporal scale. This comprehensive examination of water vapor changes promises a holistic understanding of the global climate change and potential underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Estimating Infrared Radiometric Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Retrieval Cold Biases in the Tropics due to Unscreened Optically Thin Cirrus Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive longwave infrared radiometric satellite-based retrievals of sea surface temperature (SST) at instrument nadir are investigated for cold bias caused by unscreened optically thin cirrus (OTC) clouds [cloud optical depth (COD) <= 0.3]. Level 2 nonlinear SST (NLSST) retrievals over tropical oceans (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) radiances collected aboard the NASA Aqua satellite (Aqua-MODIS) are collocated with cloud profiles from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument. OTC clouds are present in approximately 25% of tropical quality-assured (QA) Aqua-MODIS Level 2 data, representing over 99% of all contaminating cirrus found. Cold-biased NLSST (MODIS, AVHRR, and VIIRS) and triple-window (AVHRR and VIIRS only) SST retrievals are modeled based on operational algorithms using radiative transfer model simulations conducted with a hypothetical 1.5-km-thick OTC cloud placed incrementally from 10.0 to 18.0 km above mean sea level for cloud optical depths between 0.0 and 0.3. Corresponding cold bias estimates for each sensor are estimated using relative Aqua-MODIS cloud contamination frequencies as a function of cloud-top height and COD (assuming they are consistent across each platform) integrated within each corresponding modeled cold bias matrix. NLSST relative OTC cold biases, for any single observation, range from 0.33 degrees to 0.55 degrees C for the three sensors, with an absolute (bulk mean) bias between 0.09 degrees and 0.14 degrees C. Triple-window retrievals are more resilient, ranging from 0.08 degrees to 0.14 degrees C relative and from 0.02 degrees to 0.04 degrees C absolute. Cold biases are constant across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Absolute bias is lower over the Atlantic but relative bias is higher, indicating that this issue persists globally.

TI  - Debris volume estimation and monitoring of Phuktal river landslide-dammed lake in the Zanskar Himalayas, India using Cartosat-2 images
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 31 December 2014, a large landslide in the Zanskar Himalayas, India created a 69-m high natural dam on the Phuktal river resulting in formation of a 17.2 km long impounded lake with 150 m width near the blockade. In this study, very high-resolution Cartosat-2 (1 m) multi-temporal images were used for geomorphic investigation, debris volume estimation and monitoring of the Phuktal river landslide-dammed lake. Geomorphic analysis carried out using Cartosat-2 images shows that the Phuktal river landslide occurred in two phases in quick succession. Rapid estimation of the volume of landslide debris was done indirectly by surface volume method using a reconstructed geometry of the debris area mapped (90,422 m(2)) from the Cartosat-2 image acquired on 20 January 2015. Subsequently, direct volume by fill volume method was estimated from a post-landslide digital elevation model (DEM) created by photogrammetric techniques with availability of more Cartosat-2 images (25 January 2015 and 21 February 2015) from adjacent orbits. In both the methods, a pre-existing 10-m DEM created from Cartosat-1 (2.5 m) stereoscopic images of 17 October 2010 was used as baseline elevation data. The debris volumes estimated by indirect and direct methods are 2,624,873 and 2,433,173 m(3) respectively. The difference in volume is attributed to reduction of debris surface area to 78,202 m(2) due to the spread of water onto the landslide dam on 21 February 2015. Indirect volume estimated by constraining the debris surface area to 21 February 2015 was found to be 2,530,125 m(3), which is a deviation of 4 % with respect to volume estimated by direct method. This indicates that landslide volume can be estimated fairly accurately in gorges in the absence of a post-landslide DEM. Results of the study were useful for supporting disaster management activities until landslide dam breached on 07 May 2015.

TI  - Full and effective participation of indigenous peoples in forest monitoring for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD plus ): trial in Panama's Darien
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A primary technical requirement of the climate change mitigation mechanism, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), is to calculate emissions factors, that is, the amount of CO2 emissions or removals per hectare from land use and land-use change. Emissions factors are calculated from baseline estimates of the aboveground biomass (AGB) stored in different vegetation types. Ground-based methods for estimating AGB, such as forest inventories, despite being relatively accurate and necessary for calibrating remotely sensed data such as satellite or airborne Light Detection and Ranging, tend to be expensive and time-consuming. Thus, calls have been made to improve the cost-efficiency of these methods within the context of REDD+. Also as part of REDD+, there have been calls for the legitimate inclusion of indigenous peoples and rural communities in various aspects of the mechanism. To address both of these issues, we devised a participatory, rapid, forest inventorying method and tested it across the heterogeneous forest landscape of Darien, Panama. This effort took place within a project that was administratively and logistically managed entirely by an indigenous organization working in collaboration with indigenous authorities in Darien, with funding from the World Bank. A group of 24 indigenous technicians were trained on forest inventorying methods. They established and measured thirty 1-ha plots under our direct supervision. We tested for various sources of error in tree diameter and height measurements. We also tested the scalability of our tree-level biomass estimates to the plot level by comparing our results with simulations conducted on the Barro Colorado Island 50-ha permanent plot data. Results indicate that our rapid, participatory, forest inventorying method effectively captures plot-level AGB, while guaranteeing the full and effective participation of indigenous peoples. The benefits of our method in terms of cost-efficiency and access to remote forest areas are discussed, as well as those accrued by indigenous peoples.

TI  - Analysis of waterspout environmental conditions and of parent-storm behaviour based on satellite data over the southern Aegean Sea of Greece
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A frequent area of waterspout formation is identified over the southern Aegean Sea. The objectives of this study are threefold: (1) to investigate the temporal evolution of Cloud Top Temperature (CTT) of cloud lines (waterspouts' parent clouds) that triggered the formation of single or multiple waterspout events, by using Meteorological Satellite Second Generation infrared satellite data, cloud base height data and weather observations from the closest Hellenic National Meteorological Service meteorological station; (2) to synthesize a detailed climatology of the thermodynamic environment during waterspout activity and (3) to explore the sea-surface temperature (SST) seasonal distribution and its possible relationships with the temperature of the middle and lower troposphere during waterspout days over the southern Aegean Sea. It was found that the CTT of waterspout parent clouds decreases close to waterspout formation time, which is consistent with growing clouds. The Severe Weather Threat Index (SWEAT), the Bulk Richardson Number (BRN) and the Convective Potential Available Energy during the autumn season were consistent with a shallow-convection environment. The instability parameter Delta T-1000 (difference in the air temperature between 1000 hPa and that at other pressure levels) exhibited a symmetric distribution about the median during both seasons and at all levels. More than 75% of autumn waterspout activity over the southern Aegean Sea developed with SST values varying from 22 to 24.5 degrees C, while the instability parameter Delta T-SST (the temperature difference between the SST and the temperature at various pressure levels) exhibited a symmetrical distribution about the median for both seasons and for all pressure levels, consistent with the Delta T-1000 seasonal distribution. A statistical analysis showed that the means of SWEAT, BRN, convective inhibition, SST, Delta T-SST and Delta T-1000 from air temperature at 700 hPa differ statistically significant (p < 0.001) between waterspout and non-waterspout days in autumn, over the southern Aegean Sea, during 2005-2012.

TI  - Use of Satellite and In Situ Reflectance Data for Lake Water Color Characterization in the Everest Himalayan Region
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied remote sensing techniques to the study of water color in Himalayan glacial lakes as a proxy of suspended solid load. In situ measurements gathered in 5 lakes in October 2014 during satellite data acquisition enabled the characterization of water reflectance and clarity and supported image processing. Field data analysis led to a distinction between 3 water colors and a consequent lake water color classification on a regional scale from Landsat-8 data previously corrected for atmospheric and adjacency effects. Several morphometric parameters (lake size and shape, distance between lake and glacier) were also computed for the lakes thus classified. The results showed spatial and temporal variations in lake water color, suggestive of relationships between glacier shrinkage and the presence of brighter and more turbid water. A finer-scale analysis of the spatial variability of water reflectance on Chola Lake (based on GeoEye-1 data captured on 18 October 2014) showed the contribution of water component absorption from the inflow. Overall, the findings support further research to monitor Himalayan lakes using both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 (with its improved resolutions).

TI  - Detecting and mapping different types of iron mineralization in Sangan mining region, NE Iran, using satellite image and airborne geophysical data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sangan mining region is the largest Fe skarn in western Asia has emplaced into the Khaf-Kashmar-Bardaskan volcano-plutonic belt in the NE Iran. In this region, carbonate rocks of Jurassic skarnified and hosted different epigenetic types of iron minerals, including magnetite, hematite, goethite, and limonite. The combination of remote sensing and airborne geophysical data is a powerful tool for mapping and interpreting iron mineralization in some area with intensely rugged topography or a broad expanse area, where systematic sampling and conventional geological mapping has some limitation and time consuming. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data and airborne geophysical magnetometry data were used for evaluating and mapping different types of iron mineralization in the Sangan mining region. Preprocessing of the datasets involved band ratio (BR), principal component analysis (PCA), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and constrained energy minimization (CEM) of the visible-near infrared and short wave infrared ASTER data were used to map four types of iron minerals (magnetite, hematite, goethite, and limonite). For preparing a lithological mapp of this region, an RGB image produced by combination of BR and PCA, (R:(5+7)/6, G:PC3, B:PC 5). Implementing SAM and CEM technique were useful for mapping and detecting magnetite, hematite, goethite, and limonite. The Reduce To the Pole (RTP) map of the airborne geophysical magnetometry data is a practical tool for iron ore exploration that were used in this region for enhancing high anomalous signature of magnetite after extracting granitoid rocks. The integration of the extracted information from the ASTER image processing algorithms and geophysical magnetometry, mapped iron mineralization and identified new potential of high magnetite mineralization. The results verified by geological map and comprehensive fieldwork. This integration model can generalize to other arid and semi-arid regions with iron potential for both regional and district scales.

TI  - Methemoglobinemia Caused by Portable Dialysis in the Critically Ill
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the root cause of a series of methemoglobinemia cases in a medical ICU.Results: We report a sentinel case of methemoglobinemia that was associated with dialysis sessions using a portable dialysis unit in our hospital. This led to the identification of four additional patients who developed methemoglobinemia while undergoing portable dialysis. We determined that these episodes were caused by inadequate clearance of chloramine from the tap water used for portable dialysis. Introduction of larger capacity carbon filters into the portable dialysis systems resulted in no further cases of methemoglobinemia at our institution.Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of municipal tap water as a potential cause of methemoglobinemia and monitor for excessive levels of oxidants in dialysis water sources. The capacity of the hemodialysis equipment to clear chloramine can vary as a function of external factors. Using a reliable test method to identify chloramines in the water prior to entering the hemodialysis equipment is essential.

TI  - Is It Valid to Compare Surgical Site Infections Rates Between Countries? Insights From a Study of English and Norwegian Surveillance Systems
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To assess whether differences in surveillance methods or underlying populations significantly influence internationally reported national SSI rates by comparing surveillance data from 2 countries.DESIGN. Retrospective cohort.SETTING. England and Norway.METHODS. We assessed the population under surveillance and surveillance methodology to compare SSI rates in 2 countries (September 2012 January 2015) for 4 surgical categories: coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), colon surgery, cholecystectomy, and hip prosthesis (HPRO). We compared the inpatient SSI incidence using logistic regression, adjusting for the following known risk factors: sex, age, ASA score, wound class, postoperative hospital days, and operation duration. Subsequently, we restricted further analyses to the procedures reported by both countries.RESULTS. There were important differences in case definitions for superficial infection, so we restricted our analyses to deep incisional and organ-space SSIs. For CABG, the crude odds ratio (OR) for England compared to Norway was 2.4 (95% CI, 1.4-4.4), whereas adjusted OR (aOR) lost significance (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.57-2.0). For colon surgery the decreased odds (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.81) remained significant after adjustment (aOR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.34-0.51). We found no associations for cholecystectomy. For HPRO, the crude OR suggested no significant difference (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.72-2.1), whereas the aOR was significantly lower in England (aOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25-0.81). Including only the subset of procedures reported by both countries yielded comparable results.CONCLUSION. Differences in case definitions and population under surveillance in the English and Norwegian SSI surveillance systems affected SSI estimates, making the comparison of crude rates unreliable. Standardized definitions and adjustment for established risk factors are essential for European comparisons to guide related public health actions.

TI  - Regional modeling of the water masses and circulation annual variability at the Southern Brazilian Continental Shelf
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southern Brazilian Continental Shelf (SBCS) is one of the more productive areas for fisheries in Brazilian waters. The water masses and the dynamical processes of the region present a very seasonal behavior that imprint strong effects in the ecosystem and the weather of the area and its vicinity. This paper makes use of the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) for studying the water mass distribution and circulation variability in the SBCS during the year of 2012. Model outputs were compared to in situ, historical observations and to satellite data. The model was able to reproduce the main thermohaline characteristics of the waters dominating the SBCS and the adjacent region. The mixing between the Subantarctic Shelf Water and the Subtropical Shelf Water, known as the Subtropical Shelf Front (STSF), presented a clear seasonal change in volume. As a consequence of the mixing and of the seasonal oscillation of the STSF position, the stability of the water column inside the SBCS also changes seasonally. Current velocities and associated transports estimated for the Brazil Current (BC) and for the Brazilian Coastal Current (BCC) agree with previous measurements and estimates, stressing the fact that the opposite flow of the BCC occurring during winter in the study region is about 2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the BC. Seasonal maps of simulated Mean Kinetic Energy and Eddy Kinetic Energy demonstrate the known behavior of the BC and stressed the importance of the mean coastal flow off Argentina throughout the year.

TI  - The Use of Geospatial Technologies in Flood Hazard Mapping and Assessment: Case Study from River Evros
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scientists link climate change to the increase of the extreme weather phenomena frequency, which combined with land use changes often lead to disasters with severe social and economic effects. Especially floods as a consequence of heavy rainfall can put vulnerable human and natural systems such as transboundary wetlands at risk. In order to meet the European Directive 2007/60/EC requirements for the development of flood risk management plans, the flood hazard map of Evros transboundary watershed was produced after a grid-based GIS modelling method that aggregates the main factors related to the development of floods: topography, land use, geology, slope, flow accumulation and rainfall intensity. The verification of this tool was achieved through the comparison between the produced hazard map and the inundation maps derived from the supervised classification of Landsat 5 and 7 satellite imageries of four flood events that took place at Evros delta proximity, a wetland of international importance. The comparison of the modelled output (high and very high flood hazard areas) with the extent of the inundated areas as mapped from the satellite data indicated the satisfactory performance of the model. Furthermore, the vulnerability of each land use against the flood events was examined. Geographically Weighted Regression has also been applied between the final flood hazard map and the major factors in order to ascertain their contribution to flood events. The results accredited the existence of a strong relationship between land uses and flood hazard indicating the flood susceptibility of the lowlands and agricultural land. A dynamic transboundary flood hazard management plan should be developed in order to meet the Flood Directive requirements for adequate and coordinated mitigation practices to reduce flood risk.

TI  - MAPPING <i>PROSOPIS</i> <i>JULIFLORA</i> IN WEST SOMALILAND WITH LANDSAT 8 SATELLITE IMAGERY AND GROUND INFORMATION
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prosopis juliflora is a drought-tolerant fast-growing tree species originating from South and Central America with a high invasion potential in arid and semi-arid areas in Africa. It was introduced in Somaliland in the 1980s and is reported to have spread vigorously since. Despite being recognized as a serious issue in the country, the actual scale of the problem is unknown. In this study, we mapped the species in a study area that includes the capital, Hargeisa, using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. During a field campaign in 2015, we collected canopy-level spectral signatures of P.juliflora and native trees to analyse the potential use of spectral data in discriminating the invasive species. P.juliflora was found to be generally distinguishable because of its greater vigour during the dry season. We tested the accuracy of the random forest classifier and different classification set-ups, varying the spatial resolution (original 30m vs pan-sharpened 15m) and image acquisition dates (during the wet season, the dry season and a combination of the two). Best overall accuracy (84%) was achieved by using pan-sharpened data from the two seasons. About 30years since its introduction, the invasive species was detected in 9% of the total investigated area with highest occurrence in the proximity of human settlements and along seasonal water courses.

TI  - Spatial, seasonal and interannual variability of supraglacial ponds in the Langtang Valley of Nepal, 1999-2013
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial ponds play a key role in absorbing atmospheric energy and directing it to the ice of debris-covered glaciers, but the spatial and temporal distribution of these features is not well documented. We analyse 172 Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes for the period 1999-2013 to identify thawed supraglacial ponds for the debris-covered tongues of five glaciers in the Langtang Valley of Nepal. We apply an advanced atmospheric correction routine (Landcor/6S) and use band ratio and image morphological techniques to identify ponds and validate our results with 2.5 m Cartosat-1 observations. We then characterize the spatial, seasonal and interannual patterns of ponds. We find high variability in pond incidence between glaciers (May-October means of 0.08-1.69% of debris area), with ponds most frequent in zones of low surface gradient and velocity. The ponds show pronounced seasonality, appearing in the pre-monsoon as snow melts, peaking at the monsoon onset at 2% of debris-covered area, then declining in the post-monsoon as ponds drain or freeze. Ponds are highly recurrent and persistent, with 40.5% of pond locations occurring for multiple years. Rather than a trend in pond cover over the study period, we find high interannual variability for each glacier after controlling for seasonality.

TI  - Analyses of Recent Sediment Surface Dynamic of a Namibian Kalahari Salt Pan Based on Multitemporal Landsat and Hyperspectral Hyperion Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study combines spaceborne multitemporal and hyperspectral data to analyze the spatial distribution of surface evaporite minerals and changes in a semi-arid depositional environment associated with episodic flooding events, the Omongwa salt pan (Kalahari, Namibia). The dynamic of the surface crust is evaluated by a change-detection approach using the Iterative-reweighted Multivariate Alteration Detection (IR-MAD) based on the Landsat archive imagery from 1984 to 2015. The results show that the salt pan is a highly dynamic and heterogeneous landform. A change gradient is observed from very stable pan border to a highly dynamic central pan. On the basis of hyperspectral EO-1 Hyperion images, the current distribution of surface evaporite minerals is characterized using Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA). Assessment of field and image endmembers revealed that the pan surface can be categorized into three major crust types based on diagnostic absorption features and mineralogical ground truth data. The mineralogical crust types are related to different zones of surface change as well as pan morphology that influences brine flow during the pan inundation and desiccation cycles. These combined information are used to spatially map depositional environments where the more dynamic halite crust concentrates in lower areas although stable gypsum and calcite/sepiolite crusts appear in higher elevated areas.

TI  - Mass budget of the glaciers and ice caps of the Queen Elizabeth Islands, Canada, from 1991 to 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies indicate that the glaciers and ice caps in Queen Elizabeth Islands (QEI), Canada have experienced an increase in ice mass loss during the last two decades, but the contribution of ice dynamics to this loss is not well known. We present a comprehensive mapping of ice velocity using a suite of satellite data from year 1991 to 2015, combined with ice thickness data from NASA Operation IceBridge, to calculate ice discharge. We find that ice discharge increased significantly after 2011 in Prince of Wales Icefield, maintained or decreased in other sectors, whereas glacier surges have little impact on long-term trends in ice discharge. During 1991-2005, the QEI mass loss averaged 6.3 +/- 1.1 Gt yr(-1), 52% from ice discharge and the rest from surface mass balance (SMB). During 2005-2014, the mass loss from ice discharge averaged 3.5 +/- 0.2 Gt yr(-1) (10%) versus 29.6 +/- 3.0 Gt yr(-1) (90%) from SMB. SMB processes therefore dominate the QEI mass balance, with ice dynamics playing a significant role only in a few basins.

This latter worldview, I go on to argue, exercised by the free bourgeois blacks and mulatto elites on the island undermined the revolutionary and independence movement of Haiti, and made it an apartheid state.

TI  - A hurricane wind risk and loss assessment of Caribbean agriculture
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes act as large external shocks potentially causing considerable damage to agriculture in the Caribbean. While a number of studies have estimated their historic economic impact, arguably the wider community and policy makers are more concerned about their future risk and potential losses, since this type of information is useful for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategy and policy. This paper implements a new approach to undertaking a quantitative wind risk and loss assessment of agriculture in Caribbean island economies. The authors construct an expected loss function that uses synthetically generated, and historical, hurricane tracks within a wind field model that takes cropland exposure derived from satellite data into consideration. The results indicate that expected wind losses are potentially large but vary considerably across the region, where the smaller islands are considerably more likely to be negatively impacted. Moreover, we find that the structure of the agricultural sector can be important in terms of vulnerability.

TI  - Beneath the Surface of the World: High-Quality Quartzes, Crystal Cavities, and Neolithization in Circumpolar Europe
T2  - ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quartz was an important and widely used lithic material in the prehistory of circumpolar Eurasia. While ethnographic and other data indicate that quartz has been invested with special qualities and meanings in various cultures around the world, archaeological studies in circumpolar Europe have tended to discuss quartz use in exclusively practical and technological terms. This article takes a "nontechnological" approach to quartz finds from the boreal zone of northeastern Europe. We identify spatiotemporal variations in quartz use and explore how quartzes were perceived and signified in the cultural and cosmological context of Stone Age eastern Fennoscandia, concentrating particularly on what we call "high-quality quartzes." More specifically, we analyze and interpret patterns of quartz use in relation to the Neolithization of northern Eurasia. We discuss our findings against the animistic-shamanistic cosmologies of circumpolar communities and especially in regard to the emerging Neolithic worldview in the north.

TI  - Validation of Spaceborne and Modelled Surface Soil Moisture Products with Cosmic-Ray Neutron Probes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ]The scale difference between point in situ soil moisture measurements and low resolution satellite products limits the quality of any validation efforts in heterogeneous regions. Cosmic Ray Neutron Probes (CRNP) could be an option to fill the scale gap between both systems, as they provide area-average soil moisture within a 150-250 m radius footprint. In this study, we evaluate differences and similarities between CRNP observations, and surface soil moisture products from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the METOP-A/B Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), as well as simulations from the Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2 (GLDAS2). Six CRNPs located on five continents have been selected as test sites: the Rur catchment in Germany, the COSMOS sites in Arizona and California (USA), and Kenya, one CosmOz site in New SouthWales (Australia), and a site in Karnataka (India). Standard validation scores as well as the Triple Collocation (TC) method identified SMAP to provide a high accuracy soil moisture product with low noise or uncertainties as compared to CRNPs. The potential of CRNPs for satellite soil moisture validation has been proven; however, biomass correction methods should be implemented to improve its application in regions with large vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Complications of sentinel lymph node biopsy for melanoma - A systematic review of the literature
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose: The complications reported after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for melanoma is highly variable in the worldwide literature; the overall complication rate varies between 1.8% and 29.9%. With heterogeneous reporting of morbidity data, no 'average' complication rates of this procedure have been reported. This systematic review aims to determine the complications rates associated with SLNB.Methods: A systematic review of English-language literature from 2000 to 2015, which reported morbidity information about SLNB for melanoma, was performed. The methodological quality of the included studies was performed using the methodological index for non-randomised studies (MINORS) instrument and Detsky score. Pooled proportions of specific post-operative complications were constructed using a random effects statistical model, and subgroups including lymph node basin and continent of origin of the study were compared.Results: After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 articles progressed to the final analysis. 9047 patients were included. The overall complication rate was 11.3% (95% CI: 8.1-15.0). The incidence of infection was 2.9% (95% CI 1.5-4.6); seroma 5.1% (95% CI: 2.5-8.6); haematoma 0.5% (95% CI: 0.3-0.9) lymphoedema 1.3% (95% CI: 0.5-2.6) and nerve injury 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.6). There was no statistically significant difference in morbidity between the sites of SLNB or between continents.Discussion: This study provides information about the incidence of complications after SLNB. It can be used to counsel patients about the procedure and it sets a benchmark against which surgeons can audit their practice. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - The June 2016 Australian East Coast Low: Importance of Wave Direction for Coastal Erosion Assessment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In June 2016, an unusual East Coast Low storm affected some 2000 km of the eastern seaboard of Australia bringing heavy rain, strong winds and powerful wave conditions. While wave heights offshore of Sydney were not exceptional, nearshore wave conditions were such that beaches experienced some of the worst erosion in 40 years. Hydrodynamic modelling of wave and current behaviour as well as contemporaneous sand transport shows the east to north-east storm wave direction to be the major determinant of erosion magnitude. This arises because of reduced energy attenuation across the continental shelf and the focussing of wave energy on coastal sections not equilibrated with such wave exposure under the prevailing south-easterly wave climate. Narrabeen-Collaroy, a well-known erosion hot spot on Sydney's Northern Beaches, is shown to be particularly vulnerable to storms from this direction because the destructive erosion potential is amplified by the influence of the local embayment geometry. We demonstrate the magnified erosion response that occurs when there is bi-directionality between an extreme wave event and preceding modal conditions and the importance of considering wave direction in extreme value analyses.

TI  - Feasibility of Robotic-Assisted Laparoendoscopic Single-Site Surgery in the Gynecologic Oncology Setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To assess the feasibility of incorporating robotic laparoendoscopic single-site (R-LESS) surgery into gynecologic oncology care.Design: Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-3).Setting: Academic university hospital.Patients: Patients undergoing R-LESS hysterectomy for gynecologic malignancies, preinvasive disease, or risk reduction performed by a single gynecologic oncologist between 2014 and 2016.Interventions: We incorporated R-LESS as part of standard surgical management for highly selected patients undergoing hysterectomy for common gynecologic oncology indications.Measurements and Main Results: We identified 30 patients undergoing R-LESS hysterectomy meeting study criteria over a 2-year period. Indications for surgery included uterine cancer (n = 13), preinvasive cervical or uterine disease (n = 9), cervical cancer (n = 3), and hereditary gynecologic cancer risk (n = 5). Median patient age was 52 years (range, 35-77), and body mass index was 26 kg/m(2) (range, 19-34). Median uterine size was 8 cm (range, 5.5-11). Eighteen patients had prior abdominal surgery (60%). Twenty-seven patients underwent R-LESS extrafascial hysterectomy, 11 of whom underwent only robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy +/- bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with a median operative time of 140 minutes (range, 115-179). Procedures performed concurrently for the remainder included pelvic sentinel lymph node mapping (n = 14) and pelvic lymphadenectomy (n = 2), with respective median operative times of 175 (range, 150-230) and 233 minutes. One patient with endometrial cancer was converted to multiport robotic surgery to complete a pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy due to high-risk disease on frozen section. Three patients underwent R-LESS radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node mapping, and pelvic lymphadenectomy with a median operative time of 412 minutes (range, 336-451). No perioperative complications were encountered, and all patients were discharged within 24 hours of surgery.Conclusion: In highly selected patients, R-LESS extrafascial and radical hysterectomy is associated with acceptable operative times and perioperative outcomes. With additional experience, surgeons may offer this approach to patients undergoing increasingly complex procedures, even in the gynecologic oncology setting. (C) 2016 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lymphatic invasion and angiotropism in primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - LABORATORY INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Access of melanoma cells to the cutaneous vasculature either via lymphatic invasion or angiotropism is a proposed mechanism for metastasis. Lymphatic invasion is believed to be a mechanism by which melanoma cells can disseminate to regional lymph nodes and to distant sites and may be predictive of adverse outcomes. Although it can be detected on hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections, sensitivity is markedly improved by immunohistochemistry for lymphatic endothelial cells. Multiple studies have reported a significant association between the presence of lymphatic invasion and sentinel lymph node metastasis and survival. More recently, extravascular migratory metastasis has been suggested as another means by which melanoma cells can spread. Angiotropism, the histopathologic correlate of extravascular migratory metastasis, has also been associated with melanoma metastasis and disease recurrence. Although lymphatic invasion and angiotropism are not currently part of routine melanoma reporting, the detection of these attributes using ancillary immunohistochemical stains may be useful in therapeutic planning for patients with melanoma.

TI  - Surge-type glaciers in the Tien Shan (Central Asia)
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surge-type glaciers have been observed in several mountain ranges of the world. Though Karakoram and Pamir are the hot spots for the occurrence of surge-type glaciers in High Mountain Asia, few surge-type glaciers also exist in Tien Shan. These have not been studied or reported in detail in the recent literature. We have identified 39 surge-type glaciers and five tributary surges in Tien Shan either from available literature or by visual interpretation using available images from the period 1960 until 2014. Out of the 39 glaciers, 9 are confirmed as surge-type, 13 are very probably surge-type, and the remaining are possibly of surge-type. Most of the surge-type glaciers are located in Ak-Shiirak and Central Tien Shan. Compared with the normal glaciers of Tien Shan, the surge-type glaciers are larger, cover higher ranges of elevations, and have shallower slopes. There is no significant difference in aspect. The largest surge events were observed in Central Tien Shan: North Inylchek Glacier (years 1996/1997) and Samoilowich Glacier (years 1992 until 2006) advanced several kilometers. The surge cycle was around 50 years for both of these glaciers. The advance was less pronounced for all other surge-type glaciers during the period ca. 1960-2014. Some of the tributary glaciers behaved differently than the main glaciers in the sense that they continuously advanced during the entire period of our study, whereas the main glaciers have remained stable or retreated.

TI  - Dynamics and Predictability of the Intensification of Hurricane Edouard (2014)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics and predictability of the intensification of Hurricane Edouard (2014) are explored through a 60-member convection-permitting ensemble initialized with an ensemble Kalman filter that assimilates dropsondes collected during NASA's Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) investigation. The 126-h forecasts are initialized when Edouard was designated as a tropical depression and include Edouard's near-rapid intensification (RI) from a tropical storm to a strong category-2 hurricane. Although the deterministic forecast was very successful and many members correctly forecasted Edouard's intensification, there was significant spread in the timing of intensification among the members of the ensemble.Utilizing composite groups created according to the near-RI-onset times of the members, it is shown that, for increasing magnitudes of deep-layer shear, RI onset is increasingly delayed; intensification will not occur once a critical shear threshold is exceeded. Although the timing of intensification varies by as much as 48 h, a decrease in shear is observed across the intensifying composite groups similar to 6-12 h prior to RI. This decrease in shear is accompanied by a reduction in vortex tilt, as the precession and subsequent alignment process begins similar to 24-48 h prior to RI. Sensitivity experiments reveal that some of the variation in RI timing can be attributed to differences in initial intensity, as the earliest-developing members have the strongest initial vortices regardless of their environment. Significant sensitivity and limited predictability exists for members with weaker initial vortices and/or that are embedded in less conducive environments, under which the randomness of moist convective processes and minute initial differences distant from the surface center can produce divergent forecasts.

TI  - Leveraging Multi-Sensor Time Series Datasets to Map Short- and Long-Term Tropical Forest Disturbances in the Colombian Andes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of disturbances in Andean tropical forests and protected areas has commonly been calculated using bi or tri-temporal analysis because of persistent cloud cover and complex topography. Long-term trends of vegetative decline (browning) or improvement (greening) have thus not been evaluated despite their importance for assessing conservation strategy implementation in regions where field-based monitoring by environmental authorities is limited. Using Colombia's Cordillera de los Picachos National Natural Park as a case study, we provide a temporally rigorous assessment of regional vegetation change from 2001-2015 with two remote sensing-based approaches using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) algorithm. First, we measured long-term vegetation trends using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) time series, and, second, we mapped short-term disturbances using all available Landsat images. MAIAC-derived trends indicate a net greening in 6% of the park, but in the surrounding 10 km area outside of the park, a net browning trend prevails at 2.5%. We also identified a 12,500 ha area within Picachos (4% of the park's total area) that has shown at least 13 years of consecutive browning, a result that was corroborated with our Landsat-based approach that recorded a 12,642 ha (+/- 1440 ha) area of disturbed forest within the park. Landsat vegetation disturbance results had user's and producer's accuracies of 0.95 +/- 0.02 and 0.83 +/- 0.18, respectively, and 75% of Landsat-detected dates of disturbance events were accurate within +/- 6 months. This study provides new insights into the contribution of short-term disturbance to long-term trends of vegetation change, and offers an unprecedented perspective on the distribution of small-scale disturbances over a 15-year period in one of the most inaccessible national parks in the Andes.

T2  - Harefuah
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the last decade sentinel lymph nodes biopsy has become an essential part of primary surgical treatment in a number of malignancies including breast cancer, melanoma and head-and-neck malignancies. Dye or radioactive substances are injected at the primary tumor site, followed by pre-operative and intra-operative mapping. During surgery only positive lymph nodes are being dissected instead of a complete dissection of the lymphatic basin. The advantages of sentinel lymph nodes dissection are reducing the side effects of extensive lymph nodes dissection, while maintaining high detection rates and sensitivity in identifying cases with lymphatic tumor spread. In the past years, the use of sentinel lymph nodes biopsy has also been incorporated in the treatment of gynecological malignancies. In vulvar cancer, it has been shown that sentinel lymph nodes biopsy is correlated with the same survival and recurrence rates as full groin lymph nodes dissection, while substantially lowering complications and especially morbid lymphedema. Preliminary experience in cervical cancer and carcinoma of the endometrium also displays the feasibility and liability of this method. Yet, there are still several controversies regarding the optimal detection method, site of injection and its oncological safety. In this article we present a review of the current literature on this evolving field.

TI  - Cross-Comparison of Albedo Products for Glacier Surfaces Derived from Airborne and Satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo partitions the amount of energy received by glacier surfaces from shortwave fluxes and modulates the energy available for melt processes. The ice-albedo feedback, influenced by the contamination of bare-ice surfaces with light-absorbing impurities, plays a major role in the melting of mountain glaciers in a warming climate. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal distribution and variability of bare-ice glacier surface albedo under changing conditions. In this study, we focus on two mountain glaciers located in the western Swiss Alps and perform a cross-comparison of different albedo products. We take advantage of high spectral and spatial resolution (284 bands, 2 m) imaging spectrometer data from the Airborne Prism Experiment (APEX) and investigate the applicability and potential of Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data to derive broadband albedo products. The performance of shortwave broadband albedo retrievals is tested and we assess the reliability of published narrow-to-broadband conversion algorithms. The resulting albedo products from the three sensors and different algorithms are further cross-compared. Moreover, the impact of the anisotropy correction is analysed depending on different surface types. While degradation of the spectral resolution impacted glacier-wide mean albedo by about 5%, reducing the spatial resolution resulted in changes of less than 1%. However, in any case, coarser spatial resolution was no longer able to represent small-scale variability of albedo on glacier surfaces. We discuss the implications when using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 to map dynamic glaciological processes and to monitor glacier surface albedo on larger spatial and more frequent temporal scales.

TI  - INTRADAY AND INTERDAY RELIABILITY OF ULTRA-SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN RUGBY UNION PLAYERS
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the intraday and interday reliability of ultra-short-term vagal-related heart rate variability (HRV) in elite rugby union players. Forty players from the Brazilian National Rugby Team volunteered to participate in this study. The natural log of the root mean square of successive RR interval differences (lnRMSSD) assessments were performed on 4 different days. The HRV was assessed twice (intraday reliability) on the first day and once per day on the following 3 days (interday reliability). The RR interval recordings were obtained from 2-minute recordings using a portable heart rate monitor. The relative reliability of intraday and interday lnRMSSD measures was analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The typical error of measurement (absolute reliability) of intraday and interday lnRMSSD assessments was analyzed using the coefficient of variation (CV). Both intraday (ICC = 0.96; CV = 3.99%) and interday (ICC = 0.90; CV = 7.65%) measures were highly reliable. The ultra-short-term lnRMSSD is a consistent measure for evaluating elite rugby union players, in both intraday and interday settings. This study provides further validity to using this shortened method in practical field conditions with highly trained team sports athletes.

TI  - Eight Years' Experience of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Melanoma Using Lymphoscintigraphy and Gamma Probe Detection After Radiocolloid Mapping
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Isosulfan blue dye peripheral injection is used in preoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification alone or, to increase sensitivity, in conjunction with radiocolloid mapping. However, isosulfan blue dye has certain drawbacks and limitations.OBJECTIVE This study assesses the authors' experience of SLN biopsy using only radiocolloid tracer.MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2000 and 2008, 218 patients underwent SLN biopsy with radiocolloid mapping, preoperative localization by lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative confirmation by gamma probe in primary malignant cutaneous melanoma.RESULTS Mean Breslow index was 2.1 mm. The SLN biopsy success rate was above 98% at all sites and 87% in head and neck locations. The 5-year overall survival rate was 90% and that of 5-year disease-free survival was 80%. False-negative rate, with a mean follow-up time of 41 months, was 5.5%.CONCLUSION Sentinel lymph node biopsy can be successfully performed in patients with melanoma using only radiocolloid tracer without blue dye staining. In circumstances where blue dye cannot be used such as head and neck tumors, allergic reactions and pregnancy, radiocolloid tracer mapping alone is not a loss of chance for patients with melanoma.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland maps are a prerequisite for wetland development planning, protection, and restoration. The present study aimed at mapping and monitoring Rwanda's Akagera Complex Wetland by means of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Landsat data, spanning from 1987 to 2015, were acquired from different sensor instruments, considering a 5-year interval during the dry season and the shuttle radar topographic mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (30-m resolution) was used to delineate the wetland. The mapping and delineation results showed that the wetland narrowly extends along the Rwanda-Tanzania border from north to south, following the course of Akagera River and the total area can be estimated at 100,229.76 ha. After waterbodies that occupy 30% of the wetland's surface area, hippo grass and Cyperus papyrus are also predominant, representing 29.8% and 29%, respectively. Floodplain and swamp forest have also been inventoried in smaller proportions. While the wetland extent has apparently remained stable, the inhabiting waterbodies have been subject to enormous instability due to invasive species. Lakes, such as Mihindi, Ihema, Hago and Kivumba have been shrinking in extent, while Lake Rwanyakizinga has experienced a certain degree of expansion. This study represents a consistent decision support tool for Akagera wetland management in Rwanda.

TI  - Windthrow Variability in Central Amazonia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Windthrows are a recurrent disturbance in Amazonia and are an important driver of forest dynamics and carbon storage. In this study, we present for the first time the seasonal and interannual variability of windthrows, focusing on Central Amazonia, and discuss the potential meteorological factors associated with this variability. Landsat images over the 1998-2010 time period were used to detect the occurrence of windthrows, which were identified based on their spectral characteristics and shape. Here, we found that windthrows occurred every year but were more frequent between September and February. Organized convective activity associated with multicell storms embedded in mesoscale convective systems, such as northerly squall lines (that move from northeast to southwest) and southerly squall lines (that move from southwest to northeast) can cause windthrows. We also found that southerly squall lines occurred more frequently than their previously reported similar to 50 year interval. At the interannual scale, we did not find an association between El Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and windthrows.

TI  - Validation of PROBA-V GEOV1 and MODIS C5 & C6 fAPAR Products in a Deciduous Beech Forest Site in Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of new fAPAR satellite products requires simultaneous efforts in validation to provide users with a better comprehension of product performance and evaluation of uncertainties. This study aimed to validate three fAPAR satellite products, GEOV1, MODIS C5, and MODIS C6, against ground references to determine to what extent the GCOS requirements on accuracy (maximum 10% or 5%) can be met in a deciduous beech forest site in a gently and variably sloped mountain site. Three ground reference fAPAR, differing for temporal (continuous or campaign mode) and spatial sampling (single points or Elementary Sampling Units-ESUs), were collected using different devices: (1) Apogee (defined as benchmark in this study); (2) PASTIS; and (3) Digital cameras for collecting hemispherical photographs (DHP). A bottom-up approach for the upscaling process was used in the present study. Radiometric values of decametric images (Landsat-8) were extracted over the ESUs and used to develop empirical transfer functions for upscaling the ground measurements. The resulting high-resolution ground-based maps were aggregated to the spatial resolution of the satellite product to be validated considering the equivalent point spread function of the satellite sensors, and a correlation analysis was performed to accomplish the accuracy assessment. PASTIS sensors showed good performance as fAPAR(PASTIS) appropriately followed the seasonal trends depicted by fAPAR(APOGEE) (benchmark) (R-2 = 0.84; RMSE = 0.01). Despite small dissimilarities, mainly attributed to different sampling schemes and errors in DHP classification process, the agreement between fAPARPASTIS and fAPAR(DHP) was noticeable considering all the differences between both approaches. The temporal courses of the three satellite products were found to be consistent with both Apogee and PASTIS, except at the end of the summer season when ground data were more affected by senescent leaves, with both MODIS C5 and C6 displaying larger short-term variability due to their shorter temporal composite period. MODIS C5 and C6 retrievals were obtained with the backup algorithm in most cases. The three green fAPAR satellite products under study showed good agreement with ground-based maps of canopy fAPAR at 10 h, with RMSE values lower than 0.06, very low systematic differences, and more than 85% of the pixels within GCOS requirements. Among them, GEOV1 fAPAR showed up to 98% of the points lying within the GCOS requirements, and slightly lower values ( mean bias = -0.02) as compared with the ground canopy fAPAR, which is expected to be only slightly higher than green fAPAR in the peak season.

TI  - Relevance analysis and short-term prediction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in Beijing based on multi-source data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The PM2.5 problem is proving to be a major public crisis and is of great public-concern requiring an urgent response. Information about, and prediction of PM2.5 from the perspective of atmospheric dynamic theory is still limited due to the complexity of the formation and development of PM2.5. In this paper, we attempted to realize the relevance analysis and short-term prediction of PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, China, using multi-source data mining. A correlation analysis model of PM2.5 to physical data (meteorological data, including regional average rainfall, daily mean temperature, average relative humidity, average wind speed, maximum wind speed, and other pollutant concentration data, including CO, NO2, SO2, PM10) and social media data (microblog data) was proposed, based on the Multivariate Statistical Analysis method. The study found that during these factors, the value of average wind speed, the concentrations of CO, NO2, PM10, and the daily number of microblog entries with key words 'Beijing; Air pollution' show high mathematical correlation with PM2.5 concentrations. The correlation analysis was further studied based on a big data's machine learning model- Back Propagation Neural Network (hereinafter referred to as BPNN) model. It was found that the BPNN method performs better in correlation mining. Finally, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (hereinafter referred to as ARIMA) Time Series model was applied in this paper to explore the prediction of PM2.5 in the short-term time series. The predicted results were in good agreement with the observed data. This study is useful for helping realize real-time monitoring, analysis and pre-warning of PM2.5 and it also helps to broaden the application of big data and the multi-source data mining methods.

TI  - A regional-scale assessment of Himalayan glacial lake changes using satellite observations from 1990 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalaya, the world's highest mountain ranges, are home to a large group of glaciers and glacial lakes. Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in this region have resulted in catastrophic damages and fatalities in the past decades. The recent warming has caused dramatic glacial lake changes and increased potential GLOF risk in the Himalaya. However, our knowledge on the current state and change of glacial lakes in the entire Himalaya is limited. This study maps the current (2015) distribution of glacial lakes across the entire Himalaya and monitors the spatially-explicit evolution of glacial lakes over five time periods from 1990 to 2015 using a total of 348 Landsat images at 30 m resolution. The results show that 4950 glacial lakes in 2015 cover a total area of 455.3 +/- 72.7 km(2), mainly located between 4000 m and 5700 m above sea level. Himalayan glacial lakes expanded by approximately 14.1% from 1990 to 2015. The changing patterns of supraglacial lakes and proglacial lakes are rather complex, involving both lake disappearance and emergence. Many emergent glacial lakes are found at higher elevations, especially the new proglacial lakes, which have formed as a result of glacier retreat. Spatially heterogeneous changes of Himalayan glacial lakes are observed, with the most significant expansion occurring in the southern slopes of the central Himalaya. Increasing glacier meltwater induced by the Himalayan atmospheric warming is a primary cause for the observed lake expansion. This study provides primary data for future GLOF risk assessments. A total of 118 rapidly expanded glacial lakes are identified as potential vulnerable lakes for the priority of risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

TI  - Compound dislocation models (CDMs) for volcano deformation analyses
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic crises are often preceded and accompanied by volcano deformation caused by magmatic and hydrothermal processes. Fast and efficient model identification and parameter estimation techniques for various sources of deformation are crucial for process understanding, volcano hazard assessment and early warning purposes. As a simple model that can be a basis for rapid inversion techniques, we present a compound dislocation model (CDM) that is composed of three mutually orthogonal rectangular dislocations (RDs). We present new RD solutions, which are free of artefact singularities and that also possess full rotational degrees of freedom. The CDM can represent both planar intrusions in the near field and volumetric sources of inflation and deflation in the far field. Therefore, this source model can be applied to shallow dikes and sills, as well as to deep planar and equidimensional sources of any geometry, including oblate, prolate and other triaxial ellipsoidal shapes. In either case the sources may possess any arbitrary orientation in space. After systematically evaluating the CDM, we apply it to the co-eruptive displacements of the 2015 Calbuco eruption observed by the Sentinel-1A satellite in both ascending and descending orbits. The results show that the deformation source is a deflating vertical lens-shaped source at an approximate depth of 8 km centred beneath Calbuco volcano. The parameters of the optimal source model clearly show that it is significantly different from an isotropic point source or a single dislocation model. The Calbuco example reflects the convenience of using the CDM for a rapid interpretation of deformation data.

TI  - Solar Flare Prediction Model with Three Machine-learning Algorithms using Ultraviolet Brightening and Vector Magnetograms
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a flare prediction model using machine learning, which is optimized to predict the maximum class of flares occurring in the following 24 hr. Machine learning is used to devise algorithms that can learn from and make decisions on a huge amount of data. We used solar observation data during the period 2010-2015, such as vector magnetograms, ultraviolet (UV) emission, and soft X-ray emission taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite. We detected active regions (ARs) from the full-disk magnetogram, from which similar to 60 features were extracted with their time differentials, including magnetic neutral lines, the current helicity, the UV brightening, and the flare history. After standardizing the feature database, we fully shuffled and randomly separated it into two for training and testing. To investigate which algorithm is best for flare prediction, we compared three machine-learning algorithms: the support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and extremely randomized trees. The prediction score, the true skill statistic, was higher than 0.9 with a fully shuffled data set, which is higher than that for human forecasts. It was found that k-NN has the highest performance among the three algorithms. The ranking of the feature importance showed that previous flare activity is most effective, followed by the length of magnetic neutral lines, the unsigned magnetic flux, the area of UV brightening, and the time differentials of features over 24 hr, all of which are strongly correlated with the flux emergence dynamics in an AR.

TI  - Forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Brazilian Cerrado biome
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use, land use change, and forestry accounted for two-thirds of Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions profile in 2005. Amazon deforestation has declined by more than 80% over the past decade, yet Brazil's forests extend beyond the Amazon biome. Rapid expansion of cropland in the neighboring Cerrado biome has the potential to undermine climate mitigation efforts if emissions from dry forest and woodland conversion negate some of the benefits of avoided Amazon deforestation. Here, we used satellite data on cropland expansion, forest cover, and vegetation carbon stocks to estimate annual gross forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Cerrado biome. Nearly half of the Cerrado met Brazil's definition of forest cover in 2000 (>= 0.5 ha with >= 10% canopy cover). In areas of established crop production, conversion of both forest and non-forest Cerrado formations for cropland declined during 2003-2013. However, forest carbon emissions from cropland expansion increased over the past decade in Matopiba, a new frontier of agricultural production that includes portions of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piau, and Bahia states. Gross carbon emissions from cropland expansion in the Cerrado averaged 16.28 Tg C yr(-1) between 2003 and 2013, with forest-to-cropland conversion accounting for 29% of emissions. The fraction of forest carbon emissions from Matopiba was much higher; between 2010-2013, large-scale cropland conversion in Matopiba contributed 45% of total Cerrado forest carbon emissions. Carbon emissions from Cerrado-to-cropland transitions offset 5%-7% of the avoided emissions from reduced Amazon deforestation rates during 2011-2013. Comprehensive national estimates of forest carbon fluxes, including all biomes, are critical to detect cross-biome leakage within countries and achieve climate mitigation targets to reduce emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry.

TI  - Glacier Monitoring and Capacity Building: Important Ingredients for Sustainable Mountain Development
T2  - MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier observation data from major mountain regions of the world are key to improving our understanding of glacier changes: they deliver fundamental baseline information for climatological, hydrological, and hazard assessments. In many mountain ecosystems, as well as in the adjacent lowlands, glaciers play a crucial role in freshwater provision and regulation. This article first presents the state of the art on glacier monitoring and related strategies within the framework of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G). Both in situ measurements of changes in glacier mass, volume, and length as well as remotely sensed data on glacier extents and changes over entire mountain ranges provide clear indications of climate change. Based on experiences from capacity-building activities undertaken in the Tropical Andes and Central Asia over the past years, we also review the state of the art on institutional capacity in these regions and make further recommendations for sustainable mountain development. The examples from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Kyrgyzstan demonstrate that a sound understanding of measurement techniques and of the purpose of measurements is necessary for successful glacier monitoring. In addition, establishing durable institutions, capacity-building programs, and related funding is necessary to ensure that glacier monitoring is sustainable and maintained in the long term. Therefore, strengthening regional cooperation, collaborating with local scientists and institutions, and enhancing knowledge sharing and dialogue are envisaged within the GTN-G. Finally, glacier monitoring enhances the resilience of the populations that depend on water resources from glacierized mountains or that are affected by hazards related to glacier changes. We therefore suggest that glacier monitoring be included in the development of sustainable adaptation strategies in regions with glaciated mountains.

TI  - Axillary nodal prognostic impact of two-dimensional tumor heterogeneity flux in breast cancer: evaluation via dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer remains to have a high mortality toll in women worldwide. Several studies indicate benefit in identifying axillary nodal involvement towards effective patient risk stratification and treatment. Tumor heterogeneity recently emerged as a key factor impacting clinical outcomes. Voxel intensity gradient (VIG), a measure of contrast amongst radiological features of heterogeneity, harbors significance in determining intra-tumoral properties. Our project aims to apply the divergence theorem in correlating the 2-dimensional (2D) surface flux of this quantity to extra-tumoral axillary nodal involvement.Methods: A retrospective cohort of 47 patients with early stage breast cancer following surgery was accrued. Pathology information and preoperative dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) sequences were acquired. Tumor volumes were contoured and exported in slices for digital delineation, filtration, and computation. VIG and VIG divergence were approximated at every tumor pixel and divergence structurally summed. This measure of flux was normalized to tumor volume. Statistical analysis utilized Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients with leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation.Results: Among the 47 patients analyzed, 33 had T1 tumors with size (1.02 +/- 0.48 cm) and 14 had T2 tumors (3.10 +/- 0.86 cm). Normalized heterogeneity flux demonstrated significant correlation with axillary nodal ratio of positive to number collected: for non-sentinel ratio r= 0.57 (P= 0.001), and total node ratio r= 0.50 (P< 0.001). In nodal-positive patients r= 0.72 (P= 0.001) and r= 0.58 (P= 0.002), respectively. All mean squared errors were < 0.05.Conclusions: In quantifying heterogeneity departing the surface, flux mechanistically exhibited correlation with axillary nodal involvement. This correlation is optimally displayed in patients with nodal positivity. This novel radiological variable capable of characterizing tumor environment may be incorporated into future prognostic indices (nomograms) aimed at helping clinicians with axillary risk assessment.

TI  - Sentinel Surveillance for Expedited Partner Therapy Prescriptions Using Pharmacy Data, in 2 New York City Neighborhoods, 2015
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Expedited partner therapy (EPT) for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the practice of providing Ct-infected patients with medication, or prescription (prescription-EPT) to deliver to their sex partners without first examining those partners. New York City (NYC) providers commonly use prescription-EPT, yet NYC pharmacists report only occasional receipt of EPT prescriptions. This project assessed the frequency of EPT prescriptions filled in 2 NYC neighborhoods.Methods: The 2 NYC facilities reporting the most frequent use of prescription-EPTwere identified from Ct provider case reports and contacted to ascertain their EPT practices. Providers at the first facility (facility 1) prescribed two 1-g doses of azithromycin, including sex partner treatment on the index patient's electronic prescription. Providers at the second facility (facility 2) gave patients paper prescriptions for sex partners. We reviewed prescriptions filled in 2015 for azithromycin, 1 or 2 g at pharmacies near these facilities; prescriptions indicating partner therapy were classified "EPT prescriptions".Results: Facility 1 providers submitted 112 Ct case reports indicating prescription-EPT, compared with 114 submitted by facility 2 providers. Twelve of 26 identified pharmacies agreed to participate. At 7 pharmacies near facility 1, we found 61 EPT prescriptions from facility 1 and 37 from other facilities. At 5 pharmacies near facility 2, we found only 1 EPT prescription from facility 2 and 3 from other facilities.Conclusions: Expedited partner therapy prescriptions were received in NYC pharmacies near to EPT-prescribing facilities, but with great variability and at a lower frequency than suggested by provider case reports. Provider EPT prescribing practices may impact the likelihood that partners receive medication and should be further evaluated.

AB  - Background: Suprascapular nerve block is performed in the management of chronic shoulder pain and frozen shoulder.Objective: To investigate the effects of ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve block in restoration of shoulder motion in breast cancer survivors.Study Design: A cohort study.Setting: A training and research hospital, outpatient setting.Methods: A total of 18 breast cancer survivors with limited shoulder motion, pain, and difficulty in positioning the upper extremity for radiation treatment following surgery were enrolled in this study. Ultrasound-guided suprascapular nerve blocks were performed while the patients were seated in a chair without a backrest. After visualization of the suprascapular nerve under the transverse suprascapular ligament, 20 mg of triamcinolone and 4 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine were injected. Shoulder range of motion, pain, disability, and upper extremity circumference measurements were assessed in all participants before and 10 days after the block.Results: A significant decrease was observed in severity of pain and disability 10 days after the block. The ranges of shoulder abduction, flexion, and external rotation were improved significantly. All patients were able to receive radiation therapy without delay.Limitations: Absence of a control group and absence of randomization reduces the strength of our findings. Small sample size and absence of long-term follow-up are other limitations of this study.Conclusions: This is the first study investigating the effect of ultrasound-guided suprascapular block on shoulder limitation in breast cancer survivors. The results demonstrate that it may be a promising treatment approach for rapid recovery of shoulder motion in women with breast cancer before radiation treatment.

TI  - Mapping Seasonal Inundation Frequency (1985-2016) along the St-John River, New Brunswick, Canada using the Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme flood events in recent years in Canada have highlighted the need for historical information to better manage future flood risk. In this paper, a methodology to generate flood maps from Landsat to determine historical inundation frequency is presented for a region along the St-John River, New Brunswick, Canada that experiences annual springtime flooding from snowmelt and river ice. 1985-2016 Landsat data from the USGS archive were classified by combining See5 decision trees to map spectrally variable water due to spring ice and sediment, and image thresholding to map inundated floodplains. Multiple scenes representing each year were overlaid to produce seasonal time-series of spring (March-May) and summer (June-August) maximum annual water extents. Comparisons of annual surface water maps were conducted separately for each season against historical hydrometric water depth as a measure of relative springtime flood severity, and 1 m water masks from digital orthophotos were used to perform a formal accuracy assessment of summer water. Due to Landsat's 16-day revisit time, peak flood depth was poorly related to flood extent; however, spring depth measured during Landsat acquisitions was significantly related to extent (tau = 0.6, p-value < 0.001). Further, summer maps validated against 30 m water fractions scaled from 1 m water masks were over 97% accurate. Limitations with respect to the assessment of flood extent from depth, timing differences between peak flood depth and extent due to Landsat revisit time and cloud cover, and suggestions to overcome limitations through multi-sensor integration including radar are discussed.

AB  - Biomass burning is a major global source of fine primary carbonaceous particles including strongly light absorbing compounds and marker compounds. In a prior study, particulate matter (PM) sampling was conducted during 2010-2012 period at sites in Rajshahi, Dhaka, Khulna, and Chittagong. PM samples were collected using dichotomous samplers in the PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 size fractions. The samples were analyzed for mass, black carbon at 370 nm (UVBC) and 880 nm (BC), Delta-C (UVBC-BC), and elemental compositions with X-ray fluorescence. Source apportionment using PMF was performed to identify and quantify the PM sources. Results showed that biomass burning contributions during winters in Rajshahi were substantially higher than in Dhaka, Khulna, or Chittagong. Agricultural burning areas of the Indo-Gangetic Plain were hypnotized as the primary source region. The present study explores the relationships between the source regions using trajectory ensemble models and determines if transported biomass PM has disproportionately affected air quality in Rajshahi. The probable source locations that were identified included Pakistan, northern India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Northeastern India, and Myanmar. To assess the model results, satellite measurements of fire radiative power (FRP) were calculated based on fire data acquired by the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor in six defined areas. High fire occurrences from MODIS coincident with the source regions identified in Nepal, Northeastern India and Myanmar in winter. The instantaneous FRP values ranged between 4.4 MW and 2449 MW. The mean winter FRP values for Nepal and Northeastern India were higher than for the other regions with Nepal having the overall highest value. Fire locations with their mean power, NASA Satellite pictures and particles speed along trajectories have been analyzed. In summary, the integrated outcome of the different techniques has identified Northern India and Nepal as the main source area responsible for the increased biomass burning concentration difference at Rajshahi.

TI  - The sentinel behaviour of Arabian babbler floaters
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel behaviour of 38 Arabian babbler adult floaters, who lived alone within a territory belonging to a foreign group, was studied and compared with their own sentinel behaviour in the past, when they were group members. All floaters acted as sentinels and uttered 'alarm calls'. This suggests that sentinel activity is due at least, in part, to selfish motives. Floaters sentinelled less than they did as group members, with the decrease in sentinel activity sharper for ex-dominants than for ex-subordinates. One possible explanation for these differences is that sentinel activity is aimed not only at detecting predators, but also at detecting foreign conspecifics. Within a group, the latter incentive is stronger for breeding dominants than for subordinates, whereas all floaters alike may be trying to detect the owners of the territory in which they were roaming but also to avoid being detected by them. Other possible explanations are that floaters have less time and energy for sentinel activity because they are weaker or because foraging is more difficult in a foreign territory. This may be especially so for dominants who used to enjoy privileged access to food in their group. No significant difference was found in the rate of sentinels' 'alarm calls' between floaters and group members, suggesting that their main purpose is predator-prey communication, of which warning groupmates may be a side benefit.

TI  - Warming trends of perialpine lakes from homogenised time series of historical satellite and <i>in</i>-<i>situ</i> data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of more than thirty years of historical satellite data is a valuable source which could be used as an alternative to the sparse in-situ data. We developed a new homogenised time series of daily day time Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) over the last thirty years (1986-2015) at a spatial resolution of 1 km from thirteen polar orbiting satellites. The new homogenisation procedure implemented in this study corrects for the different acquisition times of the satellites standardizing the derived LSWT to 12:00 UTC. In this study, we developed new time series of LSWT for five large lakes in Italy and evaluated the product with in-situ data from the respective lakes. Furthermore, we estimated the long-term annual and summer trends, the temporal coherence of mean LSWT between the lakes, and studied the intra-annual variations and long-term trends from the newly developed LSWT time series. We found a regional warming trend at a rate of 0.017 degrees C yr(-1) annually and 0.032 degrees C yr(-1) during summer. Mean annual and summer LSWT temporal in these lakes were found to be highly coherent. Amidst the reported rapid warming of lakes globally, it is important to understand the long-term variations of surface temperature at a regional scale. This study contributes a new method to derive long-term accurate LSWT for lakes with sparse in-situ data thereby facilitating understanding of regional level changes in lake's surface temperature.

TI  - C/EBP homologous protein promotes NSAID-activated gene 1-linked pro-inflammatory signals and enterocyte invasion by enteropathogenic <i>Escherichia coli</i>
T2  - MICROBES AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - NSAID-activated Gene 1 (NAG-1) is a prognostic indicator of chronic inflammatory diseases and aggressive tumors. Among the stress sentinels in response to infection by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) or other pathogenic E. coli, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), a representative stress-regulated transcription factor, was prominently increased and assessed for its involvement in NAG-1-mediated pathogenic cellular responses. NAG-1 expression was transcriptionally upregulated by CHOP, which promoted chemokine production through sustained NF-KB activation. Mechanistically, NF-kappa B activation by NAG-1 was due to TGF beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK-1)-mediated pathway rather than SMAD-associated signals. Moreover, CHOP and subsequent TAK-1-linked signals were also involved in bacterial invasion into human cells. Therefore, CHOP as an infection-induced sentinel played crucial roles in induction of NAG-1 and subsequent prolonged activation of pro-inflammatory responses to EPEC infection or related chronic pathogenic states.

TI  - Feasibility and Prognostic Effect of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Cytology-Proven, Node-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - There was no difference in the OS and in the RRFS between SLNB and ALND groups. SLNB may be feasible after NAC for cytology-proven, node-positive breast cancer. SLNB after NAC may help reduce surgical morbidity by avoiding the need for ALND in some patients.Background: We evaluated the feasibility and prognostic effect in axillary recurrence or survival of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with cytology-proven, node-positive breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: This is a retrospective study of 329 patients who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and axillary lymph nodes (ALN) metastasis and treated with NAC followed by curative surgery at Samsung Medical Center between January 2007 and December 2013. We analyzed and compared outcomes including prognoses and survival rates among all groups. Results: The median age at the time of surgery was 44.4 years. The median follow-up time was 37 months (range, 1-91 months). The sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate was 96.7% (117 of 121 patients). The median number of retrieved SLNs was 4.0 (range, 1-7), and 57 patients had negative SLNs on frozensection analysis. The false negative rate of SLNB after NAC was 7.8% (5 of 64 patients). In survival analysis, there was no difference in the overall survival (P = .2) and the regional recurrence-free survival (P = .297) among Groups 1, 2, and 4. Conclusion: SLNB may be feasible after NAC for node-positive breast cancer and may help reduce surgical morbidity by avoiding the need for standard axillary lymph node dissection in some patients. We suggest that future studies with a large number of patients and a longer follow-up period are necessary to support the use of SLN surgery as an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection in this patient population.

AB  - A 49-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the dermatology clinic for follow-up of malignant melanoma with a complaint of painless gross hematuria. Two years prior she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma from a skin lesion on her left flank treated with wide excision, negative axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy, and adjuvant radiotherapy. Subsequently, she had no evidence of disease until urologic evaluation of her hematuria revealed two lesions in her bladder and cytopathology demonstrated findings consistent with malignant melanoma. We review literature on melanoma metastatic to the bladder and discuss the potential role of metastasectomy and other treatment strategies in such rare cases.

T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Methylene blue is more widely available and less expensive than patent blue, with an apparently lower risk of anaphylaxis.Objective: The two dyes were compared regarding detection of the sentinel lymph node (SLN).Method: A prospective, randomized trial involved 142 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Sixty-nine (49.3%) assigned to patent blue (group A) and 71 (50.70%) to methylene blue (group B). Thirty-five patients (25.0%) were clinical stage III or IV; 55 (38.7%) had axillary lymph nodes affected; and 69 (49.3%) underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients were excluded because the dye type was not recorded.Results: Patients and tumor characteristics were similar in both groups. SLNs were identified in 47 women (68.1%) in group A and 43 (60.6%) in group B (p= 0.35). SLNs were affected in 22 cases (51.2%) in group A and 21 (48.8%) in group B (p= 0.62). The SLN was the only node affected in 12 cases (54.5%) in group A and six (33.3%) in group B (p= 0.18). The time and degree of difficulty involved in identifying the SLN were similar in both groups. There were no complications or allergies.Conclusion: Methylene blue performed as well as patent blue in identifying the SLN in breast cancer patients.

TI  - Staying cool in the compact city: Vacant land and urban heating in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes socio-spatial patterns in land surface temperature (LST) and vacant land across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a city with an estimated 30,000-40,000 vacant lots and a history of increased mortality associated with extreme heat events. Urban sustainability planning efforts typically encourage a compact city to improve quality of life and reduce sprawl, yet these same characteristics contribute to surface heating and the urban heat island effect (UHI). City officials often aim to redevelop vacant lots into conventional, tax-generating uses (e.g. commercial, industrial, or residential development), but few studies consider the role of vacant land in urban heating. This study employs LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) metrics derived from Landsat 8 imagery acquired on August 7, 2014, data on imperviousness from the 2011 National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD), vacant parcels from the City of Philadelphia, and socioeconomic data on median household income and minority populations from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013 5-year estimates at the Census Block Group level. The results of this study indicate that neighborhoods with low socio-economic status are hotter and have more vacant lots than their wealthier counterparts. This study points towards the potential of green conversions of vacant lots for mitigating inequities in urban heating in the most socially and economically vulnerable neighborhoods across the city.

TI  - Blue dye for identification of sentinel nodes in breast cancer and malignant melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The combined technique (radioisotope and blue dye) is the gold standard for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and there is wide variation in techniques and blue dyes used. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the need for radioisotope and the optimal blue dye for SLNB. A total of 21 studies were included. The SLNB identification rates are high with all the commonly used blue dyes. Furthermore, methylene blue is superior to iso-sulfan blue and Patent Blue V with respect to false-negative rates. The combined technique remains the most accurate and effective technique for SLNB. In order to standardize the SLNB technique, comparative trials to determine the most effective blue dye and national guidelines are required.

TI  - Mapping and detection of land use change in a coal mining area using object-based image analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Object-based image analysis was used to map land use in the Panxie coal mining area, East China, where long-term underground coal mines have been exploited since the 1980s. A rule-based classification approach was developed for a Pleiades image to identify the desired land use classes, and the same rule-based classification strategies, after the threshold values had been modified slightly, were applied to the Landsat series images. Five land use classes were successfully captured with overall accuracies of between 80 and 94%. The classification approach was validated for its flexibility and robustness. Multitemporal classification results indicated that land use changed considerably in the Panxie coal mining area from 1989 to 2013. The urban, coal and coal gangue, and water areas increased rapidly in line with the growth in mine production. Urban areas increased from 9.38 to 20.92% and showed a tendency to increase around the coal mines. From 1989 to 2013 the coal and coal gangue area increased by 40-fold, from 0.02 to 0.58%. Similarly, the water area increased from 2.77 to 7.84% over this time period, mainly attributable to the spread of waterlogged areas. The waterlogged areas increased to about 2900 ha in 2013, which was about 80 times more than their area in 1989. In contrast, the area of cultivated land was negatively related to the increase in mine production and decreased from 73.11 to 57.25%. The results of this study provide a valuable basis for sustainable land management and environmental planning in the Panxie coal mining area.

TI  - Effect of Training Class Label Noise on Classification Performances for Land Cover Mapping with Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised classification systems used for land cover mapping require accurate reference databases. These reference data come generally from different sources such as field measurements, thematic maps, or aerial photographs. Due to misregistration, update delay, or land cover complexity, they may contain class label noise, i.e., a wrong label assignment. This study aims at evaluating the impact of mislabeled training data on classification performances for land cover mapping. Particularly, it addresses the random and systematic label noise problem for the classification of high resolution satellite image time series. Experiments are carried out on synthetic and real datasets with two traditional classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). A synthetic dataset has been designed for this study, simulating vegetation profiles over one year. The real dataset is composed of Landsat-8 and SPOT-4 images acquired during one year in the south of France. The results show that both classifiers are little influenced for low random noise levels up to 25%-30%, but their performances drop down for higher noise levels. Different classification configurations are tested by increasing the number of classes, using different input feature vectors, and changing the number of training instances. Algorithm complexities are also analyzed. The RF classifier achieves high robustness to random and systematic label noise for all the tested configurations; whereas the SVM classifier is more sensitive to the kernel choice and to the input feature vectors. Finally, this work reveals that the cross-validation procedure is impacted by the presence of class label noise.

TI  - Forest Connectivity Regions of Canada Using Circuit Theory and Image Analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological processes are increasingly well understood over smaller areas, yet information regarding interconnections and the hierarchical nature of ecosystems remains less studied and understood. Information on connectivity over large areas with high resolution source information provides for both local detail and regional context. The emerging capacity to apply circuit theory to create maps of omnidirectional connectivity provides an opportunity for improved and quantitative depictions of forest connectivity, supporting the formation and testing of hypotheses about the density of animal movement, ecosystem structure, and related links to natural and anthropogenic forces. In this research, our goal was to delineate regions where connectivity regimes are similar across the boreal region of Canada using new quantitative analyses for characterizing connectivity over large areas (e.g., millions of hectares). Utilizing the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development of forests (EOSD) circa 2000 Landsat-derived land-cover map, we created and analyzed a national-scale map of omnidirectional forest connectivity at 25m resolution over 10000 tiles of 625 km(2) each, spanning the forested regions of Canada. Using image recognition software to detect corridors, pinch points, and barriers to movements at multiple spatial scales in each tile, we developed a simple measure of the structural complexity of connectivity patterns in omnidirectional connectivity maps. We then mapped the Circuitscape resistance distance measure and used it in conjunction with the complexity data to study connectivity characteristics in each forested ecozone. Ecozone boundaries masked substantial systematic patterns in connectivity characteristics that are uncovered using a new classification of connectivity patterns that revealed six clear groups of forest connectivity patterns found in Canada. The resulting maps allow exploration of omnidirectional forest connectivity patterns at full resolution while permitting quantitative analyses of connectivity over broad areas, informing modeling, planning and monitoring efforts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal estimation of air temperature patterns at the street level using high resolution satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although meteorological monitoring stations provide accurate measurements of Air Temperature (AT), their spatial coverage within a given region is limited and thus is often insufficient for exposure and epidemiological studies. In many applications, satellite imagery measures energy flux, which is spatially continuous, and calculates Brightness Temperature (BT) that used as an input parameter. Although both quantities (AT-BT) are physically related, the correlation between them is not straightforward, and varies daily due to parameters such as meteorological conditions, surface moisture, land use, satellite-surface geometry and others. In this paper we first investigate the relationship between AT and BT as measured by 39 meteorological stations in Israel during 1984-2015. Thereafter, we apply mixed regression models with daily random slopes to calibrate Landsat BT data with monitored AT measurements for the period 1984-2015. Results show that AT can be predicted with high accuracy by using BT with high spatial resolution. The model shows relatively high accuracy estimation of AT (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 1.58 degrees C, slope = 0.90). Incorporating meteorological parameters into-the model generates better accuracy (R-2 = 0.935) than the AT-BT model (R-2 = 0.92). Furthermore, based on the relatively high model accuracy, we investigated the spatial patterns of AT within the study domain. In the latter we focused on July-August, as these two months are characterized by relativity stable synoptic conditions in the study area. In addition, a temporal change in AT during the last 30 years was estimated and verified using available meteorological stations and two additional remote sensing platforms. Finally, the impact of different land coverage on AT were estimated, as an example of future application of the presented approach. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - West Nile virus 'circulation' in Vojvodina, Serbia: Mosquito, bird, horse and human surveillance
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR PROBES
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to detect West Nile virus (WNV) in the Vojvodina province, northern Serbia, commenced with human and mosquito surveillance in 2005, followed by horse (2009) and wild bird (2012) surveillance. The knowledge obtained regarding WNV circulation, combined with the need for timely detection of virus activity and risk assessment resulted in the implementation of a national surveillance programme integrating mosquito, horse and bird surveillance in 2014. From 2013, the system showed highly satisfactory results in terms of area specificity (the capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for human cases of West Nile neuroinvasive disease - WNND) and sensitivity to detect virus circulation even at the enzootic level. A small number (n = 50) of Culex pipiens (pipiens and molestus biotypes, and their hybrids) females analysed per trap/night, combined with a high number of specimens in the sample, provided variable results in the early detection capacity at different administrative levels (NUTS2 versus NUTS3). The clustering of infected mosquitoes, horses, birds and human cases of WNND in 2014-2015 was highly significant, following the south-west to north-east direction in Vojvodina (NUTS2 administrative level). Human WNND cases grouped closest with infected mosquitoes in 2014, and with wild birds/mosquitoes in 2015. In 2014, sentinel horses showed better spatial correspondence with human WNND cases than sentinel chickens. Strong correlations were observed between the vector index values and the incidence of human WNND cases recorded at the NUTS2 and NUTS3 levels. From 2010, West Nile virus was detected in mosquitoes sampled at 43 different trap stations across Vojvodina. At 14 stations (32.56%), WNV was detected in two different (consecutive or alternate) years, at 2 stations in 3 different years, and in 1 station during 5 different years. Based on these results, integrated surveillance will be progressively improved to allow evidence-based adoption of preventive public health and mosquito control measures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ideological dilemmas of female populist radical right politicians
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF WOMENS STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Radical right political parties are usually heavily male-dominated; accordingly, previous research has concentrated on the perspective of men. The present study aims to enhance the understanding of the worldview of women within radical right parties. Taking a critical discursive psychological approach, the study looks at how female populist radical right politicians in Sweden and Finland discursively negotiate the tension between the Nordic societal norm of gender equality, on the one hand, and the patriarchal ideology of populist radical right parties, on the other. The analysis suggests that the female populist radical right politicians' discourse is indeed highly ambivalent. The discursive tension between gender equality and a patriarchal politics is heavily intertwined with two further tensions: first, that of a societal norm against prejudice versus a politics based on xenophobia; and second, that of a culture that cherishes individualism versus a political pressure to homogenize the political or cultural Other'. The study compares the discourse of female populist radical right politicians in the two country contexts. Moreover, it discusses the differences and similarities between this discourse, on the one hand, and that of male populist radical right politicians, on the other. Finally, it analyses the gendered and racialized categorizations accomplished by the discursive patterns, and elaborates on their societal implications.

TI  - Topographic Correction of Landsat TM-5 and Landsat OLI-8 Imagery to Improve the Performance of Forest Classification in the Mountainous Terrain of Northeast Thailand
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate mapping and monitoring of forests is essential for the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Advancements in the Landsat satellite series have been very useful for various forest mapping applications. However, the topographic shadows of irregular mountains are major obstacles to accurate forest classification. In this paper, we test five topographic correction methods: improved cosine correction, Minnaert, C-correction, Statistical Empirical Correction (SEC) and Variable Empirical Coefficient Algorithm (VECA), with multisource digital elevation models (DEM) to reduce the topographic relief effect in mountainous terrain produced by the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)-5 and Operational Land Imager (OLI)-8 sensors. The effectiveness of the topographic correction methods are assessed by visual interpretation and the reduction in standard deviation (SD), by means of the coefficient of variation (CV). Results show that the SEC performs best with the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30 m x 30 m DEM. The random forest (RF) classifier is used for forest classification, and the overall accuracy of forest classification is evaluated to compare the performances of the topographic corrections. Our results show that the C-correction, SEC and VECA corrected imagery were able to improve the forest classification accuracy of Landsat TM-5 from 78.41% to 81.50%, 82.38%, and 81.50%, respectively, and OLI-8 from 81.06% to 81.50%, 82.38%, and 81.94%, respectively. The highest accuracy of forest type classification is obtained with the newly available high-resolution SRTM DEM and SEC method.

TI  - Assimilation of optical and radar remote sensing data in 3D mapping of soil properties over large areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is very important for many land functions. To achieve sustainability it is important to understand how soils vary over space in the landscape. Remote sensing data can be instrumental in mapping and spatial modelling of soil properties, resources and their variability.The aims of this study were to compare satellite sensors (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2) with varying spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions for Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) of a set of soil properties in Scotland, evaluate the potential benefits of adding Sentinel-1 data to DSM models, select the most suited mix of sensors for DSM to map the considered set of soil properties and validate the results of topsoil (2D) and whole profile (3D) models.The results showed that the use of a mixture of sensors proved more effective to model and map soil properties than single sensors. The use of radar Sentinel-1 data proved useful for all soil properties, improving the prediction capability of models with only optical bands. The use of MODIS time series provided stronger relationships than the use of temporal snapshots. The results showed good validation statistics with a RMSE below 20% of the range for all considered soil properties. The RMSE improved from previous studies including only MODIS sensor and using a coarser prediction grid. The performance of the models was similar to previous studies at regional, national or continental scale. A mix of optical and radar data proved useful to map soil properties along the profile.The produced maps of soil properties describing both lateral and vertical variability, with associated uncertainty, are important for further modelling and management of soil resources and ecosystem services. Coupled with further data the soil properties maps could be used to assess soil functions and therefore conditions and suitability of soils for a range of purposes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Englacial latent-heat transfer has limited influence on seaward ice flux in western Greenland
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater can refreeze within firn layers and crevasses to warm ice through laten-theat transfer on decadal to millennial timescales. Earlier work posited that the consequent softening of the ice might accelerate ice flow, potentially increasing ice-sheet mass loss. Here, we calculate the effect of meltwater refreezing on ice temperature and softness in the P (a) over cap ktsoq (near Swiss Camp) and Jakobshavn Isbr ae regions of western Greenland using a numeric model and existing borehole measurements. We show that in the Jakobshavn catchment, meltwater percolation within the firn warms the ice at depth by 3-5 degrees C. By contrast, meltwater refreezing in crevasses (cryo-hydrologic warming) at depths of similar to 300 m warms the ice in P (a) over cap kitsoq by up to 10 degrees C, but this causes minimal increase in ice motion (< 10 ma(-1)). P<(a)over cap>kitsoq is representative of western Greenland's land-terminating ice, where the slow movement of ice through a wide ablation zone provides ideal conditions for cryo-hydrologic warming to occur. We find that only similar to 37% of the western Greenland ice flux, however, travels through such areas. Overall, our findings suggest that cryo-hydrologic warming will likely have only a limited effect on the dynamic evolution of the Greenland ice sheet.

TI  - Primary cutaneous adenoid cystic carcinoma with <i>MYB</i> aberrations: report of three cases and comprehensive review of the literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a relatively rare slow-growing and often-aggressive epithelial-myoepithelial neoplasm that arises in multiple organs including the skin. The t(6;9) (q22-23;p23-24) translocation, resulting in a MYB-NFIB gene fusion has been found in ACCs from the salivary glands and other organs. Recently, MYB aberrations occurring in a subset (40%) of primary cutaneous ACC (PCACC) examples was described. Herein, we report three additional cases of PCACC harboring MYB aberrations. The tumors presented in three males aged 43, 81 and 55years old and affected the extremities in the first two patients and the scalp in the third one. None of the patients had history of prior or concurrent ACC elsewhere. Lesions exhibited the classic ACC morphology of nests of basaloid cells arranged in cribriform and adenoid patterns. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in two cases with one case showing lymph node positivity. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with break-apart probes for MYB and NFIB loci revealed that two cases showed MYB rearrangements while one case showed loss of one MYB signal. None of the cases showed NFIB rearrangements. We contribute with three additional cases of PCACC exhibiting MYB aberrations, the apparent driving genetic abnormality in these tumors.

TI  - Mapping seagrass coverage and spatial patterns with high spatial resolution IKONOS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass habitats in subtidal coastal waters provide a variety of ecosystem functions and services and there is an increasing need to acquire information on spatial and temporal dynamics of this resource. Here, we explored the capability of IKONOS (IKO) data of high resolution (4m) for mapping seagrass cover [submerged aquatic vegetation (%SAV) cover] along the mid-western coast of Florida, USA. We also compared seagrass maps produced with IKO data with that obtained using the Landsat TM sensor with lower resolution (30m). Both IKO and TM data, collected in October 2009, were preprocessed to calculate water depth invariant bands to normalize the effect of varying depth on bottom spectra recorded by the two satellite sensors and further the textural information was extracted from IKO data. Our results demonstrate that the high resolution IKO sensor produced a higher accuracy than the TM sensor in a three-class % SAV cover classification. Of note is that the OA of %SAV cover mapping at our study area created with IKO data was 5-20% higher than that from other studies published. We also examined the spatial distribution of seagrass over a spatial range of 4-240 m using the Ripley's K function [L(d)] and IKO data that represented four different grain sizes [4 m (one IKO pixel), 8 m (2 x 2 IKO pixels), 12 m (3 x 3 IKO pixels), and 16 m (4 x 4 IKO pixels)] from moderate-dense seagrass cover along a set of six transects. The Ripley's K metric repeatedly indicated that seagrass cover representing 4m x 4m pixels displayed a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern over distances of <4-8 m, and a random or slightly clustered pattern of cover over 9-240m. The spatial pattern of seagrass cover created with the three additional grain sizes (i.e., 2 x 24m IKO pixels, 3 x 34m IKO pixels, and 4 x 4m IKO pixels) show a dispersed (or slightly dispersed) pattern across 4-32 m and a random or slightly clustered pattern across 33-240m. Given the first report on using satellite observations to quantify seagrass spatial patterns at a spatial scale from 4m to 240m, our novel analyses of moderate-dense SAV cover utilizing Ripley's K function illustrate how data obtained from the IKO sensor revealed seagrass spatial information that would be undetected by the TM sensor with a 30 m pixel size. Use of the seagrass classification scheme here, along with data from the IKO sensor with enhanced resolution, offers an opportunity to synoptically record seagrass cover dynamics at both small and large spatial scales.(C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Objective decision making between conventional and oncoplastic breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy: An aesthetic and functional prospective cohort study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is considered the standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, fair to poor cosmetic outcomes following conventional BCS have been observed in as many as one-third of cases. The aim of this study was to determine the critical tumor-to-breast volume ratio for each quadrant of the breast beyond which conventional BCS would no longer offer acceptable cosmetic and functional results or satisfactory quality of life for the patient.Methods: A prospective cohort study was performed between December 2011 and December 2013 involving 350 patients younger than 70 years with early-stage unifocal (T <= 30 mm) breast cancer who underwent wide excision and axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by whole breast irradiation. Using validated panels and software (the Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome Scale [BCTOS], EORTC Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire number C30-BR23, and Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment cosmetic results [BCCT.core] software), quality of life and aesthetic and functional parameters and their changes in correlation to the percentage of breast volume excised were statistically analyzed.Results: The maximum percentages of breast volume that were resectable by conventional BCS without resulting in unacceptable aesthetic and functional outcomes or decreased quality of life were 18-19% in the upper-outer quadrant (p < 0.0001), 14-15% in the lower-outer quadrant (p < 0.0001), 8-9% in the upper-inner quadrant (p < 0.0001), and 9-10% in the lower-inner quadrant (p < 0.0001).Conclusion: Aided by the calculated cut-off values for each breast quadrant, breast surgeons might render more objective decisions regarding performing conventional BCS, using oncoplastic techniques or choosing mastectomy with immediate reconstruction.

TI  - Quantifying annual changes in built-up area in complex urban-rural landscapes from analyses of PALSAR and Landsat images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Built-up area supports human settlements and activities, and its spatial distribution and temporal dynamics have significant impacts on ecosystem services and global environment change. To date, most of urban remote sensing has generated the maps of impervious surfaces, and limited effort has been made to explicitly identify the area, location and density of built-up in the complex and fragmented landscapes based on the freely available datasets. In this study, we took the lower Yangtze River Delta (Landsat Path/ Row: 118/038), China, where extensive urbanization and industrialization have occurred, as a case study site. We analyzed the structure and optical features of typical land cover types from (1) the HH and HV gamma-naught imagery from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), and (2) time series Landsat imagery. We proposed a pixel- and rule-based decision tree approach to identify and map built-up area at 30-m resolution from 2007 to 2010, using PALSAR HH gamma-naught and Landsat annual maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVl(max))(.) The accuracy assessment showed that the resultant annual maps of built-up had rela-tively high user (87-93%) and producer accuracies (91-95%) from 2007 to 2010. The built-up area was 2805 km(2) in 2010, about 16% of the total land area of the study site. The annual maps of built-up in 2007-2010 show relatively small changes in the urban core regions, but large outward expansion along the peri-urban regions. The average annual increase of built-up area& was about 80 km2 per year from 2007 to 2010. Our annual maps of built-up in the lower Yangtze River Delta clearly complement the existing maps of impervious surfaces in the region. This study provides a promising new approach to identify and map built-up area, which is critical to investigate the interactions between human activities and ecosystem services in urban-rural systems.

TI  - Mapping cropping intensity trends in China during 1982-2013
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Long range continuous monitoring information of cropping intensity is useful for sustainable agricultural management but still limited. This study filled this information gap through delivering spatiotemporal continuous datasets of cropping intensity in China during the past 30 years. Cropping intensity data were derived by a wavelet features-based method based on the long-term weekly global EVI2 (Enhance Vegetation Index with two bands) at 0.05 spatial resolution (5 km) from 1982 to 1999 and 8-day composite 500 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance products from 2001 to 2013. The remote-sensing estimated images in 2013 agreed well with field survey data (overall accuracy = 91.63%) and the national agricultural census data (r(2) = 0.89). Results revealed that the cropping intensity remarkably increased during 1982-1999 but slightly declined during 2001-2013. The overall cropping intensity increased from 1.34 in the 1980s to 1.41 in the 1990s, and then dropped to an average of 1.36 after 2000. From 1982 to 1999, approximately 93,225 km(2) single-cropped areas changed to double-cropping, primarily those located in the North China plain. However, 39,883 km(2) double cropped areas were turned back into single-cropping areas from 2001 to 2013, principally located in the North China plain, the Middle-lower Yangtze River plain, and the hill regions of the southern Yangtze River. This reverse trend of cropping intensity was due to combined effects from the corresponding reverse variations in agricultural population, increasing agricultural mechanical power, positive agricultural policy. The agricultural duty free policy has only immediate effects on stabilizing cropping intensity in croplands with more favorable biophysical conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combining CHAMP and Swarm Satellite Data to Invert the Lithospheric Magnetic Field in the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - CHAMP and Swarm satellite magnetic data are combined to establish the lithospheric magnetic field over the Tibetan Plateau at satellite altitude by using zonal revised spherical cap harmonic analysis (R-SCHA). These data are integrated with geological structures data to analyze the relationship between magnetic anomaly signals and large-scale geological tectonic over the Tibetan Plateau and to explore the active tectonic region based on the angle of the magnetic anomaly. Results show that the model fitting error is small for a layer 250-500 km high, and the RMSE of the horizontal and radial geomagnetic components is better than 0.3 nT. The proposed model can accurately describe medium-to long-scale lithospheric magnetic anomalies. Analysis indicates that a negative magnetic anomaly in the Tibetan Plateau significantly differs with a positive magnetic anomaly in the surrounding area, and the boundary of the positive and negative regions is generally consistent with the geological tectonic boundary in the plateau region. Significant differences exist between the basement structures of the hinterland of the plateau and the surrounding area. The magnetic anomaly in the Central and Western Tibetan Plateau shows an east-west trend, which is identical to the direction of the geological structures. The magnetic anomaly in the eastern part is arc-shaped and extends along the northeast direction. Its direction is significantly different from the trend of the geological structures. The strongest negative anomaly is located in the Himalaya block, with a central strength of up to 9 nT at a height of 300 km. The presence of a strong negative anomaly implies that the Curie isotherm in this area is relatively shallow and deep geological tectonic activity may exist.

TI  - Coseismic and post-seismic deformation fields mapped using satellite radar interferometry and fault slip inversion of the 2015 Mw8.3 Illapel earthquake, Chile
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed Sentinel-1A (S1A)IW satellite descending data from multiple acquisitions to map coseismic and post-seismic deformation fields and invert the fault slip and afterslip models associated with the seismic moment magnitude (Mw)8.3 earthquake that occurred at Illapel, Chile, on September 16th, 2015. We generated one coseismic and four post-seismic interferograms to analyze temporal and spatial variations in the deformation field after the mainshock; we found that the coseismic deformation field has a semicircular shape and covers a 300-km long and 190-km wide area. The maximum displacement reaches ca. 1.33 m in the LOS subsidence direction, while post-seismic deformation derived from four interferograms with different time intervals is mainly distributed within a long narrow area approximately 65 km wide. Maximum displacement is ca. 8 cm, including two regions of line of sight (LOS) uplift and sinking. Major regions of deformation exhibit opposite directions to the mainshock just after the event, before reverting to consistency. We inverted the coseismic fault slip and afterslip models based on a shallow-dip single fault plane in a homogeneous elastic half space. Our inversion suggests that coseismic slip is mainly concentrated in a shallow region to the northwest of the source, and that rupture length along strike is close to 340 km, with a maximum slip of about 8.16 m to the trench. The estimated moment is 3.126 x 10(21) N m (Mw8.27), and the maximum rupture depth is 50 km. Inverted residual slip also shows just one region of slip in the shallow subsurface, which is shifted slightly to the south. In the early stage of deformation, the residual is along the down-dip direction, with a maximum value of ca. 32 cm, before turning into the up-dip direction, with a maximum value of ca. 23 cm. Finally, we present a preliminary analysis of these complex changes in space and time. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A radiative transfer model-based method for the estimation of grassland aboveground biomass
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method to derive grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) based on the PROSAILH (PROSPECT + SAILH) radiative transfer model (RTM). Two variables, leaf area index (LAI, m(2) m(-2), defined as a one-side leaf area per unit of horizontal ground area) and dry matter content (DMC, gcm(-2), defined as the dry matter per leaf area), were retrieved using PROSAILH and reflectance data from Landsat 8 OLI product. The result of LAI x DMC was regarded as the estimated grassland AGB according to their definitions. The well-known ill-posed inversion problem when inverting PROSAILH was alleviated using ecological criteria to constrain the simulation scenario and therefore the number of simulated spectra. A case study of the presented method was applied to a plateau grassland in China to estimate its AGB. The results were compared to those obtained using an exponential regression, a partial least squares regression (PLSR) and an artificial neural networks (ANN). The RTM-based method offered higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.64 and RMSE= 42.67 gm(-2)) than the exponential regression (R-2 = 0.48 and RMSE = 41.65 gm(-2)) and the ANN (R-2 =0.43 and RMSE= 46.26 gm(-2)). However, the proposed method offered similar performance than PLSR as presented better determination coefficient than PLSR (R-2 = 0.55) but higher RMSE (RMSE = 37.79 gm(-2)). Although it is still necessary to test these methodologies in other areas, the RTM-based method offers greater robustness and reproducibility to estimate grassland AGB at large scale without the need to collect field measurements and therefore is considered the most promising methodology.

TI  - The "problem' of abuse in Ontario's Social Inclusion Act: A critical exploration
T2  - CRITICAL SOCIAL POLICY
M3  - Review
AB  - Employing Carol Bacchi's What's the problem? approach, this article examines the abuse policy recently implemented through the Social Inclusion Act of Ontario, Canada's developmental services sector (DSS), and how it constitutes sexual abuse of people with intellectual disabilities as a policy problem. Politically committed to preventing and addressing abuse, we examine how sexual abuse is given shape' in the policy and its compliance training materials, and how the policy's mandatory police reporting requirement subjectifies' victims according to a taken-for-granted legal worldview' that presumes justice is achieved through criminalisation. We also demonstrate the everyday deleterious effects' of this policy in relation to how it leaves both support for sexuality and the long-standing crisis management approach of Ontario's DSS unproblematised. This analysis calls into question the abuse policy of the Social Inclusion Act and demonstrates the pressing need to re-problematise abuse prevention and redress for people with intellectual disabilities.

TI  - Evaluating the influence of geo-environmental factors on gully erosion in a semi-arid region of Iran: An integrated framework
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of soil erosion in sustainable development goals in arid and semi-arid areas, the study of the geo-environmental conditions and factors influencing gully erosion occurrence is rarely undertaken. As effort to this challenge, the main objective of this study is to apply an integrated approach of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) together with high-spatial resolution imagery (SPOT-5) for detecting gully erosion features at the Kashkan-Poldokhtar watershed, Iran. We also aimed to apply a Conditional Probability (CP) model for establishing the spatial relationship between gullies and the Geo-Environmental Factors (GEFs). The gully erosion inventory map prepared using GEOBIA and field surveying was randomly partitioned into two subsets: (1) part 1 that contains 70% was used in the training phase of the CP model; (2) part 2 is a validation dataset (30%) for validation of the model and to confirm its accuracy. Prediction performances of the GEOBIA and CP model were checked by overall accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve methods, respectively. In addition, the influence of all GEFs on gully erosion was evaluated by performing a sensitivity analysis model. The validation findings illustrated that overall accuracy for GEOBIA approach and the area under the ROC curve for the CP model were 92.4% and 89.9%, respectively. Also, based on sensitivity analysis, soil texture, drainage density, and lithology represent significantly effects on the gully erosion occurrence. This study has shown that the integrated framework can be successfully used for modeling gully erosion occurrence in a data-poor environment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - SIFT-FANN: An efficient framework for spatio-spectral fusion of satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion techniques are widely used for remote sensing data. A special application is for using low resolution multi-spectral image with high resolution panchromatic image to obtain an image having both spectral and spatial information. Alignment of images to be fused is a step prior to image fusion. This is achieved by registering the images. This paper proposes the methods involving Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbor (FANN) for automatic registration of satellite image (reference image) prior to fusion of low spatial resolution multi-spectral QuickBird satellite image (sensed image) with high spatial resolution panchromatic QuickBird satellite image. In the registration steps, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is used to extract key points from both images. The keypoints are then matched using the automatic tuning algorithm, namely, FANN. This algorithm automatically selects the most appropriate indexing algorithm for the dataset. The indexed features are then matched using approximate nearest neighbor. Further, Random Sample Consensus (RanSAC) is used for further filtering to obtain only the inliers and co-register the images. The images are then fused using Intensity Hue Saturation (IHS) transform based technique to obtain a high spatial resolution multi-spectral image. The results show that the quality of fused images obtained using this algorithm is computationally efficient.

T2  - MATERIALS RESEARCH EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we report the synthesis of ZnO:Cu nanoparticles with rod-like morphology using co-precipitation method. X-ray diffraction analysis indicated that these ZnO: Cu nanoparticles has wurtzite structure with preferential growth along (1 0 1) crystal plane. The formation of additional defect levels in these particles on doping with Cu was investigated using Raman and fluorescence spectroscopy. The increase in intensity of E-1 (LO) mode observed at similar to 580 cm(-1) in the Raman spectra of ZnO: Cu nanoparticles, confirmed the formation of additional defect levels in these nanoparticles on doping with Cu. The doping concentration was evident in the intensity of the additional Raman mode observed at similar to 280 cm(-1) for the Cu doped nanoparticles. Photoluminescence spectra of Cu doped ZnO nanoparticles shows three visible emission peaks at 413, 435 and 531 nm along with a UV emission peak at 390 nm, whereas undoped ZnO nanoparticles showed only two peaks, at 389 and 582 nm. The shrinkage in band gap causing the emission of violet, blue and green colors on doping with Cu are attributed to the s-d and p-d exchange interactions between conduction band electrons of ZnO and localized d electrons of Cu ions, resulting in renormalization of band gap. The emission bands observed in these ZnO: Cu nanoparticles has been illustrated with a schematic energy level diagram.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies on forest cover change can reveal the status of forests and facilitate for its conservation planning. Idukki is the largest district in the state of Kerala having a total geographical area of 5019 km(2). The objectives of the present study are to map forest cover in Idukki district using multi-temporal remote sensing data (1975, 1990, 2001 and 2012) and topographical maps (1925), to analyze the trends in deforestation and land use changes. Overall statistics for the period of 1925 indicate that about 4675.7 km(2) (93.2 %) of the landscape was under forest. The forest cover in 2012 was estimated as 2613.4 km(2) (52.1 %). Recently, due to the implementation of policies and protection efforts, the rate of deforestation was greatly reduced. The commencement of hydroelectric projects during 1925-1990 responsible for an increase of area under water bodies by inundating other land uses. The long term analysis shows agricultural area been decreasing and commercial plantations been increasing in the district. There has been a significant increase in the area of plantations from 1236.2 km(2) (1975) to 1317.3 km(2) (2012).

TI  - Monitoring of fire incidences in vegetation types and Protected Areas of India: Implications on carbon emissions
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon emissions released from forest fires have been identified as an environmental issue in the context of global warming. This study provides data on spatial and temporal patterns of fire incidences, burnt area and carbon emissions covering natural vegetation types (forest, scrub and grassland) and Protected Areas of India. The total area affected by fire in the forest, scrub and grasslands have been estimated as 48765.45, 6540.97 and 1821.33 km(2), respectively, in 2014 using Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data. The total CO2 emissions from fires of these vegetation types in India were estimated to be 98.11 Tg during 2014. The highest emissions were caused by dry deciduous forests, followed by moist deciduous forests. The fire season typically occurs in February, March, April and May in different parts of India. Monthly CO2 emissions from fires for different vegetation types have been calculated for February, March, April and May and estimated as 2.26, 33.53, 32.15 and 30.17 Tg, respectively. Protected Areas represent 11.46% of the total natural vegetation cover of India. Analysis of fire occurrences over a 10-year period with two types of sensor data, i.e., AWiFS and MODIS, have found fires in 281 (out of 614) Protected Areas of India. About 16.78 Tg of CO2 emissions were estimated in Protected Areas in 2014. The natural vegetation types of Protected Areas have contributed for burnt area of 17.3% and CO2 emissions of 17.1% as compared to total natural vegetation burnt area and emissions in India in 2014. 9.4% of the total vegetation in the Protected Areas was burnt in 2014. Our results suggest that Protected Areas have to be considered for strict fire management as an effective strategy for mitigating climate change and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Restricted Axillary Staging in Clinically and Sonographically Node-Negative Early Invasive Breast Cancer (c/iT1-2) in the Context of Breast Conserving Therapy: First Results Following Commencement of the Intergroup-Sentinel-Mamma (INSEMA) Trial
T2  - GEBURTSHILFE UND FRAUENHEILKUNDE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node status remains an important prognostic factor in early breast cancer. It is regarded as an indicator for (neo) adjuvant systemic treatment and postoperative radiotherapy of the regional lymphatics. Commenced in September 2015, the INSEMA trial is investigating whether operative determination of nodal status as part of breast conserving therapy (BCT) for early stage breast cancer (c/iT1-2 c/iN0) can be avoided without reducing oncological safety. After inclusion of 1001 patients there was general acceptance of the complex study design by patients and study doctors so that recruitment for the first randomisation (axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLNB]: yes or no) achieved predicted case numbers. The second randomisation however (SLNB alone versus complete axillary dissection when one or two macrometastases are present at SLNB) recruited fewer cases than expected for the following three reasons: a) the 13% rate of one or two macrometastases after SLNB in the INSEMA trial collective was lower than expected; b) around 20% of patients refused the second randomisation; c) there was delayed inclusion of the Austrian study centres, which only recruited for the second randomisation. Lack of knowledge of nodal status when SLNB is avoided represents a new challenge for the postoperative tumour board. In particular decisions on chemotherapy for luminal-like tumours and irradiation of the lymphatics (excluding axilla) must be guided by tumour biological parameters. The INSEMA trial does not provide answers to some important questions, e.g. it remains unclear whether patients without SLNB can be offered partial breast irradiation alone in low-risk situations and whether SLNB can also be avoided in patients with stage T1-2 tumours who have a mastectomy indication.

TI  - Research on Remote Sensing Monitoring Technology of Forest Land Dynamic Change in Tianshui in Recent 30 Years
T2  - Forest Research
M3  - Article
AB  - [Objective] Taking Tianshui of Gansu province as a case study, the spatial distribution law, time changing trends and influence factors of forest resource had been researched in the transition region of typical Loess Plateau and Xiaolongshan-western Qinling Mountains in the past 30 years. [Method] The main data sources are Land sat TM/OLI remote sensing images with 5 series in summer from 1988 to 2015, combined with auxiliary data and field survey data. Image spectral features and indices characteristics were selected as the input characteristic variables. The land cover types were classified based on the random forest classifier and the optimal parameter SVM classifier. Subsequently, the forest resources dynamic change monitoring was implemented by the post-classification comparison method. [Result] The results show that the classification performance based on two classifiers are good, and the random forest classifier is better than that of optimal parameter SVM classifier, especially in the classification accuracy, algorithm efficiency and stability. The change detection results show that over the past 30 years the overall change trend of forest area was first decreased and then increased. From 1990 to 1996, the forest land area decreased by 0.74%, and from 1996 to 2002, forest land area decreased by 2.74%. However, forest land area increased by 1.06% from 2002 to 2008, and more significantly, forest land area increased by 8. 89% from 2008 to 2015. [Conclusion] The forest change detection method based on post-classification comparison of non-parametric classifiers classification result proposed in this paper is an effective approach for monitoring of forest resources dynamic change and information extraction in complex terrain landform transition region, which could provide valuable reference for quantitative analysis of vegetation change and comprehensive evaluation, reasonable spatial allocation and optimization adjustment of forest resources, forest management and assistant decision making and dynamic monitoring of forestry major project and ecological environment evaluation.

TI  - Context-Adaptive Pansharpening Based on Image Segmentation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpened images are widely used synthetic representations of the Earth surface characterized by both a high spatial resolution and a high spectral diversity. They are usually generated by extracting spatial details from a high-resolution PANchromatic image and by injecting them into a low spatial resolution multispectral image. The details injection is performed through injection coefficients, whose values can be either uniform for the whole image (global methods) or spatially variant (context-adaptive (CA) approaches). In this paper, we propose a CA approach in which the injection coefficients are estimated over image segments achieved through a binary partition tree segmentation algorithm. The approach is applied to two credited pansharpening algorithms based on the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure and the generalized Laplacian pyramid technique. The performance assessment is performed using two different data sets acquired by the QuickBird and the WorldView-3 satellites. The validation procedure, both at full and at reduced resolution, shows the suitability of the proposed approach, which reaches a good tradeoff between accuracy and computational burden.

TI  - Comparison of different object-based classifications in LandsatTM images for the analysis of heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates an optimal methodology for classification using object-based analysis on medium resolution images (LandsatTM), especially in areas with heterogeneous landscapes. The selected study area is the Province of Pontevedra in Spain, which has a complex landscape with different coexisting elements, such as mixed, hardwood and coniferous forests, scrublands, natural grassland, agricultural areas, water surfaces, bare soils as well as urban and industrial areas. Different segmentation configurations were tested for two different classifiers: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). For validation, the results were compared with a map of land use and land cover corresponding to the European project CLC-2006 through the analysis of both Kappa coefficient and error matrix. The best results were obtained for a SVM classification with level 30 and merge 97, resulting in a Kappa coefficient of 0.80 and error matrix of 85.31%. Additionally, different landscape metrics defining the structure and configuration of the landscape were evaluated for each classification. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A glyphosate-based herbicide induces histomorphological and protein expression changes in the liver of the female guppy <i>Poecilia reticulata</i>
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glyphosate-based herbicides (GBH) are among the most common herbicides found in aquatic systems, but limited data are available about their mode of action and hepatotoxicity in fish. This study investigated the hepatotoxicity induced by GBH in the guppy Poecilia reticulae using a histopathological assessment associated with a proteomic approach. Guppies were exposed to GBH for 24 h at 1.8 mg of glyphosate L-1, corresponding to 50% of the LC50, 96 h. The results indicate that the GBH at 1.8 mg of glyphosate L-1 induce the development of hepatic damage in P. reticulate, which is exposure-time dependent. The histopathological indexes demonstrate that GBH cause inflammatory, regressive, vascular and progressive disorders in the liver of guppies. Using 2D gel electrophoresis associated with mass spectrometry, 18 proteins that changed by GBH were identified and were related to the cellular structure, motility and transport, energy metabolism and apoptosis. The results show that the acute exposure to GBH causes hepatic histopathological damage related to protein expression profile changes in P. reticulate, indicating that a histopathological assessment associated with a proteomic analysis provides a valuable approach to assess the toxic effects of GBH in sentinel fish species.

TI  - Characterizing commercial oil palm expansion in Latin America: land use change and trade
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Commodity crop expansion has increased with the globalization of production systems and consumer demand, linking distant socio-ecological systems. Oil palm plantations are expanding in the tropics to satisfy growing oilseed and biofuel markets, and much of this expansion has caused extensive deforestation, especially in Asia. In Latin America, palm oil output has doubled since 2001, and the majority of expansion seems to be occurring on non-forested lands. We used MODIS satellite imagery (250 m resolution) to map current oil palm plantations in Latin America and determined prior land use and land cover (LULC) using high-resolution images in Google Earth. In addition, we compiled trade data to determine where Latin American palm oil flows, in order to better understand the underlying drivers of expansion in the region. Based on a sample of 342 032 ha of oil palm plantations across Latin America, we found that 79% replaced previously intervened lands (e.g. pastures, croplands, bananas), primarily cattle pastures (56%). The remaining 21% came from areas that were classified as woody vegetation (e.g. forests), most notably in the Amazon and the Peten region in northern Guatemala. Latin America is a net exporter of palm oil but the majority of palm oil exports (70%) stayed within the region, with Mexico importing about half. Growth of the oil palm sector may be driven by global factors, but environmental and economic outcomes vary between regions (i.e. Asia and Latin America), within regions (i.e. Colombia and Peru), and within single countries (i.e. Guatemala), suggesting that local conditions are influential. The present trend of oil palm expanding onto previously cleared lands, guided by roundtable certifications programs, provides an opportunity for more sustainable development of the oil palm sector in Latin America.

TI  - Environmental drivers of decadal change of a mangrove forest in the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide important ecosystem services, but are under constant pressure from natural, anthropogenic, and climate change related disturbances. Environmental drivers on mangrove change at large spatial scales, other than sea level rise, are not well understood. In here, we use spatially explicit methods to identify the main environmental drivers of mangrove coverage change over a decade in the landscape of the North coast of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. A post-supervised classification approach on seven SPOT 5 multispectral satellite images was used to construct thematic maps of mangrove coverage between 2004 and 2014. A linear regression model between the thematic maps was performed to estimate the mangrove coverage change rate per pixel. Climate surfaces for annual maximum, minimum and mean temperature, and annual mean and cumulative precipitation for the region were calculated for the period 1980-2009 using data obtained from the National Meteorological Service. The effect of environmental variables on mangrove coverage change rates was assessed with a boosted generalized additive model (boosted GAM). The lowest and highest overall accuracy obtained for the time series thematic maps were 87.14% (Kappa = 0.78), and 97.5% (Kappa = 0.95), respectively. The most influential environmental variables on mangrove coverage change were annual cumulative precipitation (21%), and annual maximum temperature (9%). Current climate change scenarios for the region predict an increase in temperature and a decrease in precipitation, intensifying environmental stress on this ecosystem. Therefore, adequate management strategies are fundamental to help maintain the mangrove forest under changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Physical and biological forcing of mesoscale variability in the carbonate system of the Ross Sea (Antarctica) during summer 2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water samples (0-200 m) were collected in a coastal area of the Ross Sea in January 2014 to evaluate the physical and biological forcing on the carbonate system at the mesoscale (distance between stations of 5-10 km). Remote sensing supported the determination of the sampling strategy and helped positioning each sampling station. Total alkalinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, phytoplankton pigments and composition were investigated in combination with measurements of temperature, salinity and current speed. Total inorganic carbon, sea water CO2 partial pressure and the saturation state (0) for calcite and aragonite were calculated from the measured total alkalinity and pH. In addition, continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2 concentration were completed. LADCP measurements revealed the presence of a significant change in current speed and direction that corresponded to a clearly defined front characterized by gradients in both temperature and salinity. Phytoplankton biomass was relatively high at all stations and the highest values of chlorophyll-a were found between 20 to 50 m, with the dominant taxonomic group being haptophyceae. The carbonate system properties in surface waters exhibited mesoscale variability with a horizontal length scale of about 10 km. Sea-ice melt, through the input of low salinity water, results in a dilution of the total alkalinity and inorganic carbon, but our observations suggest that phytoplankton activity was the major forcing of the distribution of the carbonate system variables. Higher CO3- ,Omega and pH in the surface layer were found where the highest values of chlorophyll-a were observed. The calculated Delta pCO(2) pattern follows both MODIS data and in situ chlorophyll-a measurements, and the estimated CO2 fluxes ranged from -0.5 +/- 0.4 to -31.0 +/- 6.4 mmol m(-2) d(-1). The large range observed in the fluxes is due to both the spatial variability of sea water pCO(2) and to the episodic winds experienced. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Treatment of the axilla in patients with primary breast cancer and low burden axillary disease: Limitations of the evidence from randomised controlled trials
T2  - CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ONCOLOGY HEMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Invasive breast cancer is the second most common cancer worldwide. It is known to metastasise to the regional axillary lymph nodes but there has been debate over what is the best way to stage and treat the axilla in patients presenting with primary breast cancer. Multiple trials over the last two decades have led to a change in practice from routine axillary lymph node dissection to sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients who are clinically lymph node negative preoperatively. This has resulted in new questions regarding subsequent treatment of some patients. This review will critically appraise the evidence on axillary treatment in patients with low burden axillary disease and highlight limitations of relevant randomised controlled trials.

TI  - <i>Mus spretus</i> as an environmental sentinel: A review of 17 years (1998-2015) of research in Mediterranean Europe
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Review
AB  - The Algerian mouse Mus spretus has been widely used as a biomonitor to assess environmental contamination, either in situ or ex situ. Knowledge on toxic effects of environmental pollutants on M. spretus greatly stems from multi-approach studies, in late 1990's and early 2000's, aiming at evaluating the acute and chronic environmental impacts generated by mining activities, in Spain and Portugal. These studies also identified several measures of overall fitness in mice as indicators of metal stress. More recent studies have pointed out for two promising pathways: the use of non-invasive and non-destructive endpoints aiming to protect wild populations; and the "omic" sciences. Overall, the set of studies carried out over the last 17 years (1998-2015) demonstrates the potential use of M. spretus as a sentinel species to detect environmental contamination, especially by mixtures of contaminants.

M3  - Article
AB  - The updated S3 guidelines on malignant melanoma were established in August 2016. The principles of diagnostics and classification are based on the histopathological results from the primary tumor and if necessary the sentinel lymph nodes. The most important factor for prognosis is the tumor thickness according to Breslow and the detection of sentinel node micrometastases. The surgical safety margin after excision is dependent on the tumor thickness. Furthermore, ulceration of the primary tumor and presence of mitosis in melanomas less than 1 mm in thickness are also considered in the TaEuroclassification. The sentinel lymph nodes should be prepared according to established procedures using HE staining and immunohistochemical methods. The largest tumor diameter of a micrometastasis should be measured in tenths of a millimeter (Rotterdam classification). Molecular pathology testing for mutations in the BRAF and NRAS oncogenes should be carried out in patients with metastatic disease or surgically non-resectable tumors. In addition c-KIT mutations should be tested in acral lentiginous and mucosal melanomas. Treatment with signal transduction inhibitors is possible when mutations have been detected.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF THE SPATIAL AND-HABITAT DISTRIBUTION OF ANSERIFORM WATERFOWL IN THE YAMAL-NENETS AND KHANTY-MANSI AUTONOMOUS REGIONS (EXPERIENCE FROM THE USE OF ULTRA-LIGHT AIRCRAFT)
T2  - ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In Russia, the conservation of anseriform waterfowl is possible through the creation of temporary hunting free zones during the hunt period, especially in spring. A justification for creating such zones and outlining their boundaries (by analogy with the experience deriving from the countries on North America) each season must be based on data on annual waterfowl monitoring. The present paper describes census experience drawn from the use of ultra-light aviation for further delineating the key staging sites of anseriform waterfowl in western Siberia. To refine the duration of monitoring, observation data were combined with those derived from geese equipped with GSM-GPS transmitters. In the spring and autumn of 2012-2014, we covered over 50000 km of aerial surveys of 25 waterfowl species. A new method is advanced for assessing their numbers based on visual observations, flock photography and modern statistics. We estimated species densities in 16 habitat types delineated on the basis of Landsat imagery. In terms of this, a system is proposed for extrapolating the survey data on 25 waterfowl species onto model sites in western Siberia. Drops in the numbers of several mass game species were noted. Based on an evaluation of habitat quality, 10 waterfowl hunting-free zones were suggested and delineated. A GIS project was launched that incorporated the main migration routes, boundaries of the key sites, places of mass bird aggregations, as well as sites for the observation of rare, Red Data List species. A program of long-term monitoring and sustainable use of waterfowl game resources in the study region is offered. Such an approach must also be applied to other regions of Russia.

TI  - Recent catastrophic landslide lake outburst floods in the Himalayan mountain range
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the more complex and devastating interactions between climate and hydromorphological processes in mountain environments are landslide lake outburst floods (LLOFs), resulting from mass movements temporarily blocking a drainage system. This work reviews these processes in the Himalayas and highlights the high frequency of this type of phenomenon in the region. In addition, we analyse two recent catastrophic trans-national LLOFs occurring in the Sutlej river basin during 2000 and 2005. Based on high resolution satellite images, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived evolution of snowline elevation and discharge data we reconstruct the timing and hydrometeorological conditions related to the formation and failure of landslide dams. Results showed that the 2005 flood, originating from the outburst of the Parchu Lake, was not related to heavy precipitation, but was likely enhanced by the rapid and late snowmelt of an unusually deep and widespread snowpack. The flood in 2000 was triggered by the outburst of an unnamed lake located on the Tibetan plateau, identified here for the first time. In this case, the outburst followed intense precipitation in the lake watershed, which raised the level of the lake and thus caused the breaching of the dam. As stream gauges were damaged during the events detailed discharge data is not available, but we estimated the peak discharges ranging between 1100 m(3) s(-1) and 2000 m(3) s(-1) in 2005, and 1024 m(3) s(-1) and 1800 m(3) s(-1) in 2000. These events caused significant geomorphic changes along the river valleys, with observed changes in channel width exceeding 200 m. Results also demonstrate that remotely-sensed data enables valuable large-scale monitoring of lake development and related hydrometeorological conditions, and may thereby inform early warning strategies, and provide a basis for flood risk reduction measures that focus on disaster preparedness and response strategies.

TI  - Modelling sea ice formation in the Terra Nova Bay polynya
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic sea ice is constantly exported from the shore by strong near surface winds that open leads and Iarge polynyas in the pack ice. The latter, known as wind-driven polynyas, are responsible for significant water mass modification due to the high salt flux into the ocean associated with enhanced ice growth. In this article, we focus on the wind-driven Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya, in the western Ross Sea. Brine rejected during sea ice formation processes that occur in the TNB polynya densifies the water column leading to the formation of the most characteristic water mass of the Ross Sea, the High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW). This water mass, in turn, takes part in the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), the densest water mass of the world ocean, which plays a major role in the global meridional overturning circulation, thus affecting the global climate system. A simple coupled sea ice-ocean model has been developed to simulate the seasonal cycle of sea ice formation and export within a polynya. The sea ice model accounts for both thermal and mechanical ice processes. The oceanic circulation is described by a one-and-a-half layer, reduced gravity model. The domain resolution is 1 km x 1 km, which is sufficient to represent the salient features of the coastline geometry, notably the Drygalski Ice Tongue. The model is forced by a combination of Era Interim reanalysis and in-situ data from automatic weather stations, and also by a climatological oceanic dataset developed from in situ hydrographic observations. The sensitivity of the polynya to the atmospheric forcing is well reproduced by the model when atmospheric in situ measurements are combined with reanalysis data. Merging the two datasets allows us to capture in detail the strength and the spatial distribution of the katabatic winds that often drive the opening of the polynya. The model resolves fairly accurately the sea ice drift and sea ice production rates in the TNB polynya, leading to realistic polynya extent estimates. The model-derived polynya extent has been validated by comparing the modelled sea ice concentration against MODIS high resolution satellite images, confirming that the model is able to reproduce reasonably well the TNB polynya evolution in terms of both shape and extent.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy plus wide local excision vs. wide location excision alone for primary cutaneous melanoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy and wide local excision of the primary melanoma (SLNB) is now a standard staging procedure for patients with melanomas 1 mm or more in thickness, but its therapeutic benefit is not clear.Objective To determine whether there is an association between performance of SLNB and patient prognosis.Methods Studies assessing the association between performance of SLNB and patient prognosis were pooled from MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar. From each study, first author's last name, publication year, origin country, type of study design, characteristics of participants and the Hazard risk (HR) for melanoma specific survival (MSS) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were collected. Methodological assessment of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) and the 'Risk of bias' tool detailed in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Meta-analyses for the global HR were performed. In addition, in order to explore the sources of heterogeneity among the studies, sensitivity analyses are also provided.Results A total of six studies with 8764 patients who had undergone SLNB and 11054 patients who had undergone wide location excision alone (WLEA) were identified for the analysis. The indicators suggest that the heterogeneity is low: tau(2) = 0; H = 1 [1; 1.74]; I-2 = 0% [0%; 66.5%]. Evidence for publication bias was not found (Egger's test P = 0.4654). The pooled MSS HR from fixed effects analysis was determined to be 0.88 (95% CI = 0.80-0.96).Conclusions Although no significant survival difference was observed in four of the six series, the pooling summary data from all the studies that deal with this issue suggested that SLNB is associated with a significantly better outcome compared with WLEA for localized melanoma.

TI  - Mottainai: a Japanese sense of anima mundi.
T2  - The Journal of analytical psychology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Japanese expression 'Mottainai!' can be translated as 'What a waste!' or 'Don't be wasteful!' However, mottainai means much more than that. It expresses a sense of concern or regret for whatever is wasted because its intrinsic value is not properly utilized. Buddhism and Japan's indigenous religion, Shinto, are integral to the Japanese psyche, accordingly the other-than-human world is also experienced and lived in daily life. In the Japanese worldview everything in nature is endowed with spirit, every individual existence is dependent on others and all are connected in an ever-changing world. Mottainai offers a glimpse of the anima mundi inherent in this worldview. This contrasts with our anthropocentric Zeitgeist, which manifests outwardly as environmental crisis and inwardly as fixation upon social interactions, especially through communication technologies, to the exclusion of all else. Jung's statement, 'The decisive question for man is: Is he related to something infinite or not? That is the telling question of his life', has never been more pertinent. Encounters beyond the human world could be understood as touching this 'something infinite', and the apparent benefits of such experiences in the analytical process are illustrated with clinical vignettes from the author's practice.

TI  - Active layer thermal monitoring of a Dry Valley of the Ellsworth Mountains, Continental Antarctica
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ellsworth Mountains are located along the southern edge of the Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf and are subdivided by the Minnesota Glacier into the Heritage Range to the east, and the Sentinel Range to the west (Figure 1). The climate of the Ellsworth Mountains is strongly controlled by proximity to the Ronne-Filchner Ice Shelf and elevation. The entire ice free area is underlain by continuous permafrost of unknown thickness, most in the form of dry permafrost. Active-layer depths in drift sheets of the Ellsworth Mountains range from 15 to 50 cm. Detailed knowledge on Antarctic permafrost is patchy, especially at the continent. Two adjacent active layer monitoring sites were installed at Mt. Dolence, Ellsworth Mountains, in the summer of 2012. Two dry-valley soils at Mt. Dolence area, on quartzite drift deposits were studied: (i) a convex-slope site exposed to the wind (Lithic Haplorthel 886 m asl, 5 cm, 10 cm, 30 cm); and a sheltered concave-slope site protected from winds (Lithic Anhyorthel 850 m asl, 5 cm, 10 cm, 30 cm). Data was recorded at hourly intervals from January 2nd 2012 until December 29th 2013. The soil climate temperature at 5 cm reaches a maximum daily mean in late December, reaching a minimum in mid July at both sites. Active layer thickness reaches a maximum of 48.4 cm at P1 on January 17th 2013 and 47.8 cm at P2 on January 7th 2012. The soil thermal regime at the dry valley of Mt. Dolence, Ellsworth Mountains is characteristic of cold desert affected by dry-frozen permafrost. Although air temperature does not reach elevated positive values, variations in soil temperature are intense, showing the soil's response to solar radiation. The origins of typical surface periglacial features and landform on the widespread Ellsworth drifts may be inherited from past events of warmer climates, since liquid water is unlikely to play any significant role under the present climate.

TI  - Assessing the functional signature of heathland landscapes via hyperspectral remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wall-to-wall information about the state and change of vegetation is needed in many ecological applications, such as the monitoring of large conservation areas. In support of this task, remote sensing can provide valuable information that is complementary to the results from field work. Remote sensing is also well suited for change detection, but the question arises how a rate of change can be expressed in a generalized and objective way that allows comparisons between different areas. We think that true comparability can hardly be achieved by using conventional vegetation classification approaches, which are not transferable if they take account of the individuality of areas. To reach such comparability, an approach would be needed that combines generality with flexibility to adapt to local conditions.Therefore, we propose that the local vegetation is broken down into basic strategy types as proposed by Phil Grime in 1974. He observed general rules in the occurrence of three general plant strategies: competitive ability (C), stress tolerance (S), and ruderal strategy (R). Our research question is whether these strategy types can be used to derive functional signatures of landscapes as a basis for comparison between conservation areas.We used the CSR concept to map plant strategies in a heath landscape based on remote sensing data. Average Grime CSR values of vegetation samples were regressed against airborne hyperspectral imagery, resulting in spatial representations of C, S, and R (val. r(2) of 0.55, 0.59, and 0.28, respectively). Based on this continuous information we created functional signatures for two subareas of the study site, the 'CSR-fingerprints'.We found clear differences in the CSR signatures of different parts of the investigated area. We think that similar differences in time can also be assessed using the same approach. This could provide a simple but powerful expression of the state of vegetation that would be comparable across regions and time. We therefore assume that the method is suitable for comparative studies with a focus on vegetation functioning. While it does not explicitly take into account differences in species composition, it can also work as an early warning system with follow-up investigations in areas subjected to change.

TI  - Treatment of melanoma during pregnancy
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma diagnosed during pregnancy is a rare clinical case presentation which must be mastered. In the absence of guidelines for this clinical challenge, we performed a review of the literature and provide a practical guideline on how to manage such rare clinical cases based on our clinical experience. Expecting mothers require adequate counselling and explanation of all therapeutic options as they take responsibility for more than their own lives. However, they should be guided through the process of diagnostic and therapeutic measures in a potentially life-threatening situation. Pregnancy itself is no reason to withhold any type of necessary melanoma surgery. Perioperative management, however, requires certain adjustments in order to comply with this special situation. If indicated, even adjuvant and palliative systemic therapy need to be given to the patient, but they also have to be adapted to the specific circumstances as data is still sparse, especially for the new first and second line therapies with antibodies and targeted molecules.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of ships at sea is a complex task made more so by adverse weather conditions, lack of night visibility, and large areas of concern. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery with large swaths can provide the needed coverage at a reduced resolution. The development of ship detection methods that can effectively detect ships despite the reduced image resolution is an important area of research. A novel ship detection method is introduced that makes use of a standard constant false alarm rate (FAR) prescreening step followed by a cascade classifier ship discriminator. Ships are identified using Haar-like features using adaptive boosting training on the classifier with an accuracy of 89.38% and FAR of 1.47 x 10(-8) across a large swath Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT-2 newly created SAR data set.

TI  - High spatiotemporal resolution of river planform dynamics from Landsat: The RivMAP toolbox and results from the Ucayali River
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying planform changes of large and actively migrating rivers such as those in the tropical Amazon at multidecadal time scales, over large spatial domains, and with high spatiotemporal frequency is essential for advancing river morphodynamic theory, identifying controls on migration, and understanding the roles of climate and human influences on planform adjustments. This paper addresses the challenges of quantifying river planform changes from annual channel masks derived from Landsat imagery and introduces a set of efficient methods to map and measure changes in channel widths, the locations and rates of migration, accretion and erosion, and the space-time characteristics of cutoff dynamics. The techniques are assembled in a comprehensive MATLAB toolbox called RivMAP (River Morphodynamics from Analysis of Planforms), which is applied to over 1500km of the actively migrating and predominately meandering Ucayali River in Peru from 1985 to 2015. We find multiscale spatial and temporal variability around multidecadal trends in migration rates, erosion and accretion, and channel widths revealing a river dynamically adjusting to sediment and water fluxes. Confounding factors controlling planform morphodynamics including local inputs of sediment, cutoffs, and climate are parsed through the high temporal analysis.

TI  - Using ultrasound and palpation for predicting axillary lymph node status following neoadjuvant chemotherapy - Results from the multi-center SENTINA trial
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With the growing importance of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) the assessment of post neoadjuvant axillary status is of increasing importance especially in patients who presented initially with suspicious nodes (cN1). This study aims to investigate the predictive value of palpation and axillary ultrasound of formerly cN1 patients following NST.Patients and methods: The SENTINA trial (SENTinel NeoAdjuvant) is a 4-arm prospective multicenter study designed to evaluate the role of sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) in the context of neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) of breast cancer patients.Results: 1240 patients from 103 institutions entered the trial. 715 (arm C n = 592; arm D n = 123) patients, who presented initially cN1 underwent clinical evaluation of lymph node status following NST. Palpation alone demonstrated a sensitivity of 8.3%, specifity of 94.8% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 46.6%. Ultrasound alone revealed a sensitivity of 23.9%, specificity 91.7%, and a NPV of 50.3%. The investigators combined classification (palpation and ultrasound) resulted in a sensitivity of 24.4%, specificity 91.4%, and a NPV of 50.3%. Investigators classified the axilla nodes as being unsuspicious (cN0) following NST in 592/715 patients; of them 298 (50.3%) were pN0, 151 (25.5%) had 1-2 histologically involved nodes and 143 (24.2%) had > 2 histologically involved nodes.Conclusion: The diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound and palpation following NST is unacceptably low and additional tools for evaluation of the axillary lymph node status following NST are urgently needed.

TI  - Identification of Artificial Recharge Sites for Noyyal River Basin Using GIS and Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water is a nature's valuable gift to all life forms. Water quality and quantity plays a major role for the growth and development of community. Both natural and human factors influence the quality and quantity of water source. Depending upon the quality and quantity of groundwater it can be used for various purposes, such as drinking, agricultural and industrial. Due to revolution in industries and various anthropogenic sources in the past decades, groundwater has been polluted and depleted. Remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) has become one of the leading tools in the field of hydrogeological science, which helps in assessing, monitoring and conserving groundwater resources. GIS technology provides suitable alternatives for efficient management of large and complex databases. In recent years, the increasing use of satellite remote sensing data has made it easier to define the spatial distribution of different groundwater prospect classes on the basis of geomorphology and other associated parameters. Analysis of remotely sensed data along with Survey of India(SOI) topographical sheets and collateral information with necessary field checks helps in generating the base line information for artificial recharge. The artificial recharge sites were identified by integrating thematic maps of geology, geomorphology, slope, drainage density and lineament density of the study area. The study focuses on the development of remote sensing and GIS based analysis and methodology for identifying artificial recharge studies in Noyyal river basin.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nurse staffing, increased workload and unstable nursing unit environments are linked to negative patient outcomes including falls and medication errors on medical/surgical units. Considering this evidence, the aim of our study was to overview midwives' workload and work setting. We created a questionnaire and performed an online survey. We obtained information about the type and level of hospital, workload, the use of standardised procedures, reporting of sentinel and near-miss' events. We reported a severe understaffing in midwives' work settings and important underuse of standard protocols according to the international guidelines, especially in the South of Italy. Based on our results, we strongly suggest a change of direction of healthcare policy, oriented to increase the number of employed midwives, in order to let them fulfil their duties according to the international guidelines (especially one-to-one care). On the other hand, we encourage the adoption of standardised protocols in each work setting.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: A new approach in the management of head and neck cancers.
T2  - Sultan Qaboos University medical journal
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Cervical lymph node metastasis affects the prognosis and overall survival rate of and therapeutic planning for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). However, advanced diagnostic modalities still lack accuracy in detecting occult neck metastasis. A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a minimally invasive auxiliary method for assessing the presence of occult metastatic disease in a patient with a clinically negative neck. This technique increases the specificity of neck dissection and thus reduces morbidity among oral cancer patients. The removal of sentinel nodes and dissection of the levels between the primary tumour and the sentinel node or the irradiation of target nodal basins is favoured as a selective treatment approach; this technique has the potential to become the new standard of care for patients with HNSCCs. This article presents an update on clinical applications and novel developments in this field.

TI  - Earthquake Damage Visualization (EDV) Technique for the Rapid Detection of Earthquake-Induced Damages Using SAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The damage of buildings and manmade structures, where most of human activities occur, is the major cause of casualties of from earthquakes. In this paper, an improved technique, Earthquake Damage Visualization (EDV) is presented for the rapid detection of earthquake damage using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. The EDV is based on the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence change method. The normalized difference between the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherences, and vice versa, are used to calculate the forward (from pre-seismic to co- seismic) and backward (from co- seismic to pre-seismic) change parameters, respectively. The backward change parameter is added to visualize the retrospective changes caused by factors other than the earthquake. The third change-free parameter uses the average values of the pre-seismic and co-seismic coherence maps. These three change parameters were ultimately merged into the EDV as an RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) composite imagery. The EDV could visualize the earthquake damage efficiently using Horizontal transmit and Horizontal receive (HH), and Horizontal transmit and Vertical receive (HV) polarizations data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2). Its performance was evaluated in the Kathmandu Valley, which was hit severely by the 2015 Nepal Earthquake. The cross-validation results showed that the EDV is more sensitive to the damaged buildings than the existing method. The EDV could be used for building damage detection in other earthquakes as well.

TI  - Greenspace patterns and the mitigation of land surface temperature in Taipei metropolis
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to assess the role of greenspace patterns on cooling effects from urban greenspaces. Greenspace has been argued to have significant potential to mitigate urban heat island effect in urban areas, and thus to reduce risks to human health and wellbeing intensified by global warming. Based on remote sensing data and subsequent spatial analysis carried out for Taipei Metropolis, this paper argues that greenspace features lowering temperature within greenspaces are not necessarily to have explicit cooling contribution on surrounding built environments. For mitigating urban heat at the area nearby greenspaces, greenspace size, shape and greenness may have limited effect, whereas increasing greenery at greenspace edges and enhancing greenspace cohesion are more effective means of extending cooling benefits. In turn, findings from Taipei Metropolis suggest urban planners ought to: consider relative locations in the city when designing a cooling intervention; work to preserve large greenspaces; extent greenery at greenspace surroundings and find means to connect existing cool islands.

TI  - Assessing the impact of climatic parameters and their inter-annual seasonal variability on fire activity using time series satellite products in South China (2001-2014)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - China has a serious wildfire problem with a large number of fires in the south of the country especially during the winter (DJF) and spring (MAM) seasons. This study focused on identifying the causes of variability in inter-annual fire seasons. The relationship between fires and climatic parameters (precipitation, evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration) was evaluated on annual and seasonal (winter, spring) time scales. Certain other parameters (moisture balance, surface moisture balance, coefficient of variability of daily precipitation and ratio between evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration) were also calculated and related to fire variability for both time scales. Inter-annual time scale was found not to be strong enough to explain fire activity in the region; however, inter-seasonal fire variability showed significant correlation with potential evapotranspiration and with the ratio between evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration. The relationship and relative variability between evapotranspiration and the potential evapotranspiration were found to have important effect on inter-seasonal fire variability as compared to the other parameters studied, and link fire activity in the region to large-scale climatic systems.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to examine risks of atrial fibrillation and death at discharge in stroke patients treated with thrombolysis in a subregional setting covering full calendar years with a clear study catchment drawn serving as a confirmatory statistical analysis from the northeast of England in the last 2 years.MethodsData between 16 June, 2013 and 15 June, 2015 were extracted from Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme in Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that has covered health service for Northumberland and North Tyneside.ResultsThe very old people aged 80 and above were less likely to have thrombolysis treatment, while there was no sex difference observed. Moreover, thrombolysis treatment was more likely to be given in ischemic patients with severe stroke symptoms. There was no difference in comorbidities including atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, and stroke/TIA as well. Those who received thrombolysis treatment were more likely to have atrial fibrillation or die at discharge. The ORs were higher after additionally adjusting for comorbidities. Similarly, these patients also had poorer scoring in modified Rankin scale than those who did not receive thrombolysis treatment. However, there was no difference at 6 months after survival.ConclusionFor future research, clinical outcomes in addition to atrial fibrillation and quality of life both at discharge and 6 months after thrombolysis treatment should be included for examination as well. For clinical practice, giving thrombolysis treatment in hospitals might need to be reconsidered if clinical outcomes were actually worse than not.

TI  - Durum Wheat Cover Analysis in the Scope of Policy and Market Price Changes: A Case Study in Southern Italy
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land systems are the result of human interactions with the natural environment, and subjective evidence of socio-economic and environmental interactions has been demonstrated. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to analyze empirically the link between agricultural market and policy, as well as the environmental response due to changes in crop management by local stakeholders. In this study, we propose a cross investigation and analysis to bring the link between vegetation cover, policy, market and farmer's behavior to light. Our methodology is a combination of a rational positive and analogical approach between the quantifiable and non-quantifiable agents on a temporal basis. The method is applied to a dominant mono-crop agricultural watershed in Southern Italy that has been dedicated to durum wheat cultivation. In this region, we studied the relationship between the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), durum wheat market price, vegetation cover and land allocation. As a first step, we conducted a separate analysis for each factor, exploiting Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observed Leaf Area Index (LAI) to analyze the land vegetation space-time distribution over the period 2000-2014 and three Land Satellite (Landsat) validated images as check-points for the agricultural pattern and CAP's reforms. We used the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) and Eurostat data to investigate the on-farm accountancy and the durum wheat market price changes, respectively. Based on the study period, we developed a storyline of the major relevant CAP's policy changes. In a second step, we conducted a comparative analysis where the CAP's reforms were used as interpretational support, the land allocation and the on-farm accountability for CAP's implementation, the price of durum wheat and the LAI for analytical comparison. We found interesting insights regarding the non-agronomic driving forces of LAI dynamics. The behavior of the individual farmers is influenced by the CAP policy that has been implemented by using profitability as the stimulus for the decision making of the farmer. This explains the correlation of the trend between the market price, the LAI of durum wheat and their associated dynamics.

TI  - Specific Land Cover Class Mapping by Semi-Supervised Weighted Support Vector Machines
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many remote sensing projects on land cover mapping, the interest is often in a sub-set of classes presented in the study area. Conventional multi-class classification may lead to a considerable training effort and to the underestimation of the classes of interest. On the other hand, one-class classifiers require much less training, but may overestimate the real extension of the class of interest. This paper illustrates the combined use of cost-sensitive and semi-supervised learning to overcome these difficulties. This method utilises a manually-collected set of pixels of the class of interest and a random sample of pixels, keeping the training effort low. Each data point is then weighted according to its distance to its near positive data point to inform the learning algorithm. The proposed approach was compared with a conventional multi-class classifier, a one-class classifier, and a semi-supervised classifier in the discrimination of high-mangrove in Saloum estuary, Senegal, from Landsat imagery. The derived classification accuracies were high: 93.90% for the multi-class supervised classifier, 90.75% for the semi-supervised classifier, 88.75% for the one-class classifier, and 93.75% for the proposed method. The results show that accuracy achieved with the proposed method is statistically non-inferior to that achieved with standard binary classification, requiring however much less training effort.

TI  - Evaluating the effectiveness, impact and safety of live attenuated and seasonal inactivated influenza vaccination: protocol for the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Effectiveness II (SIVE II) study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Seasonal (inactivated) influenza vaccination is recommended for all individuals aged 65+ and in individuals under 65 who are at an increased risk of complications of influenza infection, for example, people with asthma. Live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was recommended for children as they are thought to be responsible for much of the transmission of influenza to the populations at risk of serious complications from influenza. A phased roll-out of the LAIV pilot programme began in 2013/2014. There is limited evidence for vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the populations targeted for influenza vaccination. The aim of this study is to examine the safety and effectiveness of the live attenuated seasonal influenza vaccine programme in children and the inactivated seasonal influenza vaccination programme among different age and at-risk groups of people.Methods and analysis: Test negative and cohort study designs will be used to estimate VE. A primary care database covering 1.25 million people in Scotland for the period 2000/2001 to 2015/2016 will be linked to the Scottish Immunisation Recall Service (SIRS), Health Protection Scotland virology database, admissions to Scottish hospitals and the Scottish death register. Vaccination status (including LAIV uptake) will be determined from the primary care and SIRS database. The primary outcome will be influenza-positive real-time PCR tests carried out in sentinel general practices and other healthcare settings. Secondary outcomes include influenza-like illness and asthma-related general practice consultations, hospitalisations and death. An instrumental variable analysis will be carried out to account for confounding. Self-controlled study designs will be used to estimate the risk of adverse events associated with influenza vaccination.Ethics and dissemination: We obtained approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee, West Midlands-Edgbaston. The study findings will be presented at international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.

For this purpose, variations in the spectral response of these sub-provinces in IRS P6 LISS III data are enhanced using principal component (PC) and independent component (IC) methods to spatially delineate the geomorphic sub-provinces and associated Quaternary sediments. It has been observed that the false colour composite derived using IC (first, second and third ICs) are effective in enhancing fluvial sub-provinces, while IC band 4, band 3 and band 2 are suitable to delineate coastal sub-provinces. On the other hand, PC composite derived using band 4, band 3 and band 1 are suitable to delineate different Quaternary sediments deposited within the spatial extent of geomorphic sub-provinces. Fused image enhanced products of IRS (Indian Remote Sensing Satellite) LISS III band and ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) polarisation bands are used to supplement and complement the variations observed for each geomorphic province in optical data as radar interactions are sensitive to variation in moisture and surface cover. Although there is a strong synergy between the spatial extent of geomorphic sub-provinces and the Quaternary units in terms of spatial disposition, different Quaternary units are also found within the same geomorphic province. Therefore, we have segmented each geomorphic sub-provinces based on the spatial extent of the different Quaternary deposits to identify few geoenvironmental (termed here as geomorpho-environmental) zones. In this regard, eleven zones are identified. Each zone has been characterised based on geomorphic stability, potentiality for agriculture practice, scope for urban development and reclamation. These geoenvironmental zones may provide important input to planners.

TI  - Remembering Our Forebears: Albert Jan Kluyver and the Unity of Life
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dutch microbiologist/biochemist Albert Jan Kluyver (1888-1956) was an early proponent of the idea of biochemical unity, and how that concept might be demonstrated through the careful study of microbial life. The fundamental relatedness of living systems is an obvious correlate of the theory of evolution, and modern attempts to construct phylogenetic schemes support this relatedness through comparison of genomes. The approach of Kluyver and his scientific descendants predated the tools of modern molecular biology by decades. Kluyver himself is poorly recognized today, yet his influence at the time was profound. Through lens of today however, it has been argued that the focus by Kluyver and others to create taxonomic and phylogenetic schemes using morphology and biochemistry distorted and hindered progress of the discipline of microbiology, because of a perception that the older approaches focused too much on a reductionist worldview. This essay argues that in contrast the careful characterization of fundamental microbial metabolism and physiology by Kluyver made many of the advances of the latter part of the twentieth century possible, by offering a framework which in many respects anticipated our current view of phylogeny, and by directly and indirectly training a generation of scientists who became leaders in the explosive growth of biotechnology.

TI  - Improving the reliability of photovoltaic-based hybrid power system with battery storage in low wind locations
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The optimum configurations of photovoltaic-micro wind hybrid power systems with battery storage are determined for 12 low windy locations in the Indian western Himalayas which will provide inputs to formulate a policy for the renewable energy based hybrid systems in the region. The objective is to utilize the available wind resource to supplement the solar resource for improving reliability and minimizing energy storage requirements of hybrid systems. In the analysis 7 micro turbines ranging from 1 kW(p) to 5 kWp are considered. The solar and wind resource assessment of the region shows good solar resource of 4.11-5.24 kWh/m(2)/day but low wind resource with wind speeds ranging from 2 to 3.6 m/s. However, wind speeds more than 5 m/s are also available for about 1000 h annually indicating potential for small wind power generation. The feasibility analysis is carried out for 12 locations using measured data for one location and NASA satellite data for other 11 locations. A 1 kWp micro-wind turbine with cut in speed of 2 m/s is found to generate maximum energy annually for these locations for a typical load. The methodology can be used for identifying optimum micro-wind PV hybrid systems for low wind locations worldwide. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of the Metasin assay for intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the preferred surgical technique for staging the axilla in clinically node-negative breast cancer. Accurate intraoperative staging allows for the immediate performance of an axillary clearance in node-positive patients. We assessed the Metasin assay for the intraoperative analysis of SLNs in a prospective evaluation of 250 consecutive patients undergoing intraoperative SLN analysis at the Breast Unit, University Hospital, Southampton, UK.Methods Metasin uses a quantitative reverse transcription PCR to detect two markers of metastasis: cytokeratin 19 (CK19) an epithelial marker and mammaglobin (MGB) a breast specific marker. Metasin results were compared with the results from routine paraffin block histopathology.Results Metasin was robust, with a failure rate of < 1%, and demonstrated excellent accuracy and reproducibility. The average turnaround time for the Metasin assay was 42 min, the largest variable being the number of nodes assayed. A total of 533 SLNs were evaluated with 75 patients testing positive for MGB and/or CK19. Based on the analysis of individual SLNs, the overall concordance between Metasin and histology was 92.3% (sensitivity 88.7%, specificity 92.9%). When adjusted for tissue allocation bias, the concordance was 93.8% (sensitivity 89.8%, specificity 94.6%). In this evaluation, 57/250 patients (23%) proceeded to axillary clearance based on Metasin results and were considered spared a second operative procedure.Conclusions Metasin has proven to be an accurate, reproducible and reliable laboratory test. The analysis time is acceptable for intraoperative use, and in comparison to routine histology demonstrates acceptable concordance, sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Whose children are they? A transnational minority religious sect and schools as sites of conflict in Canada, 1890-1922
T2  - PAEDAGOGICA HISTORICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1874, 6000 Old Colony Mennonites, an ethno-religious minority sect, immigrated to the Canadian prairies from Russia, after negotiating a charter of privileges with the federal government. Chief among these freedoms was the right to educate their children without government interference. Between 1890 and 1922, tensions mounted between the Mennonites and the government over issues related to schooling, culminating in the 1922 exodus to Latin America. Archival evidence - school inspector reports, personal correspondence and German and English-language newspapers - illustrates how a lack of identity with a nation-state rendered government attempts at assimilation through schooling ineffective. The transnational lens elucidates why these Mennonites were not moved by state efforts; their allegiance was to their own community and to the kingdom of God, but not to any particular nation. Successive legislation - the 1890 Schools Act, the 1907 law mandating that the Union Jack flag be flown outside schools, and the School Attendance Act - though not directed solely at the Mennonites, made it harder for them to conduct their schools according to tradition. Schooling served as the primary locus through which their language, religion and worldview were transmitted and these goals often conflicted directly with predominant concepts of education.

TI  - Quantifying River Channel Stability at the Basin Scale
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines the feasibility of a basin-scale scheme for characterising and quantifying river reaches in terms of their geomorphological stability status and potential for morphological adjustment based on auditing stream energy. A River Energy Audit Scheme (REAS) is explored, which involves integrating stream power with flow duration to investigate the downstream distribution of Annual Geomorphic Energy (AGE). This measure represents the average annual energy available with which to perform geomorphological work in reshaping the channel boundary. Changes in AGE between successive reaches might indicate whether adjustments are likely to be led by erosion or deposition at the channel perimeter. A case study of the River Kent in Cumbria, UK, demonstrates that basin-wide application is achievable without excessive field work and data processing. However, in addressing the basin scale, the research found that this is inevitably at the cost of a number of assumptions and limitations, which are discussed herein. Technological advances in remotely sensed data capture, developments in image processing and emerging GIS tools provide the near-term prospect of fully quantifying river channel stability at the basin scale, although as yet not fully realized. Potential applications of this type of approach include system-wide assessment of river channel stability and sensitivity to land-use or climate change, and informing strategic planning for river channel and flood risk management.

TI  - Monitoring DNA Damage in Gills of Freshwater Mussels (<i>Anodonta anatina</i>) Exposed to Heavy Metals
T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study was carried out to investigate the genotoxic effect of different levels of heavy metals on gill cells of freshwater mussels (Anodonta ananna), a sentinel species in aquatic environment Freshwater mussels were exposed to none (0 mu g L-1), low (120 mu g medium (240 mu g L-1) and high (360 mu g L-1) levels of lead (Pb), chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) alone and in combinations (Pb + Cr + Cu) for 15 days under laboratory conditions. Gill cells of mussels were used to determine the DNA damage by comet assay The tail DNA (%), comet tail length and olive tail moment (OTM) were the parameters selected to detect DNA damage Low doses (120 mu g L-1) of each metal induced significantly higher levels of DNA strands breaks as compared to medium dose (240 mu g L-1) and very low levels of DNA damaged was observed at high dose (360 mu g L-1). Cu and Pb showed significantly higher value of % of tail DNA (56.74 +/- 1.81, 47.36 +/- 1.23) and comet tail length (41.30 +/- 0 758, 49.15 +/- 1.90), respectively, as compared to Cr and combined metal exposure (Pb + Cu + Cr). The lowest levels of DNA damage for all the parameters were observed in combined metal treatment Genotoxic effect of metals on freshwater mussels is very important to assess the aquatic health and could be suggested as biomarker It is concluded that the Cu and Pb induced more DNA damage as compared to Cr and combined metal exposure (Pb + Cu + Cr) Moreover, our results showed that the low dose treatment of metals have more genotoxic effect as compared to the medium and high doses

TI  - Comparison of Intraoperative γ-Probe Imaging and Postoperative SPECT/CT in Detection of Sentinel Nodes Related to the Ovary
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tracer injection into ovarian ligaments has been shown to detect sentinel nodes (SNs) in patients with ovarian cancer. To determine the possibility that SNs are missed, this feasibility study compared their detection during surgery with their detection on postoperative SPECT/CT. Methods: In 8 patients (with either ovarian or endometrial cancer), after a staging lymphadenectomy including resection of SNs related to the ovary, SPECT/CT was performed within 24 h. Results: SPECT/CT identified hotspots in 4 patients at sites where SNs were resected. In 6 patients, additional sites were found, mainly in the pelvic region. Conclusion: Discrepancies between the gamma-probe and SPECT/CT may be due to missed SNs during surgery, but with respect to pelvic hotspots, in most cases they are more probably related to remnants of tracer at injection sites. With respect to sites where SNs were resected, remaining hotspots may have been caused by residual lymphatic flow after resection.

TI  - Estimation of daily PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations in Italy (2006-2012) using finely resolved satellite data, land use variables and meteorology
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Health effects of air pollution, especially particulate matter (PM), have been widely investigated. However, most of the studies rely on few monitors located in urban areas for short-term assessments, or land use/dispersion modelling for long-term evaluations, again mostly in cities. Recently, the availability of finely resolved satellite data provides an opportunity to estimate daily concentrations of air pollutants over wide spatio-temporal domains. Italy lacks a robust and validated high resolution spatio-temporally resolved model of particulate matter. The complex topography and the air mixture from both natural and anthropogenic sources are great challenges difficult to be addressed. We combined finely resolved data on Aerosol Optical Depth (ACID) from the Multi Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm, ground-level PM10 measurements, land use variables and meteorological parameters into a four-stage mixed model framework to derive estimates of daily PM10 concentrations at 1-km2 grid over Italy, for the years 2006-2012. We checked performance of our models by applying 10-fold cross-validation (CV) for each year. Our models displayed good fitting, with mean CV-R2 = 0.65 and little bias (average slope of predicted VS observed PM10 = 0.99). Out-of-sample predictions were more accurate in Northern Italy (Po valley) and large conurbations (e.g. Rome), for background monitoring stations, and in the winter season. Resulting concentration maps showed highest average PIVim levels in specific areas (Po river valley, main industrial and metropolitan areas) with decreasing trends over time. Our daily predictions of PM10 concentrations across the whole Italy will allow, for the first time, estimation of long-term and short-term effects of air pollution nationwide, even in areas lacking monitoring data.

TI  - Patterns of bird diversity and habitat use in mixed vineyard-matorral landscapes of Central Chile
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean climate region of central Chile is rich in biodiversity and contains highly productive agricultural lands, which creates challenges for the preservation of natural habitats and native biodiversity. Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes diffidult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportunities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, it's important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.

TI  - Mapping poverty using mobile phone and satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Poverty is one of the most important determinants of adverse health outcomes globally, a major cause of societal instability and one of the largest causes of lost human potential. Traditional approaches to measuring and targeting poverty rely heavily on census data, which in most low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) are unavailable or out-of-date. Alternate measures are needed to complement and update estimates between censuses. This study demonstrates how public and private data sources that are commonly available for LMICs can be used to provide novel insight into the spatial distribution of poverty. We evaluate the relative value of modelling three traditional poverty measures using aggregate data from mobile operators and widely available geospatial data. Taken together, models combining these data sources provide the best predictive power (highest r(2) = 0.78) and lowest error, but generally models employing mobile data only yield comparable results, offering the potential to measure poverty more frequently and at finer granularity. Stratifying models into urban and rural areas highlights the advantage of using mobile data in urban areas and different data indifferent contexts. The findings indicate the possibility to estimate and continually monitor poverty rates at high spatial resolution in countries with limited capacity to support traditional methods of data collection.

TI  - MACv2-SP: a parameterization of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect for use in CMIP6
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple plume implementation of the second version (v2) of the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, MACv2-SP, is described. MACv2-SP provides a prescription of anthropogenic aerosol optical properties and an associated Twomey effect. It was created to provide a harmonized description of post-1850 anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing for climate modeling studies. MACv2-SP has been designed to be easy to implement, change and use, and thereby enable studies exploring the climatic effects of different patterns of aerosol radiative forcing, including a Twomey effect. MACv2-SP is formulated in terms of nine spatial plumes associated with different major anthropogenic source regions. The shape of the plumes is fit to the Max Planck Institute Aerosol Climatology, version 2, whose present-day (2005) distribution is anchored by surface-based observations. Two types of plumes are considered: one predominantly associated with biomass burning, the other with industrial emissions. These differ in the prescription of their annual cycle and in their optical properties, thereby implicitly accounting for different contributions of absorbing aerosol to the different plumes. A Twomey effect for each plume is prescribed as a change in the host model's background cloud-droplet population density using relationships derived from satellite data. Year-to-year variations in the amplitude of the plumes over the historical period (1850-2016) are derived by scaling the plumes with associated national emission sources of SO2 and NH3. Experiments using MACv2-SP are performed with the Max Planck Institute Earth System Model. The globally and annually averaged instantaneous and effective aerosol radiative forcings are estimated to be -0.6 and -0.5 W m(-2), respectively. Forcing from aerosol-cloud interactions (the Twomey effect) offsets the reduction of clear-sky forcing by clouds, so that the net effect of clouds on the aerosol forcing is small; hence, the clear-sky forcing, which is more readily measurable, provides a good estimate of the total aerosol forcing.

TI  - Detection of Archaeological Residues in Vegetated Areas Using Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Buried archaeological structures, such as earthworks and buildings, often leave traces at the surface by altering the properties of overlying material, such as soil and vegetation. These traces may be better visible from a remote perspective than on the surface. Active and passive airborne and spaceborne sensors acquiring imagery from the ultraviolet to infrared have been shown to reveal these archaeological residues following the application of various processing techniques. While the active microwave region of the spectrum, in the form of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has been used for archaeological prospection, particularly in desert regions, it has yet to be fully exploited to detect buried structures indirectly though proxy indicators in overlying materials in vegetated areas. Studies so far have tended to focus on the intensity of the SAR signal, without making full use of the phase. This paper demonstrates that SAR backscatter intensity, coherence and interferometry can be used to identify archaeological residues over a number of areas in the vicinity of Rome, Italy. SAR imagery from the COnstellation of small Satellites for the Mediterranean basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) have been obtained for the analysis: 77 scenes in Stripmap and 27 in Spotlight mode. Processing included multitemporal speckle filtering, coherence generation and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) creation from Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS). Comparison of these datasets with archaeological, geological, soil, vegetation and meteorological data reveal that several products derived from SAR data can expose various types of archaeological residues under different environmental conditions.

TI  - Correlation of satellite image time-series for the detection and monitoring of slow-moving landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow-moving landslides are widespread in many landscapes with significant impacts on the topographic relief, sediment transfer and human settlements. Their area-wide mapping and monitoring in mountainous terrain, however, is still challenging. The growing archives of optical remote sensing images offer great potential for the operational detection and monitoring of surface motion in such areas. This study proposes a multiple pairwise image correlation (MPIC) technique to obtain a series of redundant horizontal displacement fields, and different multi-temporal indicators for a more accurate detection and quantification of surface displacement. The technique is developed and tested on a series of monoscopic and stereoscopic Pleiades satellite images at a test site in the South French Alps. Empirical tests confirm that MPIC significantly increased detection accuracy (F- measure = 0.85) and that the measurement error can be reduced by averaging velocities from all pair combinations covering a given time-step (i.e. when stereo-pairs are available for at least one date). The derived inventory and displacement fields of 169 slow-moving landslides show a positive relationship between the landslide size and velocities, as well as a seasonal acceleration of the largest landslides in response to an increase in effective precipitation. The processing technique can be adapted to better exploit increasingly available time-series from a variety of optical satellites for the detection and monitoring of landslide displacement.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green fluorescence in early-stage breast cancer: a meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence is safe and has a high detection rate for SLNs. However, the results of this novel technique are heterogeneous. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ICG fluorescence method compared with the standard radioisotope (RI) method. All eligible studies were identified from 2005 through 2015. A proportion meta-analysis was performed using a fixed effects and/or random effects model based on the study heterogeneity. A total of 12 studies met the inclusion criteria and included 1736 women. There was no significant difference between ICG fluorescence and RI for SLN detection using either the fixed effects model [odds ratio (OR) 1.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87-1.90] or the random effects model (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.54-3.18). There were seven studies reporting the detection rate for tumor-positive SLN. The ICG fluorescence method was significantly better than the RI method in the fixed effects model (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.00-3.49) for staging axilla. However, there was no difference in the random effects model (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.74-4.86). There was study outcome heterogeneity for the detection of SLN but not for tumor-positive SLN. There was no publication bias observed in the studies included. The ICG fluorescence method has valid diagnostic performance for SLN detection and shows a trend toward better axilla staging compared with the RI method. ICG fluorescence is a useful alternative to RI for SLN biopsy.

TI  - Using Land-Use Change, Soil Characteristics, and a Semi-Automated On-Line GIS Database to Inventory Carolina Bays
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carolina Bay wetlands are common in the southeastern US Coastal Plain and important to water quality, carbon sequestration, and habitat. Only South Carolina and Georgia have statewide inventories. We developed and evaluated a novel way to identify and delineate Bays using Bay-dense Bladen County, NC as a testbed. We posited that Bay land use had changed in the past 40 years and that Bays comprise a small subset of their surrounding soils. We classified decadal Landsat images as forest, agriculture, urban, and water. We used 812 previously delineated Bays to identify common Bay soils. From areas with common Bay soils and land-use change, we identified 548 new Bays and delineated them using a semi-automated on-line digitization tool. We saved new Bays to a Google Fusion Table for download and integration within a GIS. To gauge accuracy, Bays were scored on soils, land-use change, wetland delineation, and landscape position. Potential errors included omission of some small Bays (3.3-14.6 % of total Bay area) and commission of misclassified Bays (11 % of 1360 Bays), an estimated overall accuracy of 74 to 86 %. With 1360 delineated Bays, we estimated that as many as 478 have not yet been identified. These are most likely < 5.76 ha.

TI  - A cloud detection algorithm-generating method for remote sensing data at visible to short-wave infrared wavelengths
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To realize highly precise and automatic cloud detection from multi-sensors, this paper proposes a cloud detection algorithm-generating (CDAG) method for remote sensing data from visible to short-wave infra-red (SWIR) bands. Hyperspectral remote sensing data with high spatial resolution were collected and used as a pixel dataset of cloudy and clear skies. In this paper, multi-temporal AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data with 224 bands at visible to SWIR wavelengths and a 20 m spatial resolution were used for the dataset. Based on the pixel dataset, pixels of different types of clouds and land cover were distinguished artificially and used for the simulation of multispectral sensors. Cloud detection algorithms for the multispectral remote sensing sensors were then generated based on the spectral differences between the cloudy and clear-sky pixels distinguished previously. The possi-bility of assigning a pixel as cloudy was calculated based on the reliability of each method. Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra and Suomi NPP VIIRS (Visible/Infrared Imaging Radiometer) were used for the cloud detection test with the CDAG method, and the results from each sensor were compared with the corresponding artificial results, demonstrating an accurate detection rate of more than 85%.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal LAI Modelling by Integrating Climate and MODIS LAI Data in a Mesoscale Catchment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is often represented by the leaf area index (LAI) in many ecological, hydrological and meteorological land surface models. However, the spatio-temporal dynamics of the vegetation are important to represent in these models. While the widely applied methods, such as the Canopy Structure Dynamic Model (CSDM) and the Double Logistic Model (DLM) are solely based on cumulative daily mean temperature data as input, a new spatio-temporal LAI prediction model referred to as the Temperature Precipitation Vegetation Model (TPVM) is developed that also considers cumulative precipitation data as input into the modelling process. TPVM as well as CDSM and DLM model performances are compared and evaluated against filtered LAI data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The calibration/validation results of a cross-validation performed in the meso-scale Attert catchment in Luxembourg indicated that the DLM and TPVM generally provided more realistic and accurate LAI data. The TPVM performed superiorly for the agricultural land cover types compared to the other two models, which only used the temperature data. The Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC) between TPVM and the field measurement is 0.78, compared to 0.73 and 0.69 for the DLM and CSDM, respectively. The phenological metrics were derived from the TPVM model to investigate the interaction between the climate variables and the LAI variations. These interactions illustrated the dominant control of temperature on the LAI dynamics for deciduous forest cover, and a combined influence of temperature with precipitation for the agricultural land use areas.

TI  - Effects of green space dynamics on urban heat islands: Mitigation and diversification
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how green spaces affect urban temperature is crucial for assessing thermal benefits of landscape planning. This study investigated green space dynamics and land surface temperature (LST) in the Beijing metropolis. Landscape types were classified from QuickBird (2002) and IKONOS (2012) images and LST values were extracted from Landsat TM images. Five landscape types were obtained in this region including impervious land (IL), forest land (FL), grass land (GL), water body (WB), and bare land (BL). Green expansion indicated landscape change from IL and BL to FL and GL. Green loss indicated landscape change from FL and GL to IL. Green exchange indicated landscape change between FL and GL. Results show that (1) the area of green space dynamics accounted for 38.24% of the total research area, including green space losses (108.86 km(2)), expansion (92.49 km(2)), and exchange (53.83 km(2)). (2) LST change was not significant in the unchanged (0-0.19 degrees C) and exchanged green space (in the range of-0.02-0.25 degrees C). However, there were minor decreases of LST in areas of green expansion (in the range of-1.11 degrees C to-0.67 degrees C) and major increases in LST in the areas of green losses (1.64-2.21 degrees C). The results indicated that the number of green spaces is not the only criteria that should be assessed for temperature mitigation. Ecosystem services of temperature mitigation are not equal between the loss and expansion of green spaces even within same area. Greater focus on protecting natural forests in cities might provide greater benefits for climate mitigation.

TI  - MONITORING THE ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT OF OPEN-PIT COALFIELDS IN COLD ZONES OF NORTHEAST CHINA USING LANDSAT TIME SERIES IMAGES OF 2000-2015
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the deterioration of ecological environment and vegetation of coalfields caused by China's large-scale coal mining activities is important because of the fragile ecological environment and low temperature in cold and arid areas. This study takes the open coal pits of Haizhou, Gulianhe, and Huolinhe as examples and proposes a method for evaluating their ecological environment using Landsat time series images based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) variations of open-pit coalfields in cold and arid zones. The average NDVI value of the mining area each month was calculated using Landsat image data from 2000 to 2015. The vegetation cover area in the coalfields was extracted according to the NDVI threshold, and the scatter plots of the annual maximum NDVI and vegetation cover area were drawn. We fitted the variation trend line of maximum NDVI value and vegetation cover area to reduce the effect of meteorological factors on NDVI values. Results show that after the closure of open pit and reclamation of dump area, the NDVI of open-pit coalfields and vegetation cover area have been increasing rapidly over the last decade, and the ecological environment of these coalfields has obviously improved. The coal mining activities have led to the rapid decline of annual maximum NDVI and vegetation cover area of the coalfields in permafrost zones, and the ecological environment of coalfields continues to deteriorate. Although the quarterly average NDVI remains unchanged in non-permafrost mining coalfields under coal exploitation, the vegetation cover area in the coalfields decreases linearly, indicating that the ecological environment of the coalfields tends to deteriorate. From an ecological environment protection perspective, the results of this study provide a basis for decision making in constructing large-scale open pits in cold and arid zones.

TI  - Relation analyse of TSS with abundance of gastropods using Landsat Sattelite imagery in nongsa beach batam.
T2  - Journal of Biodiversity and Environmental Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Nongsa beach, residing in Nongsa Regency, Batam City is a territory whose economy's began developing by marine tourism. These activities will certainly have a negative impact to the condition of waters in Nongsa beach. One of the consequences is the decreasing of Gastropods population which has the most important role in aquatic ecosystem and is the bio-indicator of the waters. The purpose of this research is to know the composition and density of gastropods and to know the relation among TSS, sedimen fractions and organic matter with density of gastropods in Nongsa beach Batam. TSS and sedimen fractions contained in the bottom substrate are closely related to gastropods, because a kind of sedimen is a habitat preference for gastropods. Nutrients used by gastropods for feeding is needed to survive. TSS analysis can be used by satellite imagery procession. Landsat data was used to determine the concentration of TSS up to 25 meters deep. Using satellite imagery can simplify and accelerate of data analysis process. The statistics result of the validation test shows the coefficient of determination (R2=0.6662), which indicates the TSS concentration extracted from satellite images data of Landsat determined 66.6% the conditions in field. This research used the descriptive method and purposive sampling method to determine the object which was suitable with the purpose. TSS concentration are between 0,092 - 0,11mg/l. Various kinds of gastropods were found from Famili Strombidae, Muricidae, Neritidae, Ceritidae, Potamididae, Terrebridaedan Phasianellidae.

TI  - From Space to the Rocky Intertidal: Using NASA MODIS Sea Surface Temperature and NOAAWater Temperature to Predict Intertidal Logger Temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of satellite-derived datasets has greatly facilitated large-scale ecological studies, as in situ observations are spatially sparse and expensive undertakings. We tested the efficacy of using satellite sea surface temperature (SST) collected by NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and local water temperature collected from NOAA buoys and onshore stations to estimate submerged intertidal mussel logger temperatures. Daily SST and local water temperatures were compared to mussel logger temperatures at five study sites located along the Oregon coastline. We found that satellite-derived SSTs and local water temperatures were similarly correlated to the submerged mussel logger temperatures. This finding suggests that satellite-derived SSTs may be used in conjunction with local water temperatures to understand the temporal and spatial variation of mussel logger temperatures. While there are limitations to using satellite-derived temperature for ecological studies, including issues with temporal and spatial resolution, our results are promising.

TI  - Laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer: a prospective multicenter trial
T2  - LANGENBECKS ARCHIVES OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prospective multicenter trials have shown the feasibility of sentinel node (SN) navigation surgery using a dual tracer of dye and radioisotope for early gastric cancer. However, comparable trials using the indocyanine green (ICG) and the infrared ray laparoscopic system (IRLS) have not been reported. On the basis of our cohort studies, we assumed that the ICG imaging with the IRLS is as effective as the dual tracer in detecting SNs. Therefore, we conducted a prospective multicenter trial to assess the effectiveness and generalizability of the infrared ICG technique in patients with early gastric cancer.Patients with previously untreated cT1 gastric adenocarcinomas less than 4 cm in gross diameter were eligible for inclusion in this study. SN mapping was performed by using ICG combined with IRLS technique. Following biopsy of the identified SNs, D2 or modified D2 laparoscopic gastrectomy was performed according to the current Japanese Gastric Cancer Association guidelines.Among the 47 patients who gave written informed consent, 44 were eligible from the surgical findings, for whom SN biopsy was performed. The detection rate of the lymphatic basin by the ICG with IRLS was 100% (44/44). The accuracy was also 100% (7/7) for detecting metastatic lymph node, which was verified on the permanent pathologic examination. Following the median follow-up of 114 months (range, 60 to 120 months), no recurrence (0/40) was observed. Although the number of patients was unequally distributed among the hospitals participating in the trial, the detection rates of SNs in low-volume hospitals were comparable to those in high-volume hospitals. Consequently, there was no learning curve in this trial.The infrared ICG imaging accurately detected the lymphatic basin and SNs with occult metastasis in SN-navigated gastrectomy for gastric cancer. This method was feasible even for low-volume surgeons and hospitals.

TI  - New Snow Water Equivalent Processing System With Improved Resolution Over Europe and its Applications in Hydrology
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence and amount of snow, given in terms of snow water equivalent (SWE), is an essential physical characteristic influencing climate and hydrological processes. For the recent decades, remote sensing has proven to be a valuable tool for deriving regional and global scale information on SWE. However, determining SWE reliably from remote sensing data for many local-scale applications remains a challenge. Microwave radiometers are currently the best option to determine SWE since they respond to snow depth and density. Further, weather phenomena and solar illumination are not of concern. However, for some purposes the typical spatial resolution of space-borne radiometers (in the order of tens of kilometers) is not sufficient. In this study, the spatial resolution of existing operational SWE products (GlobSnow and H-SAF product portfolios) is improved by performing assimilation of ground truth observations of snow depth and space borne derived SWE estimates in a resolution grid of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees (approximately 5 km x 5 km). Some modifications to the SWE algorithm and the applied auxiliary data (such as an improved forest stem volume map) are introduced. We will present how the improved resolution enhances spatial details in the retrieved SWE, while the validation results show that in terms of accuracy, the new product is on similar level than the existing operational products. Finally, the gained new SWE estimates are ingested into the HOPS hydrological model in the Ounasjoki river basin. The results indicate that simulation of snow melt driven river discharge can be improved by ingesting the retrieved SWE data into a hydrological model.

TI  - Evaluation of using R-SCHA to simultaneously model main field and secular variation multilevel geomagnetic data for the North Atlantic
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One efficient approach to modelling the Earth's core magnetic field involves the inclusion of crossover marine data which cover areas lacking in observatory and repeat station data for epochs when precise three-component satellite magnetic field measurements were not common. In this study, we show how the Revised Spherical Cap Harmonic Analysis (R-SCHA) can appropriately provide a continuous time field model for the North Atlantic region by using multilevel sets of geomagnetic data such as marine, repeat station, observatory, and satellite data. Taking advantage of the properties of the R-SCHA basis functions we can model the radial and horizontal variations of the main field and its secular variation with the most suitable spatial and temporal wavelengths. To assess the best compromise between the data fit and the model roughness, temporal and spatial regularization matrices were implemented in the modelling approach. Two additional strategies were also used to obtain. a satisfactory regional model: the opportunity to fit the anomaly bias at each observatory location, and constraining the regional model to the CHAOS-6 model at the end of its period of validity, i.e. 1999-2000, allowing a smooth transition with the predictions of this recent model. In terms of the root mean square error, the degree of success was limited partly because of the high uncertainties associated with some of the datasets (especially the marine ones), but we have produced a model that performs comparably to the global models for the period 1960-2000, thus showing the benefits of using this regional technique.

TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA): where do we go with it?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay was initially developed for the intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph node metastases in breast cancer. This assay measures cytokeratin 19 (CK19) mRNA copy number and is widely used in hospitals. The results of the IBCSG 23-01, ACOSOG Z0011, and AMAROS trials demonstrated that no further axillary dissection is required for patients with sentinel lymph nodes that tested positive for cancer, which has led to a decreasing trend in the need for intraoperative assessment of lymph nodes. Here, I review studies relevant to OSNA and discuss perspectives on future applications of OSNA in cancer surgery. The studies reviewed were identified by carrying out a search on PubMed for all articles pertaining to OSNA and published prior to the end of June 2016 using the keywords "OSNA" or "one-step nucleic acid amplification" in the title or abstract. Method comparison studies between OSNA and pathological assessment for the detection of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer revealed that in a pooled assessment OSNA had a high specificity (94.8 %), high concordant rate (93.8 %), and a negative predictive value (97.6 %). Similar results have been found for gastric, colorectal, and lung cancers in multicenter studies. These results demonstrate that OSNA can serve as an alternative method to pathological assessment for examining lymph node metastasis. Multicenter prospective studies with a large sample size are needed to definitively reveal the superiority of OSNA over pathological assessment to predict prognosis. Technical refinements to improve the assay are essential to its further development as a new standard for testing in place of pathological examination.

TI  - A revisit to decadal change of aerosol optical depth and its impact on global radiation over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global radiation over China decreased between the 1960s and 1990, since when it has remained stable. As the total cloud cover has continued to decrease since the 1960s, variations in aerosols were suggested in previous studies to be the primary cause for variations in global radiation over China. However, the effect of aerosols on global radiation on a decadal scale has not been physically quantified over China. In this study, aerosol optical depth (ADD) data since 1980 are estimated by combining horizontal visibility data at stations in China and AOD observed by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). It is found that the AOD exhibits decadal changes, with two decreasing periods (before the end of 1980s and after 2006) and one increasing period (from 1990 to 2006). With the derived ADD, a clear sky model is then applied to quantify the role of aerosols in the variations in global radiation over China. The results show that aerosol direct effect cannot fully explain the decadal variations in the global radiation over China between 1980 and 2010, though it has a considerable effect on global radiation climatology. There are significant differences between the trends of clear-sky global radiation impacted by aerosols and those of all-sky global radiation impacted by aerosols and clouds, and the correlation coefficient for the comparison is very low. Therefore, the variations in all-sky global radiation over China are likely to be due to changes in cloud properties and to interactions between clouds and aerosols. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterization of basic immune function parameters in the fathead minnow (<i>Pimephales promelas</i>), a common model in environmental toxicity testing
T2  - FISH & SHELLFISH IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) is an environmental sentinel species, commonly used in toxicity testing. However, there is a lack of data regarding basic immune function in this species. To improve the usefulness of the fathead minnow as a model for basic immune function and immunotoxicity, this study sought to 1) compare the differential expression of immune function genes in nave fathead minnows and 2) determine the effects of pathogen exposure on immune gene expression and spleen index. To accomplish this, kidney, spleen and liver tissue were collected three days post injection (dpi) from adult male fathead minnows from each of the following groups: 1) uninjected control 2) sham-injected (Hank's balanced salt solution) and 3) pathogen-injected (Yersinia ruckeri). Spleen tissue was also collected at seven and 14 dpi. Differential tissue expression of immune function genes was evaluated in nave minnows and expression patterns were similar to those found in other fish species, with liver tissue generally having the highest amount of expression. Following pathogen injection, the expression of complement component 3 (c3) (4.4-fold, kidney; 2.5-fold, liver), interleukin 11 (il11) (4.8-fold, kidney; 15.2-fold, liver) and interleukin 1 beta (il1 beta) (8.2-fold, kidney; 17.2-fold, spleen; 2.6-fold, liver) were significantly upregulated. Elastase 2 (elas2) was significantly downregulated (5.8-fold) in liver tissue. A significant increase in spleen index at seven dpi was also observed in pathogen-injected minnows. This study has identified endpoints that are part of the normal response to pathogen in fathead minnows, an essential step toward the development of the fathead minnow as a model for immunotoxicity evaluations.

TI  - Impacts of state-led and bottom-up urbanization on land use change in the peri-urban areas of Shanghai: Planned growth or uncontrolled sprawl?
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last several decades since the opening reform, peri-urbanization emerged in the developed areas of China. In Shanghai, peri-urban areas expanded rapidly, and land use in these areas experienced significant changes and restructuring. This paper examines the expansion of peri-urban areas, and their social-economic characteristics in Shanghai from 1990 to 2009. By combining Landsat TM images and land use maps based on site survey, this paper analyzes the spatio-temporal characteristics of land use change in the peri-urban areas of Shanghai, and we find that expansion of non-agricultural land has been mainly characterized by the growth of industrial land, and has caused significant loss of cultivated and forested land. This paper then examines the driving forces of land use change from the perspectives of state-led growth and bottom-up development. It argues that state-led growth has played a dominant role in the expansion of non-agricultural land, and the impact of bottom-up development has been much less significant. Planning has played a critical role in regulating the space to accommodate the increasing demand of population and economic growth while at the same time promoting space growth to attract outside investment.

TI  - Modeling above-ground carbon storage: a remote sensing approach to derive individual tree species information in urban settings
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation has gained importance in respective debates about climate change mitigation and adaptation in cities. Although recently developed remote sensing techniques provide necessary city-wide information, a sufficient and consistent city-wide information of relevant urban ecosystem services, such as carbon emissions offset, does not exist. This study uses city-wide, high-resolution, and remotely sensed data to derive individual tree species information and to estimate the above-ground carbon storage of urban forests in Berlin, Germany. The variance of tree biomass was estimated using allometric equations that contained different levels of detail regarding the tree species found in this study of 700 km(2), which had a tree canopy of 213 km(2). The average tree density was 65 trees/ha per unit of tree cover and a range from 10 to 40 trees/ha for densely urban land cover. City-wide estimates of the above-ground carbon storage ranged between 6.34 and 7.69 tC/ha per unit of land cover, depending on the level of tree species information used. Equations that did not use individually localized tree species information undervalued the total amount of urban forest carbon storage by up to 15 %. Equations using a generalized estimate of dominant tree species information provided rather precise city-wide carbon estimates. Concerning differences within a densely built area per unit of land cover approaches using individually localized tree species information prevented underestimation of mid-range carbon density areas (10-20 tC/ha), which were actually up to 8.4 % higher, and prevented overestimation of very low carbon density areas (0-5 tC/ha), which were actually up to 11.4 % lower. Park-like areas showed 10 to 30 tC/ha, whereas land cover of very high carbon density (40-80 tC/ha) mostly consisted of mixed peri-urban forest stands. Thus, this approach, which uses widely accessible and remotely sensed data, can help to improve the consistency of forest carbon estimates in cities.

TI  - Which ocean colour algorithm for MERIS in North West European waters?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl a) is a key parameter for the assessment of water quality in coastal and shelf environments. The availability of satellite ocean colour offers the potential of monitoring these regions at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales, as long as a high level of accuracy can be achieved. To use satellite derived Chl a to monitor these environments, it is imperative that rigorous accuracy assessments are undertaken to select the most accurate ocean colour algorithm(s).To this end, the accuracy of a range of ocean colour Chl a algorithms for use with Medium Imaging Resolution Spectrometer (MERIS) Level 2 (L2) Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs), using two different atmospheric correction (AC) processors (COASTCOLOUR and MERIS Ground Segment processor version 8.0 - MEGS8.0), were assessed in North West European waters. A total of 594 measurements of R-rs(lambda) and/or Chl a were made in the North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, along the Portuguese Coast English Channel and Celtic Sea between June 2001 and March 2012, where Chl a varied from 0.2 to 35 mg m(-3). The following algorithms were compared: MERIS Case 1 water Chl a algorithm OC4Me, the MERIS Case 2 algorithm Algal Pigment 2 (AP2), the MODIS-Aqua Case 1 Chl a algorithm OC3 adapted for MERIS (OC3Me), the MODIS-Aqua Garver-Siegel-Maritorena algorithm (GSM) adapted for MERIS and the Gohin et al. (2002) algorithm for MERIS (005Me). For both COASTCOLOUR and MEGS8.0 processors, OC5Me was the most accurate Chl a algorithm, which was within similar to 25% of in situ values in these coastal and shelf waters. The uncertainty in MEGS8.0 R(rs)4442) (similar to 17%) was slightly higher compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 12%) from 0.3 to 7 mg m(-3) Chl a, but for R-rs(560)the uncertainty was lower for MEGS8.0 (similar to 10%) compared to COASTCOLOUR (similar to 13%), which meant that MEGS8.0 Chl a was more accurate than COASTCOLOUR for all of the Chl a algorithms tested. Compared to 005Me, OC4Me tended to over-estimate Chl a, which was caused by non-algal SPM especially at values >14 g M-3. GSM also over-estimated Chl a, which was caused by variations in absorption coefficient of coloured dissolved organic matter at 442 nm (a(CDOM)(442)). AP2 consistently under-estimated Chl a, especially when non-algal SPM was >4 g m(-3). (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Characterization of spatial variability of soil physicochemical properties and its impact on Rhodes grass productivity
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterization of soil properties is a key step in understanding the source of spatial variability in the productivity across agricultural fields. A study on a 16 ha field located in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia was undertaken to investigate the spatial variability of selected soil properties, such as soil compaction `SC', electrical conductivity `EC', pH (acidity or alkalinity of soil) and soil texture and its impact on the productivity of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana L.). The productivity of Rhodes grass was investigated using the Cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (CNDVI), which was determined from Landsat-8 (OLI) images. The statistical analysis showed high spatial variability across the experimental field based on SC, clay and silt; indicated by values of the coefficient of variation (CV) of 22.08%, 21.89% and 21.02%, respectively. However, low to very low variability was observed for soil EC, sand and pH; with CV values of 13.94%, 7.20% and 0.53%, respectively. Results of the CNDVI of two successive harvests showed a relatively similar trend of Rhodes grass productivity across the experimental area (r = 0.74, p= 0.0001). Soil physicochemical layers of a considerable spatial variability (SC, clay, silt and EC) were utilized to delineate the experimental field into three management zones (MZ-1, MZ-2 and MZ-3); which covered 30.23%, 33.85% and 35.92% of the total area, respectively. The results of CNDVI indicated that the MZ-1 was the most productive zone, as its major areas of 50.28% and 45.09% were occupied by the highest CNDVI classes of 0.97-1.08 and 4.264.72, for the first and second harvests, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring Rice Agriculture across Myanmar Using Time Series Sentinel-1 Assisted by Landsat-8 and PALSAR-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment and monitoring of rice agriculture over large areas has been limited by cloud cover, optical sensor spatial and temporal resolutions, and lack of systematic or open access radar. Dense time series of open access Sentinel-1 C-band data at moderate spatial resolution offers new opportunities for monitoring agriculture. This is especially pertinent in South and Southeast Asia where rice is critical to food security and mostly grown during the rainy seasons when high cloud cover is present. In this research application, time series Sentinel-1A Interferometric Wide images ( 632) were utilized to map rice extent, crop calendar, inundation, and cropping intensity across Myanmar. An updated ( 2015) land use land cover map fusing Sentinel-1, Landsat-8 OLI, and PALSAR-2 were integrated and classified using a randomforest algorithm. Time series phenological analyses of the dense Sentinel-1 data were then executed to assess rice information across all of Myanmar. The broad land use land cover map identified 186,701 km(2) of cropland across Myanmar with mean out-of-sample kappa of over 90%. A phenological time series analysis refined the cropland class to create a rice mask by extrapolating unique indicators tied to the rice life cycle ( dynamic range, inundation, growth stages) from the dense time series Sentinel-1 to map rice paddy characteristics in an automated approach. Analyses show that the harvested rice area was 6,652,111 ha with general ( R-2 = 0.78) agreement with government census statistics. The outcomes show strong ability to assess and monitor rice production at moderate scales over a large cloud-prone region. In countries such as Myanmar with large populations and governments dependent upon rice production, more robust and transparent monitoring and assessment tools can help support better decision making. These results indicate that systematic and open access Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can help scale information required by food security initiatives and Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification programs.

TI  - Drifting towards ceftriaxone treatment failure in gonorrhoea: risk factor analysis of data from the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme in England and Wales
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is threatened by the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We analysed data from the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance Programme (GRASP) in England and Wales to identify groups most at risk of reduced susceptibility to the currently recommended first-line therapy, ceftriaxone.Methods Data from GRASP between 2007 and 2013 on ceftriaxone susceptibility and strain types were analysed. Risk factors associated with isolates exhibiting a ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of >= 0.015 mg/L (CTR >= 0.015 mg/L) were identified using logistic regression.Results One third of isolates from men who have sex with men (MSM) (1279/4203) and 9.9% from heterosexuals (458/4626) exhibited CTR >= 0.015 mg/L. Between 2007 and 2013, the modal MIC for isolates remained at 0.004 mg/L for MSM but increased from 0.002 to 0.004 mg/L for heterosexuals. Among MSM, CTR >= 0.015 mg/L was associated with Asian ethnicity (crude OR: 1.42; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.88) and previous gonorrhoea (1.34; 1.16 to 1.54). Among heterosexuals, CTR >= 0.015 mg/L was associated with older age (35+ years: 4.31; 3.34 to 5.55), >= 6 sexual partners (1.58; 1.01 to 2.44) and sex abroad (2.23; 1.71 to 2.91). CTR >= 0.015 mg/L was less likely in isolates from heterosexuals of black Caribbean or African ethnicity (0.29; 0.20 to 0.41, 0.66; 0.43 to 0.99), with a concurrent chlamydial infection (0.25; 0.19 to 0.34) or women (0.57; 0.46 to 0.71). Over 600 isolates (CTR >= 0.015 mg/L) were typed; the majority were in Genogroup 1407, containing sequence type 1407.Conclusions The emergence and spread of gonorrhoea with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone seems a realistic prospect, most likely in those involved in 'rapid-transmission' or bridging sexual networks.

TI  - Soil, land use time, and sustainable intensification of agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado region
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado area is in rapid decline because of the expansion of modern agriculture. In this study, we used extensive field data and a 30-year chronosequence of Landsat images (1980-2010) to assess the effects of time since conversion of Cerrado into agriculture upon soil chemical attributes and soybean/corn yield in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed. We determined the rates of vegetation conversion into agriculture, the agricultural land use time since conversion, and the temporal changes in topsoil (0-20 cm soil depth) and subsurface (20-40 cm) chemical attributes of the soils. In addition, we investigated possible associations between fertilization/over-fertilization and land use history detected from the satellites. The results showed that 61.8% of the native vegetation in the Alto do Rio Verde watershed was already converted into agriculture with 31% of soils being used in agriculture for more than 30 years. While other fertilizers in cultivated soils (e.g., Ca+2, Mg+2, and P) have been compensated over time by soil management practices to keep crop yield high, large reductions in C-org (38%) and N-tot (29%) were observed in old cultivated areas. Furthermore, soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming presented higher values of P and Mg+2 than the ideal levels necessary for plant development. Therefore, increased risks of over-fertilization of the soils and environmental contamination with these macronutrients were associated with soybean and cornfields having more than 10 years of farming, especially those with more than 30 years of agricultural land use.

TI  - Characterizing the relationship between land use land cover change and land surface temperature
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring changes in land use land cover (LULC) to understand the urban heat island (UHI) effect is valu-able for both communities and local governments in cities in developing countries, where urbanization and industrialization often take place rapidly but where coherent planning and control policies have not been applied. This work aims at determining and analyzing the relationship between LULC change and land surface temperature (LST) patterns in the context of urbanization. We first explore the relation-ship between LST and vegetation, man-made features, and cropland using normalized vegetation, and built-up indices within each LULC type. Afterwards, we assess the impacts of LULC change and urbanization in UHI using hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) and urban landscape analysis. Finally, we pro-pose a model applying non-parametric regression to estimate future urban climate patterns using predicted land cover and land use change. Results from this work provide an effective methodology for UHI characterization, showing that (a) LST depends on a nonlinear way of LULC types; (b) hotspot anal-ysis using Getis Ord Gi* statistics allows to analyze the LST pattern change through time; (c) UHI is influ-enced by both urban landscape and urban development type; (d) LST pattern forecast and UHI effect examination can be done by the proposed model using nonlinear regression and simulated LULC change scenarios. We chose an inner city area of Hanoi as a case-study, a small and flat plain area where LULC change is significant due to urbanization and industrialization. The methodology presented in this paper can be broadly applied in other cities which exhibit a similar dynamic growth. Our findings can represent an useful tool for policy makers and the community awareness by providing a scientific basis for sustain-able urban planning and management.

TI  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae in the UK: a national study (EuSCAPE-UK) on prevalence, incidence, laboratory detection methods and infection control measures
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To estimate UK prevalence and incidence of clinically significant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), and to determine epidemiological characteristics, laboratory methods and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in acute care facilities.Methods: A 6 month survey was undertaken in November 2013-April 2014 in 21 sentinel UK laboratories as part of the European Survey on Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae (EuSCAPE) project. Up to 10 consecutive, non-duplicate, clinically significant and carbapenem-non-susceptible isolates of Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae were submitted to a reference laboratory. Participants answered a questionnaire on relevant laboratory methods and IPC measures.Results: Of 102 isolates submitted, 89 (87%) were non-susceptible to >= 1 carbapenem, and 32 (36%) were confirmed as CPE. CPE were resistant to most antibiotics, except colistin (94% susceptible), gentamicin (63%), tigecycline (56%) and amikacin (53%). The prevalence of CPE was 0.02% (95% CI = 0.01%-0.03%). The incidence of CPE was 0.007 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI = 0.005-0.010), with north-west England the most affected region at 0.033 per 1000 patient-days (95% CI = 0.012-0.072). Recommended IPC measures were not universally followed, notably screening high-risk patients on admission (applied by 86%), using a CPE 'flag' on patients' records (70%) and alerting neighbouring hospitals when transferring affected patients (only 30%). Most sites (86%) had a laboratory protocol for CPE screening, most frequently using chromogenic agar (52%) or MacConkey/CLED agars with carbapenem discs (38%).Conclusions: The UK prevalence and incidence of clinically significant CPE is currently low, but these MDR bacteria affect most UK regions. Improved IPC measures, vigilance and monitoring are required.

TI  - Do livelihood typologies influence local perceptions of forest cover change? Evidence from a tropical forested and non-forested rural landscape in western Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Validation of scientific findings from satellite remote sensing against local ecological knowledge could make the interpretation of forest cover patterns more robust. In this paper, we examine local perceptions of forest cover change in parishes around Budongo and Bugoma for a 30-year period (1985-2014), compare the results with those obtained from remote sensing (Twongyirwe et al., 2015), and interrogate whether the perceptions could be related to livelihood typologies. First, we characterise household strategies for the entire landscape to place livelihood strategies of communities in deforestated areas in a broader local context. An in-depth questionnaire was administered to 706 households in 13 parishes situated in 4 Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs). The data included household demographic characteristics, energy use, cropping and livestock husbandry, and seasonal time- and labour-budgets. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were employed to help identify dominant structures in the data. Secondly, the 375 households in 7 parishes around Budongo and Bugoma forests (part of the 706) responded to additional questions that sought their perceptions on the forest cover trend. The PCA results for the entire landscape show that significant variation amongst households is mainly related to the cultivation time input, on-farm income particularly from cropping activities, livestock husbandry, demographic characteristics, agricultural extension activities, and cultivation labour input. Hierarchical CA shows that households at the landscape level fall into about nine different types, with variation in spatial distribution. The analysis suggests that poor households do live near forested regions, and that the rural poor are more reliant on forest products than pen-urban populations. Regarding perceptions of forest cover change, the majority (70.1%: n = 375) of the respondents in the parishes think that there has been a decline in forest cover, and this percentage is larger than the percentage of non-respondents (18.9%), those that thought it had increased (5.6%), not changed (3.7%), and those that did not know (1.6%). In addition, perceptions on forest change were significantly related to the household livelihood typologies (X-2 = 623.4, df = 4, p = 0.000): respondents who perceived forest cover as having declined and those that provided no response belonged to cluster 2 ("low income mixed farming households"), which is also the dominant livelihood typology around these forests. While the data largely suggest that there is a remarkable agreement between remote sensing results and local knowledge on forest change, and that local people may play a big role in filling data gaps where a dearth of information is prevalent (or where remote sensing 'evidence is fuzzy), there is a clear signal that people in different social classes and age groups can have very different views on what the change in forest cover might be despite what the remote sensing data show. This might have policy implications if decision makers tend to come from the groups that are not likely to have perceived forest cover change, or base their judgement on views from certain social classes. This implies that it is important to have the remote sensing data available as a counter balance to local perception (and vice versa) and therefore these data should be considered concurrently.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of classification algorithms and spatial resolution on the accuracy of land cover mapping in a mountain environment in Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images of various spatial resolutions and different image classification techniques have been utilized for land cover (LC) mapping at local and regional scale studies. Mapping capabilities and achievable accuracies of LC classification in a mountain environment are, however, influenced by the spatial resolution of the utilized images and applied classification techniques. Hence, developing and characterizing regionally optimized methods are essential for the planning and monitoring of natural resources. In this study, the potential of four non-parametric image classification techniques, i.e., k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and neural network (NN) on the accuracy of LC classification was evaluated in the Hindu Kush mountains ranges of northern Pakistan. Moreover, we have assessed the impact of the spatial resolution of the utilized satellite imagery, i.e., SPOT-5 with 2.5 m and Landsat-8 with 30 m on the accuracy of the derived LC classification. For the classification of LC based on SPOT-5, we have achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (OCA) = 89% with kappa coefficient (KC = 0.86) using SVM followed by k-NN, RF, and NN. However, for LC classification derived from Landsat-8 imagery, we achieved the highest OCA = 71% with KC = 0.59 using RF and SVM followed by k-NN and NN. The higher accuracy derived from SPOT-5 versus Landsat-8 indicated that the results of LC classification based on SPOT-5 are more accurate and reliable than Landsat-8. The findings of the present study will be useful for the classification and mapping task of LC in a mountain environment using SPOT-5 and Landsat-8 at local and regional scale studies.

T2  - CONTACT DERMATITIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Case reports constitute a classic publication format that is being increasingly appreciated, for example because of its educational value. In the field of contact dermatitis research, case reports often serve as sentinel publications concerning new allergens, or new exposures to knownallergens, or regarding other conditions leading to contact dermatitis. The CARE guideline published in 2013 addresses standardized and complete reporting of case reports in all fields of medicine. The present article takes up the CAREsuggestions, and further specifies these in terms of application to case reports in the field of contact dermatitis. The objective of this structured guidance is to provide junior or inexperienced doctors and researchers with an annotated list, against which the fulfilment of essential or optional items of a complete, high-quality case report to be submitted to Contact Dermatitis or other journals can be checked.

TI  - Integrating Radarsat-2, Lidar, and Worldview-3 Imagery to Maximize Detection of Forested Inundation Extent in the Delmarva Peninsula, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural variability in surface-water extent and associated characteristics presents a challenge to gathering timely, accurate information, particularly in environments that are dominated by small and/or forested wetlands. This study mapped inundation extent across the Upper Choptank River Watershed on the Delmarva Peninsula, occurring within both Maryland and Delaware. We integrated six quad-polarized Radarsat-2 images, Worldview-3 imagery, and an enhanced topographic wetness index in a random forest model. Output maps were filtered using light detection and ranging (lidar)-derived depressions to maximize the accuracy of forested inundation extent. Overall accuracy within the integrated and filtered model was 94.3%, with 5.5% and 6.0% errors of omission and commission for inundation, respectively. Accuracy of inundation maps obtained using Radarsat-2 alone were likely detrimentally affected by less than ideal angles of incidence and recent precipitation, but were likely improved by targeting the period between snowmelt and leaf-out for imagery collection. Across the six Radarsat-2 dates, filtering inundation outputs by lidar-derived depressions slightly elevated errors of omission for water (+1.0%), but decreased errors of commission (7.8%), resulting in an average increase of 5.4% in overall accuracy. Depressions were derived from lidar datasets collected under both dry and average wetness conditions. Although antecedent wetness conditions influenced the abundance and total area mapped as depression, the two versions of the depression datasets showed a similar ability to reduce error in the inundation maps. Accurate mapping of surface water is critical to predicting and monitoring the effect of human-induced change and interannual variability on water quantity and quality.

TI  - Distribution changes of woody plants in Western Iran as monitored by remote sensing and geographical information system: a case study of Zagros forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The status of woody plants in dry-land systems is a fundamental determinant of key ecosystem processes. Monitoring of this status plays an important role in understanding the dynamics of woody plants in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. The present study determined the dynamism of the Zagros forests in Iran using Remote Sensing and Geographic Information System techniques and statistical science. The results show that the density of trees varied from 10 to 53 % according to the physiographic and climatic conditions of semi-arid regions. The best and lowest correlation between vegetation indices and forest density were obtained for the global environmental monitoring index (GEMI; R (2) = 0.94) and soil adjust vegetation index (R (2) = 0.81), respectively. GEMI is used to monitor land use changes over a 10-year period. Results show that 2720 ha(2) of forest have been destroyed by human interference and tillage on steep slopes during this period which also resulted in the loss of the fertile soil layer. GEMI determined the areas with a biomass of trees and could normally separate border regions with low biomass density of trees from regions without canopy cover. The results revealed that assessment of forest and vegetation cover in arid and semi-arid arduous forest regions using satellite digital numbers and ordinary sampling is subject to uncertainty. A stratified grouping procedure should be established to increase the accuracy of assessment.

TI  - An optical tool for quantitative assessment of phycocyanin pigment concentration in cyanobacterial blooms within inland and marine environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative assessment of the pigment phycocyanin (PC) in cyanobacterial blooms is essential to assess their abundance and distribution and consequently aid their management in many recreational waters within inland and coastal environments. In contrast to the open-ocean waters, these water bodies are very complex with a pronounced heterogeneity of their optical properties, and hence accurate retrieval of the water-leaving radiances and PC concentration from satellite observations is notoriously difficult with existing algorithms. In the present study, a new inversion algorithm is developed as a rapid cyanobacteria bloom assessment method and its retrievals of PC are compared with in-situ and satellite observations and those from a previously reported inversion algorithm. The new algorithm estimates PC concentration on the basis of the unique absorption feature of phycocyanin at 620 nm which is isolated from the total pigment absorption by taking advantage of the well recognized absorption and reflectance features in the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (less impacted by the influences of the overlapping absorption signatures of the mixture constituents and pigment packaging). The by-products of this work include chl-a concentration and predictions from reflectance data to monitor the cyanobacterial component and non-cyanobacterial component of the phytoplankton assemblage and to evaluate PC:Chl-a pigment weight ratios for specific water types. Initial validation of the algorithm was performed using in-situ field data in turbid productive waters dominated by phycocyanin and other pigments, yielding coefficients of determination and slope close to unity and mean errors less than a few percent. These results suggest that the algorithm could be used as a rapid assessment tool for the remote-sensing assessment of the spatial distribution and relative abundance of cyanobacterial blooms in many regional water bodies.

TI  - Applying the chi-square transformation and automatic secant thresholding to Landsat imagery as unsupervised change detection methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the performance of change detection analysis, the change/unchanged pixel categorization is usually made through empirical methods or trial-and-error manual procedures whose reliability may affect the results. To detect land-cover changes, an unsupervised change detection technique was applied to Landsat images from an area in the south of Mexico. At first, normalized surface reflectance, principal components, and tasselled cap images were used to develop the chi-square transformation (CST) applied to each kind of image organized in absolute and relative values and thus, obtain the continuous image of change. Later, the histogram secant technique was applied to change images to automatically define the thresholds and categorize as change/unchanged the pixels. Finally, to assess the change detection accuracy, 86 polygons (14,512 pixels) were sampled, classified as real change/unchanged sites, and defined as ground-truth, from the interpretation of color aerial photo slides aided by the land-cover maps to obtain omission/commission errors and kappa coefficient of agreement. The results show that the CST and automatic histogram secant thresholding are suitable techniques that can be applied for unsupervised analysis change detection.

TI  - When being far away is good: Exploring how mortality salience, regulatory mode, and goal progress affect judgments of meaning in life
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research indicates that death-relevant thoughts (mortality salience) have a nuanced effect on judgments of life's meaningfulness. Thoughts of death diminish meaning in life only among people who lack or do not readily engage psychological structures that confer meaning. Building on this past research, the current research examined how an important source of meaning, long-term goal progress, affects the ways that death-relevant cognitions impact judgments of life's meaning. In Study 1 (N=118), mortality salience decreased perceptions of meaning in life only among participants who were induced to feel closer to (vs. farther from) completing a long-termgoal. Study 2 (N=259) extended these findings by demonstrating the moderating influence of individual differences in locomotion. Mortality salience again decreased perceptions of meaning in life among participants who felt closer to accomplishing a long-term goal, but it only did so among people who do not quickly adopt new goals to pursue (i.e., those low in locomotion). The implications of these findings for better understanding how people maintain meaning in the face of existential concerns and how aspects of goal pursuit affect these processes are discussed.

TI  - Developing spatially and thematically detailed backdated maps for land cover studies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global or regional land cover change on a decadal time scale can be studied at a high level of detail using the availability of remote sensing data such as that provided by Landsat. However, there are three main technical challenges in this goal. First, the generation of land cover maps without reference data is problematic (backdating). Second, it is important to maintain high accuracies in land cover change map products, requiring a reasonably rich legend within each map. Third, a high level of automation is necessary to aid the management of large volumes of data. This paper describes a robust methodology for processing time series of satellite data over large spatial areas. The methodology includes a retrospective analysis used for the generation of training and test data for historical periods lacking reference information. This methodology was developed in the context of research on global change in the Iberian Peninsula. In this study we selected two scenes covering geographic regions that are representative of the Iberian Peninsula. For each scene, we present the results of two classifications (1985-1989 and 2000-2004 quinquennia), each with a legend of 13 categories. An overall accuracy of over 92% was obtained for all 4 maps.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA OF BRASOV, ROMANIA, USING LANDSAT MULTITEMPORAL SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - An important objective of local authorities is to obtain quickly precise information concerning the land cover changes and to monitor them. This type of information can be gathered with the help of multitemporal satellite images Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). This paper identifies and analyzes the land cover changes in the metropolitan area of Brasov, Romania, using Landsat 5 TM images acquired in 1987 and 2009 and Landsat 7 ETM+ acquired in 2000. The images were classified in seven land cover classes by supervised classification method. The accuracies obtained were of 88.57% for 1987, 90.48% for 2000 and 92.38% for 2009. Land cover change maps were generated by post-classification change detection methods for the periods 1987-2000, 2000-2009 and 1987-2009. The change map accuracy for 1987-2009 was assessed, after it was transformed in a change/no-change map, as being 77.60% with Kappa statistic of 54.84%. The thematic images highlighted the fact that in the period 1987-2009, two major changes concerning land cover took place: the decrease by 53.09% of the cropland in favor of urban areas, uncultivated areas and pastures and the increase of urban areas by 45.71%. The analysis of the urban growth on the basis of satellite images Landsat 5 TM and 7 ETM+ in correlation with the demographic growth in the period 1987-2009 revealed that the annual urban growth rate was of 2.08%, while the annual demographic growth was of -0.53%.

TI  - Methylene-blue aided rapid confocal laser endomicroscopy of breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast conserving surgery allows complete tumor resection while maintaining acceptable cosmesis for patients. Safe and rapid intraoperative margin assessment during the procedure is important to establish the completeness of tumor excision and minimizes the need for reoperation. Confocal laser endomicroscopy has demonstrated promise for real-time intraoperative margin assessment using acriflavine staining, but it is not approved for routine in-human use. We describe a custom high-speed line-scan confocal laser endomicroscopy (LS-CLE) system at 660 nm that enables high-resolution histomorphological imaging of breast tissue stained with methylene-blue, an alternative fluorescent stain for localizing sentinel nodes during breast surgery. Preliminary imaging results on freshly excised human breast tissue specimens are presented, demonstrating the potential of methylene-blue aided rapid LS-CLE to determine the oncological status of surgical margins in-vivo.

TI  - Criteria derived from serum markers can precisely evaluate axillary status in breast cancer patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A noninvasive method to confirm the presence of lymph node metastases (LNM) in breast cancer patients is lacking. This study aimed to identify markers from peripheral blood that have diagnostic value in evaluating axillary LNM.Methods: We tested 26 factors in serum from 57 patients with resectable breast cancer by the Luminex assay. Differences between node-negative and node-positive patients were assessed. The diagnostic value of the factors was determined by further analyses and a validation test.Results: Matrix metalloproteinase-1, hepatocyte growth factor, and chemokine ligand 5 were independent risk factors for LNM. However, receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that these factors alone were not ideal predictors. The LNM score (LNMS), derived from combining these markers, correlated significantly with numbers of positive lymph nodes. Patients with LNMS of 0 had few LNM, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be avoided, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was unnecessary. Very high accuracy was achieved for patients with LNMS of 1 with SLNB using only methylene blue, patients with LNMS of 3 required ALND, and patients with LNMS of 2 needed SLNB using both a radioactive isotope and methylene blue, and ALND.Conclusions: The LNMS derived from matrix metalloproteinase-1, hepatocyte growth factor, and chemokine ligand 5 serum levels identified the axillary lymph node status with high accuracy. Patients with higher LNMS had a greater probability of LNM. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Energy crop mapping with enhanced TM/MODIS time series in the BCAP agricultural lands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the mid-2000s, agricultural lands in the United States have been undergoing rapid change to meet the increasing bioenergy demand. In 2009 the USDA Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was estab-lished. In its Project Area 1, land owners are financially supported to grow perennial prairie grasses (switchgrass) in their row-crop lands. To promote the program, this study tested the feasibility of bio-mass crop mapping based on unique timings of crop development. With a previously published data fusion algorithm- the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), a 10-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series in 2007 was established by fusing MODIS reflectance into TM image series. Two critical dates- peak growing (PG) and peak drying (PD)-were extracted and a unique "PG-0-PD" timing sequence was defined for each crop. With a knowledge-based decision tree approach, the classification of enhanced TM/MODIS time series reached an overall accuracy of 76% against the USDA Crop Data layer (CDL). Especially, our results showed that winter wheat single cropping and wheat-soybean double cropping were much better classified, which may provide additional information for the CDL product. More importantly, this study extracted the first spatial layer of warm-season prairie grasses that have not been published in any national land cover products, which could serve as a base map for decision making of bioenergy land use in BCAP land.

M3  - Article
AB  - According to the latest Sentinel-1 radar system parameters and the surface characteristic parameters of the study area, this paper established a database of surface microwave scattering characteristics under the sparse vegetation cover condition by AIEM model. On the basis of AIEM model numerical simulation analysis, soil moisture inversion model was constructed. The results showed that: 1) Under the different incident angles and polarization mode, the backscatter coefficient response of soil moisture (M-v) and the composite surface roughness (Z(s)) have obvious logarithmic correlation, respectively. Soil moisture response of VV polarization is sensitive, the optimal response range is for M-v 0 similar to 30%, Z(s) 0 similar to 0.06 cm. 2) GammaMAP filtering has good denoising effect in the sentinel-1 radar data preprocessing. The spatial distribution of soil moisture extracted from sentinel-1 images has good consistency with the actual situation in the same period field in the study area. In April, the soil moisture spatio-temporal distribution of Weigan-Kuqa river basin shows spring drought characteristics. 3) For 0 similar to 10 cm surface soil moisture, the correlation coefficient between the measured value and simulated value reaches 0. 76, showing that this model is suitable for the extraction of soil moisture in the arid area of a certain regional scale.

TI  - Dust aerosol impact on the retrieval of cloud top height from satellite observations of CALIPSO, CloudSat and MODIS
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosol effect on the retrievals of dusty cloud top height (DCTH) are analyzed over Northwest China using cloud products from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Aqua, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and CloudSat for the Spring season of March-May over the years 2007-2011. An excellent agreement is found between CloudSat and CALIPSO derived DCTHs for all cloud types, suggesting that the effect of dust aerosols plays a small role in DCTHs determination for lidar and radar measurements. However, the presence of dust aerosols greatly affects the retrievals of DCTHs for MODIS compared with pure clouds and the active sensors derived results. The differences of DCTHs retrieving from CloudSat and MODIS range from -2.30 to 6.8 km. Likewise, the differences of DCTHs retrieving from CALIPSO and MODIS range from -2.66 to 6.78 km. In addition, the results show that the differences in DCTHs for active and passive sensors are dependent on cloud type. On the whole, dust aerosols have the largest effect on cloud top heights (CTH) retrieved of nimbostratus (Ns), followed by altocumulus (Ac) and altostratus (As), the last is cirrus (Ci) over Northwest China. Our results also indicate that the accuracy of MODIS-derived retrievals reduces accompanied with a decrease of height. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Projected changes in daily fire spread across Canada over the next century
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the face of climate change, predicting and understanding future fire regimes across Canada is a high priority for wildland fire research and management. Due in large part to the difficulties in obtaining future daily fire weather projections, one of the major challenges in predicting future fire activity is to estimate how much of the change in weather potential could translate into on-the-ground fire spread. As a result, past studies have used monthly, annual, or multi-decadal weather projections to predict future fires, thereby sacrificing information relevant to day-to-day fire spread. Using climate projections from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), historical weather observations, MODIS fire detection data, and the national fire database of Canada, this study investigated potential changes in the number of active burning days of wildfires by relating 'spread days' to patterns of daily fire-conducive weather. Results suggest that climate change over the next century may have significant impacts on fire spread days in almost all parts of Canada's forested landmass; the number of fire spread days could experience a 2-to-3-fold increase under a high CO2 forcing scenario in eastern Canada, and a greater than 50% increase in western Canada, where the fire potential is already high. The change in future fire spread is critical in understanding fire regime changes, but is also imminently relevant to fire management operations and in fire risk mitigation.

TI  - Mapping urban CO<sub>2</sub> emissions using DMSP/OLS 'city lights' satellite data in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - China, the world's top CO2 emitter, is faced with pressure of energy-saving emission reduction. In the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), China announced its plan, aiming to cut down CO2 emissions by 60%-65% per unit of GDP in comparison to 2005's level by 2030. To achieve this ambitious goal, reliable national, provincial, and city-level statistics are fundamental for multi-scale mitigation policy-makings as well as for the allocation of responsibilities among different administrative units. However, China implemented a top-down energy statistical system. The National Bureau of Statistics only publishes annually both national and provincial energy statistics. Only part of cities released their statistics, which results in missing data in city-level energy statistics. This also affects data transparency and accuracy of energy and CO2 emission statistics, and as a result, increases difficulty in allocation of CO2 emission reduction responsibilities. In order to fill this lacuna, we employed a standardized remote sensing inversion approach for estimating China's city-level CO2 emissions from energy consumptions by integrating DMSP/OLS 'city lights' satellite data and statistical data. The end product is a map of city-level CO2 emissions in China. The most topping CO2 emitters are located in the major urban agglomerations along the more economically developed eastern coast (e.g. Yangtze River Delta, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Shandong Peninsula, and Pearl River Delta). Other regions with high CO2 emissions are Shanxi and Henan in Central China, as well as the Chengdu-Chongqing and Shaanxi in West China. Regions with low CO2 emissions are western China, and most of Central China and South China.

T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper aims to update the clinical researches using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent published during the past five years. PubMed database was used for literature search, and the search terms were (SPIO OR superparamagnetic iron oxide OR Resovist OR Ferumoxytol OR Ferumoxtran-10) AND (MRI OR magnetic resonance imaging). The literature search results show clinical research on SPIO remains robust, particularly fuelled by the approval of ferumoxytol for intravenously administration. SPIOs have been tested on MR angiography, sentinel lymph node detection, lymph node metastasis evaluation; inflammation evaluation; blood volume measurement; as well as liver imaging. Two experimental SPIOs with unique potentials are also discussed in this review. A curcumin-conjugated SPIO can penetrate brain blood barrier (BBB) and bind to amyloid plaques in Alzheime's disease transgenic mice brain, and thereafter detectable by MRI. Another SPIO was fabricated with a core of Fe3O4 nanoparticle and a shell coating of concentrated hydrophilic polymer brushes and are almost not taken by peripheral macrophages as well as by mononuclear phagocytes and reticuloendothelial system (RES) due to the suppression of non-specific protein binding caused by their stealthy "brush-afforded'' structure. This SPIO may offer potentials for the applications such as drug targeting and tissue or organ imaging other than liver and lymph nodes.

TI  - Derivation of cloud-free-region atmospheric motion vectors from FY-2E thermal infrared imagery
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The operational cloud-motion tracking technique fails to retrieve atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) in areas lacking cloud; and while water vapor shown in water vapor imagery can be used, the heights assigned to the retrieved AMVs are mostly in the upper troposphere. As the noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEdT) performance of FY-2E split window (10.3-11.5 mu m, 11.6-12.8 mu m) channels has been improved, the weak signals representing the spatial texture of water vapor and aerosols in cloud-free areas can be strengthened with algorithms based on the difference principle, and applied in calculating AMVs in the lower troposphere. This paper is a preliminary summary for this purpose, in which the principles and algorithm schemes for the temporal difference, split window difference and second-order difference (SD) methods are introduced. Results from simulation and cases experiments are reported in order to verify and evaluate the methods, based on comparison among retrievals and the "truth". The results show that all three algorithms, though not perfect in some cases, generally work well. Moreover, the SD method appears to be the best in suppressing the surface temperature influence and clarifying the spatial texture of water vapor and aerosols. The accuracy with respect to NCEP 800 hPa reanalysis data was found to be acceptable, as compared with the accuracy of the cloud motion vectors.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During biological effect monitoring studies of endocrine active compounds with the snail Assiminea grayana in 2007-2013, reproductive disorders including atresia, transformation of capsule/albumen glands into prostates in females and ovotestis, transformation of prostates to capsule/albumen glands, disruption of spermatogenesis, and calcification of tubules in males, were encountered in several years. The search of sources of endocrine active substances was first directed to antifouling biocides from paint particles and extended to leaching compounds from polymeric materials. In contrast to the reference sites, most of the observed disorders occurred at a station near harbors and dockyards polluted with residues from antifouling paints and polymeric materials. Beside of investigations about the potential ingestion of polymer particles by the snails, further investigations of compounds of polymeric materials with endocrine potential should follow.

TI  - An operational framework for object-based land use classification of heterogeneous rural landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of very high resolution (VHR) satellite data are encouraging development agencies to investigate its use in monitoring and evaluation programmes. VHR data pose challenges for land use classification of heterogeneous rural landscapes as it is not possible to develop generalised and transferable land use classification definitions and algorithms. We present an operational framework for classifying VHR satellite data in heterogeneous rural landscapes using an object-based and random forest classifier. The framework overcomes the challenges of classifying VHR data in anthropogenic landscapes. It does this by using an image stack of RGB-NIR, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and textural bands in a two-phase object-based classification. The framework can be applied to data acquired by different sensors, with different view and illumination geometries, at different times of the year. Even with these complex input data the framework can produce classification results that are comparable across time. Here we describe the framework and present an example of its application using data from QuickBird (2 images) and GeoEye (1 image) sensors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forward a Small-Timescale BRDF/Albedo by Multisensor Combined BRDF Inversion Model
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the land surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) and albedo on a small timescale are retrieved by the multisensor combined BRDF inversion (MCBI) model with improved accuracy. The accumulation period for this BRDF/albedo retrieval is shortened to 8 and 4 days with data from four satellite sensors, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectraradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), and Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI), to obtain the dynamic features of land surfaces. All the four sensors have high revisit frequencies and dense angular sampling. The MCBI model provides an algorithm to form a virtual MODIS observation network with these four sensors, resulting in a multiband and multiangle sampling reflectance data set. It also provides a multisensor reflectance quality control index, the net information index (NII), for a robust BRDF/albedo retrieval. The performance of the MCBI is assessed by comparisons withMODIS BRDF/albedo product and the in situ measurement. The results show that the highly frequent angular sampling with four sensors allows for a full retrieval of BRDF/albedo with a shorter accumulation period of 8 and 4 days. The NII reduces the uncertainties when using different sensors' reflectance and allows for a high-quality BRDF/albedo retrieval. It reveals that the MCBI has the potential to generate a multisensor-based BRDF/albedo on a small timescale. The MCBI is a key algorithm for the BRDF/albedo product in China's multisource data synergized quantitative remote sensing production system and operationally implemented to generate a global product.

TI  - The sky is the limit: reconstructing physical geography from an aerial perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In an era of rapid geographical data acquisition, interpretations of remote sensing products are an integral part of many undergraduate geography degree schemes but there are fewer opportunities for collection and processing of primary remote sensing data. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide a relatively inexpensive opportunity to introduce the principles and practice of airborne remote sensing into field courses, enabling students to learn about image acquisition, data processing and interpretation of derived products. Two case studies illustrate how a low-cost DJI Phantom Vision+ UAV can be used by students to acquire images that can be processed using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry software. Results from a student questionnaire and analysis of assessed student reports showed that using UAVs enhanced student engagement and equipped them with data processing skills. The derivation of bespoke orthophotos and Digital Elevation Models has the potential to provide students with opportunities to gain insight into various remote sensing data quality issues, although additional training is required to maximize this potential. Recognition of the successes and limitations of this teaching intervention provides scope for improving future UAV exercises. UAVs are enabling both a reconstruction of how we measure the Earth's surface and a reconstruction of how students do fieldwork.

TI  - Spring and summer monthly MODIS LST is inherently compared to air temperature in snow covered sub-Arctic mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (skin temperature) provides invaluable information for data-sparse high elevation and Arctic regions. However, the relationship between satellite-derived clear-sky skin temperature and various downscaled air temperature products for snow covered sub-Arctic alpine regions remain poorly understood, such that trend analysis or air temperature product integration is difficult. We compared monthly average air temperatures from two independent downscaled temperature products to MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature at nine meteorological stations situated above tree-line in the southwest Yukon, Canada, between May and August 2008 for a full range of snow cover fractions. We found that both down scaled products generally agreed with LST for the low elevation, snow-free, vegetation classes. However, a systematic cold bias in Average LST emerged for snow fractions greater than approximately 40%, and this bias increased in magnitude as snow cover increased. In these situations the downscaled air temperatures were 57 degrees C warmer than Average LST for snow fractions of >90%, and this pattern was largely independent of the number of measurements of LST within a month. Maximum LST was similar to average air temperatures for high snow fractions, but Minimum LST was colder by 10 degrees C or more for all snow fractions. Consequently, the average of Maximum and Minimum LST produces the cold bias, compared to air temperature, for high snow cover fractions. Air temperature measured at nine meteorological monitoring stations located between elevations of 1408-2690 m, on land cover classes Barren, Sparsely Vegetated or Permanent Snow and Ice, confirmed the cold bias results when incorporating Minimum LST in monthly averages. For snow fractions of <40% the RMSE for all of the temperature products was <2.5 degrees C when compared to station air temperature and all biases were positive and <2.0 degrees C. For snow fractions of >40%, the average LST bias became strongly negative at -4.5 degrees C, and the RMSE increased to 6.1 degrees C, whereas the downscaled products bias and RMSE were similar to those from snow fractions of <40%. A weak warm bias for all the temperature products occurred for small snow fractions over non-forested land cover classes. Downscaled air temperature fields show physically real differences from Average LST in spring and summer, caused by snow cover and the interplay of Maximum and Minimum LST. These findings indicate that the integration of MODIS 1ST with downscaled air temperature products or local air temperature requires the incorporation of snow cover. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Urban-microclimate effect on vector mosquito abundance of tropical green roofs
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization engenders habitats with distinctive and often adverse microclimates. Green spaces are actively incorporated in urban designs to make cities resilient against climate-change, disease spread and other environmental challenges. Adoption of green roof as an innovative urban green infrastructure has been hindered by the perceived disservice of attracting urban pests like mosquitoes. This study evaluated important microclimatic attributes that explain vector abundance differences between urban extensive green roofs and two control site types in humid-subtropical Hong Kong. Mosquito-trapping data were collected fortnightly for a year (March 2015 to 2016) from seven sites representing three experimental treatment groups: green roofs (GR), low-elevation blue-green spaces as positive controls (PC), and bare roofs as negative controls (NC). Concurrent ambient microclimate parameters were measured on site. Human-biting female mosquitoes of species known to transmit infectious diseases locally and globally constituted the vector abundance data. Generalized linear models evaluated the effects of site-specific microclimatic factors on abundance. Time-lagged microclimatic measurements were analyzed to reveal latent effects. The models consistently identified temperature and wind speed as significant factors. Wind speed accounted for differences in abundance across site types, while temperature exerted its effect on abundance chiefly through seasonal variation. Contrary to common preconception, urban green roofs had significantly lower vector abundance relative to controls. High wind exposure on elevated buildings, which acted as a deterrent of mosquito flight, was found to be the underlying microclimatic factor. Our findings could inform urban greening design and policy, as well as disease control and transmission risk assessment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Snow Depth Inversion Using the Localized HUT Model Based on FY-3B MWRI Data in the Farmland of Heilongjiang Province, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow depth parameter inversion in the farmland using passive microwave remote sensing is of great significance to the agricultural production in Northeast China. Firstly, the Helsinki University of Technology (HUT) snow emission model was validated in the farmland based on microwave radiation imager (MWRI) onboard FengYun-3B satellite (FY-3B). The results showed that there was a big difference between the brightness temperature of HUT model simulation and MWRI for 18.7 GHz horizontal polarization (18.7 H) and 36.5 GHz horizontal polarization (36.5 H). To improve HUT model, the empirical parameter in the model was localized. Then the localized HUT (LHUT) model was built, where the extinction coefficient was calculated by the new extinction coefficient formula. Next, LHUT model was validated based on MWRI data and compared with HUT model. The results showed that LHUT underestimates slightly the brightness temperature with 0.91 and 4.19 K for 18.7 and 36.5 H respectively, and LHUT is superior to HUT model. Finally, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to invert snow depth based on LHUT. The results showed that snow depth was underestimated with 6.79 cm based on LHUT. The inverted snow depth based on LHUT model is in better agreement with the measured snow depth.

TI  - Terrestrial ecosystem model performance in simulating productivity and its vulnerability to climate change in the northern permafrost region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Realistic projection of future climate-carbon (C) cycle feedbacks requires better understanding and an improved representation of the C cycle in permafrost regions in the current generation of Earth system models. Here we evaluated 10 terrestrial ecosystem models for their estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) and responses to historical climate change in permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In comparison with the satellite estimate from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 246 +/- 6gCm(-2) yr (-1)), most models produced higher NPP (309 +/- 12 g Cm-2 yr(-1)) over the permafrost region during 2000-2009. By comparing the simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) with a flux tower-based database, we found that although mean GPP among the models was only overestimated by 10% over 1982-2009, there was a twofold discrepancy among models (380 to 800 g Cm-2 yr(-1)), which mainly resulted from differences in simulated maximum monthly GPP (GPP(max)). Most models overestimated C use efficiency (CUE) as compared to observations at both regional and site levels. Further analysis shows that model variability of GPP and CUE are nonlinearly correlated to variability in specific leaf area and the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco at 25 degrees C (V-cmax_(25)), respectively. Themodels also varied in their sensitivities of NPP, GPP, and CUE to historical changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. These results indicate that model predictive ability of the C cycle in permafrost regions can be improved by better representation of the processes controlling CUE and GPP(max) as well as their sensitivity to climate change.

TI  - On the Use of Generalized Volume Scattering Models for the Improvement of General Polarimetric Model- Based Decomposition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, a general polarimetric model-based decomposition framework was proposed by Chen et al., which addresses several well-known limitations in previous decomposition methods and implements a simultaneous full-parameter inversion by using complete polarimetric information. However, it only employs four typical models to characterize the volume scattering component, which limits the parameter inversion performance. To overcome this issue, this paper presents two general polarimetric model-based decomposition methods by incorporating the generalized volume scattering model (GVSM) or simplified adaptive volume scattering model, (SAVSM) proposed by Antropov et al. and Huang et al., respectively, into the general decomposition framework proposed by Chen et al. By doing so, the final volume coherency matrix structure is selected from a wide range of volume scattering models within a continuous interval according to the data itself without adding unknowns. Moreover, the new approaches rely on one nonlinear optimization stage instead of four as in the previous method proposed by Chen et al. In addition, the parameter inversion procedure adopts the modified algorithm proposed by Xie et al. which leads to higher accuracy and more physically reliable output parameters. A number of Monte Carlo simulations of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data are carried out and show that the proposed method with GVSM yields an overall improvement in the final accuracy of estimated parameters and outperforms both the version using SAVSM and the original approach. In addition, C-band Radarsat-2 and L-band AIRSAR fully polarimetric images over the San Francisco region are also used for testing purposes. A detailed comparison and analysis of decomposition results over different land-cover types are conducted. According to this study, the use of general decomposition models leads to a more accurate quantitative retrieval of target parameters. However, there exists a trade-off between parameter accuracy and model complexity which constrains the physical validity of solutions and must be further investigated.

TI  - A Soil Moisture Retrieval Method Based on Typical Polarization Decomposition Techniques for a Maize Field from Full-Polarization Radarsat-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) estimates are important to research, but are not accurately predictable in areas with tall vegetation. Full-polarization Radarsat-2 C-band data were used to retrieve SM contents using typical polarization decomposition (Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi and VanZly) at different growth stages of maize. Applicability analyses were conducted, including proportion, regression and surface scattering model analyses. Furthermore, the Bragg, the extended Bragg scattering model (X-Bragg) and improved surface scattering models (ISSM) were used to retrieve SM content. The results indicated that the VanZly decomposition method was the best. The proportion of surface scattering in the proportion analysis was highest (> 52%), followed by that in the Yamaguchi method (> 41%). The R2 (> 0.6144) between surface scattering and SM was significantly higher (R-2 < 0.4484) between dihedral scattering and SM in the regression analysis. The ISSM was better at different maize growth stages than the Bragg and X-Bragg models with a higher R-2 (> 0.6599) and lower absolute error (AE) (< 5.82) and root mean square error ( RMSE) (< 3.73). The best algorithm was obtained at the sowing stage (R-2 = 0.8843, AE = 3.13, RMSE = 1.76). In addition, the X-Bragg model provided better approximation of actual surface scattering without the measured data (better algorithm: R2 = 0.8314, AE = 4.39, RMSE = 2.81).

TI  - Trend shifts in satellite-derived vegetation growth in Central Eurasia, 1982-2013
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Eurasian vegetation is critical for the regional ecological security and the global carbon cycle. However, climatic impacts on vegetation growth in Central Eurasia are uncertain. The reason for this uncertainty lies in the fact that the response of vegetation to climate change showed nonlinearity, seasonality and differences among plant functional types. Based on remotely sensed vegetation index and in-situ meteorological data for the years 1982-2013, in conjunction with the latest land cover type product, we analyzed how vegetation growth trend varied across different seasons and evaluated vegetation response to climate variables at regional, biome and pixel scales. We found a persistent increase in the growing season NDVI over Central Eurasia during 1982-1994, whereas this greening trend has stalled since the mid-1990s in response to increased water deficit. The stalled trend in the growing season NDVI was largely attributed by summer and autumn NDVI changes. Enhanced spring vegetation growth after 2002 was caused by rapid spring warming. The response of vegetation to climatic factors varied in different seasons. Precipitation was the main climate driver for the growing season and summer vegetation growth. Changes in temperature and precipitation during winter and spring controlled the spring vegetation growth. Autumn vegetation growth was mainly dependent on the vegetation growth in summer. We found diverse responses of different vegetation types to climate drivers in Central Eurasia. Forests were more responsive to temperature than to precipitation. Grassland and desert vegetation responded more strongly to precipitation than to temperature in summer but more strongly to temperature than to precipitation in spring. In addition, the growth of desert vegetation was more dependent on winter precipitation than that of grasslands. This study has important implications for improving the performance of terrestrial ecosystem models to predict future vegetation response to climate change. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Use of an Anopheles Salivary Biomarker to Assess Malaria Transmission Risk Along the Thailand-Myanmar Border
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The modalities of malaria transmission along the Thailand-Myanmar border are poorly understood. Here we address the relevance of using a specific Anopheles salivary biomarker to measure the risk among humans of exposure to Anopheles bites.Methods. Serologic surveys were conducted from May 2013 to December 2014 in 4 sentinel villages. More than 9400 blood specimens were collected in filter papers from all inhabitants at baseline and then every 3 months thereafter, for up to 18 months, for analysis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between the intensity of the human antibody response and entomological indicators of transmission (human biting rates and entomological inoculation rates [EIRs]) was studied using a multivariate 3-level mixed model analysis. Heat maps for human immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses for each village and survey time point were created using QGIS 2.4.Results. The levels of IgG response among participants varied significantly according to village, season, and age (P <.001) and were positively associated with the abundance of total Anopheles species and primary malaria vectors and the EIR (P <.001). Spatial clusters of high-IgG responders were identified across space and time within study villages.Conclusions. The gSG6-P1 biomarker has great potential to address the risk of transmission along the Thailand-Myanmar border and represents a promising tool to guide malaria interventions.

TI  - Mapping the Influence of Land Use/Land Cover Changes on the Urban Heat Island Effect-A Case Study of Changchun, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal patterns of land use/land cover changes (LUCC) can significantly affect the distribution and intensity of the urban heat island (UHI) effect. However, few studies have mapped a clear picture of the influence of LUCC on UHI. In this study, both qualitative and quantitative models are employed to explore the effect of LUCC on UHI. UHI and LUCC maps were retrieved from Landsat data acquired from 1984, 1992, 2000, 2007, and 2014 to show their spatio-temporal patterns. The results showed that: (1) both the patterns of LUCC and UHI have had dramatic changes in the past 30 years. The urban area of Changchun increased more than four times, from 143.15 km(2) in 1984 to 577.45 km(2) in 2014, and the proportion of UHI regions has increased from 15.27% in 1984 to 29.62% in 2014; (2) the spatiotemporal changes in thermal environment were consistent with the process of urbanization. The average LST of the study area has been continuously increasing as many other land use types have been transformed to urban regions. The mean temperatures were higher in urban regions than rural areas over all of the periods, but the UHI intensity varied based on different measurements; and (3) the thermal environment inside the city varied widely even within a small area. The LST possesses a very strong positive relationship with impervious surface area (ISA), and the relationship has become stronger in recent years. The UHI we employ, specifically in this study, is SUHI (surface urban heat island).

TI  - Automated Extraction of Urban Water Bodies from ZY-3 Multi-Spectral Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of urban water bodies from high-resolution remote sensing images, which has been a hotspot in researches, has drawn a lot of attention both domestic and abroad. A challenging issue is to distinguish the shadow of high-rise buildings from water bodies. To tackle this issue, we propose the automatic urban water extraction method (AUWEM) to extract urban water bodies from high-resolution remote sensing images. First, in order to improve the extraction accuracy, we refine the NDWI algorithm. Instead of Band2 in NDWI, we select the first principal component after PCA transformation as well as Band1 for ZY-3 multi-spectral image data to construct two new indices, namely NNDWI1, which is sensitive to turbid water, and NNDWI2, which is sensitive to the water body whose spectral information is interfered by vegetation. We superimpose the image threshold segmentation results generated by applying NNDWI1 and NNDWI2, then detect and remove the shadows in the small areas of the segmentation results using object-oriented shadow detection technology, and finally obtain the results of the urban water extraction. By comparing the Maximum Likelihood Method (MaxLike) and NDWI, we find that the average Kappa coefficients of AUWEM, NDWI and MaxLike in the five experimental areas are about 93%, 86.2% and 88.6%, respectively. AUWEM exhibits lower omission error rates and commission error rates compared with the NDWI and MaxLike. The average total error rates of the three methods are about 11.9%, 18.2%, and 22.1%, respectively. AUWEM not only shows higher water edge detection accuracy, but it also is relatively stable with the change of threshold. Therefore, it can satisfy demands of extracting water bodies from ZY-3 images.

TI  - Automated mapping of impervious surfaces in urban and suburban areas: Linear spectral unmixing of high spatial resolution imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying impervious surfaces in urban and suburban areas is a key step toward a sustainable urban planning and management strategy. With the availability of fine-scale remote sensing imagery, automated mapping of impervious surfaces has attracted growing attention. However, the vast majority of existing studies have selected pixel-based and object-based methods for impervious surface mapping, with few adopting sub-pixel analysis of high spatial resolution imagery. This research makes use of a vegetation-bright impervious-dark impervious linear spectral mixture model to characterize urban and suburban surface components. A WorldView-3 image acquired on May 9th, 2015 is analyzed for its potential in automated unmixing of meaningful surface materials for two urban subsets and one suburban subset in Toronto, ON, Canada. Given the wide distribution of shadows in urban areas, the linear spectral unmixing is implemented in non-shadowed and shadowed areas separately for the two urban subsets. The results indicate that the accuracy of impervious surface mapping in suburban areas reaches up to 86.99%, much higher than the accuracies in urban areas (80.03% and 79.67%). Despite its merits in mapping accuracy and automation, the application of our proposed vegetation-bright impervious-dark impervious model to map impervious surfaces is limited due to the absence of soil component. To further extend the operational transferability of our proposed method, especially for the areas where plenty of bare soils exist during urbanization or reclamation, it is still of great necessity to mask out bare soils by automated classification prior to the implementation of linear spectral unmixing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in volume of closed lakes on the Tibetan Plateau and their climatic responses from 1976 to 2013
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - To study the response of lakes to climate change, variations in volume of closed lakes larger than 50 km(2) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were analyzed by integrating Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) and LANDSAT images. Total lake volume (LV) increased (net) by 102.64 km(3) during 1976-2013 with an average annual rate of 2.77 km(3) year(-1); the rate increased dramatically to 7.67 km(3) year(-1) during 2000-2013. Four main patterns of LV change were discovered using k-means clustering analysis: (1) a slight increase in LV during 1976-2000 followed by a rapid increase in the southeastern part of the endorheic region, (2) an initial decrease in LV followed by an increase during 1990-2013 in the central and western parts of the endorheic region, (3) an initial decrease in LV followed by an increase during 2000-2013 in the northeastern part of the endorheic region, and (4) an overall decrease during the whole study period for the southern outflow region. Precipitation was the dominant factor affecting LV change. In particular, abnormally large amounts of precipitation during 2000-2013 resulted in a dramatic increase in LV. Temperature changes were positively correlated to LV change before 2000 and negatively after 2000. Glaciers have different influence on LV change based on the comparison between lakes with and without glacial melt input. The distinct regional patterns of change in LV indicate that the sensitivity of lakes to a changing climate varies depending upon the time period and spatial location. These findings have important implications for both the interpretation of past lake level records and prediction of future lake responses to climate change.

TI  - A method to estimate the structural parameters of windbreaks using remote sensing
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Windbreaks are a major component of agroforestry practices and play an important role in agroforestry ecosystems. They can reduce wind velocity and protect shelter crops from wind damage and soil from wind erosion. Porosity is one of the most important structural parameters that affect wind speed and is widely used in the study of wind protection provided by windbreaks. In this paper, a method to estimate porosity using high-resolution satellite imagery is represented. Porosity was difficult to estimate through the direct use of remote sensing data due to the poor relationship with vegetation indices. Thus, two intermediate variables, that is, CL (2) x LAI and CL x LAI x W, which were highly related to porosity, were selected. Leaf area index (LAI) and average tree crown length (CL) were estimated using vegetation indices, and W, which refers to the width of a windbreak, was identified using object-based image analysis. Porosity was estimated using a statistical relationship between porosity and intermediate variables. The average prediction accuracy of the estimated porosity value was 76.104 %. Based on the estimated porosity value, the windbreaks were grouped into three types, and their efficiency of wind protection was evaluated. The evaluation result indicated that the windbreaks have a very good protective structure in the study area and they can effectively shelter crops from wind damage and erosion. This study can provide a useful guide for studying the wind protection provided by windbreaks on spatial and temporal scales using remote sensing.

T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Conclusions: The rabbit lingual sentinel lymph node (SLN) could be long-term visualized by indirect lymphography using gadolinium-loaded polyethylenimine-entrapped gold nanoparticles (Gd-Au PENPs) as CT/MR dual-modal contrast agent.Objective: To investigate duration and intensity of rabbit lingual SLN enhancement using Gd-Au PENPs as a CT/MR dual-modal contrast agent.Methods: Twelve rabbits were randomly divided into indirect CT lymphography (CT-LG) and MR lymphography (MR-LG) groups. In each group, two rabbits received unilateral injection and four received bilateral injection of Gd-Au PENPs in the sub-mucosa of the tongue. Then the enhancement characteristics of SLN were investigated.Results: The enhanced SLNs were observed in 100% in all rabbits by indirect CT-LG and MR-LG simultaneously at 1min after injection. Then SLN enhancement was improved rapidly and the first peaks were observed at 25min for CT-LG and 1h for MR-LG, respectively, then SLN enhancement decreased gradually to a minimum at 2h for CT-LG and 3h for MR-LG. Afterwards, the enhancement intensity increased again and second peaks were observed at 24h for both CT-LG and MR-LG. Hereafter, the intensity dropped slowly and weak enhancement was also observed at the 40th week for CT-LG and 31st day for MR-LG. Black-stained SLNs were visualized in 100% at autopsy in all rabbits.

TI  - Snow grain size retrieval over the polar ice sheets with the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow grain size is an important parameter for cryosphere studies. As a proof of concept, this paper presents an approach to retrieve this parameter over Greenland, East and West Antarctica ice sheets from surface reflectances observed with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) at 1064 nm. Spaceborne lidar observations overcome many of the disadvantages in passive remote sensing, including difficulties in cloud screening and low sun angle limitations and hence tend to provide more accurate and stable retrievals. Results from the GLAS L2A campaign, which began on 25 September and lasted until 19 November, 2003, show that the mode of the grain size distribution over Greenland is the largest (similar to 300 mu m) among the three, West Antarctica is the second (similar to 220 mu m) and East Antarctica is the smallest (similar to 190 mu m). Snow grain sizes are larger over the coastal regions compared to inland the ice sheets. These results are consistent with previous studies. Applying the broadband snow surface albedo parameterization scheme developed by Garder and Sharp (2010) to the retrieved snow grain size, ice sheet surface albedo is also derived. In the future, more accurate retrievals can be achieved with multiple wavelengths lidar observations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Initial Radiometric Characteristics of KOMPSAT-3A Multispectral Imagery Using the 6S Radiative Transfer Model, Well-Known Radiometric Tarps, and MFRSR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit radiometric characterization of the multispectral (MS) imagery of the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI)'s Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-3A (KOMPSAT-3A), which was launched on 25 March 2015, was conducted to provide quantitative radiometric information about KOMPSAT-3A. During the in-orbit test (IOT), vicarious radiometric calibration of KOMPSAT-3A was performed using the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. The characteristics of radiometric tarps, the atmospheric optical depth from multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometer (MFRSR) measurements, and sun-sensor-geometry were carefully considered, in order to calculate the exact top of atmosphere (TOA) radiance received by KOMPSAT-3A MS bands. In addition, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) behaviors of the radiometric tarps were measured in the laboratory with a two-dimensional hyperspectral gonioradiometer, to compensate for the geometry discrepancy between the satellite and the ASD FieldSpec (R) 3 spectroradiometer. The match-up datasets between the TOA radiance and the digital number (DN) from KOMPSAT-3A were used to determine DN-to-radiance conversion factors, based on linear least squares fitting for two field campaigns. The final results showed that the R-2 values between the observed and simulated radiances for the blue, green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands, are greater than 0.998. An approximate error budget analysis for the vicarious calibration of KOMPSAT-3A showed an error of less than 6.8%. When applying the laboratory-based BRDF correction to the case of higher viewing zenith angle geometry, the gain ratio was improved, particularly for the blue (1.3%) and green (1.2%) bands, which exhibit high sensitivity to the BRDF of radiometric tarps during the backward-scattering phase. The calculated gain ratio between the first and second campaigns showed a less than 5% discrepancy, indicating that the determined radiometric characteristics of KOMPSAT-3A are reliable and useful to the user group for quantitative applications.

TI  - Phenology and classification of abandoned agricultural land based on ALOS-1 and 2 PALSAR multi-temporal measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural crop abandonment negatively impacts local economy and environment since land, as a resource for agriculture, is not optimally utilized. To take necessary actions to rehabilitate abandoned agricultural lands, the identification of the spatial distribution of these lands must be acknowledged. While optical images had previously illustrated potentials in the identification of agricultural land abandonment, tropical areas often suffer cloud coverage problem that limits the availability of the imageries. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the potential of ALOS-1 and 2 (Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 and 2) PALSAR (Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar) images for the identification and classification of abandoned agricultural crop areas, namely paddy, rubber and oil palm fields. Distinct crop phenology for paddy and rubber was identified from ALOS-1 PALSAR; nonetheless, oil palm did not demonstrate any useful phenology for discriminating between the abandoned classes. The accuracy obtained for these abandoned lands of paddy, rubber and oil palm was 93.33%+/- 0.06%, 78%+/- 2.32% and 63.33%+/- 1.88%, respectively. This study confirmed that the understanding of crop phenology in relation to image date selection is essential to obtain high accuracy for classifying abandoned and non-abandoned agricultural crops. The finding also portrayed that PALSAR offers a huge advantage for application of vegetation in tropical areas.

TI  - Monitoring ecosystem dynamics in northwestern Ethiopia using NDVI and climate variables to assess long term trends in dryland vegetation variability
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland ecosystems are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Monitoring is vital in order to evaluate their response to fluctuating rainfall and temperature patterns for long-term ecosystem safeguarding. Monitoring of long term changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and climate variables are fundamental for better understanding of change trajectories in dryland ecosystem, and to ascertain their potential interaction with anthropogenic drivers. In this study, we identify determinant factors of dryland changes by using MODIS NDVI, precipitation and temperature data for Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) and Mann Kendall test statistic. BFAST predicts iteratively time and number of changes within a time series data to depict the size and direction of changes. Analysis of NDVI, precipitation and temperature time series data showed substantial changes during the study period of 2000-2014. There is a reduction trend in vegetation showed by the decline in NDVI, with significant breakpoints till 2009 and recovery afterwards, without a significant change in annual trends of precipitation (alpha < 0.05) for the same study period. Furthermore 2 positive climate trends were founded: a) a significant positive trend on long term annual rainfall during the main rainy seasons and; 2) a significant (alpha < 0.05) annual increment of the long term mean minimum and mean maximum temperature of 0.03 degrees C/year and 0.04 degrees C/year, respectively. This assessment showed that climate variables cannot be considered as the main factors in explaining the observed patterns of vegetation dynamics. Seasonal and interannual precipitation changes have a lower weight as driving factors for the reduction in vegetation trends. Hence, the decline in vegetation productivity of the region can be attributed to the increasing pressure of human activities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL NANOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IR-780 iodide, a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent heptamethine dye, has attracted wide attention in the biomedical community. However, hydrophobicity and toxicity severely limit its further biomedical application. Although many successful efforts have been made to increase its solubility and biocompatibility, a strong fluorescent signal and longer retention time are in high demand in biomedical application in vivo as well as basic science research. In this work, we report the development of novel silica cross-linked micellar core-shell nanoparticles encapsulating IR-780 (NIR-Silica NPs) and their utility for biomedical imaging in vivo. Compared to free IR-780, the solubility of NIR-Silica NPs was not only greatly increased, but there was also a dramatic 5-7-fold enhancement of fluorescence intensity. More importantly, the exceptionally small size (25 nm) and colloidal stability of the NPs are also sufficient to realize the enhanced permeability and retention effect. In vitro cell viability assays further indicated that the NIR-Silica NPs are safer even at the highest concentration tested of 1.0 mg/mL. Finally, sentinel lymph node mapping and long-term tumor imaging in vivo demonstrated that the NIR-Silica NPs have a long circulation time and higher signal-to-noise ratio at a very low dye concentration and short exposure time (0.2 s). Therefore, the NIR-Silica NPs may be a promising fluorescence imaging agent for clinical application.

TI  - Detectability Analysis of Road Vehicles in Radarsat-2 Fully Polarimetric SAR Images for Traffic Monitoring
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - By acquiring information over a wide area regardless of weather conditions and solar illumination, space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the potential to be a promising application for traffic monitoring. However, the backscatter character of a vehicle in a SAR image is unstable and varies with image parameters, such as aspect and incidence angle. To investigate vehicle detectability in SAR images for traffic monitoring applications, images of four common types of vehicles in China were acquired using the fully polarimetric (FP) SAR of Radarsat-2 in our experiments. Methods for measuring a vehicle's aspect angle and backscatter intensity are introduced. The experimental FP SAR images are used to analyze the detectability, which is affected by factors such as vehicle size, vehicle shape, and aspect angle. Moreover, a new metric to improve vehicle detectability in FP SAR images is proposed and compared with the well-known intensity metric. The experimental results show that shape is a crucial factor in affecting the backscatter intensity of vehicles, which also oscillates with varying aspect angle. If the size of a vehicle is smaller than the SAR image resolution, using the intensity metric would result in low detectability. However, it could be improved in an FP SAR image by using the proposed metric. Compared with the intensity metric, the overall detectability is improved from 72% to 90% in our experiments. Therefore, this study indicates that FP SAR images have the ability to detect stationary vehicles on the road and are meaningful for traffic monitoring.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice croplands in China and India from 2000 to 2015
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid population growth and urbanization, paddy rice agriculture is experiencing substantial changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of planting areas in the two most populous countries China and India-where food security is always the primary concern. However, there is no spatially explicit and continuous rice-planting information in either country. This knowledge gap clearly hinders our ability to understand the effects of spatial paddy rice area dynamics on the environment, such as food and water security, climate change, and zoonotic infectious disease transmission. To resolve this problem, we first generated annual maps of paddy rice planting areas for both countries from 2000 to 2015, which are derived from time series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and the phenology- and pixel-based rice mapping platform (RICE-MODIS), and analyzed the spatiotemporal pattern of paddy rice dynamics in the two countries. We found that China experienced a general decrease in paddy rice planting area with a rate of 0.72 million (m) ha/yr from 2000 to 2015, while a significant increase at a rate of 0.27 m ha/yr for the same time period happened in India. The spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in China shifted northeastward significantly, due to simultaneous expansions in paddy rice planting areas in northeastern China and contractions in southern China. India showed an expansion of paddy rice areas across the entire country, particularly in the northwestern region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain located in north India and the central and south plateau of India. In general, there has been a northwesterly shift in the spatial pattern of paddy rice agriculture in India. These changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of paddy rice planting area have raised new concerns on how the shift may affect national food security and environmental issues relevant to water, climate, and biodiversity.

TI  - Prevalence of Severe Febrile and Thrombocytopenic Syndrome Virus, <i>Anaplasma</i> spp. and <i>Babesia microti</i> in Hard Ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) from Jiaodong Peninsula, Shandong Province
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of tick-borne pathogens and their possible coinfections were evaluated among host-seeking ticks in seven cities from Jiaodong peninsula, Shandong Province, with specific PCR or reverse transcription-PCR tests. Among 2107 ticks collected, four species of three genera were identified with Haemaphysalis longicornis as predominant species, and total of 63 H. longicornis and 10 Rhicephalus microplus were confirmed infected with tick-borne pathogens. These pathogens were consequently identified as severe febrile and thrombocytopenic syndrome virus (SFTSV), Anaplasma capra, Anaplasma phygocytophilum, and Babesia microti, respectively, with high phylogenetic scores on some fragments of species-specific genes. The infection rates of the pathogens in H. longicornis were presented as 1.03%, 0.84%, 0.58%, and 1.66%, respectively, close related to its field density and clump distribution pattern. Furthermore, coinfection of A. capra and SFTSV was also discovered from two female H. longicornis in Pingdu city. These results indicated that the potential human pathogens other than severe febrile and thrombocytopenic syndrome might be transmitted by hard ticks separately or in combination, and more reliable differential diagnosis, proper administrations, rational prevention, and control measures should be developed with the support of precision laboratory tests.

TI  - An analysis of oasis evolution based on land use and land cover change: A case study in the Sangong River Basin on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated oasis evolution and the changes of peripheral desert in the Sangong River Basin since the 1950s by rebuilding seven land cover maps derived from black-and-white aerial photographs (1958, 1968, and 1978), a color-infrared aerial photograph (1987), Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery (1998), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) imagery (2004), and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery (2014). The results showed that: (1) Since 1950, the oasis consecutively expanded more than four times from an alluvial fan to an alluvial plain, causing the shrinkage of desert landscapes that were dominated by a Haloxylon ammodendron Bunge community (HBC) and a Tamarix chinensis Lour community (TLC). Furthermore, the primary (1958-1968) and final (2004-2014) stages were the most important periods, during which agricultural land experienced the most rapid expansion during the period 1958-1968, and the built-up area showed the most rapid expansion after the 2000s. (2) Two basic management modes, a "local mode" formed by the local governments and a "farm management mode" developed by Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, together promoted oasis evolution under various land-use and landcover (LULC) stages. (3) The evolution of the modern oasis during the 1950s-2004 showed the general features of an arid oasis, while during the period of 2004-2014 it was characterized by a large-scale inter-basin water diversion or the import of new water sources. (4) The oasis expanded at the expense of desert vegetation, resulting in distinct variation in the structure of the desert plant community, which will make it more difficult to protect the desert ecosystem.

TI  - Land surface temperature shaped by urban fractions in megacity region
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large areas of cropland and natural vegetation have been replaced by impervious surfaces during the recent rapid urbanization in China, which has resulted in intensified urban heat island effects and modified local or regional warming trends. However, it is unclear how urban expansion contributes to local temperature change. In this study, we investigated the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) change and the increase of urban land signals. The megacity of Tianjin was chosen for the case study because it is representative of the urbanization process in northern China. A combined analysis of LST and urban land information was conducted based on an urban-rural transect derived from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS), Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS), and QuickBird images. The results indicated that the density of urban land signals has intensified within a 1-km(2) grid in the urban center with an impervious land fraction > 60 %. However, the construction on urban land is quite different with low-/mid-rise buildings outnumbering high-rise buildings in the urban-rural transect. Based on a statistical moving window analysis, positive correlation (R (2) > 0.9) is found between LST and urban land signals. Surface temperature change (Delta LST) increases by 0.062 A degrees C, which was probably caused by the 1 % increase of urbanized land (Delta IF) in this case region.

TI  - Near-Infrared Quantum Dot and <SUP>89</SUP>Zr Dual-Labeled Nanoparticles for <i>in Vivo</i> Cerenkov Imaging
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerenkov luminescence (CL) is an emerging imaging modality that utilizes the light generated during the radioactive decay of many clinical used isotopes. Although it is increasingly used for background-free imaging and deep tissue photodynamic therapy, in vivo applications of CL suffer from limited tissue penetration. Here, we propose to use quantum dots (QDs) as spectral converters that can transfer the CL UV-blue emissions to near-infrared light that is less scattered or absorbed in vivo. Experiments on tissue phantoms showed enhanced penetration depth and increased transmitted intensity for CL in the presence of near-infrared (NIR) QDs. To realize this concept for in vivo imaging applications, we developed three types of NIR QDs and Zr-89 dual-labeled nanoparticles based on lipid micelles, nanoemulsions, and polymeric nanoplatforms, which enable codelivery of the radionuclide and the QDs for maximized spectral conversion efficiency. We finally demonstrated the application of these self-illuminating nanoparticles for imaging of lymph nodes and tumors in a prostate cancer mouse model.

TI  - The dynamic response of lakes in the Tuohepingco Basin of the Tibetan Plateau to climate change
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is particularly sensitive to the influences of climate change. As indicators of climate change, lakes on the TP play a key role in the Earth's climatic system. Lake Yazi (LY), Lake Tuohepingco (LT) and Lake Changtiao (LC) in the Tuohepingco Basin are three inland lakes on the plateau. The extents of LY, LT and LC were obtained using object-based image analysis for remote sensing and 22 images from Landsat satellites (from September to December between 1972 and 2015). Inter-annual changes in the extent of LY, LT and LC were then analyzed. The results show that the total area of the three lakes underwent a change from shrinkage to expansion between 1972 and 2015. In general, there was a trend toward shrinkage during 1972-1999, distinct expansion during 2000-2007 and slight expansion during 2008-2015. Moreover, we found that 14 other lakes have also expanded dramatically since 2000. Lakes at 30 degrees N and 35 degrees N (LY, LT and LC are also located in this region) exhibited the same dramatic period of expansion between 2000 and 2005. In other words, 2000 appears to be a critical transition point for changes in lake size on the TP. Lakes at the same latitudes in the Tibetan Plateau interior may have a similar period of dramatic expansion after 2000. The warming-triggered deglaciation or permafrost degradation, increased precipitation and decreased evapotranspiration may be the influencing factors of lake expansion in the Tuohepingco Basin. Temperature showed relatively higher correlation with lake extent, while precipitation and evaporation were slightly correlated with lake area. Given the importance of wetlands to human society, these are no trivial issues, and we now need accelerated research based on long-term and continuous remote sensing.

TI  - A method to extract parameters of Arctic sea ice from FY-3/MERSI imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - With high spatial resolution of 250 m, MERSI images obtained from FY-3 satellite not only reveals information about the long term distribution of sea ice in large scale, but also contains information about its detailed shape characteristics, such as ice block area and roundness. Based on the spectral feature of sea ice and gray distribution feature of ice block, an integral method and process for extracting the macroscopic sea ice distribution and detail ice block shape parameters was proposed in this paper. This method consisted of sea ice recognition, ice block detection and sea ice parameters extraction. In the summer of 2014, the detail sea ice information of the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait was extracted accurately by using the proposed method. And consequently this method can provide methodological support and information security for the study on the change of Arctic sea ice and interaction between atmosphere and ocean.

TI  - Projection Shape Template-Based Ship Target Recognition in TerraSAR-X Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship target recognition has always been a hot issue in the field of ocean surveillance. Due to the serious shortage of samples in ship target recognition for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, the template-based method is still one of the most effective ways to solve the problem. In this letter, we put forward a novel ship recognition method based on the projection shape template (PST), aiming at increasing both the accuracy and the robustness of the recognition. The PST of each category is calculated by projecting the 3-D model obtained from the two-view images of the target to the 2-D slant-plane image according to the SAR imaging model. Then, we propose a contour extraction method to detect the profile of ships, which served as the feature. Finally, the identity of the query ship is obtained through contour matching. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is effective even when the number of samples is extremely small, consequently providing a promising way for the automatic interpretation of ship targets in the SAR images.

TI  - [Surgical treatment and prognosis of ductal carcinoma in situ: 526 cases analysis].
T2  - Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the choice of surgical treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and its impact on long-term outcomes. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the clinicopathological features and treatment protocol of DCIS patients who underwent surgical treatment in Comprehensive Breast Health Center, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from January 2009 to August 2016 was done. The factors which could affect surgical treatment were analyzed by chi(2) test and Logistic regression. Survival analysis were performed between different surgical approaches. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Log-rank tests demonstrated the distribution of disease free survival and overall survival. Results: A total of 526 patients were enrolled in this study, 405 cases (77.0%) underwent mastectomy, 121 cases (23.0%) underwent breast-conserving surgery, of which 88 cases received radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery. It was shown by univariate and multivariate analysis that age>50 years (OR=0.631, 95% CI: 0.413 to 0.965, P=0.034), first symptom of nipple discharge (OR=0.316, 95% CI: 0.120 to 0.834, P=0.020), excision biopsy (OR=1.831, 95% CI: 1.182 to 2.835, P=0.007) and tumor size >3 cm (OR=0.422, 95% CI: 0.206 to 0.864, P=0.018) were significantly correlated with choice of surgical treatment for breast lesions. Axillary lymph node dissection was performed for 118 cases (22.4%), with sentinel lymph node biopsy for 327 cases (62.2%), and none for 81 cases (15.4%). There was significant statistical difference in the choice of axillary lymph node management in patients of different age (chi(2)=8.124, P=0.017), biopsy type (chi(2)=35.567, P=0.000), breast operation type (chi(2)=149.118, P=0.000) and tumor size (chi(2)=13.394, P=0.010). The 5-year disease free survival rates was 95.7%, 89.6% and 100%, respectively, for mastectomy group, breast-conserving surgery group and breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy group. And the 5-year overall survival rates for three groups were 99.0%, 100% and 100%. The differences were not statistically significant (P=0.427, 0.777). Conclusions: For DCIS patients, age, first symptom and tumor size are independent predictors of breast surgery. The choice of axillary lymph node surgery is influenced by age, biopsy, operation type, and tumor size. Different surgical treatment options has no significant effect on disease-free survival and overall survival in DCIS patients.

TI  - Preliminary verification of instantaneous air temperature estimation for clear sky conditions based on SEBAL
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially distributed near surface air temperature at the height of 2 m is an important input parameter for the land surface models. It is of great significance in both theoretical research and practical applications to retrieve instantaneous air temperature data from remote sensing observations. An approach based on Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) to retrieve air temperature under clear sky conditions is presented. Taking the meteorological measurement data at one station as the reference and remotely sensed data as the model input, the research estimates the air temperature by using an iterative computation. The method was applied to the area of Jiangsu province for nine scenes by using MODIS data products, as well as part of Fujian province, China based on four scenes of Landsat 8 imagery. Comparing the air temperature estimated from the proposed method with that of the meteorological station measurement, results show that the root mean square error is 1.7 and 2.6 A degrees C at 1000 and 30 m spatial resolution respectively. Sensitivity analysis of influencing factors reveals that land surface temperature is the most sensitive to the estimation precision. Research results indicate that the method has great potentiality to be used to estimate instantaneous air temperature distribution under clear sky conditions.

TI  - Retrievals of all-weather daytime air temperature from MODIS products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that remote sensing techniques hold the potential to explore the spatial estimation of air temperature (T-a) with fine spatial and temporal resolution across the world. However, because of the complex interaction of land-atmosphere systein and the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daytime T-a exclusively from remote sensing data is still far from straight forward, especially under cloudy sky conditions. In this paper, we presented a simple parameterization scheme of daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. To evaluate its applicability, the scheme was demonstrated in two regions with totally different geomorphological and climatic conditions, the east part of the Qaidam Basin (EQB) in China and the Southern Great Plains (SGP) in the United States of America. The instantaneous T-a under clear sky conditions (T-a,T-clear) was determined as the average of near surface air temperature (T-a(s)) retrieved from MOD07_L2 product and land surface temperature (T-s) retrieved from MOD06_12 product. Then a regression model between T-a,T-clear and T-s was established, and the instantaneous Ta under cloudy sky conditions (T-a,T-cloudy) was estimated by applying the regression model to T-s retrieved under cloudy sky conditions. The results showed that the averaging parameterization scheme has significantly improved the accuracy of T-a,T-clear retrievals with MAE = 1.95 degrees C, RMSE = 2.50 degrees C, and B = 0.02 in the EQB, and MAE = 2.02 degrees C, RMSE = 2.56 degrees C, and B = 0.01 in the SGP. The T-a,T-cloudy estimates also showed good agreement with T-a observations in both regions with a correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.91. The values of RMSE calculated for the EQB and SGP were 3.42 degrees C and 2.91 degrees C, respectively. The accuracy of both T-a,T-clear and T-a,T-cloudy estimates has reached a level comparable with other traditional statistical approaches that adopt ancillary T-a measurements as training dataset. Therefore, it is feasible to estimate daytime T-a under all-weather conditions entirely based on MODIS products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Applying n-bit floating point numbers and integers, and the n-bit filter of HDF5 to reduce file sizes of remote sensing products in memory-sensitive environments
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Memory sensitive applications for remote sensing data require memory-optimized data types in remote sensing products. Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) offers user defined floating point numbers and integers and the n-bit filter to create data types optimized for memory consumption. The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) applies a compaction scheme to the disseminated products of the Day and Night Band (DNB) data of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite's instrument Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) through the EUMETSAT Advanced Retransmission Service, converting the original 32 bits floating point numbers to user defined floating point numbers in combination with the n-bit filter for the radiance dataset of the product. The radiance dataset requires a floating point representation due to the high dynamic range of the DNB. A compression factor of 1.96 is reached by using an automatically determined exponent size and an 8 bits trailing significand and thus reducing the bandwidth requirements for dissemination. It is shown how the parameters needed for user defined floating point numbers are derived or determined automatically based on the data present in a product.

M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Neurological complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) may be reduced with transcatheter cerebral embolic protection (TCEP).OBJECTIVES This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of TCEP during TAVR.METHODS Nineteen centers randomized 363 patients undergoing TAVR to a safety arm (n = 123), device imaging (n = 121), and control imaging (n = 119). The primary safety endpoint consisted of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) at 30 days, and the primary efficacy endpoint was reduction in new lesion volume in protected brain territories on magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 to 7 days. Patients underwent neurocognitive assessments, and the debris captured was analyzed.RESULTS The rate of MACCE (7.3%) was noninferior to the performance goal (18.3%, p(noninferior) < 0.001) and not statistically different from that of the control group (9.9%; p = 0.41). New lesion volume was 178.0 mm(3) in control subjects and 102.8 mm(3) in the device arm (p = 0.33). A post hoc multivariable analysis identified pre-existing lesion volume and valve type as predictors of new lesion volume. Strokes at 30 days were 9.1% in control subjects and 5.6% in patients with devices (p = 0.25) Neurocognitive function was similar in control subjects and patients with devices, but there was a correlation between lesion volume and neurocognitive decline (p = 0.0022). Debris found within filters in 99% of patients included thrombus, calcification, valve tissue, artery wall, and foreign material.CONCLUSIONS TCEP was safe, captured embolic debris in 99% of patients, and did not change neurocognitive function. Reduction in new lesion volume on magnetic resonance scans was not statistically significant.

TI  - Tree cover in Central Africa: determinants and sensitivity under contrasted scenarios of global change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cover is a key variable for ecosystem functioning, and is widely used to study tropical ecosystems. But its determinants and their relative importance are still a matter of debate, especially because most regional and global analyses have not considered the influence of agricultural practices. More information is urgently needed regarding how human practices influence vegetation structure. Here we focused in Central Africa, a region still subjected to traditional agricultural practices with a clear vegetation gradient. Using remote sensing data and global databases, we calibrated a Random Forest model to correlatively link tree cover with climatic, edaphic, fire and agricultural practices data. We showed that annual rainfall and accumulated water deficit were the main drivers of the distribution of tree cover and vegetation classes (defined by the modes of tree cover density), but agricultural practices, especially pastoralism, were also important in determining tree cover. We simulated future tree cover with our model using different scenarios of climate and land-use (agriculture and population) changes. Our simulations suggest that tree cover may respond differently regarding the type of scenarios, but land-use change was an important driver of vegetation change even able to counterbalance the effect of climate change in Central Africa.

TI  - Aerosol optical depth thresholds as a tool to assess diffuse radiation fertilization of the land carbon uptake in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - China suffers from frequent haze pollution episodes that alter the surface solar radiation and influence regional carbon uptake by the land biosphere. Here, we apply combined vegetation and radiation modeling and multiple observational datasets to assess the radiative effects of aerosol pollution in China on the regional land carbon uptake for the 2009-2011 period. First, we assess the inherent sensitivity of China's land biosphere to aerosol pollution by defining and calculating two thresholds of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm, (i) AOD(t1), resulting in the maximum net primary productivity (NPP), and (ii) AOD(t2), such that if local AOD < AOD(t2), the aerosol diffuse fertilization effect (DFE) always promotes local NPP compared with aerosol-free conditions. Then, we apply the thresholds, satellite data, and interactive vegetation modeling to estimate current impacts of aerosol pollution on land ecosystems. In the northeast, observed AOD is 55% lower than AOD(t1), indicating a strong aerosol DFE on local NPP. In the southeastern coastal regions, observed AOD is close to AOD(t1), suggesting that regional NPP is promoted by the current level of aerosol loading, but that further increases in AOD in this region will weaken the fertilization effects. The North China Plain experiences limited enhancement of NPP by aerosols because observed AOD is 77% higher than AOD(t1) but 14% lower than AOD(t2). Aerosols always inhibit regional NPP in the southwest because of the persistent high cloud coverage that already substantially reduces the total light availability there. Under clear-sky conditions, simulated NPP shows widespread increases of 20-60% (35.0 +/- 0.9% on average) by aerosols. Under all-sky conditions, aerosol pollution has spatially contrasting opposite sign effects on NPP from 3% to +6% (1.6 +/- 0.5% on average), depending on the local AOD relative to the regional thresholds. Stringent aerosol pollution reductions motivated by public health concerns, especially in the North China Plain and the southwest, will help protect land ecosystem functioning in China and mitigate long-term global warming.

TI  - Characterizing response versus scan-angle for MODIS reflective solar bands using deep convective clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS consists of a cross-track, two-sided scan mirror, whose reflectance is not uniform but is a function of angle of incidence (AOI). This feature, known as response versus scan-angle (RVS), was characterized for all reflective solar bands of both MODIS instruments prior to launch. The RVS characteristic has changed on orbit, which must be tracked precisely over time to ensure the quality of MODIS products. The MODIS characterization support team utilizes the onboard calibrators and the earth view responses from multiple pseudoinvariant desert sites to track the RVS changes at different AOIs. The drawback of using deserts is the assumption that these sites are radiometrically stable during the monitoring period. In addition, the 16-day orbit repeat cycle of MODIS allows for only a limited set of AOIs over a given desert. We propose a novel and robust approach of characterizing the MODIS RVS using tropical deep convective clouds (DCC). The method tracks the monthly DCC response at specified sets of AOIs to compute the temporal RVS changes. Initial results have shown that the Aqua-MODIS collection 6 band 1 level 1B radiances show considerable residual RVS dependencies, with long-term drifts up to 2.3% at certain AOIs.

TI  - Demography, maternal health and the epidemiology of malaria and other major infectious diseases in the rural department Tsamba-Magotsi, Ngounie Province, in central African Gabon
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sub-Saharan Africa is undergoing an epidemiological transition from a predominance of infectious diseases to non-communicable and lifestyle related conditions. However, the pace of this transition and the pattern of disease epidemiology are uneven between affluent urban and rural poor populations. To address this question for a remote rural region located in the central African rainforest region of Gabon, this study was conducted to assess reasons for health care attendance and to characterize the epidemiology of malaria and other major infectious diseases for the department of Tsamba Magotsi.Methods: Major causes for health care attendance were collected from local hospital records. Cross sectional population based surveys were performed for the assessment of local malaria epidemiology. Pregnant women attending antenatal care services were surveyed as a sentinel population for the characterization of chronic viral and parasitic infections in the community.Results: Infectious diseases were responsible for 71% (7469) of a total of 10,580 consultations at the formal health care sector in 2010. Overall, malaria - defined by clinical syndrome - remained the most frequent cause for health care attendance. A cross sectional malaria survey in 840 asymptomatic individuals residing in Tsamba Magotsi resulted in a Plasmodium spp. infection prevalence of 37%. The infection rate in 2-10 year old asymptomatic children - a standard measure for malaria endemicity - was 46% (100 of 217) with P. falciparum as predominant species (79%). Infection with other plasmodial species (P. ovale and P. malariae) presented most commonly as coinfections (23.2%). Prevalence of HIV, HBV, and syphilis were 6.2, 7.3, and 2.5%, respectively, in cross-sectional assessments of antenatal care visits of pregnant women. Urogenital schistosomiasis and the filarial pathogens Loa loa and Mansonella perstans are highly prevalent chronic parasitic infections affecting the local population.Conclusions: Despite major improvements in the accessibility of Tsamba Magotsi over the past decade the epidemiological transition does not appear to have majorly changed on the spectrum of diseases in this rural Gabonese population. The high prevalence of Plasmodium infection indicates a high burden of malaria related morbidity. Infectious diseases remain one of the most important health issues and further research activities in the field of tropical medicine and infectious diseases could help improve health care for the local population.

TI  - Clouds, warm air, and a climate cooling signal over the summer Arctic
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - While the atmospheric greenhouse effect always results in a warming at the surface, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) to space always represents a cooling. During events of heat and moisture advection into the Arctic, increases in tropospheric temperature and moisture impact clouds, in turn impacting longwave (LW) radiation. State-of-the-art satellite measurements and atmospheric reanalysis consistently reveal an enhancement of summer Arctic monthly OLR cooling ranging 1.5-4Wm(-2) during months with anomalously high thermodynamic advection. This cooling anomaly is found to be of the same magnitude or slightly larger than associated downwelling LW surface warming anomalies. We identify a relationship between large-scale circulation variability and changing cloud properties permitting LW radiation at both the surface and top of the atmosphere to respond to variability in atmospheric thermodynamics. Driven by anomalous advection of warm air, the corresponding enhanced OLR cooling signal on monthly time scales represents an important buffer to regional Arctic warming.

TI  - Radiative effects of absorbing aerosols over northeastern India: Observations and model simulations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiyear measurements of spectral properties of aerosol absorption are examined over four geographically distinct locations of northeastern India. Results indicated significant spatiotemporal variation in aerosol absorption coefficients (sigma(abs)) with highest values in winter and lowest in monsoon. The western parts of the region, close to the outflow of Indo-Gangetic Plains, showed higher values of sigma(abs) and black carbon (BC) concentration-mostly associated with fossil fuel combustion. But, the eastern parts showed higher contributions from biomass-burning aerosols, as much as 20-25% to the total aerosol absorption, conspicuously during premonsoon season. This is attributed to a large number of burning activities over the Southeast Asian region, as depicted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer fire count maps, whose spatial extent and magnitude peaks during March/April. The nearly consistent high values of aerosol index (AI) and layer height from Ozone Monitoring Instrument indicate the presence of absorbing aerosols in the upper atmosphere. The observed seasonality has been captured fairly well by Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) as well as Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model simulations. The ratio of column-integrated optical depths due to particulate organic matter and BC from GOCART showed good coincidence with satellite-based observations, indicating the increased vertical dispersion of absorbing aerosols, probably by the additional local convection due to higher fire radiative power caused by the intense biomass-burning activities. In the WRF-Chem though underperformed by different magnitude in winter, the values are closer or overestimated near the burnt areas. Atmospheric forcing due to BC was highest (similar to 30 Wm(-2)) over the western part associated with the fossil fuel combustion.

TI  - Quantifying the low bias of CALIPSO's column aerosol optical depth due to undetected aerosol layers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data processing scheme only retrieves extinction profiles in those portions of the return signal where cloud or aerosol layers have been identified by the CALIOP layer detection scheme. In this study we use 2 years of CALIOP and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to quantify the aerosol optical depth of undetected weakly backscattering layers. Aerosol extinction and column-averaged lidar ratio is retrieved from CALIOP level 1B (version 4) profile using MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) as a constraint over oceans from March 2013 to February 2015. To quantify the undetected layer AOD (ULA), an unconstrained retrieval is applied globally using a lidar ratio of 28.75 sr estimated from constrained retrievals during the daytime over the ocean. We find a global mean ULA of 0.031 +/- 0.052. There is no significant difference in ULA between land and ocean. However, the fraction of undetected aerosol layers rises considerably during daytime, when the large amount of solar background noise lowers the signal-to-noise ratio. For this reason, there is a difference in ULA between day (0.036 +/- 0.066) and night (0.025 +/- 0.021). ULA is larger in the northern hemisphere and relatively larger at high latitudes. Large ULA for the polar regions is strongly related to the cases where the CALIOP level 2 product reports zero AOD. This study provides an estimate of the complement of AOD that is not detected by lidar and bounds the CALIOP AOD uncertainty to provide corrections for science studies that employ the CALIOP level 2 AOD.

TI  - Adapted sparse fusion with constrained clustering for semisupervised change detection in remotely sensed images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection is defined as the process that helps in determining the changes associated with land use and land cover properties with reference to georegistered multitemporal remote sensing data. A unique idea of integrating sparse fusion with constrained clustering has been attempted to detect changes in multitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images in a framework called ASCC (to be pronounced as "ask"). Unlike the other traditional methods of change detection, this approach focuses on the fusion of difference images followed by a semisupervised clustering to construct a change detection map in binary form. An enhanced sparse representation is adopted to improve the performance of the fusion process by creating a locally adaptive dictionary that extracts patches from the two difference images. The reconstruction of the fused image is performed using maximum absolute coefficients of the learned dictionary. The resultant fused image is subjected to the change detection process through constrained clustering to discern the changed pixels from the unchanged pixels. To evaluate the designed solution, the method is quantified through percentage correct classification and the process is compared with the existing methods of clustering such as kappa-means, adaptive kappa-means, fuzzy C-means, and enhanced constrained kappa-means. The simulation results demonstrated that the designed approach performed better when compared with state-of-art change detection methods for detecting changes in multitemporal images.

TI  - Entrainment of stratospheric air and Asian pollution by the convective boundary layer in the southwestern US
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of deep stratospheric intrusions in late May 2013 increased the daily maximum 8 h surface ozone (O-3) concentrations to more than 70 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at rural and urban surface monitors in California and Nevada. This influx of ozone-rich lower stratospheric air and entrained Asian pollution persisted for more than 5 days and contributed to exceedances of the 2008 8 h national ambient air quality standard of 75 ppbv on 21 and 25 May in Clark County, NV. Exceedances would also have occurred on 22 and 23 May had the new standard of 70 ppbv been in effect. In this paper, we examine this episode using lidar measurements from a high-elevation site on Angel Peak, NV, and surface measurements from NOAA, the Clark County, Nevada Department of Air Quality, the Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System, and the Nevada Rural Ozone Initiative. These measurements, together with analyses from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/North American Regional Reanalysis; NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM3 model; NOAA National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service Real-time Air Quality Modeling System; and FLEXPART models, show that the exceedances followed entrainment of similar to 20 to 40 ppbv of lower stratospheric ozone mingled with another 0 to 10 ppbv of ozone transported from Asia by the unusually deep convective boundary layers above the Mojave desert. Our analysis suggests that this vigorous mixing can affect both high and low elevations and help explain the springtime ozone maximum in the southwestern U.S.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The extensive cloudiness and resulting high albedo of the Southern Oceans (SO) are predominantly due to the occurrence of widespread marine boundary layer clouds. Recent work finds correlations between biogenically enhanced cloud condensation nuclei concentrations and cloud droplet number concentrations derived from passive satellite data. The active remote sensors in the A-Train have created a unique and long-term record of these clouds that include vertical profiles of radar reflectivity and microwave brightness temperature from CloudSat that can be combined with solar reflectances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. We examine this data record using a unique algorithm to infer warm-topped cloud and precipitation properties. We find seasonal variations in cloud properties where summer season clouds demonstrate higher cloud droplet number concentrations on average and require higher liquid water contents to produce similar precipitation rates.

AB  - Global surface emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) over a 10-year period (20052014) are estimated from an assimilation of multiple satellite data sets: tropospheric NO2 columns from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY), O-3 profiles from Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), CO profiles from Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT), and O-3 and HNO3 profiles from Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) using an ensemble Kalman filter technique. Chemical concentrations of various species and emission sources of several precursors are simultaneously optimized. This is expected to improve the emission inversion because the emission estimates are influenced by biases in the modelled tropospheric chemistry, which can be partly corrected by also optimizing the concentrations. We present detailed distributions of the estimated emission distributions for all major regions, the diurnal and seasonal variability, and the evolution of these emissions over the 10-year period. The estimated regional total emissions show a strong positive trend over India (+29 % decade(-1)), China (+26 % decade(-1)), and the Middle East (+20 % decade(-1)), and a negative trend over the USA (-38 % decade(-1)), southern Africa (-8.2 % decade(-1)), and western Europe (-8.8 % decade(-1)). The negative trends in the USA and western Europe are larger during 2005-2010 relative to 2011-2014, whereas the trend in China becomes negative after 2011. The data assimilation also suggests a large uncertainty in anthropogenic and fire-related emission factors and an important underestimation of soil NOx sources in the emission inventories. Despite the large trends observed for individual regions, the global total emission is almost constant between 2005 (47.9 Tg N yr(-1)) and 2014 (47.5 Tg N yr(-1)).

TI  - Global clear-sky surface skin temperature from multiple satellites using a single-channel algorithm with angular anisotropy corrections
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface skin temperature (T-s) is an important parameter for characterizing the energy exchange at the ground/water-atmosphere interface. The Satellite ClOud and Radiation Property retrieval System (SatCORPS) employs a single-channel thermal-infrared (TIR) method to retrieve T-s over clear-sky land and ocean surfaces from data taken by geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite imagers. GEO satellites can provide somewhat continuous estimates of T-s over the diurnal cycle in non-polar regions, while polar T-s retrievals from LEO imagers, such as the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), can complement the GEO measurements. The combined global coverage of remotely sensed T-s, along with accompanying cloud and surface radiation parameters, produced in near-realtime and from historical satellite data, should be beneficial for both weather and climate applications. For example, near-realtime hourly T-s observations can be assimilated in high-temporal-resolution numerical weather prediction models and historical observations can be used for validation or assimilation of climate models. Key drawbacks to the utility of TIR-derived T-s data include the limitation to clear-sky conditions, the reliance on a particular set of analyses/reanalyses necessary for atmospheric corrections, and the dependence on viewing and illumination angles. Therefore, T-s validation with established references is essential, as is proper evaluation of T-s sensitivity to atmospheric correction source.This article presents improvements on the NASA Langley GEO satellite and AVHRR TIR-based T-s product that is derived using a single-channel technique. The resulting clear-sky skin temperature values are validated with surface references and independent Satellite products. Furthermore, an empirically adjusted theoretical model of satellite land surface temperature (LST) angular anisotropy is tested to improve satellite LST retrievals. Application of the anisotropic correction yields reduced mean bias and improved precision of GOES-13 LST relative to independent Moderateresolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MYD11_L2) LST and Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program ground station measurements. It also significantly reduces inter-satellite differences between LSTs retrieved simultaneously from two different imagers. The implementation of these universal corrections into the SatCORPS product can yield significant improvement in near-global-scale, near-realtime, satellite-based LST measurements. The immediate availability and broad coverage of these skin temperature observations should prove valuable to modelers and climate researchers looking for improved forecasts and better understanding of the global climate model.

TI  - Investigating dominant characteristics of fires across the Amazon during 2005-2014 through satellite data synthesis of combustion signatures
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of fire emissions remain uncertain due to limited constraints on the variations in fire characteristics. Here we demonstrate the utility of space-based observations of smoke constituents in addressing this limitation. We introduce a satellite-derived smoke index (SI) as an indicator of the dominant phase of large-scale fires. This index is calculated as the ratio of the geometric mean of observed fractional enhancements (due to fire) in carbon monoxide and aerosol optical depth to that of nitrogen dioxide. We assess the usefulness of this index on fires in the Amazon. We analyze the seasonal, regional, and interannual joint distribution of SI and fire radiative power (FRP) in relation to fire hotspots, land cover, Drought Severity Index, and deforestation rate estimates. We also compare this index with an analogous quantity derived from field data or emission inventories. Our results show that SI changes from low (more flaming) to high (more smoldering) during the course of a fire season, which is consistent with the changes in observed maximum FRPs from high to low. We also find that flaming combustion is more dominant in areas where deforestation fires dominate, while smoldering combustion has a larger influence during drought years when understory fires are more likely enhanced. Lastly, we find that the spatiotemporal variation in SI is inconsistent with current emission inventories. Although we recognize some limitations of this approach, our results point to the utility of SI as a proxy for overall combustion efficiency in the parameterization of fire emission models.

TI  - Accounting for the effects of surface BRDF on satellite cloud and trace-gas retrievals: a new approach based on geometry-dependent Lambertian equivalent reflectivity applied to OMI algorithms
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most satellite nadir ultraviolet and visible cloud, aerosol, and trace-gas algorithms make use of climatological surface reflectivity databases. For example, cloud and NO2 retrievals for the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) use monthly gridded surface reflectivity climatologies that do not depend upon the observation geometry. In reality, reflection of incoming direct and diffuse solar light from land or ocean surfaces is sensitive to the sun-sensor geometry. This dependence is described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). To account for the BRDF, we propose to use a new concept of geometry-dependent Lambertian equivalent reflectivity (LER). Implementation within the existing OMI cloud and NO2 retrieval infrastructure requires changes only to the input surface reflectivity database. The geometry-dependent LER is calculated using a vector radiative transfer model with high spatial resolution BRDF information from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) over land and the Cox-Munk slope distribution over ocean with a contribution from water-leaving radiance. We compare the geometry-dependent and climatological LERs for two wavelengths, 354 and 466 nm, that are used in OMI cloud algorithms to derive cloud fractions. A detailed comparison of the cloud fractions and pressures derived with climatological and geometry-dependent LERs is carried out. Geometry-dependent LER and corresponding retrieved cloud products are then used as inputs to our OMI NO2 algorithm. We find that replacing the climatological OMI-based LERs with geometry-dependent LERs can increase NO2 vertical columns by up to 50% in highly polluted areas; the differences include both BRDF effects and biases between the MODIS and OMI-based surface reflectance data sets. Only minor changes to NO2 columns (within 5 %) are found over unpolluted and overcast areas.

TI  - Low-CCN concentration air masses over the eastern North Atlantic: Seasonality, meteorology, and drivers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A 20 month cloud condensation nucleus concentration (N-CCN) data set from Graciosa Island (39 degrees N, 28 degrees W) in the remote North Atlantic is used to characterize air masses with low cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. Low-CCN events are defined as 6 h periods with mean N-CCN < 20 cm(-3) (0.1% supersaturation). A total of 47 low-CCN events are identified. Surface, satellite, and reanalysis data are used to explore the meteorological and cloud context for low-CCN air masses. Low-CCN events occur in all seasons, but their frequency was 3 times higher in December-May than during June-November. Composites show that many of the low-CCN events had a common meteorological basis that involves southerly low-level flow and rather low wind speeds at Graciosa. Anomalously low pressure is situated to the west of Graciosa during these events, but back trajectories and lagged SLP composites indicate that low-CCN air masses often originate as cold air outbreaks to the north and west of Graciosa. Low-CCN events were associated with low cloud droplet concentrations (N-d) at Graciosa, but liquid water path (LWP) during low-CCN events was not systematically different from that at other times. Satellite N-d and LWP estimates from MODIS collocated with Lagrangian back trajectories show systematically lower N-d and higher LWP several days prior to arrival at Graciosa, consistent with the hypothesis that observed low-CCN air masses are often formed by coalescence scavenging in thick warm clouds, often in cold air outbreaks.

TI  - On the response of MODIS cloud coverage to global mean surface air temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The global surface temperature change (Delta T-s) mediated cloud cover response is directly related to cloud-climate feedback. Using satellite remote sensing data to relate cloud and climate requires a well-calibrated, stable, and consistent long-term cloud data record. The Collection 5.1 (C5) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud observations have been widely used for this purpose. However, the MODIS data quality varies greatly with the surface type, spectral region, cloud type, and time periods of study, which calls for additional caution when applying such data to studies on cloud cover temporal trends and variability. Using 15 years of cloud observations made by Terra and Aqua MODIS, we analyze the Delta T-s-mediated cloud cover response for different cloud types by linearly regressing the monthly anomaly of cloud cover (Delta C) with the monthly anomaly of global T-s. The Collection 6 (C6) Aqua data exhibit a similar cloud response to the long-term counterpart simulated by advanced climate models. A robust increase in altitude with increasing Delta T-s is found for high clouds, while a robust decrease of Delta C is noticed for optically thick low clouds. The large differences between C5 and C6 results are from improvements in calibration and cloud retrieval algorithms. The large positive cloud cover responses with data after 2010 and the strong sensitivity to time period obtained from the Terra (C5 and C6) data are likely due to calibration drift that has not been corrected, suggesting that the previous estimate of the short-term cloud cover response from the these data should be revisited.

TI  - Comparing simulated PSC optical properties with CALIPSO observations during the 2010 Antarctic winter
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We simulate polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) during the Antarctic winter of 2010 using the Specified Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model/Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (SD-WACCM/CARMA) model. The current PSC model contains microphysical schemes for supercooled ternary solutions (STS) and nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, as well as a prognostic treatment for PSC ice particles and dehydration. Our simulations and CALIPSO satellite data suggest two major NAT particle formation mechanisms. The first mechanism is the nucleation of NAT from STS. Our model, with homogeneous nucleation rates of NAT from STS constrained by observations from the Arctic winter of 2010-2011, reproduces optical properties observed by CALIPSO over Antarctica in May and the timing of denitrification observed by the Microwave Limb Sounder within their uncertainties. On the other hand, the CALIPSO data indicate that our simulations are missing clouds containing small NAT particles with large number densities. We suggest these particles are most likely to form from ice clouds or STS in gravity waves, as found by previous investigations. The simulated cloud coverage agrees with the CALIPSO cloud coverage within a few percent on average with a correlation coefficient of 0.83. However, using the CALIPSO classification algorithm, simulated ice clouds often fall into Mix categories under the denitrified and dehydrated conditions. The model needs an improved ice microphysical representation, not only to allow ice particles to be a source of NAT but also to provide information on ice cloud particle number and size so that ice cloud optical properties can be more precisely calculated for comparison with CALIPSO data.

TI  - Tropospheric temperature measurements with the pure rotational Raman lidar technique using nonlinear calibration functions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Among lidar techniques, the pure rotational Raman (PRR) technique is the best suited for tropospheric and lower stratospheric temperature measurements. Calibration functions are required for the PRR technique to retrieve temperature profiles from lidar remote sensing data. Both temperature retrieval accuracy and number of calibration coefficients depend on the selected function. The commonly used calibration function (linear in reciprocal temperature 1/T with two calibration coefficients) ignores all types of broadening of individual PRR lines of atmospheric N-2 and O-2 molecules. However, the collisional (pressure) broadening dominates over other types of broadening of PRR lines in the troposphere and can differently affect the accuracy of tropospheric temperature measurements depending on the PRR lidar system. We recently derived the calibration function in the general analytical form that takes into account the collisional broadening of all N-2 and O-2 PRR lines (Gerasimov and Zuev, 2016). This general calibration function represents an infinite series and, therefore, cannot be directly used in the temperature retrieval algorithm. For this reason, its four simplest special cases (calibration functions nonlinear in 1/T with three calibration coefficients), two of which have not been suggested before, were considered and analyzed. All the special cases take the collisional PRR lines broadening into account in varying degrees and the best function among them was determined via simulation. In this paper, we use the special cases to retrieve tropospheric temperature from real PRR lidar data. The calibration function best suited for tropospheric temperature retrievals is determined from the comparative analysis of temperature uncertainties yielded by using these functions. The absolute and relative statistical uncertainties of temperature retrieval are given in an analytical form assuming Poisson statistics of photon counting. The vertical tropospheric temperature profiles, retrieved from nighttime lidar measurements in Tomsk (56.48 degrees N, 85.05 degrees E; Western Siberia, Russia) on 2 October 2014 and 1 April 2015, are presented as an example of the calibration functions application. The measurements were performed using a PRR lidar designed in the Institute of Monitoring of Climatic and Ecological Systems of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences for tropospheric temperature measurements.

TI  - Comparison of Mediterranean Pteropod Shell Biometrics and Ultrastructure from Historical (1910 and 1921) and Present Day (2012) Samples Provides Baseline for Monitoring Effects of Global Change
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic carbon perturbation has caused decreases in seawater pH and increases in global temperatures since the start of the 20th century. The subsequent lowering of the saturation state of CaCO3 may make the secretion of skeletons more problematic for marine calcifiers. As organisms that precipitate thin aragonite shells, thecosome pteropods have been identified as being particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. Coupled with their global distribution, this makes them ideal for use as sentinel organisms. Recent studies have highlighted shell dissolution as a potential indicator of ocean acidification; however, this metric is not applicable for monitoring pH changes in supersaturated basins. In this study, the novel approach of high resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning was used to produce quantitative 3-dimensional renderings pteropod shells to assess the potential of using this method to monitor small changes in shell biometrics that may be driven by climate change drivers. An ontogenetic analysis of the shells of Cavolinia inflexa and Styliola subula collected from the Mediterranean was used to identify suitable monitoring metrics. Modern samples were then compared to historical samples of the same species, collected during the Mediterranean leg of the Thor (1910) and Dana (1921) cruises to assess whether any empirical differences could be detected. Shell densities were calculated and scanning electron microscopy was used to compare the aragonite crystal morphology. pH for the collection years was hind-cast using temperature and salinity time series with atmospheric CO2 concentrations from ice core data. Historical samples of S. subula were thicker than S. subula shells of the same size from 2012 and C. inflexa shells collected in 1910 were significantly denser than those from 2012. These results provide a baseline for future work to develop monitoring techniques for climate change in the oceans using the novel approach of high-resolution CT scanning.

TI  - The 2014 geomagnetic jerk as observed by southern African magnetic observatories
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid secular variation pulses in the Earth's geomagnetic field have been identified during the last decade. In particular, the 2014 jerk is the latest in a series of localised rapid secular variation events observed at the Earth's surface which are thought to be the result of rapid oscillations at the core surface approximately at a depth of 3000 km. In Southern Africa, the 2014 jerk has been analysed using data from four observatories located at Hermanus, Hartebeesthoek, Keetmanshoop and Tsumeb and found that this event occurred with varying strengths in the different components at a particular observatory, while different observatories in the region showed strong individual characteristics. The changes in the secular variation patterns at individual magnetic observatories in this study took place in an area characterised by rapid changes in the geomagnetic field with time. Of particular interest is that global field models like CHAOS-6 and POMME 10 derived from various combinations of ground and satellite data do not always indicate similar short-period patterns in X, Y and Z as revealed by observatory measurements. This has been confirmed by comparing the secular variation pattern at the Kourou magnetic observatory located in French Guiana, a station close to the current centre of the South Atlantic Anomaly.

M3  - Article
AB  - The study to evaluate regional ecosystem services and their radiation effects may help exposit the features of integrity and correlativity of the ecological-economical-societal complex system of the studied region. Based on the 2013 land sate remote-sensing images of the Zhangjiakou-Chengde Region and the eco-service valuation method, the composition of the surface land cover and key ecosystem services of the region and their radiation effects on Beijing have been analyzed and evaluated. Results show that about 97% of the land in this region is covered with forests, grasslands and farmlands, which are the mainstay of the ecological protective screen for the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Metropolitan Region. The natural ecosystem of the region may provide key ecosystem services, such as water conservation, wind and sand control, carbon sequestration and oxygen release, valuated as high as 189.5 billion yuan RMB in 2013. The high-valued eco-zones are distributed mainly in Chengde, of which the land is mostly covered with forests and grasslands and the southeastern part of Zhangjiakou. Every year, nearly 21% of the key ecosystem services of the Zhangjiakou-Chengde region may render are radiated into Beijing, via water and wind. Within the region, Huailai, Chicheng, Xuanhua, Zhuolu, Chongli and Guyuan counties are more closely related to the ecosystem services of Beijing as major contributors. All the findings of the study may serve as certain valuable reference for future efforts to exposit ecosystem integrity of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Metropolitan Region and to explore scientific mechanisms for eco-remediation and cooperation of the Region.

TI  - Rapid wastage of the Hazen Plateau ice caps, northeastern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Two pairs of small stagnant ice bodies on the Hazen Plateau of northeastern Ellesmere Island, the St. Patrick Bay ice caps and the Murray and Simmons ice caps, are rapidly shrinking, and the remnants of the St. Patrick Bay ice caps are likely to disappear entirely within the next 5 years. Vertical aerial photographs of these Little Ice Age relics taken during August of 1959 show that the larger of the St. Patrick Bay ice caps had an area of 7.48 km(2) and the smaller one 2.93 km(2); the Murray and Simmons ice caps covered 4.37 and 7.45 km(2) respectively. Outlines determined from ASTER satellite data for July 2016 show that, compared to 1959, the larger and the smaller of the St. Patrick Bay ice caps had both been reduced to only 5% of their former area, with the Murray and Simmons ice caps faring better at 39 and 25 %, likely reflecting their higher elevation. Consistent with findings from other glaciological studies in the Queen Elizabeth Islands, ASTER imagery in conjunction with past GPS surveys documents a strikingly rapid wastage of the St. Patrick Bay ice caps over the last 15 years. These two ice caps shrank noticeably even between 2014 and 2015, apparently in direct response to the especially warm summer of 2015 over northeastern Ellesmere Island. The well-documented recession patterns of the Hazen Plateau ice caps over the last 55+ years offer an opportunity to examine the processes of plant recolonization of polar landscapes.

TI  - Extent of Night Warming and Spatially Heterogeneous Cloudiness Differentiate Temporal Trend of Greenness in Mountainous Tropics in the New Century
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests have essential functions in global C dynamics but vulnerable to changes in land cover land use (LCLUC) and climate. The tropics of Caribbean are experiencing warming and drying climate and diverse LCLUC. However, large-scale studies to detect long-term trends of C and mechanisms behind are still rare. Using MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), we investigated greenness trend in the Greater Antilles Caribbean during 2000-2015, and analyzed trend of vegetation patches without LCLUC to give prominence to climate impacts. We hypothesized that night warming and heavy cloudiness would reduce EVI in this mountainous tropical region. Over the 15 years, EVI decreased significantly in Jamaica, Haiti, Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico, but increased in Cuba partly due to its strong reforestation. Haiti had the largest decreasing trend because of continuous deforestation for charcoals. After LCLUC was excluded, EVI trend still varied greatly, decreasing in the windward but increasing in the leeward of Puerto Rico. Nighttime warming reinforced by spatially heterogeneous cloudiness was found to significantly and negatively correlate with EVI trend, and explained the spatial pattern of the latter. Although cooled daytime and increased rainfall might enhance EVI, nighttime warming dominated the climate impacts and differentiated the EVI trend.

TI  - Impact of spaceborne carbon monoxide observations from the S-5P platform on tropospheric composition analyses and forecasts
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use the technique of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to quantify the impact of space-borne carbon monoxide (CO) total column observations from the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) platform on tropospheric analyses and forecasts. We focus on Europe for the period of northern summer 2003, when there was a severe heat wave episode associated with extremely hot and dry weather conditions. We describe different elements of the OSSE: (i) the nature run (NR), i.e., the "truth"; (ii) the CO synthetic observations; (iii) the assimilation run (AR), where we assimilate the observations of interest; (iv) the control run (CR), in this study a free model run without assimilation; and (v) efforts to establish the fidelity of the OSSE results. Comparison of the results from AR and the CR, against the NR, shows that CO total column observations from S-5P provide a significant benefit (at the 99% confidence level) at the surface, with the largest benefit occurring over land in regions far away from emission sources. Furthermore, the S-5P CO total column observations are able to capture phenomena such as the forest fires that occurred in Portugal during northern summer 2003. These results provide evidence of the benefit of S-5P observations for monitoring processes contributing to atmospheric pollution.

TI  - Water availability limits tree productivity, carbon stocks, and carbon residence time in mature forests across the western US
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water availability constrains the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems and is projected to change in many parts of the world over the coming century. We quantified the response of tree net primary productivity (NPP), live biomass (BIO), and mean carbon residence time (CRT = BIO / NPP) to spatial variation in water availability in the western US. We used forest inventory measurements from 1953 mature stands (> 100 years) in Washington, Oregon, and California (WAORCA) along with satellite and climate data sets covering the western US. We summarized forest structure and function in both domains along a 400 cm yr(-1) hydrologic gradient, quantified with a climate moisture index (CMI) based on the difference between precipitation and reference evapotranspiration summed over the water year (October-September) and then averaged annually from 1985 to 2014 (CMIwy). Median NPP, BIO, and CRT computed at 10 cm yr(-1) intervals along the CMIwy gradient increased monotonically with increasing CMIwy across both WAORCA (r(s) = 0.93-0.96, p < 0.001) and the western US (r(s) = 0.93-0.99, p < 0.001). Field measurements from WAORCA showed that median NPP increased from 2.2 to 5.6 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) between the driest and wettest 5% of sites, while BIO increased from 26 to 281 Mg C ha(-1) and CRT increased from 11 to 49 years. The satellite data sets revealed similar changes over the western US, though these data sets tended to plateau in the wettest areas, suggesting that additional efforts are needed to better quantify NPP and BIO from satellites in high-productivity, high-biomass forests. Our results illustrate that long-term average water availability is a key environmental constraint on tree productivity, carbon storage, and carbon residence time in mature forests across the western US, underscoring the need to assess potential ecosystem response to projected warming and drying over the coming century.

TI  - Azimuth-range decouple-based <i>L</i><sub>1</sub> regularization method for wide ScanSAR imaging via extended chirp scaling
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we proposed an azimuth-range decouple-based L-1 regularization method for wide ScanSAR imaging via extended chirp scaling (ECS) and applied it to the TerraSAR-X data to achieve large-scale sparse reconstruction. Compared with ECS, the conventional ScanSAR imaging algorithm based on matched filtering, the proposed method can improve the synthetic aperture radar image performance with full-sampling raw data for not only sparse but also nonsparse surveillance regions. It can also achieve high-resolution imaging for sparse considered scenes efficiently using down-sampling raw data. Compared with a typical L-1 regularization imaging approach, which requires transfer of the two-dimensional (2-D) echo data into a vector and reconstruction of the scene via 2-D matrix operation, our proposed method has less computational cost and hence makes the large-scale regularization reconstruction of considered area become possible. The experimental results via real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Environmental control of natural gap size distribution in tropical forests
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural disturbances are the dominant form of forest regeneration and dynamics in unmanaged tropical forests. Monitoring the size distribution of treefall gaps is important to better understand and predict the carbon budget in response to land use and other global changes. In this study, we model the size frequency distribution of natural canopy gaps with a discrete power law distribution. We use a Bayesian framework to introduce and test, using Monte Carlo Markov chain and Kuo-Mallick algorithms, the effect of local physical environment on gap size distribution. We apply our methodological framework to an original light detecting and ranging dataset in which natural forest gaps were delineated over 30 000 ha of unmanaged forest. We highlight strong links between gap size distribution and environment, primarily hydrological conditions and topography, with large gaps being more frequent on floodplains and in wind-exposed areas. In the future, we plan to apply our methodological framework on a larger scale using satellite data. Additionally, although gap size distribution variation is clearly under environmental control, variation in gap size distribution in time should be tested against climate variability.

TI  - Quantifying local-scale dust emission from the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust plumes emitted from the narrow Arabian Red Sea coastal plain are often observed on satellite images and felt in local population centers. Despite its relatively small area, the coastal plain could be a significant dust source; however, its effect is not well quantified as it is not well approximated in global or even regional models. In addition, because of close proximity to the Red Sea, a significant amount of dust from the coastal areas could be deposited into the Red Sea and serve as a vital component of the nutrient balance of marine ecosystems.In the current study, we apply the offline Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) to better quantify dust emission from the coastal plain during the period of 2009-2011. We verify the spatial and temporal variability in model results using independent weather station reports. We also compare the results with the MERRA Aerosol Reanalysis (MERRAero). We show that the best results are obtained with 1 km model spatial resolution and dust source function based on Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) measurements. We present the dust emission spatial pattern, as well as estimates of seasonal and diurnal variability in dust event frequency and intensity, and discuss the emission regime in the major dust generation hot spot areas. We demonstrate the contrasting seasonal dust cycles in the northern and southern parts of the coastal plain and discuss the physical mechanisms responsible for dust generation.This study provides the first estimates of the fine-scale spatial and temporal distribution of dust emissions from the Arabian Red Sea coastal plain constrained by MERRAero and short-term WRF-Chem simulations. The estimate of total dust emission from the coastal plain, tuned to fit emissions in MERRAero, is 7.5 +/- 0.5 Mt a(-1). Small interannual variability indicates that the study area is a stable dust source. The mineralogical composition analysis shows that the coastal plain generates around 76 +/- 5 kt of iron oxides and 6 +/- 0.4 kt of phosphorus annually. Over 65% of dust is emitted from the northern part of the coastal plain.

TI  - High Resolution Mapping of Soil Properties Using Remote Sensing Variables in South-Western Burkina Faso: A Comparison of Machine Learning and Multiple Linear Regression Models
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and detailed spatial soil information is essential for environmental modelling, risk assessment and decision making. The use of Remote Sensing data as secondary sources of information in digital soil mapping has been found to be cost effective and less time consuming compared to traditional soil mapping approaches. But the potentials of Remote Sensing data in improving knowledge of local scale soil information in West Africa have not been fully explored. This study investigated the use of high spatial resolution satellite data (RapidEye and Landsat), terrain/climatic data and laboratory analysed soil samples to map the spatial distribution of six soil properties-sand, silt, clay, cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen-in a 580 km(2) agricultural watershed in south-western Burkina Faso. Four statistical prediction models-multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), stochastic gradient boosting (SGB)-were tested and compared. Internal validation was conducted by cross validation while the predictions were validated against an independent set of soil samples considering the modelling area and an extrapolation area. Model performance statistics revealed that the machine learning techniques performed marginally better than the MLR, with the RFR providing in most cases the highest accuracy. The inability of MLR to handle non-linear relationships between dependent and independent variables was found to be a limitation in accurately predicting soil properties at unsampled locations. Satellite data acquired during ploughing or early crop development stages (e.g. May, June) were found to be the most important spectral predictors while elevation, temperature and precipitation came up as prominent terrain/climatic variables in predicting soil properties. The results further showed that shortwave infrared and near infrared channels of Landsat8 as well as soil specific indices of redness, coloration and saturation were prominent predictors in digital soil mapping. Considering the increased availability of freely available Remote Sensing data (e.g. Landsat, SRTM, Sentinels), soil information at local and regional scales in data poor regions such as West Africa can be improved with relatively little financial and human resources.

TI  - Evaluation of single-band snow-patch mapping using high-resolution microwave remote sensing: an application in the maritime Antarctic
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous and ice-free terrains of the maritime Antarctic generate complex mosaics of snow patches, ranging from tens to hundreds of metres. These can only be accurately mapped using high-resolution remote sensing. In this paper we evaluate the application of radar scenes from TerraSAR-X in High Resolution SpotLight mode for mapping snow patches at a test area on Fildes Peninsula (King George Island, South Shetlands). Snow-patch mapping and characterization of snow stratigraphy were conducted at the time of image acquisition on 12 and 13 January 2012. Snow was wet in all studied snow patches, with coarse-grain and rounded crystals showing advanced melting and with frequent ice layers in the snow pack. Two TerraSAR-X scenes in HH and VV polarization modes were analysed, with the former showing the best results when discriminating between wet snow, lake water and bare soil. However, significant overlap in the backscattering signal was found. Average wet-snow backscattering was -18.0 dB in HH mode, with water showing -21.1 dB and bare soil showing -11.9 dB. Single-band pixel-based and object-oriented image classification methods were used to assess the classification potential of TerraSAR-X SpotLight imagery. The best results were obtained with an object-oriented approach using a watershed segmentation with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, with an overall accuracy of 92% and Kappa of 0.88. The main limitation was the west to north-west facing snow patches, which showed significant error, an issue related to artefacts from the geometry of satellite imagery acquisition. The results show that TerraSAR-X in SpotLight mode provides high-quality imagery for mapping wet snow and snowmelt in the maritime Antarctic. The classification procedure that we propose is a simple method and a first step to an implementation in operational mode if a good digital elevation model is available.

TI  - Facile scalable synthesis of highly monodisperse small silica nanoparticles using alkaline buffer solution and their application for efficient sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
M3  - Article
AB  - Cancer nanomedicine involving nanotechnology-based drugs and in vivo imaging agents is an active field of nanoscience that provides new ways of enhancing therapeutic and diagnostic efficacy. Translating cancer nanomedicine mainly comes from rational and scalable design of nanoparticles to achieve versatile properties including specific size because nanomaterials whose properties confer unique advantages can only optimize clinical impact. Here, a facile scalable synthesis of highly monodisperse small silica nanoparticles was developed by screening various alkaline buffer solutions as catalysts. The size of silica nanoparticles ranging from 7 to 30 nm was finely controlled by varying the reaction temperature. Moderate sized silica nanoparticles in the range of 30 to 50 nm and large sized silica nanoparticles (>100 nm) were readily synthesized by in situ adding tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and applying the Stober method in the reaction solution using small silica nanoparticles as the seeds, respectively. Having shown the ability to precisely synthesize size controlled silica nanoparticles with a process compatible with good manufacturing practices, we performed in vivo fluorescence imaging and immunofluorescence analysis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) with the synthesized nanoparticles having different sizes to investigate the size effect for effective identification of SLNs. The synthesized nanoparticles with a diameter of 12 nm showed effective SLN uptake within 10 min after intradermal injection both in noninvasive and in intraoperative imaging mode and were localized evenly inside the SLN, whereas the 120 nm sized nanoparticles failed to identify the SLN with noninvasive imaging at 10 min post-injection and distributed only in the medulla region not in the superficial cortex of the SLN. Taken together, a new facile scalable synthesis technique to achieve fine size controlling capability from very small silica nanoparticles (7 nm) was developed and it made possible to investigate the optimal size of nanoparticles for efficient SLN mapping which is still controversial.

TI  - Using spatiotemporal remote sensing data to assess the status and effectiveness of the underground coal fire suppression efforts during 2000-2015 in Wuda, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - China, the largest coal consumer in the world, is one of the countries that experience the most coal fires. Hence, it is critical for China to monitor coal fires and carry out coal fire monitoring, assessment, and appropriate suppression work. The Wuda coalfield, located in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, was selected as the study area. This paper was aiming to analyze spatiotemporal changes of coal fires located in Wuda of China from 2000 to 2015 and focused on the assessment of fire protection project during 2006-2008. Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images were used to detect changes in coal fires over the last 16 years by utilizing a generalized single-channel method to retrieve land surface temperature data and natural breaks extracting coal fire zones. The results showed that: 1) the changes of coal fires area represented obvious three stages: Stage I (2000 2006) was before the fire suppression project with fire spread and expansion; Stage II (2006-2008) was the implementation of this project with rapid reduction of fire area; Stage III (2008-2015) was after this project with stable fire area at a low level; 2) the fire suppression work was highly successful; the area of coal fires basically remained at 192.98 ha, a reduction by 45.74% from 2000 and 62.40% from 2006 (before fire suppression projects); 3) fire suppression work in the south (zone F) and in the northwest (zone A) was the most successful, while some new patches sporadically appeared in other regions (zone B, C and D); 4) coal fire suppression methods have led to significant destruction of local geomorphology; 5) it was difficult to completely extinct coal fires underground with current suppression method. Compared with previous studies, this research paid more attention to the estimation of fire suppression projections which provided an available way for environment decision makers and coal energy producers to qualitatively assess the status and effectiveness of coal fire suppression projects.

TI  - Diagnostic Efficacy of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis of 66 Studies
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe diagnostic efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy(SLNB) in early oral squamous cell carcinoma(OSCC) still remains controversial. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the diagnostic value of SLNB in clinically neck-negative T1-2 OSCC.MethodsA systematic literature search for relevant literature published up to September 11, 2016 was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials, and the reference lists of eligible studies were examined. Data from different studies were pooled to estimate the summary sentinel lymph node(SLN) identification rate, sensitivity, negative predictive value. Summary receiver operator characteristic curve(SROC) was plotted and area under the SROC curve (AUC) was calculated to evaluate the overall diagnostic efficacy. Threshold effect was assessed with use of the spearman correlation coefficient. Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the Q tests and the I-2 statistics. Subgroup analyses were conducted in view of the greater effect of different study characteristics on diagnostic efficacy of SLN. Deeks' funnel plot asymmetry test was performed to evaluate publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was evaluated through omitting studies one by one and comparing the pooled results of random-effects model and fixed-effects model. All analyses were performed using Review Manager (version 5.3.5), Meta-DiSc (version 1.4), Comprehensive Meta Analysis (version 2.0) and STATA (version 12).Results66 studies comprising 3566 patients with cT1-2N0 OSCC were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled SLN identification rate was 96.3%(95% CI: 95.3%-97.0%). The pooled sensitivity was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.85-0.89), pooled negative predictive value was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.93-0.95), and AUC was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.97-0.99). Subgroup analyses indicated that SLN assessment with immunohistochemistry(IHC) achieved a significantly higher sensitivity than without IHC.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis suggests that SLNB has a high diagnostic accuracy in cT1-2N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma, and is an ideal alternative to elective neck dissection. Furthermore, the use of IHC can significantly improve SLNB diagnostic sensitivity for early OSCC.

TI  - Seasonal and regional presence of hymenopteran parasitoids of <i>Drosophila</i> in Switzerland and their ability to parasitize the invasive <i>Drosophila suzukii</i>
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its introduction into Europe the invasive Drosophila suzukii has established and spread widely, thereby entering habitats populated by native Drosophila species and their natural enemies. The highly prolific D. suzukii will likely interact with these species as a competitor, host or prey. To investigate potential interactions of D. suzukii with parasitoids, a field survey was conducted across several fruit-growing regions in Switzerland in two consecutive years. Eight species of hymenopteran parasitoids were collected using D. melanogaster as sentinel hosts in field-traps. Parasitoid capture was much higher in 2015 than in 2014 and varied among regions, time of the growing season, and habitat type. Laboratory no-choice assays with the field-collected species demonstrated that the larval parasitoids Asobara tabida, Leptopilina boulardi, and L. heterotoma could not use D. suzukii for reproduction, although the latter two reduced the number of emerging D. suzukii. In contrast, the pupal parasitoids Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae, Trichopria drosophilae, Vrestovia fidenas and Spalangia erythromera all developed with D. suzukii as hosts. Regional differences between strains were generally not evident, with the exception of two T. drosophilae strains that differed in parasitization rate. Thus, native parasitoids may interact with D. suzukii and should be regarded when implementing pest control measures.

TI  - Keeping it All Going - Complement Meets Metabolism
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The complement system is an evolutionary old and crucial component of innate immunity, which is key to the detection and removal of invading pathogens. It was initially discovered as a liver-derived sentinel system circulating in serum, the lymph, and interstitial fluids that mediate the opsonization and lytic killing of bacteria, fungi, and viruses and the initiation of the general inflammatory responses. Although work performed specifically in the last five decades identified complement also as a critical instructor of adaptive immunity-indicating that complement's function is likely broader than initially anticipated-the dominant opinion among researchers and clinicians was that the key complement functions were in principle defined. However, there is now a growing realization that complement activity goes well beyond "classic" immune functions and that this system is also required for normal (neuronal) development and activity and general cell and tissue integrity and homeostasis. Furthermore, the recent discovery that complement activation is not confined to the extracellular space but occurs within cells led to the surprising understanding that complement is involved in the regulation of basic processes of the cell, particularly those of metabolic nature-mostly via novel crosstalks between complement and intracellular sensor, and effector, pathways that had been overlooked because of their spatial separation. These paradigm shifts in the field led to a renaissance in complement research and provide new platforms to now better understand the molecular pathways underlying the wide-reaching effects of complement functions in immunity and beyond. In this review, we will cover the current knowledge about complement's emerging relationship with the cellular metabolism machinery with a focus on the functional differences between serum-circulating versus intracellularly active complement during normal cell survival and induction of effector functions. We will also discuss how taking a closer look into the evolution of key complement components not only made the functional connection between complement and metabolism rather "predictable" but how it may also give clues for the discovery of additional roles for complement in basic cellular processes.

TI  - Evaluating the hydrological consistency of evaporation products using satellite-based gravity and rainfall data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in space-based observations have provided the capacity to develop regional-to global-scale estimates of evaporation, offering insights into this key component of the hydrological cycle. However, the evaluation of large-scale evaporation retrievals is not a straightforward task. While a number of studies have intercompared a range of these evaporation products by examining the variance amongst them, or by comparison of pixel-scale retrievals against ground-based observations, there is a need to explore more appropriate techniques to comprehensively evaluate remote-sensing-based estimates. One possible approach is to establish the level of product agreement between related hydrological components: for instance, how well do evaporation patterns and response match with precipitation or water storage changes? To assess the suitability of this "consistency"-based approach for evaluating evaporation products, we focused our investigation on four globally distributed basins in arid and semi-arid environments, comprising the Colorado River basin, Niger River basin, Aral Sea basin, and Lake Eyre basin. In an effort to assess retrieval quality, three satellite-based global evaporation products based on different methodologies and input data, including CSIRO-PML, the MODIS Global Evapotranspiration product (MOD16), and Global Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM), were evaluated against rainfall data from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) along with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) water storage anomalies. To ensure a fair comparison, we evaluated consistency using a degree correlation approach after transforming both evaporation and precipitation data into spherical harmonics. Overall we found no persistent hydrological consistency in these dry-land environments. Indeed, the degree correlation showed oscillating values between periods of low and high water storage changes, with a phase difference of about 2-3 months. Interestingly, after imposing a simple lag in GRACE data to account for delayed surface runoff or baseflow components, an improved match in terms of degree correlation was observed in the Niger River basin. Significant improvements to the degree correlations (from similar to 0 to about 0.6) were also found in the Colorado River basin for both the CSIRO-PML and GLEAM products, while MOD16 showed only half of that improvement. In other basins, the variability in the temporal pattern of degree correlations remained considerable and hindered any clear differentiation between the evaporation products. Even so, it was found that a constant lag of 2 months provided a better fit compared to other alternatives, including a zero lag. From a product assessment perspective, no significant or persistent advantage could be discerned across any of the three evaporation products in terms of a sustained hydrological consistency with precipitation and water storage anomaly data. As a result, our analysis has implications in terms of the confidence that can be placed in independent retrievals of the hydrological cycle, raises questions on inter-product quality, and highlights the need for additional techniques to evaluate large-scale products.

TI  - Elective breast radiotherapy including level I and II lymph nodes: A planning study with the humeral head as planning risk volume
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to assess the dose to the humeral head planning risk volume with the currently used high tangential fields (HTF) and compare different planning techniques for breast radiotherapy including axillary level I and II lymph nodes (PTVn) while sparing the humeral head.Methods: Ten patients with left-sided breast cancer were enrolled in a planning study with 16 fractions of 2.66 Gy. Four planning techniques were compared: HTF, HTF with sparing of the humeral head, 6-field IMRT with sparing of the humeral head and VMAT with sparing of the humeral head. The humeral head + 10 mm was spared by restricting V40Gy < 1 cc.Results: The dose to the humeral head was too high with HTF (V40Gy on average 20.7 cc). When sparing the humeral head in HTF, PTVn V90% decreased significantly from 97.9% to 89.4%. 6-field IMRT and VMAT had a PTVn V90% of 98.2% and 99.5% respectively. However, dose to the lungs, heart and especially the contralateral breast increased with VMAT.Conclusions: The humeral head is rarely spared when using HTF. When sparing the humeral head, the 6-field IMRT technique leads to adequate PTV coverage while not increasing the dose to the OARs.

TI  - Review of Participatory Epidemiology Practices in Animal Health (1980-2015) and Future Practice Directions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - In this study we combined an inventory of the major applications, geographic regions and diseases covered by participatory epidemiology (PE) activities in the field of animal health since 1980, together with an email discussion forum with PE practitioners from different regions of the world. The inventory included the search of peer-reviewed papers, master and technical reports, conference proceedings, manuals, training materials and projects. The search resulted in a low number of PE activity results until the year 2000, followed by a considerable increase (especially from 2012). Most of the identified activities were implemented in Africa and Asia, and focused on surveillance, disease survey and prioritization, and disease control. Seventy-nine PE practitioners working predominantly in Africa, Asia and Europe (29, 22 and 18 respectively) contributed to the email discussion forum. They proposed various modifications to the existing PE definition and discussed different issues related to the applicatoin of PE, its institutionalization for use in policy development, as well as the priorities for future development. The need to increase the number of PE trained people together with some methodological developments and the application of this methodology in developed countries, were some of the points highlighted during the forum. These factors stress the importance of further developing PE as a useful approach for engaging communities in addressing animal and related public health risks.

T2  - ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Zika virus has spread rapidly in the Americas and has been imported into many nonendemic countries by travelers.Objective: To describe clinical manifestations and epidemiology of Zika virus disease in travelers exposed in the Americas.Design: Descriptive, using GeoSentinel records.Setting: 63 travel and tropical medicine clinics in 30 countries.Patients: Ill returned travelers with a confirmed, probable, or clinically suspected diagnosis of Zika virus disease seen between January 2013 and 29 February 2016.Measurements: Frequencies of demographic, trip, and clinical characteristics and complications.Results: Starting in May 2015, 93 cases of Zika virus disease were reported. Common symptoms included exanthema (88%), fever (76%), and arthralgia (72%). Fifty-nine percent of patients were exposed in South America; 71% were diagnosed in Europe. Case status was established most commonly by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood and less often by PCR testing of other body fluids or serology and plaque-reduction neutralization testing. Two patients developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, and 3 of 4 pregnancies had adverse outcomes (microcephaly, major fetal neurologic abnormalities, and intrauterine fetal death).Limitation: Surveillance data collected by specialized clinics may not be representative of all ill returned travelers, and denominator data are unavailable.Conclusion: These surveillance data help characterize the clinical manifestations and adverse outcomes of Zika virus disease among travelers infected in the Americas and show a need for global standardization of diagnostic testing. The serious fetal complications observed in this study highlight the importance of travel advisories and prevention measures for pregnant women and their partners. Travelers are sentinels for global Zika virus circulation and may facilitate further transmission.

TI  - An ice sheet model validation framework for the Greenland ice sheet
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a new ice sheet model validation framework - the Cryospheric Model Comparison Tool (CmCt) - that takes advantage of ice sheet altimetry and gravimetry observations collected over the past several decades and is applied here to modeling of the Greenland ice sheet. We use realistic simulations performed with the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM) along with two idealized, non-dynamic models to demonstrate the framework and its use. Dynamic simulations with CISM are forced from 1991 to 2013, using combinations of reanalysis-based surface mass balance and observations of outlet glacier flux change. We propose and demonstrate qualitative and quantitative metrics for use in evaluating the different model simulations against the observations. We find that the altimetry observations used here are largely ambiguous in terms of their ability to distinguish one simulation from another. Based on basin-scale and whole-ice-sheet-scale metrics, we find that simulations using both idealized conceptual models and dynamic, numerical models provide an equally reasonable representation of the ice sheet surface (mean elevation differences of <1 m). This is likely due to their short period of record, biases inherent to digital elevation models used for model initial conditions, and biases resulting from firn dynamics, which are not explicitly accounted for in the models or observations. On the other hand, we find that the gravimetry observations used here are able to unambiguously distinguish between simulations of varying complexity, and along with the CmCt, can provide a quantitative score for assessing a particular model and/or simulation. The new framework demonstrates that our proposed metrics can distinguish relatively better from relatively worse simulations and that dynamic ice sheet models, when appropriately initialized and forced with the right boundary conditions, demonstrate a predictive skill with respect to observed dynamic changes that have occurred on Greenland over the past few decades. An extensible design will allow for continued use of the CmCt as future altimetry, gravimetry, and other remotely sensed data become available for use in ice sheet model validation.

TI  - Decadal-scale relationship between measurements of aerosols, land-use change, and fire over Southeast Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A simultaneous analysis of 13 years of remotely sensed data of land cover, fires, precipitation, and aerosols from the MODIS, TRMM, and MISR satellites and the AERONET network over Southeast Asia is performed, leading to a set of robust relationships between land-use change and fire being found on inter-annual and intra-annual scales over Southeast Asia, reflecting the heavy amounts of anthropogenic influence over land-use change and fires in this region of the world. First, we find that fires occur annually, but with a considerable amount of variance in their onset, duration, and intensity from year to year, and from two separate regions within Southeast Asia. Second, we show that a simple regression model of the land-cover, fire, and precipitation data can be used to recreate a robust representation of the timing and magnitude of measured aerosol optical depth (AOD) from multiple measurements sources of this region using either 8-day (better for onset and duration) or monthly (better for magnitude) measurements, but not daily measurements. We find that the reconstructed AOD matches the timing and intensity from AERONET measurements to within 70 to 90% and the timing and intensity of MISR measurements to within 50 to 95 %. This is a unique finding in this part of the world since cloud-covered regions are large, yet the model is still robustly capable, including over regions where no fires are observed and hence no emissions would be expected to contribute to AOD. Third, we determine that while Southeast Asia is a source region of such intense smoke emissions, portions of it are also impacted by smoke transported from other regions. There are regions in northern Southeast Asia which have two annual AOD peaks, one during the local fire season and the other, smaller peak corresponding to a combination of some local smoke sources as well as transport of aerosols from fires in southern Southeast Asia and possibly even from anthropogenic sources in South Asia. Overall, this study highlights the importance of taking into account a simultaneous use of land-use, fire, and precipitation for understanding the impacts of fires on the atmospheric loading and distribution of aerosols in Southeast Asia over both space and time. Furthermore, it highlights that there are significant advantages of using 8-day and monthly average values (instead of daily data) in order to better quantify the magnitude and timing of Southeast Asia fires.

TI  - Economic Development and Forest Cover: Evidence from Satellite Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing deforestation is a pressing, global environmental issue with direct impacts on climate change, carbon emissions, and biodiversity. There is an intuitive link between economic development and overexploitation of natural resources including forests, but this relationship has proven difficult to establish empirically due to both inadequate data and convoluting geo-climactic factors. In this analysis, we use satellite data on forest cover along national borders in order to study the determinants of deforestation differences across countries. Controlling for trans-border geo-climactic differences, we find that income per capita is the most robust determinant of differences in cross-border forest cover. We show that the marginal effect of per capita income growth on forest cover is strongest at the earliest stages of economic development, and weakens in more advanced economies, presenting some of the strongest evidence to date for the existence of at least half of an environmental Kuznets curve for deforestation.

TI  - Retrieval of seasonal Rubisco-limited photosynthetic capacity at global FLUXNET sites from hyperspectral satellite remote sensing: Impact on carbon modelling
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Process-based ecophysiological models, which simulate carbon exchange at the land-surface, are powerful and indispensable tools for understanding how vegetation behaves under present and future climate. However, these models are necessarily complex, containing numerous biophysical parameters which are often poorly defined. The current study develops a novel retrieval of Rubisco-limited top-of-canopy photosynthetic capacity (i.e. maximum carboxylation rate, V-cmax(25,toc)), which is one of the most critical parameters in the calculation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP). The retrieval combines standard remote sensing satellite products of Leaf Area Index (LAI), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with a hyperspectral index of total canopy chlorophyll concentration from the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). Monthly values of V-cmax(25,toc) are determined over a 9 year period for 296 global FLUXNET sites (catalogue made available online) and 8 Plant Functional Types (PFTs). AFT averages agree favourably with compilations of field-based measurements. However, according to a Monte Carlo analysis, our method is still currently subject to large systematic uncertainties (25-30%), much of which arises from the empirical relationship between maximum electron transport and leaf chlorophyll content. For all 8 PFTs, except tropical broadleaf forest, V-cmax(25,toc) varies considerably across the season (generally a factor of 1.6). Similarly, variability between sites of the same PFT is significant (interquartile range is 40% of the median). This suggests an important additional role for satellites in the spatial and temporal parameterisation of carbon models. Inclusion of this temporal and spatial variability in a process-based ecophysiological model produces, respectively, an impact of 11% and 12% on simulated GPP. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimation of latent heat flux over savannah vegetation across the North Australian Tropical Transect from multiple sensors and global meteorological data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Latent heat flux (LE) and corresponding water loss in non-moisture-limited ecosystems are well correlated to radiation and temperature. By contrast, in savannahs and arid and semi-arid lands LE is mostly driven by available water and the vegetation exerts a strong control over the rate of transpiration. Therefore, LE models that use optical vegetation indices (VIs) to represent the vegetation component (transpiration as a function of surface conductance, G(s)) generally overestimate water fluxes in water limited ecosystems. In this study, we evaluated and compared optical and passive microwave index based retrievals of G(s) and LE derived using the Penman-Monteith (PM) formulation over the North Australian Tropical Transect (NATO. The methodology was evaluated at six eddy covariance (EC) sites from the OzFlux network. To parameterize the PM equation for retrievals of LE (PM-G(s)), a subset of G(s) values was derived from meteorological and EC flux observations and regressed against individual and combined satellite indices, from (1) MODIS AQUA: the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI); and from (2) AMSR-E passive microwave: frequency index (FI), polarization index (PI), vegetation optical depth (VOD) and soil moisture (SM) products. Similarly, we combined optical and passive microwave indices (multi-sensor model) to estimate weekly G(s) values, and evaluated their spatial and temporal synergies. The multi-sensor approach explained 40-80% of LE variance at some sites, with root mean square errors (RMSE) lower than 20 W/m(2) and demonstrated better performance to other satellite-based estimates of LE. The optical indices represented potential G(s) associated with the phenological status of the vegetation (e.g. leaf area index, chlorophyll content) at finer spatial resolution. The microwave indices provided information about water availability and moisture stress (e.g. water content in leaves and shallow soil depths, atmospheric demand) at a high temporal resolution, thereby providing a scaling factor for potential G(s). We applied the newly proposed G(s) model to estimate LE at regional scale using global meteorological data. Our derivation could be extended to continental scales providing equally robust estimates of LE in arid and semi-arid biomes. A more accurate estimation of G(s) and LE across different savannah classes will improve the analysis of water use efficiency under drought conditions, which is of importance to climate change studies of water, carbon and energy cycling.

TI  - Unconventional oil and gas development and risk of childhood leukemia: Assessing the evidence
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread distribution of unconventional oil and gas (UO&G) wells and other facilities in the United States potentially exposes millions of people to air and water pollutants, including known or suspected carcinogens. Childhood leukemia is a particular concern because of the disease severity, vulnerable population, and short disease latency. A comprehensive review of carcinogens and leukemogens associated with UO&G development is not available and could inform future exposure monitoring studies and human health assessments. The objective of this analysis was to assess the evidence of carcinogenicity of water contaminants and air pollutants related to UO&G development. We obtained a list of 1177 chemicals in hydraulic fracturing fluids and wastewater from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and constructed a list of 143 UO&G-related air pollutants through a review of scientific papers published through 2015 using PubMed and ProQuest databases. We assessed carcinogenicity and evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma of these chemicals using International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) monographs. The majority of compounds (>80%) were not evaluated by IARC and therefore could not be reviewed. Of the 111 potential water contaminants and 29 potential air pollutants evaluated by IARC (119 unique compounds), 49 water and 20 air pollutants were known, probable, or possible human carcinogens (55 unique compounds). A total of 17 water and 11 air pollutants (20 unique compounds) had evidence of increased risk for leukemia/lymphoma, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, cadmium, diesel exhaust, and several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Though information on the carcinogenicity of compounds associated with UO&G development was limited, our assessment identified 20 known or suspected carcinogens that could be measured in future studies to advance exposure and risk assessments of cancer-causing agents. Our findings support the need for investigation into the relationship between UO&G development and risk of cancer in general and childhood leukemia in particular. (C) 2016 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of landscape composition and pattern on land surface temperature: An urban heat island study in the megacities of Southeast Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its adverse impacts on urban ecological environment and the overall livability of cities, the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon has become a major research focus in various interrelated fields, including urban climatology, urban ecology, urban planning, and urban geography. This study sought to examine the relationship between land surface temperature (1ST) and the abundance and spatial pattern of impervious surface and green space in the metropolitan areas of Bangkok (Thailand), Jakarta (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines). Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data and various geospatial approaches, including urban-rural gradient, multiresolution grid-based, and spatial metrics based techniques, were used to facilitate the analysis. We found a significant strong correlation between mean LST and the density of impervious surface (positive) and green space (negative) along the urban-rural gradients of the three cities, depicting a typical UHI profile. The correlation of impervious surface density with mean 1ST tends to increase in larger grids, whereas the correlation of green space density with mean LST tends to increase in smaller grids, indicating a stronger influence of impervious surface and green space on the variability of LST in larger and smaller areas, respectively. The size, shape complexity, and aggregation of the patches of impervious surface and green space also had significant relationships with mean LST, though aggregation had the most consistent strong correlation. On average, the mean LST of impervious surface is about 3 degrees C higher than that of green space, highlighting the important role of green spaces in mitigating UHI effects, an important urban ecosystem service. We recommend that the density and spatial pattern of urban impervious surfaces and green spaces be considered in landscape and urban planning so that urban areas and cities can have healthier and more comfortable living urban environments.

Few studies, however, have focused on characterizing the entire mineral assemblage, even though it could aide our understanding of past environments. In this study we use both spaceborne and field (VNIR spectroscopy) analyses to study the mineralogy of various salt flats (salars) of the northern region of Chile as an analog for Martian evaporites. These data are then compared to laboratory based Raman and XRD analyses for a complete overview on mineral assemblages. Central (core) and marginal zones within the salars are easily distinguished on the Landsat 8 band color composites. These areas host different mineral assemblages that often result in different landscapes. The lower elevation Salar de Atacama, located in the Andean pre-depression, is characterized by a unique thick halite crust at its center, whereas various assemblages of calcium sulfates (gypsum, bassanite, anhydrite) and sodium sulfates (mirabilite, thenardite, blodite, glauberite), borates (ulexite, pinnoite), Al/Fe- clays and carbonates (calcite, aragonite) were found at its margin. Sulfates form the main crust of the Andean salars to the east, although various compositions are observed. These compositions appear controlled by the type of feeder brine (Ca, SO4 or mixed), a result of the local geology among other factors. Sulfate crusts were found to be generally thin (<5 cm) with a sharp transition to the underlying clay, silt, or sand-rich alluvial deposits. Coupled with morphologic analyses, VNIR spectroscopy provides a powerful tool to distinguish different salt crusts. XRD analysis allowed us to quantify the mineral assemblages and assess the limitations of VNIR techniques in the presence of hydrated sulfates, which tend to mask the signatures of other minerals such as clays, chlorides, and carbonates. We found that the Atacama's unique arid and volcanic environment, coupled with the transition recorded in some of the salars has a strong Mars analog potential. Characterizing the outcrop mineralogy at a variety of environments from alkaline, lake waters to more acidic salar brines may help in constraining geochemical environments on Mars.

TI  - Spectral evidence of early-stage spruce beetle infestation in Engelmann spruce
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby)) outbreaks cause widespread mortality of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii (Parry ex Engelm)) within the subalpine forests of the western United States. Early detection of infestations could allow forest managers to mitigate outbreaks or anticipate a response to tree mortality and the potential effects on ecosystem services of interest. However, the subtle changes in the foliage of infested spruce make early detection difficult. An experiment was conducted in southern Colorado to determine important wavelengths for detecting early-stage (i.e. recently infested) spruce beetle infestation in Engelmann spruce. Spectral reflectance from non-infested and recently infested spruce needles were obtained using the ASDi Field-Spec Pro spectroradiometer. After pre-processing, random forest analysis was used to identify hyperspectral bands and aggregations of hyperspectral bands corresponding to Landsat TM bands and vegetation indices that effectively discriminated between non-infested and infested trees. Results show that the shortwave infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum was a key area for detecting early stages of spruce beetle infestation, likely due to the effects of beetle infestation on water transport within Engelmann spruce. The strong discriminability of bands in the shortwave infrared region indicates a potential for this spectral region to be used to detect early stage spruce beetle infestation over larger areas using multispectral satellite imagery. In a preliminary trial, we found that a time series of reflectance in Landsat TM band 7 (shortwave infrared) was strongly correlated with the progression through time of a spruce beetle outbreak in southern Wyoming. These findings suggest that multispectral indicators of early-stage spruce beetle outbreak can be developed. These indicators are needed to better understand spatiotemporal dynamics of spruce beetle outbreaks, and can be used by forest managers to detect early stages of spruce beetle infestation and to potentially mitigate some spruce mortality.

TI  - Urban expansion brought stress to food security in China: Evidence from decreased cropland net primary productivity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland net primary productivity (CNPP) is a crucial indicator of grain productivity and food security. However, assessments of the impact of urban expansion on the CNPP in China have been inadequate owing to data limitations. In this paper, our objective was to assess the impact of urban expansion on the CNPP in China from 1992 to 2015 in a spatially explicit manner. We first obtained the CNPP before urban expansion between 1992 and 2015 in China using the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model. We then assessed the impact of urban expansion on the CNPP from 1992 to 2015 at multiple scales (the whole country, agricultural zones, and urban expansion hotspots) by combining the CNPP before urban expansion with the urban land coverage time series extracted from multi-source remotely sensed data. We found that the total loss of the CNPP due to urban expansion from 1992 to 2015 was 13.77 TgC, which accounts for 1.88% of the CNPP before urban expansion in China. This CNPP loss resulted in a 12.45-million-ton decrease in grain production in China, corresponding to a reduction in the mean annual grain self-sufficiency rate of 2%. Therefore, we concluded that rapid urban expansion from 1992 to 2015 caused stress to China's food security. We suggest that it is still vital for China to effectively protect cropland to improve the urbanization level to 60% by 2020. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Understanding local community's values, worldviews and perceptions in the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Biosphere Reserve, Scotland
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biosphere reserves have been studied around the world, but methods to elicit community's values, worldviews and perceptions are missing. A greater understanding of these can help avoid tension and improve successful management. This paper used a mixed-methods survey to elicit local community's environmental values, ecological world views and perceptions of the Galloway and Southern Ayrshire Biosphere Reserve (GSABR). Over three weeks, forty participants from three communities of the GSABR responded to a semi-structured mixed-methods survey. The survey revealed that residents of the GSABR greatly value wildlife and beauty of nature, and that the majority of the respondents showed concern for the environment from an ecocentric worldview. Results also revealed that the most influential tested socio-demographic characteristic affecting people's relationship to their environment is their professional affiliation. Tourism and recreation were seen as major benefits of the recent biosphere designation. Results did highlight contrasting benefits from the designation for different stakeholder groups, which could potentially lead to tensions and should be considered in the reserve management. Given the community's supportive world views and perceptions, greater participation in the biosphere's management in likely to be welcomed and should be used to avoid or mediate any conflicts. The mixed method survey developed for this study, proved successful in eliciting these themes in the GSABR. We recommend other biosphere reserves replicate this research, to gain better understanding of local communities and increase their support and participation in reserve management.

TI  - Surface albedo raise in the South American Chaco: Combined effects of deforestation and agricultural changes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation affects climate and the energy balance of the Earth not only through the release of greenhouse gases but also through shifts in the physical properties of the surface. These physical effects can be strongly dependent not only on the deforestation event but on the land use choices and management that follow it. Here we explored how the albedo and radiation balance of the dry subtropical Chaco forests of South America changed over the last decade in response to both deforestation and land use/management. For the whole region we analyzed changes in the mean annual albedo derived from MODIS imagery and their relation with the dominant land use trajectories for a 12-year period (2000-2012). In two focal areas we identified how specific land uses and management shifts affected the seasonality of surface albedo and green vegetation cover, quantifying their associated radiation budget changes and radiative forcing effects. Deforestation accounted for 83% of the regional albedo increase observed in Chaco, yet, land use and land management changes were also a main driver of albedo shifts, explaining the rest of the albedo rise occurred in the region. Albedo raises increased the mean annual outgoing shortwave energy flux at the top of the atmosphere producing a biophysical cooling effect which was strongly dependent on the land use choice and agricultural management, ranging from -8W m(-2) in silvopastoral systems to -17 W m(-2) under single annual cropping schemes. These values are equivalent to a reduction in atmospheric CO2 of 12-27 Mg C ha(-1), or 15-55% of the typical emissions that accompany deforestation in this region. Land use and management choices in the Chaco region produce strong divergences in the resulting albedo seasonality that should not be ignored in the assessment of their net climatic effects and the discussion of possible mitigation actions.

TI  - Spatial variability of <i>E</i>. <i>coli</i> in an urban salt-wedge estuary
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the spatial variability of a common faecal indicator organism, Escherichia coli, in an urban salt-wedge estuary in Melbourne, Australia. Data were collected through comprehensive depth profiling in the water column at four sites and included measurements of temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and E. coli concentrations. Vertical variability of E. coli was closely related to the salt-wedge dynamics; in the presence of a salt-wedge, there was a significant decrease in E. coli concentrations with depth. Transverse variability was low and was most likely dwarfed by the analytical uncertainties of E. coli measurements. Longitudinal variability was also low, potentially reflecting minimal die-off, settling, and additional inputs entering along the estuary. These results were supported by a simple mixing model that predicted E. coli concentrations based on salinity measurements. Additionally, an assessment of a sentinel monitoring station suggested routine monitoring locations may produce conservative estimates of E. coli concentrations in stratified estuaries.

TI  - Comparison of ground and satellite-based methods for estimating stand-level WAR in a boreal forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (fPAR, 400-700 nm) can be retrieved from satellite measurements and is used to estimate and monitor ecosystem productivity and vegetation phenology. Although fPAR depends primarily on the Leaf Area Index (LAI), it is also influenced by the incoming radiation field and thus varies diurnally and seasonally. The overall aim of this study was to compare different ground and satellite-based fPAR estimates. The field data consisted of nearly 1000 plots located in the southern boreal forest zone in Finland. For all plots, data on canopy transmittance and forest inventory variables were available. We compared two different approaches to estimate fPAR and studied which satellite-based vegetation indices are best correlated with the instantaneous ground reference fPAR. Finally, a canopy fPAR model was used to assess some underlying assumptions of the satellite-based fPAR products: the similarity between instantaneous (at the time of satellite overpass) and daily-integrated fPAR. Results showed that allometric estimates of LAI and Beer's law are not sufficient to estimate fPAR in a boreal forest, because canopy openness strongly influences the relationship between canopy LAI and fPAR. We found that vegetation indices calculated from Landsat were only moderately correlated (maximum R-2 = 0.34) with the ground-based fPAR. Our study showed that the absolute difference between fPAR at the moment of the satellite overpass and daily integrated fPAR exceeds the 0.05 fPAR-units limit set by Global Climate Observing Systems network in northern latitudes during the peak growing season. Thus, at high latitudes covered by boreal forests, the satellite-based fPAR systematically underestimates the daily integrated black sky WAR. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Global surface temperature change analysis based on MODIS data in recent twelve years
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global surface temperature change is one of the most important aspects in global climate change research. In this study, in order to overcome shortcomings of traditional observation methods in meteorology, a new method is proposed to calculate global mean surface temperature based on remote sensing data. We found that (1) the global mean surface temperature was close to 14.35 degrees C from 2001 to 2012, and the warmest and coldest surface temperatures of the global in the recent twelve years occurred in 2005 and 2008, respectively; (2) the warmest and coldest surface temperatures on the global land surface occurred in 2005 and 2001, respectively, and on the global ocean surface in 2010 and 2008, respectively; and (3) in recent twelve years, although most regions (especially the Southern Hemisphere) are warming, global warming is yet controversial because it is cooling in the central and eastern regions of Pacific Ocean, northern regions of the Atlantic Ocean, northern regions of China, Mongolia, southern regions of Russia, western regions of Canada and America, the eastern and northern regions of Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. The analysis of daily and seasonal temperature change indicates that the temperature change is mainly caused by the variation of orbit of celestial body. A big data model based on orbit position and gravitational-magmatic change of celestial body with the solar or the galactic system should be built and taken into account for climate and ecosystems change at a large spatial-temporal scale.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of drought in a typical plain region based on the soil moisture anomaly percentage index
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought strongly affects the agricultural economy, most severely in plain regions, with prosperous agricultural development, which suffer huge economic losses. An effective index is required to describe the process of drought initiation, development, and alleviation, and soil moisture is a vital variable with respect to agricultural drought as a comprehensive variable. In this study, Jiangsu province was selected as a typical plain region, the VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity) model was used to simulate soil moisture at a resolution of 0.125 degrees x 0.125 degrees, and the soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI) was established for drought identification and investigation of drought spatio-temporal characteristics between 1956 and 2011. The results show that the VIC model built in our study is feasible, and the simulated 3-layer daily soil moisture database can be used in drought studies as an alternative to measured soil moisture. The droughts in the northern part of the province are more severe than those in the southern part, and Xuzhou is the most frequently affected city. There are no strong trends of drought duration in 13 cities of Jiangsu province. Among the 13 cities, drought intensity decreases as drought duration increases for the same drought area, and drought intensity decreases with drought area for the same drought duration. The methods used here in our study to build the VIC model for plain regions that lack closed basin hydrologic data may be helpful for further studies of VIC, and the regional analysis of drought can provide a powerful reference for regional drought prevention and resistance in Jiangsu province.

TI  - Modelling the topsoil carbon stock of agricultural lands with the Stochastic Gradient Treeboost in a semi-arid Mediterranean region
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient modelling methods to assess soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks have a pivotal importance as inputs for global carbon cycle studies and decision-making processes. However, laboratory analyses of SOC field samples are costly and time consuming. Global-scale estimates of SOC were recently made according to categorical variables, including land use and soil texture. Remote sensing (RS) data can contribute to the better modelling of the spatial distribution of SOC stock at a regional scale. In the present study, we used Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT) to estimate the topsoil (0-30 cm) SOC stock of a Mediterranean semiarid area (Sicily, Italy, 25,286 km(2)). In particular, our study examined agricultural lands, which represent approximately 64% of the entire region. An extensive soil dataset (2202 samples, 1 profile/7.31 Km(2) on average) was acquired from the soil database of Sicily. The georeferenced field observations were intersected with remotely sensed environmental data and other spatial data, including climatic data from WORLDCLIM, land cover from CORINE, soil texture, topography and derived indices. Finally, the SGT was compared to published global estimates (GSOC) and data from the International Soil Reference and Information Centre (ISRIC) Soil Grids by comparing the pseudo-regressions of the SGT, GSOC and ISRIC with soil observations. The mean SOC stock across the entire region that was estimated by GSOC and ISRIC was 3.9% lower and 46.2% higher compared to the SGT. The SGT efficiently predicted SOC stocks that were <70 t ha(-1) (corresponding to the 90th percentile of the observed values). On average, the coefficient of variation of the SGT model was 3.6% when computed on the whole dataset and remained lower than 23% when computed on a distribution basis. The SGT mean absolute error was 14.84 t ha(-1), 18.4% and 363% lower than GSOC and ISRIC, respectively. The mean annual rainfall, soil texture, land use, mean annual temperature and Landsat 7 ETM+ panchromatic Band 8 were the most important predictors of SOC stock. Finally, SOC stocks were estimated for each land cover class. SGT predicted SOC stock better than GSOC and ISRIC for most data. This resulted in a percentage of data in the prediction confidence interval 50% compared to the observed values of 71.4%, 65.8%, and 50.7% for SGT, GSOC, and SGT, respectively. This consisted of a higher R-2 and a slope (13) that was closer to 1 for the pseudo-regression constructed with SGT compared to GSOC and ISRIC. In conclusion, the results of the present study showed that the integration of RS with climatic and soil texture spatial data could strongly improve SOC prediction in a semi-arid Mediterranean region. In addition, the panchromatic band of Landsat 7 ETM+ was more predictive compared to the conventionally used NDVI. This information is crucial to guiding decision-making processes, especially at a regional scale and/or in semi-arid Mediterranean areas. The model performance of the SGT could be further, improved by adopting predictors with greater spatial resolutions. The results of the present experiment yield valuable information, especially for assessing climate change or land use change scenarios for SOC stocks and their spatial distribution.

TI  - Clinical and Microbiological Characteristics of <i>Clostridium difficile</i> Infection Among Hospitalized Children in the Netherlands
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Little is known about pediatric Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) epidemiology. We describe the clinical and microbiological characteristics of CDI among hospitalized children in the Netherlands.Methods. Between May 2009 and May 2015, 26 hospitals registered characteristics of pediatric (aged 2-18 years) and adult (aged >= 18 years) CDI in a national sentinel surveillance study. Routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping and multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis (MLVA) of selected strains was performed. Pediatric and adult results were compared using proportion and 95% confidence interval (CI). Time trend of pediatric CDI was evaluated using a mixed-effect Poisson model.Results. Pediatric CDIs were reported in 17 of the 26 participating hospitals (n = 135; 3% of all CDIs); the monthly number was constant over time. The median age of pediatric cases was 10 years (interquartile range, 4.7-14.5 years). Fifty-five percent of the children had community onset and 31% had severe CDI. Compared with adults (n = 4,556), complication and mortality rates were lower. Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 265 (toxin A negative, B positive) was most prevalent in children (15%; 95% CI, 8.8%-24.0%) but rarely found in adults (1%; 95% CI, 0.9%-1.6%). This strain was rarely found in other countries, except for Belgium. MLVA showed genetic relatedness between three-fourths of pediatric and adult ribotype 265 strains, without a clear epidemiological link.Conclusions. Pediatric CDI in hospitals has remained stable over the last 6 years and resulted in fewer complications than for adult CDI. Further studies are needed to elucidate the source and epidemiology of PCR ribotype 265, primarily found in children.

TI  - Analysis and estimation of tallgrass prairie evapotranspiration in the central United States
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors controlling evapotranspiration (ET) of spatially distributed tallgrass prairie is crucial to accurately upscale ET and to predict the response of tallgrass prairie ecosystems to current and future climate. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and ground-based climate variables were integrated with eddy covariance tower based ET (ETEc) at six AmeriFlux tallgrass prairie sites in the central United States to determine major climatic factors that control ET over multiple timescales and to develop a simple and robust statistical model for predicting ET. Variability in ET was nearly identical across sites over a range of timescales, and it was most strongly driven by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at hourly-to-weekly timescales, by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) at weekly-to-monthly timescales, and by temperature at seasonal-tointerannual timescales at all sites. Thus, the climatic drivers of ET change over multiple timescales. The EVI tracked the seasonal variation of ETEc well at both individual sites (R-2 > 0.70) and across six sites (R-2 = 0.76). The inclusion of PAR further improved the ET-EVI relationship (R-2 = 0.86). Based on this result, we used ETEc, EVI, and PAR (MJ m(-2) d(-1)) data from four sites (15 site-years) to develop a statistical model (ET= 0.11 PAR+ 5.49 EVI 1.43, adj. R-2 = 0.86, P<0.0001) for predicting daily ET at 8-day intervals. This predictive model was evaluated against additional two years of ETEc data from one of the four model development sites and two independent sites. The predicted ET (ETEVI+PAR) captured the seasonal patterns and magnitudes of ETEC, and correlated well with ETEc, with R-2 of 0.87-0.96 and RMSE of 0.35-0.49 mm d(-1), and it was significantly improved compared to the standard MODIS ET product. This study demonstrated that tallgrass prairie ET can be accurately predicted using a multiple regression model that uses EVI and PAR which can be readily derived from remote sensing data.

TI  - Responses of net primary productivity to phenological dynamics in the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the response of vegetation Net Primary Productivity (NPP) to phenological dynamics is critical to study climate change effects on ecosystem dynamics in the high-latitude, so investigating responses of NPP to phenological dynamics is becoming an increasing important way to identify and predict global ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we intend to quantifying the temporal trends and spatial variations of vegetation phenology and NPP across the Tibetan Plateau by calibrating and analyzing time series of the MODIS-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during 2002-2012, and examining the mechanisms of vegetation NPP response to phenological dynamics over the plateau. Our results indicated that most of the plateau experienced a coninuous advancing trend in the beginning of vegetation growing season (BGS) and a delaying trend in the end of vegetation growing season (EGS), consequently a prolonged length of vegetation growing season (LGS). Accordingly, NPP also substantially increased in most parts of the plateau. Meanwhile, the spatial patterns of the BGS, EGS, LGS and NPP varied in accordcance with the heat and water gradient across the plateau. The response modes of the NPP to phenological shifs varied within different climatic regimes, and the spatiotemporal response patterns were primarily controlled by the local climatic and topographic conditions. Moreover, temperature and precipitation played different roles in diverse responses of NPP to phenological dynamics, implying a profound effect of climate on response mechanism of the NPP to phenological changes.

TI  - Two scales are better than one: Monitoring multiple-use northern temperate forests
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Managing forests for multiple, often conflicting values, coupled with the uncertainty of global environmental change, requires a more flexible approach to maintaining functioning ecosystems into the future. Adaptive management offers such flexibility, but is often hampered by a lack of targeted monitoring data collected in a consistent manner the evidence base. Moreover, effective management of expansive forest ecosystems requires data on both landscape scale processes, as well as finer-scale data on vegetation structure and composition. To address the challenges of adaptive management in forest ecosystems, we tested the ability of a small set of multi-scale indicators to inform management of Minnesota's Northern Great Lakes forest. Using remotely sensed and field data, we monitored changes in forest condition over a 20-year period in the 42,000 ha Manitou forest landscape in northeastern Minnesota. We used multi-temporal remote sensing data to assess landscape-scale changes in disturbance rates, patch size and age structure. With field data, we used a chronosequence method to assess management effects over time on finer scale characteristics such as canopy composition, tree regeneration, vertical structure and coarse woody debris. Combining remotely sensed and field data provided a more robust evidence base for decision-making than either approach could have provided alone. For example, examining remote-sensing data alone indicates that the rate of severe disturbance (timber harvest) peaked during the 20-year analysis period, and has declined in recent years. As disturbance rates declined, patch size and the proportion of forest in later successional stages all increased from year 2000 levels. These indicators of landscape structure showed positive shifts towards conservation objectives, but only tell part of the whole story. Field data elucidate a number of negative trends, including poor regeneration of key species (Picea glauca, Pinus strobus, Thuja occidentalis, Betula alleghaniensis), and simplified structure in young and mature growth stages. In addition, much of the mature forest transitioning into later-successional growth stages lacks the long-lived species and structural characteristics needed to develop late successional conditions. An evidence base compiled from data gathered at both the stand and landscape scale provides the flexibility on which sound adaptive management depends. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Microfluidic metamaterial sensor: Selective trapping and remote sensing of microparticles
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We experimentally demonstrate the integration of a microfluidic trap array on top of metamaterial resonators for size selective trapping and remote sensing of microparticles. A split-ring resonator (SRR) design supports strongly confined electric field in the capacitive split gap at the fundamental inductive-capacitive resonance mode. The tightly confined electric field in the SRR gap forms a hot-spot that has become an enabling platform for sensing applications. Here, we extend the concept of metamaterial sensing to "trapping and sensing"by fabricating trapezoidal shaped structures near the split gap that enables trapping of microparticles in the split-gap region of each SRR. The proposed microfluidic metamaterial sensor enables sensing of different refractive index microparticles in terms of change in the transmitted amplitude and resonance frequency of the fundamental resonance mode operating in the terahertz spectral region. The proposed approach exploits the advantages offered by microfluidics, metamaterials, and terahertz technologies to form an ideal platform for ultra-sensitive, label-free, remote, and non-destructive detection of micro-substances.

TI  - Quad-polarized synthetic aperture radar and multispectral data classification using classification and regression tree and support vector machine-based data fusion system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpretation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing is difficult because the geometry and spectral range of SAR are different from optical imagery. Consequently, SAR imaging can be a complementary data to multispectral (MS) optical remote sensing techniques because it does not depend on solar illumination and weather conditions. This study presents a multisensor fusion of SAR and MS data based on the use of classification and regression tree (CART) and support vector machine (SVM) through a decision fusion system. First, different feature extraction strategies were applied on SAR and MS data to produce more spectral and textural information. To overcome the redundancy and correlation between features, an intrinsic dimension estimation method based on noise-whitened Harsanyi, Farrand, and Chang determines the proper dimension of the features. Then, principal component analysis and independent component analysis were utilized on stacked feature space of two data. Afterward, SVM and CART classified each reduced feature space. Finally, a fusion strategy was utilized to fuse the classification results. To show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, single classification on each data was compared to the obtained results. A coregistered Radarsat-2 and WorldView-2 data set from San Francisco, USA, was available to examine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results show that combinations of SAR data with optical sensor based on the proposed methodology improve the classification results for most of the classes. The proposed fusion method provided approximately 93.24% and 95.44% for two different areas of the data. (C) 2017 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Cloud masking and removal in remote sensing image time series
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic cloud masking of Earth observation images is one of the first required steps in optical remote sensing data processing since the operational use and product generation from satellite image time series might be hampered by undetected clouds. The high temporal revisit of current and forthcoming missions and the scarcity of labeled data force us to cast cloud screening as an unsupervised change detection problem in the temporal domain. We introduce a cloud screening method based on detecting abrupt changes along the time dimension. The main assumption is that image time series follow smooth variations over land (background) and abrupt changes will be mainly due to the presence of clouds. The method estimates the background surface changes using the information in the time series. In particular, we propose linear and nonlinear least squares regression algorithms that minimize both the prediction and the estimation error simultaneously. Then, significant differences in the image of interest with respect to the estimated background are identified as clouds. The use of kernel methods allows the generalization of the algorithm to account for higher-order (nonlinear) feature relations. After the proposed cloud masking and cloud removal, cloud-free time series at high spatial resolution can be used to obtain a better monitoring of land cover dynamics and to generate more elaborated products. The method is tested in a dataset with 5-day revisit time series from SPOT-4 at high resolution and with Landsat-8 time series. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields more accurate cloud masks when confronted with state-of-the-art approaches typically used in operational settings. In addition, the algorithm has been implemented in the Google Earth Engine platform, which allows us to access the full Landsat-8 catalog and work in a parallel distributed platform to extend its applicability to a global planetary scale.

TI  - Dark-spot segmentation for oil spill detection based on multifeature fusion classification in single-pol synthetic aperture radar imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, oil spill surveillance with space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has received unprecedented attention and has been gradually developed into a common technique for maritime environment protection. A typical SAR-based oil spill detection process consists of three steps: (1) dark-spot segmentation, (2) feature extraction, and (3) oil spill and look-alike discrimination. As a preliminary task in the oil spill detection process chain, dark-spot segmentation is a critical and fundamental step prior to feature extraction and classification, since its output has a direct impact on the two subsequent stages. The balance between the detection probability and false alarm probability has a vital impact on the performance of the entire detection system. Unfortunately, this problem has not drawn as much attention as the other two stages. A specific effort has been placed on dark-spot segmentation in single-pol SAR imagery. A combination of fine designed features, including gray features, geometric features, and textural features, is proposed to characterize the oil spill and seawater for improving the performance of dark-spot segmentation. In the proposed process chain, a histogram stretching transform is incorporated before the gray feature extraction to enhance the contrast between possible oil spills and water. A simple but effective multiple-level thresholding algorithm is developed to conduct a binary classification before the geometric feature extraction to obtain more accurate area features. A local binary pattern code is computed and assigned as the textural feature for a pixel to characterize the physical difference between oil spills and water. The experimental result confirms that the proposed fine designed feature combination outperforms existing approaches in both aspects of overall segmentation accuracy and the capability to balance detection probability and false alarm probability. It is a promising alternative that can be incorporated into existing oil spill detection systems to further improve system performance.

TI  - Effects of land cover change on evapotranspiration in the Yellow River Delta analyzed with the SEBAL model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the associations between land cover changes and evapotranspiration (ET) in the Yellow River Delta during the last 30 years using Landsat imagery. The result showed that the Delta region experienced a distinct increase in area due to sea-land interaction and sediment deposition, accompanied by substantial change in land cover fractions. From 1986 to 2015, 35.48% of land cover changed, mainly due to a transformation into salterns and culture ponds from other land cover types. In general, land cover was converted from less developed into highly developed types. The monowindow algorithm for retrieval of land surface temperature (LST) and the SEBAL model were used to explore the effects of land cover changes on regional ET. The results indicated that the average relative error of daily ET was 9.46%, and there was a significant linear correlation (R-2 >= 0.959, p < 0.001) between ET and LST. Relationships existed between LST, ET, fractional vegetation cover, and other relevant vegetation indices, and there were positive and negative correlations between different threshold ranges. During the study period, the transformation of large areas of different land cover types into salterns and culture ponds led to an average increase of 1.43 mm in daily ET.

TI  - Early identification of cotton fields using mosaicked aerial multispectral imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early identification of cotton fields is important for advancing boll weevil eradication progress and reducing the risk of reinfestation. Remote sensing has long been used for crop identification, but limited work has been reported on early identification of cotton fields. The objective of this study is to evaluate aerial imagery for identifying cotton fields before cotton plants start to bloom. A two-camera imaging system was used to acquire red-green-blue and near-infrared images with 1-m pixel resolution along two flight lines over an 8 km x 12 km cropping area. The images were mosaicked using two approaches: manual georeferencing followed by position-based mosaicking in Erdas Imagine and content-based automatic mosaicking in Pix4DMapper. The mosaicked images were then classified into different crops and cover types using supervised classification techniques. Results showed that both types of mosaics were effective for cotton identification and that maximum likelihood classification produced the best overall accuracy of 90% for the position-based approach and 91% for the content-based approach. The methodologies presented in this study will be useful for boll weevil eradication program managers to quickly and efficiently identify cotton fields at relatively early growth stages using mosaicked aerial imagery.

The development of internet-based surveillance tools has brought an innovative approach to seasonal influenza surveillance by directly involving self-selected volunteers among the general population reporting their health status on a weekly basis throughout the flu season. In this paper, we explore how Influweb, an internet-based monitoring system for influenza surveillance, deployed in Italy since 2008 has performed during three years from 2012 to 2015 in comparison with data collected during the same period by the Italian sentinel doctors surveillance system.

TI  - Long-term MODIS observations of cyanobacterial dynamics in Lake Taihu: Responses to nutrient enrichment and meteorological factors
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed and validated an empirical model for estimating chlorophyll a concentrations (Chla) in Lake Taihu to generate a long-term Chla and algal bloom area time series from MODIS-Aqua observations for 2003 to 2013. Then, based on the long-term time series data, we quantified the responses of cyanobacterial dynamics to nutrient enrichment and climatic conditions. Chla showed substantial spatial and temporal variability. In addition, the annual mean cyanobacterial surface bloom area exhibited an increasing trend across the entire lake from 2003 to 2013, with the exception of 2006 and 2007. High air temperature and phosphorus levels in the spring can prompt cyanobacterial growth, and low wind speeds and low atmospheric pressure levels favor cyanobacterial surface bloom formation. The sensitivity of cyanobacterial dynamics to climatic conditions was found to vary by region. Our results indicate that temperature is the most important factor controlling Chla inter-annual variability followed by phosphorus and that air pressure is the most important factor controlling cyanobacterial surface bloom formation followed by wind speeds in Lake Taihu.

T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from RADARSAT-2 (RS2) in dual-polarization mode provide additional information for discriminating sea ice and open water compared to single-polarization data. We have developed an automatic algorithm based on dual-polarized RS2 SAR images to distinguish open water (rough and calm) and sea ice. Several technical issues inherent in RS2 data were solved in the pre-processing stage, including thermal noise reduction in HV polarization and correction of angular backscatter dependency in HH polarization. Texture features were explored and used in addition to supervised image classification based on the support vector machines (SVM) approach. The study was conducted in the ice-covered area between Greenland and Franz Josef Land. The algorithm has been trained using 24 RS2 scenes acquired in winter months in 2011 and 2012, and the results were validated against manually derived ice charts of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. The algorithm was applied on a total of 2705 RS2 scenes obtained from 2013 to 2015, and the validation results showed that the average classification accuracy was 91 +/- 4 %.

TI  - Detecting volcanic sulfur dioxide plumes in the Northern Hemisphere using the Brewer spectrophotometers, other networks, and satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the adequacy of the existing Brewer network to supplement other networks from the ground and space to detect SO2 plumes of volcanic origin. It was found that large volcanic eruptions of the last decade in the Northern Hemisphere have a positive columnar SO2 signal seen by the Brewer instruments located under the plume. It is shown that a few days after the eruption the Brewer instrument is capable of detecting significant columnar SO2 increases, exceeding on average 2DU relative to an unperturbed pre-volcanic 10-day baseline, with a mean close to 0 and sigma = 0.46, as calculated from the 32 Brewer stations under study. Intercomparisons with independent measurements from the ground and space as well as theoretical calculations corroborate the capability of the Brewer network to detect volcanic plumes. For instance, the comparison with OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and GOME-2 (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2) SO2 space-borne retrievals shows statistically significant agreement between the Brewer network data and the collocated satellite overpasses in the case of the Kasatochi eruption. Unfortunately, due to sparsity of satellite data, the significant positive departures seen in the Brewer and other ground networks following the Eyjafjallajokull, Bardarbunga and Nabro eruptions could not be statistically confirmed by the data from satellite overpasses. A model exercise from the MACC (Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate) project shows that the large increases in SO2 over Europe following the Bardarbunga eruption in Iceland were not caused by local pollution sources or ship emissions but were clearly linked to the volcanic eruption. Sulfur dioxide positive departures in Europe following Bardarbunga could be traced by other networks from the free troposphere down to the surface (AirBase (European air quality database) and EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network)). We propose that by combining Brewer data with that from other networks and satellites, a useful tool aided by trajectory analyses and modelling could be created which can also be used to forecast high SO2 values both at ground level and in air flight corridors following future eruptions.

AB  - Accuracy of prediction of pelvic lymph node status using sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and outcomes of SLNB-guided abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) were assessed. Patients with stage IB1 (Figure 2009) cervical cancer and with tumors > 2 cm were enrolled. Prior to fertility-sparing surgery 99mTc-labeled phytate was administered. SLNs were intraoperatively identified, excised, and assessed using fast-frozen sections. Systematic bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy was subsequently undertaken. The SLN detection rate was 91.8% (45/49 patients); 8.2%(4/49) had radical hysterectomies because of metastatic primary SLNs. All SLNs received routine immunopathological examination to detect micrometastasis. Sensitivity, accuracy, and false negative rates were 100%, 100%, and 0%, respectively. ART was successfully completed in 45 patients (median follow-up, 61 [ range, 4-149] months). Three of the 45 (6.7%) were lost to follow-up; two relapsed and one died of tumor progression. Overall 3-year survival and progression-free survival rates were 97.6% and 95.2%, respectively. Of the 19 patients who attempted to conceive after surgery, five achieved pregnancy, and one had a live birth in the third trimester. We concluded that SLNB using 99mTc-labeled phytate can accurately assess pelvic node status. SLNB-guided ART is safe and feasible in patients selected for fertility-sparing procedures.

TI  - Tree-grass phenology information improves light use efficiency modelling of gross primary productivity for an Australian tropical savanna
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coexistence of trees and grasses in savanna ecosystems results in marked phenological dynamics that vary spatially and temporally with climate. Australian savannas comprise a complex variety of life forms and phenologies, from evergreen trees to annual/perennial grasses, producing a boom-bust seasonal pattern of productivity that follows the wet-dry seasonal rainfall cycle. As the climate changes into the 21st century, modification to rainfall and temperature regimes in savannas is highly likely. There is a need to link phenology cycles of different species with productivity to understand how the tree-grass relationship may shift in response to climate change. This study investigated the relationship between productivity and phenology for trees and grasses in an Australian tropical savanna. Productivity, estimated from overstory (tree) and understory (grass) eddy covariance flux tower estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP), was compared against 2 years of repeat time-lapse digital photography (phenocams). We explored the phenology-productivity relationship at the ecosystem scale using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) vegetation indices and flux tower GPP. These data were obtained from the Howard Springs OzFlux/Fluxnet site (AU-How) in northern Australia. Two greenness indices were calculated from the phenocam images: the green chromatic coordinate (GCC) and excess green index (ExG). These indices captured the temporal dynamics of the understory (grass) and overstory (trees) phenology and were correlated well with tower GPP for understory (r(2) = 0.65 to 0.72) but less so for the overstory (r(2) = 0.14 to 0.23). The MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) correlated well with GPP at the ecosystem scale (r(2) = 0.70). Lastly, we used GCC and EVI to parameterise a light use efficiency (LUE) model and found it to improve the estimates of GPP for the overstory, understory and ecosystem. We conclude that phenology is an important parameter to consider in estimating GPP from LUE models in savannas and that phenocams can provide important insights into the phenological variability of trees and grasses.

TI  - Quantification of Local Warming Trend: A Remote Sensing-Based Approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the warming trends at local level is critical; and, the development of relevant adaptation and mitigation policies at those levels are quite challenging. Here, our overall goal was to generate local warming trend map at 1 km spatial resolution by using: (i) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based 8-day composite surface temperature data; (ii) weather station-based yearly average air temperature data; and (iii) air temperature normal (i.e., 30 year average) data over the Canadian province of Alberta during the period 1961-2010. Thus, we analysed the station-based air temperature data in generating relationships between air temperature normal and yearly average air temperature in order to facilitate the selection of year-specific MODIS-based surface temperature data. These MODIS data in conjunction with weather station-based air temperature normal data were then used to model local warming trends. We observed that almost 88% areas of the province experienced warming trends (i.e., up to 1.5 degrees C). The study concluded that remote sensing technology could be useful for delineating generic trends associated with local warming.

TI  - Suppression of 19S proteasome subunits marks emergence of an altered cell state in diverse cancers
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of proteasome inhibitors to target cancer's dependence on altered protein homeostasis has been greatly limited by intrinsic and acquired resistance. Analyzing data from thousands of cancer lines and tumors, we find that those with suppressed expression of one or more 19S proteasome subunits show intrinsic proteasome inhibitor resistance. Moreover, such proteasome subunit suppression is associated with poor outcome in myeloma patients, where proteasome inhibitors are a mainstay of treatment. Beyond conferring resistance to proteasome inhibitors, proteasome subunit suppression also serves as a sentinel of a more global remodeling of the transcriptome. This remodeling produces a distinct gene signature and new vulnerabilities to the proapoptotic drug, ABT-263. This frequent, naturally arising imbalance in 19S regulatory complex composition is achieved through a variety of mechanisms, including DNA methylation, and marks the emergence of a heritably altered and therapeutically relevant state in diverse cancers.

TI  - Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in the Netherlands from 2003/2004 through 2013/2014: The Importance of Circulating Influenza Virus Types and Subtypes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) varies over different influenza seasons and virus (sub) types/lineages. To assess the association between IVE and circulating influenza virus (sub) types/lineages, we estimated the overall and (sub) type specific IVE in the Netherlands. We conducted a test-negative case control study among subjects with influenza-like illness or acute respiratory tract infection consulting the Sentinel Practices over 11 influenza seasons (2003/2004 through 2013/2014) in the Netherlands. The adjusted IVE was estimated using generalized linear mixed modelling and multiple logistic regression. In seven seasons vaccine strains did not match the circulating viruses. Overall adjusted IVE was 40% (95% CI 18 to 56%) and 20% (95% CI -5 to 38%) when vaccine (partially) matched and mismatched the circulating viruses, respectively. When A(H3N2) was the predominant virus, IVE was 38% (95% CI 14 to 55%). IVE against infection with former seasonal A(H1N1) virus was 83% (95% CI 52 to 94%), and with B virus 67% (95% CI 55 to 76%). In conclusion IVE estimates were particularly low when vaccine mismatched the circulating viruses and A(H3N2) was the predominant influenza virus subtype. Tremendous effort is required to improve vaccine production procedure and to explore the factors that influence the IVE against A(H3N2) virus.

TI  - Sulfur dioxide retrievals from TROPOMI onboard Sentinel-5 Precursor: algorithm theoretical basis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S-5P) platform will measure ultraviolet earthshine radiances at high spectral and improved spatial resolution (pixel size of 7 km x 3.5 km at nadir) compared to its predecessors OMI and GOME-2. This paper presents the sulfur dioxide (SO2) vertical column retrieval algorithm implemented in the S-5P operational processor UPAS (Universal Processor for UV/VIS Atmospheric Spectrometers) and comprehensively describes its various retrieval steps. The spectral fitting is performed using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method including multiple fitting windows to cope with the large range of atmospheric SO2 columns encountered. It is followed by a slant column background correction scheme to reduce possible biases or across-track-dependent artifacts in the data. The SO2 vertical columns are obtained by applying air mass factors (AMFs) calculated for a set of representative a priori profiles and accounting for various parameters influencing the retrieval sensitivity to SO2. Finally, the algorithm includes an error analysis module which is fully described here. We also discuss verification results (as part of the algorithm development) and future validation needs of the TROPOMI SO2 algorithm.

TI  - Vegetation Changes in the Permafrost Regions of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau from 1982-2012: Different Responses Related to Geographical Locations and Vegetation Types in High-Altitude Areas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) contains the largest permafrost area in a high-altitude region in the world, and the unique hydrothermal environments of the active layers in this region have an important impact on vegetation growth. Geographical locations present different climatic conditions, and in combination with the permafrost environments, these conditions comprehensively affect the local vegetation activity. Therefore, the responses of vegetation to climate change in the permafrost region of the QTP may be varied differently by geographical location and vegetation condition. In this study, using the latest Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) product based on turning points (TPs), which were calculated using a piecewise linear model, 9 areas within the permafrost region of the QTP were selected to investigate the effect of geographical location and vegetation type on vegetation growth from 1982 to 2012. The following 4 vegetation types were observed in the 9 selected study areas: alpine swamp meadow, alpine meadow, alpine steppe and alpine desert. The research results show that, in these study areas, TPs mainly appeared in 2000 and 2001, and almost 55.1% and 35.0% of the TPs were located in 2000 and 2001. The global standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and 7 meteorological variables were selected to analyze their correlations with NDVI. We found that the main correlative variables to vegetation productivity in study areas from 1982 to 2012 were precipitation, surface downward long-wave radiation and temperature. Furthermore, NDVI changes exhibited by different vegetation types within the same study area followed similar trends. The results show that regional effects rather than vegetation type had a larger impact on changes in vegetation growth in the permafrost regions of the QTP, indicating that climatic factors had a larger impact in the permafrost regions than the environmental factors (including permafrost) related to the underlying surface conditions.

TI  - Detection of West Nile virus in six mosquito species in synchrony with seroconversion among sentinel chickens in India
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic flavivirus maintained in mosquito-bird transmission cycle. Although humans are accidental hosts, fatal outcomes following WNV infection have been reported from India. Studies have identified WNV as an important etiological agent causing acute encephalitis syndrome in Assam, Northeast India. While circulation of WNV is evident, the role of vectors and avian hosts involved in the transmission remains unclear. In this study we identified local mosquito species for evidence of WNV infection along with seroconversion among sentinel chickens.Methods: Mosquitoes were collected and pooled species wise from June 2014 through December 2015. Virus was screened using reverse transcriptase PCR followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Sentinel chicken blood was screened for WNV antibody to assess their role in WNV transmission.Results: A total of 52,882 mosquitoes belonging to 16 species were collected. WNV was detected in 18 pools of Culex vishnui, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex whitmorei, Culex pseudovishnui and Mansonia uniformis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all mosquito derived sequences belonged to Lineage 5 and were 99-100% similar to the Assam strain of WNV isolated from human CSF sample in 2007. All sentinel chickens had seroconverted by the month of July that happens to be the peak WNV transmission month among humans as well.Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of WNV identification from field-collected Cx. pseudovishnui and Mansonia uniformis in India. Our study demonstrates potential vectors which may play a crucial role in WNV transmission and should be considered in the vector control strategies. Additionally, our study highlights the role of sentinel chickens for WNV surveillance.

TI  - Impact of dam failure-induced flood on road network using combined remote sensing and geospatial approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) to the delineation of dam failure-induced floods is demonstrated for the case of the Sparmos dam (Larissa, Central Greece). The approach followed was based on the differentiation of NDWI maps to accurately define the extent of the inundated area over different time spans using multimission Earth observation optical data. Besides using Landsat data, for which the index was initially designed, higher spatial resolution data from Sentinel-2 mission were also successfully exploited. A geospatial analysis approach was then introduced to rapidly identify potentially affected segments of the road network. This allowed for further correlation to actual damages in the following damage assessment and remediation activities. The proposed combination of geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques can be easily implemented by local authorities and civil protection agencies for mapping and monitoring flood events.

TI  - Mapping asphalt pavement aging and condition using multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis in Beijing, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asphalt road reflectance spectra change as pavement ages. This provides the possibility for remote sensing to be used to monitor a change in asphalt pavement conditions. However, the relatively narrow geometry of roads and the relatively coarse spatial resolution of remotely sensed imagery result in mixtures between pavement and adjacent landcovers (e.g., vegetation, buildings, and soil), increasing uncertainties in spectral analysis. To overcome this problem, multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) was used to map the asphalt pavement condition using Worldview-2 satellite imagery in this study. Based on extensive field investigation and in situ measurements, aged asphalt pavements were categorized into four stagespreliminarily aged, moderately aged, heavily aged, and distressed. The spectral characteristics in the first three stages were further analyzed, and a MESMA unmixing analysis was conducted to map these three kinds of pavement conditions from the Worldview-2 image. The results showed that the road pavement conditions could be detected well and mapped with an overall accuracy of 81.71% and Kappa coefficient of 0.77. Finally, a quantitative assessment of the pavement conditions for each road segment in this study area was conducted to inform road maintenance management. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Variational assimilation of land surface temperature within the ORCHIDEE Land Surface Model Version 1.2.6
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The SECHIBA module of the ORCHIDEE land surface model describes the exchanges of water and energy between the surface and the atmosphere. In the present paper, the adjoint semi-generator software called YAO was used as a framework to implement a 4D-VAR assimilation scheme of observations in SECHIBA. The objective was to deliver the adjoint model of SECHIBA (SECHIBA-YAO) obtained with YAO to provide an opportunity for scientists and end users to perform their own assimilation. SECHIBA-YAO allows the control of the 11 most influential internal parameters of the soil water content, by observing the land surface temperature or remote sensing data such as the brightness temperature. The paper presents the fundamental principles of the 4D-VAR assimilation, the semi-generator software YAO and a large number of experiments showing the accuracy of the adjoint code in different conditions (sites, PFTs, seasons). In addition, a distributed version is available in the case for which only the land surface temperature is observed.

TI  - Interferons Induce Expression of SAMHD1 in Monocytes through Down-regulation of miR-181a and miR-30a
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - SAMHD1 is a phosphohydrolase maintaining cellular dNTP homeostasis but also acts as a critical regulator in innate immune responses due to its antiviral activity and association with autoimmune disease, leading to aberrant activation of interferon. SAMHD1 expression is differentially regulated by interferon in certain primary cells, but the underlying mechanism is not understood. Here, we report a detailed characterization of the promotor region, the 5' - and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of SAMHD1, and the mechanism responsible for the cell type-dependent up-regulation of SAMHD1 protein by interferon. We demonstrate that induction of SAMHD1 by type I and II interferons depends on 3'-UTR post-transcriptional regulation, whereas the promoter drives basal expression levels. We reveal novel functional target sites for the microRNAs miR-181a, miR30a, and miR-155 in the SAMHD1 3'-UTR. Furthermore, we demonstrate that down-regulation of endogenous miR-181a and miR-30a levels inversely correlates with SAMHD1 protein up-regulation upon type I and II interferon stimulation in primary human monocytes. These miRNAs are not modulated by interferon in macrophages or dendritic cells, and consequently protein levels of SAMHD1 remain unchanged. These results suggest that SAMHD1 is a non-classical interferon-stimulated gene regulated through cell type-dependent down-regulation of miR-181a and miR-30a in innate sentinel cells.

TI  - Profiling aerosol optical, microphysical and hygroscopic properties in ambient conditions by combining in situ and remote sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the In situ/Remote sensing aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (IRRA) that combines airborne in situ and lidar remote sensing data to retrieve vertical profiles of ambient aerosol optical, microphysical and hygroscopic properties, employing the ISORROPIA II model for acquiring the particle hygroscopic growth. Here we apply the algorithm on data collected from the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) BAe-146 research aircraft during the ACEMED campaign in the Eastern Mediterranean. Vertical profiles of aerosol microphysical properties have been derived successfully for an aged smoke plume near the city of Thessaloniki with aerosol optical depth of similar to 0.4 at 532 nm, single scattering albedos of similar to 0.9-0.95 at 550 nm and typical lidar ratios for smoke of similar to 60-80 sr at 532 nm. IRRA retrieves highly hydrated particles above land, with 55 and 80% water volume content for ambient relative humidity of 80 and 90 %, respectively. The proposed methodology is highly advantageous for aerosol characterization in humid conditions and can find valuable applications in aerosol-cloud interaction schemes. Moreover, it can be used for the validation of active space-borne sensors, as is demonstrated here for the case of CALIPSO.

TI  - Molecular Evidence of Transmission of Influenza A/H1N1 2009 on a University Campus
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the recent years, the data on the molecular epidemiology of influenza viruses have expanded enormously because of the availability of cutting-edge sequencing technologies. However, much of the information is from the temperate regions with few studies from tropical regions such as South-east Asia. Despite the fact that influenza has been known to transmit rapidly within semi-closed communities, such as military camps and educational institutions, data are limited from these communities.ObjectivesTo determine the phylogeography of influenza viruses on a university campus, we examined the spatial distribution of influenza virus on the National University of Singapore (NUS) campus.MethodsConsenting students from the NUS who sought medical attention at the UHC provided two nasopharyngeal swabs and demographic data. PCR was used for detection of influenza viruses. 34 full-genomes of pH1N1/09 viruses were successfully sequenced by Sanger method and concatenated using Geneious R7. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using these 34 sequences and 1518 global sequences. Phylogeographic analysis was done using BaTS software and Association index and Fitch parsimony scores were determined.ResultsIntegrating whole genome sequencing data with epidemiological data, we found strong evidence of influenza transmission on campus as isolates from students residing on-campus were highly similar to each other (AI, P value = 0.009; PS, P value = 0.04). There was also evidence of multiple introductions from the community.ConclusionsSuch data are useful in formulating pandemic preparedness plans which can use these communities as sentinel sites for detection and monitoring of emerging respiratory viral infections.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the infectious status, gene type transition and epidemiological features of rotavirus A isolated from infants and children (<59 months-of-age) in sentinel hospitals from 2008 to 2015 in Henan province, China. Methods: In total, 2 541 stool samples (each 3- 5 ml) were collected from infants and children aged less than five years in two sentinel hospitals and group A rotavirus was detected by a double antibody sandwich ELISA. Viral RNA was extracted from positive samples and G/P gene typing was performed using a two-step nested multiplex RT-PCR. Epidemiological information (including demographic information such as age, sex and clinical symptoms) was also collected from the patients and analyzed. Results: Group A rotavirus was detected in 30.9% (785/2 541) of diarrhea samples from children. The detection rate was higher in October (54.8%, 345/629) and lower in July (5%, 5/101) each year from 2008 to 2015. The group A rotavirus infection rate was higher in boys (30.6%, 451/1 476) than in girls (31.4%, 334/1 065) (chi2=0.18, P=0.664). Infection mainly occurred in 4-12 months old patients (61.3%, 481/785) (chi2=196.69, P<0.001), and the infection rate was lower in cities (26%, 258/992) compared with rural areas (34.0%, 527/1 549) (chi2=18.19, P<0.001). G typing of 785 strains of group A rotavirus revealed the following types: G1 (13.5%, 106 strains), G2 (11.1%, 87 strains), G3 (29.7%, 233 strains), and G9 (57.5%, 451 strains); P typing revealed the predominance of P[4] (11.3%, 89 strains) and P[8] (84.7%, 665 strains); gene type combinations comprised mainly G9P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G1P[8], respectively accounted for 52.9% (415), 9.7% (76), 17.3% (136), 11.3% (89). Gene type combinations G1 [8] and G3P[8] have been decreasing in prevalence since 2008 and G9P[8] has become the dominant gene type of group A rotavirus in Henan province. Among the group A rotavirus infection samples, the male:female infection ratio was 1.4∶1 (451/334), with no significant difference in the infection rate (chi2=0.18, P=0.664); the infection rate was higher in 4- 12 months old patients (61.3%, 481/785), with a significant difference detected between age groups (chi2=196.69, P<0.001). The rate of detection was lower in cities (26.0%, 258/992) than in rural areas (34.0%, 527/1 549) (chi2=18.19, P<0.001). Clinical analysis revealed a body temperature of below 37 degrees in 75.7% of positive cases (594 patients), 37.0- 37.5 degrees in 17.2% of cases (135 patients), 37.6-38.0 degrees in 2.0% of cases (16 patients), and above 38 degrees in 5.1% of cases (40 patients), with most cases showing no fever or a mild fever. The frequency of episodes of diarrhea among the patients was 0- 3 times (21.1%, 166 cases), 4- 6 times (65.6%, 515 cases), 7- 9 times (8.0%, 63 cases), or 10- 15 times (5.2%, 41 cases), mainly showing mild and moderate diarrhea. Vomiting also varied in frequency among the patients from no vomiting (86.9%, 682 cases), 1-2 times (11.8%, 92 cases), 3 times (6.0%, 47 cases), and more than 3 times (0.4%, 3 cases). The occurrence of dehydration varied from no dehydration (86.9%, 682 cases), mild dehydration of 1%- 5% (12.1%, 95 cases), to severe dehydration of ≥5% (1.0%, 8 cases). Conclusion: A higher infection rate of group A rotavirus was detected in children younger than five years of age with acute diarrhea in sentinel hospitals in Henan province, including part-mixed infection cases. A predominance of cases was detected in the autumn, and secondly the spring of each year. Gene type G9P[8] was most frequently isolated. The majority of patients displayed no fever, vomiting or dehydration. The cases with clinical symptoms of fever, diarrhea, vomiting and dehydration often showed mild disease.

TI  - Effect of the revisit interval and temporal upscaling methods on the accuracy of remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimates
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatially distributed estimates of actual evapotranspiration (ET) derived from remotely sensed data are critical to a broad range of practical and operational applications. However, due to lengthy return intervals and cloud cover, data acquisition is not continuous over time, particularly for satellite sensors operating at medium (similar to 100 m) or finer resolutions. To fill the data gaps between clear-sky data acquisitions, interpolation methods that take advantage of the relationship between ET and other environmental properties that can be continuously monitored are often used. This study sought to evaluate the accuracy of this approach, which is commonly referred to as temporal upscaling, as a function of satellite revisit interval. Using data collected at 20 Ameri-flux sites distributed throughout the contiguous United States and representing four distinct land cover types (cropland, grassland, forest, and open-canopy) as a proxy for perfect retrievals on satellite overpass dates, this study assesses daily ET estimates derived using five different reference quantities (incident solar radiation, net radiation, available energy, reference ET, and equilibrium latent heat flux) and three different interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline, and Hermite spline). Not only did the analyses find that the temporal auto-correlation, i.e., persistence, of all of the reference quantities was short, it also found that those land cover types with the greatest ET exhibited the least persistence. This carries over to the error associated with both the various scaled quantities and flux estimates. In terms of both the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), the errors increased rapidly with increasing return interval following a logarithmic relationship. Again, those land cover types with the greatest ET showed the largest errors. Moreover, using a threshold of 20% relative error, this study indicates that a return interval of no more than 5 days is necessary for accurate daily ET estimates. It also found that the spline interpolation methods performed erratically for long return intervals and should be avoided.

TI  - Empirical fitting of forward backscattering models for multitemporal retrieval of soil moisture from radar data at L-band
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multitemporal algorithm, originally conceived for the C-band radar aboard the Sentinel-1 satellite, has been updated to retrieve soil moisture from L-band radar data, such as those provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission. This type of algorithm may deliver more accurate soil moisture maps that mitigate the effect of roughness and vegetation changes. Within the multitemporal inversion scheme based on the Bayesian maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion, a dense time series of radar measurements is integrated to invert a forward backscattering model. The model calibration and validation tasks have been accomplished using the data collected during the SMAP validation experiment 12 spanning several soil conditions (pasture, wheat, corn, and soybean). The data have been used to update the forward model for bare soil scattering at L-band and to tune a simple vegetation scattering model considering two different classes of vegetation: those producing mainly single scattering effects and those characterized by a significant multiple scattering involving terrain surface and vegetation elements interaction. The algorithm retrievals showed a root mean square difference (RMSD) around 5% over bare soil, soybean, and cornfields. As for wheat, a bias was observed; when removed, the RMSD went down from 7.7% to 5%. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Assessment of satellite-based chlorophyll-a retrieval algorithms for high solar zenith angle conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous empirical algorithms have been operationally used to retrieve global ocean chlorophyll-a (Chla) concentrations from ocean color satellite data, for example, the OC4V4 algorithm for sea-viewing wide field-of-view sensor and the OC3M algorithm for moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer. However, the algorithms have been established and validated based on in situ data mainly measured under low to moderate solar zenith angle (SZA) (<70 deg). Currently, with the development of geostationary satellite ocean color remote sensing, enabling observations from early morning to late afternoon, it has become necessary to know whether the empirical Chla algorithms can be applied to high SZA. The performances of seven widely used Chla algorithms (i.e., OC2, OC3M, OC3V, OC4V4, Clark, ocean-color index, and Yellow Sea Large Marine Ecosystem Ocean Color Work Group) under high SZAs were evaluated using the global in situ ocean color dataset (NASA bio-optical marine algorithm dataset). The results show that the performances of all seven algorithms decreased significantly under high SZAs compared with those under low to moderate SZAs. For instance, for the OC4V4 algorithm, the relative percent difference (RPD) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were 13.78% and 1.66 mu g/L for the whole dataset and 3.95% and 1.49 mu g/L for SZAs ranging from 30 deg to 40 deg, respectively. However, RPD and RMSE values increased to 30.45% and 6.10 mu g/L for SZAs larger than 70 deg. Adjusting the coefficients of the algorithms using the in situ dataset with high SZA can only slightly improve the performance. The bidirectional remote sensing reflectance can explain the underestimation of the retrieved Chla under high SZA, and the low sensitivity of the blue-green ratio is responsible for the relatively larger scatter between the retrieved and the in situ Chla under high SZA.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe the epidemiological pattern and genetic characteristics of 242 acute dengue infections imported to Europe by returning travellers from 2012 to 2014. The overall geographical pattern of imported dengue (South-east Asia > Americas > western Pacific region > Africa) remained stable compared with 1999 to 2010. We isolated the majority of dengue virus genotypes and epidemic lineages causing outbreaks and epidemics in Asia, America and Africa during the study period. Travellers acted as sentinels for four unusual dengue outbreaks (Madeira, 2012-13; Luanda, 2013; Dar es Salaam, 2014; Tokyo, 2014). We were able to characterise dengue viruses imported from regions where currently no virological surveillance data are available. Up to 36% of travellers infected with dengue while travelling returned during the acute phase of the infection (up to 7 days after symptom onset) or became symptomatic after returning to Europe, and 58% of the patients with acute dengue infection were viraemic when seeking medical care. Epidemiological and virological data from dengue-infected international travellers can add an important layer to global surveillance efforts. A considerable number of dengue-infected travellers are viraemic after arrival back home, which poses a risk for dengue introduction and autochthonous transmission in European regions where suitable mosquito vectors are prevalent.

TI  - Evaluating the representation of aerosol optical properties using an online coupled model over the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of atmospheric aerosol particles on the Earth's climate mainly depend on their optical, microphysical and chemical properties, which modify the Earth's radiative budget. The aerosol radiative effects can be divided into direct and semi-direct effects, produced by the aerosol-radiation interactions (ARIs), and indirect effects, produced by aerosol-cloud interactions (ACIs). In this sense the objective of this work is to assess whether the inclusion of aerosol radiative feedbacks in the online coupled WRF-Chem model improves the modelling outputs over the Iberian Peninsula (IP) and surrounding water areas. For this purpose, the methodology is based on the evaluation of modelled aerosol optical properties under different simulation scenarios. The evaluated data come from two WRF-Chem simulations for the IP differing in the inclusion/no-inclusion of ARIs and ACIs (RF/NRF simulations). The case studies cover two episodes with different aerosol types over the IP in 2010, namely a Saharan dust outbreak and a forest fire episode. The evaluation uses observational data from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) stations and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor, including aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE). Experimental data of aerosol vertical distribution from the EARLINET (European Aerosol Research Lidar Network) Granada station are used for checking the models. The results indicate that for the spatial distribution the bestrepresented variable is AOD and the largest improvements when including the aerosol radiative feedbacks are found for the vertical distribution. In the case of the dust outbreak, a slight improvement (worsening) is produced over the areas with medium (high/low) levels of AOD(-9%/+12% of improvement) when including the aerosol radiative feedbacks. For the wildfire episode, improvements of AOD representation (up to 11 %) over areas further away from emission sources are estimated, which compensates for the computational effort of including aerosol feedbacks in the simulations. No clear improvement is observed for the AE representation, the variability of which is largely underpredicted by both simulations.

TI  - The treatment of non-malarial febrile illness in Papua New Guinea: findings from cross sectional and longitudinal studies of health worker practice
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Papua New Guinea Department of Health recently shifted from a presumptive to a 'test and treat' malaria case management policy. This shift was supported by the widespread introduction of malaria rapid diagnostic tests in health facilities across the country. Health workers received training and job-aids detailing how to conduct and interpret a malaria rapid diagnostic test and how to treat test positive cases; however, little instruction on treating non-malaria febrile cases was provided. Accordingly, this study examined health worker case management of non-malarial febrile patients in the 12-month period immediately following the introduction of the revised malaria case management policy.Methods: Data were collected from a country-wide cross-sectional survey of febrile case management at randomly selected health facilities and from longitudinal surveillance at sentinel health facilities. Analysis was restricted to febrile patients who tested negative for malaria infection by rapid diagnostic test (N=303 and 5705 outpatients, respectively).Results and Discussion: 96.8% of non-malarial febrile patients received a diagnosis in the longitudinal sample, compared to 52.4% of the cross-sectional sample. Respiratory tract infections were the most commonly reported diagnoses. Over 90% of patients in both samples were prescribed one or more medications, most commonly an analgesic (71.3 & 72.9% of the longitudinal and cross-sectional samples, respectively), some form of antibiotic (72.7 & 73.4%, respectively) and/or an anthelminthic (17.9 & 16.5%, respectively). Prescribing behaviour was adherent with the recommendations in the standard treatment guidelines in fewer than 20% of cases (longitudinal sample only).Conclusion: Many non-malarial febrile patients are not provided with a diagnosis. When diagnoses are provided they are typically some form of respiratory tract infection. Antibiotics and analgesics are widely prescribed, although medications prescribed rarely adhere to the Papua New Guinea standard treatment guidelines. These findings indicate that Papua New Guinea health workers require support for non-malarial febrile illness case management.

TI  - Evaluations of dual attractant toxic sugar baits for surveillance and control of <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in Florida
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dual attractant toxic sugar baits (D-ATSB) containing two host kairomones, L-lactic (LA) and 1-octen3- ol (O), and fruit-based attractants were evaluated through olfactory, consumption and mortality, and semi-field experiments to determine if host kairomones could first, enhance attraction of a fruit-based (attractant) toxic sugar bait (ATSB), and second, increase the efficacy of a fruit based attractive toxic sugar bait (ATSB).Methods: Four combinations of LA and O were incorporated into the ATSB and evaluated in an olfactometer to determine if these combinations could enhance attraction of Aedes aegypti (L.) to the bait. Ae. albopictus (Skuse) and Ae. aegypti were used to determine bait consumption through excrement droplet counts and percent mortality, of the most attractive D-ATSB (1% LA and 1% O) from the olfactory study. Semi-field evaluations were conducted in screened portable field cages to determine if the D-ATSB applied to non-flowering plants controlled more mosquitoes than the fruit-based ATSB, and ASB. Mosquitoes were exposed to D-ATSB and the two controls for 48 h and collected with BGS traps. The catch rates of the BGS traps were compared to determine efficacy of the D-ATSB.Results: During olfactometer evaluations of D-ATSB, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were more attracted to 1% LA and 1% O compared to the fruit-based toxic sugar bait alone. Both species of mosquito consumed more fruit-based non-toxic bait (ASB) and ATSB than the D-ATSB. For both species, percent mortality bioassays indicated D-ATSB controlled mosquitoes, as compared to non-toxic control, but not more than the fruit based ATSB. Semi-field evaluations, BioGents sentinel traps at 48 h confirmed that ATSB (positive control) controlled Ae. albopictus, but there was no statistical difference between ASB (negative control) and the D-ATSB. No differences were observed between the mosquitoes caught in any of the experimental formulations for Ae. aegypti.Conclusions: L-lactic (1%) and 1-octen-3-ol (1%) added to a fruit-based sugar bait increased attraction of Ae. aegypti and may have future implications in mosquito trapping devices. The addition of the host kairomones did not enhance the consumption and efficacy of the ATSB in laboratory or semi-field evaluations for both mosquito species. We attribute to the absence of other host cues leading to lack of alighting onto bait surfaces to imbibe the toxic bait, as well as a possible decrease in palatability of the bait caused by the addition of the host kairomones.

TI  - Epigenome-wide association study of body mass index, and the adverse outcomes of adiposity
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 1.5 billion people worldwide are overweight or affected by obesity, and are at risk of developing type (2) diabetes, cardiovascular disease and related metabolic and inflammatory disturbances(1,2). Although the mechanisms linking adiposity to associated clinical conditions are poorly understood, recent studies suggest that adiposity may influence DNA methylation(3-6), a key regulator of gene expression and molecular phenotype(7). Here we use epigenome-wide association to show that body mass index (BMI; a key measure of adiposity) is associated with widespread changes in DNA methylation (187 genetic loci with P < 1 x 10(-7), range P = 9.2 x 10(-8) to 6.0 x 10(-46); n = 10,261 samples). Genetic association analyses demonstrate that the alterations in DNA methylation are predominantly the consequence of adiposity, rather than the cause. We find that methylation loci are enriched for functional genomic features in multiple tissues (P < 0.05), and show that sentinel methylation markers identify gene expression signatures at 38 loci (P < 9.0 x 10(-6), range P = 5.5 x 10(-6) to 6.1 x 10(-35), n = 1,785 samples). The methylation loci identify genes involved in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, substrate transport and inflammatory pathways. Finally, we show that the disturbances in DNA methylation predict future development of type 2 diabetes (relative risk per 1 standard deviation increase in methylation risk score: 2.3 (2.07-2.56); P = 1.1 x 10(-54)). Our results provide new insights into the biologic pathways influenced by adiposity, and may enable development of new strategies for prediction and prevention of type 2 diabetes and other adverse clinical consequences of obesity.

TI  - Feasibility Study of HIV Sentinel Surveillance using PMTCT data in Cameroon: from Scientific Success to Programmatic Failure
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In low-income countries (LICs), HIV sentinel surveillance surveys (HIV-SSS) are recommended in between two demographic and health surveys, due to low-cost than the latter. Using the classical unlinked anonymous testing (UAT), HIV-SSS among pregnant women raised certain ethical and financial challenges. We therefore aimed at evaluating how to use prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) routine data as an alternative approach for HIV-SSS in LICs.Methods: A survey conducted through 2012 among first antenatal-care attendees (ANC1) in the ten regions of Cameroon. HIV testing was performed at PMTCT clinics as-per the national serial algorithm (rapid test), and PMTCT site laboratory (PMTCT-SL) performances were evaluated by comparison with results of the national reference laboratory (NRL), determined as the reference standard.Results: Acceptance rate for HIV testing was 99%, for a total of 6521 ANC1 (49 +/- 3% aged 15-24) enrolled nationwide. Among 6103 eligible ANC1, sensitivity (using NRL testing as the reference standard) was 81.2%, ranging from 58.8% (South region) to 100% (West region); thus implying that 18.8% HIV-infected ANC1 declared HIV-negative at the PMTCT-SL were positive from NRL-results. Specificity was 99.3%, without significant disparity across sites. At population-level, this implies that every year in Cameroon, similar to 2,500 HIV-infected women are wrongly declared seronegative, while similar to 1,000 are wrongly declared seropositive. Only 44.4% (16/36) of evaluated laboratories reached the quality target of 80%.Conclusions: The study identified weaknesses in routine PMTCT HIV testing. As Cameroon transitions to using routine PMTCT data for HIV-SSS among pregnant women, there is need in optimizing quality system to ensure robust routine HIV testing for programmatic and surveillance purposes.

TI  - Earthquake rupture properties of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake foreshocks (<i>M</i><sub>j</sub> 6.5 and <i>M</i><sub>j</sub> 6.4) revealed by conventional and multiple-aperture InSAR
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - By applying conventional cross-track InSAR and multiple-aperture InSAR (MAI) techniques with ALOS-2 SAR data to foreshocks of the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, ground displacement fields in range (line-of-sight) and azimuth components have been successfully mapped. The most concentrated crustal deformation with ground displacement exceeding 15 cm is located on the western side of the Hinagu fault zone. A locally distributed displacement which appears along the strike of the Futagawa fault can be identified in and around Mashiki town, suggesting that a different local fault slip also contributed toward foreshocks. Inverting InSAR, MAI, and GNSS data, distributed slip models are obtained that show almost pure right-lateral fault motion on a plane dipping west by 80 degrees for the Hinagu fault and almost pure normal fault motion on a plane dipping south by 70 degrees for the local fault beneath Mashiki town. The slip on the Hinagu fault reaches around the junction of the Hinagu and Futagawa faults. The slip in the north significantly extends down to around 10 km depth, while in the south the slip is concentrated near the ground surface, perhaps corresponding to the M-j 6.5 and the M-j 6.4 events, respectively. The focal mechanism of the distributed slip model for the Hinagu fault alone shows pure right-lateral motion, which is inconsistent with the seismically estimated mechanism that includes a significant non-double couple component. On the other hand, when taking the contribution of normal fault motion into account, the focal mechanism appears similar to that of the seismic analysis. This result may suggest that local fault motion occurred just beneath Mashiki town, simultaneously with the M-j 6.5 event, thereby increasing the degree of damage to the town.

TI  - Toward the development of a novel non-RGD cyclic peptide drug conjugate for treatment of human metastatic melanoma
T2  - ONCOTARGET
M3  - Article
AB  - The newly discovered short (9 amino acid) non-RGD S-S bridged cyclic peptide ALOS-4 (H-cycl(Cys-Ser-Ser-Ala-Gly-Ser-Leu-Phe-Cys)-OH),which binds to integrin alpha(v)beta(3) is investigated as peptide carrier for targeted drug delivery against human metastatic melanoma. ALOS4 binds specifically the alpha(v)beta(3) overexpressing human metastatic melanoma WM-266-4 cell line both in vitro and in ex vivo assays. Coupling ALOS4 to the topoisomerase I inhibitor Camptothecin (ALOS4-CPT) increases the cytotoxicity of CPT against human metastatic melanoma cells while reduces dramatically the cytotoxicity against non-cancerous cells as measured by the levels of gH2A. X, active caspase 3 and cell viability. Moreover, conjugating ALOS4 to CPT even increases the chemo-stability of CPT under physiological pH. Bioinformatic analysis using Rosetta platform revealed potential docking sites of ALOS4 on the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin which are distinct from the RGD binding sites. We propose to use this specific non-RGD cyclic peptide as the therapeutic carrier for conjugation of drugs in order to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity of currently available treatments of human malignant melanoma.

TI  - Spaceborne PolInSAR tomography for vertical profile retrieval of forest vegetation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest height plays a crucial role in investigating the biophysical parameters of forests and the terrestrial carbon. PolInSAR- based inversion modeling has been successfully implemented on airborne and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. SAR tomography is a recent approach to separate scatterers in the cross- range direction and generate its vertical profile. This study highlights the potential of tomographic processing of multibaseline fully polarimetric Radarsat- 2 C- band SAR data to estimate radar reflectivity at different forest height levels. A teak patch of Haldwani forest in Uttarakhand state of India was chosen as the test site to perform tomography. Since SAR tomography is a spectral estimation problem, Fourier transform (FT), beamforming (BF), and Capon- based spectral estimators were applied on the dataset to obtain the backscattering power contributions at different forest height levels. Fourier showed high backscatter power retrieval at different forest heights. The radar reflectivities at different heights were significantly reduced by BF followed by Capon. Tomographic profile of FT severely suffered from high sidelobes, which was drastically reduced by implementing BF. Capon further reduced the sidelobes and achieved a substantially improved tomographic profile. The height maps were generated for these algorithms and validated with ground truth data.

TI  - LULC analysis of urban spaces using Markov chain predictive model at Ranchi in India
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Monitoring of land use and land cover (LULC) change is one important drivers of global change, which plays a decisive role on the management and sustainable developmental planning for urban spaces. The study aims to develop series of LULC maps of urban areas of Ranchi, India and was studied during the years 1989 and 2015. It predicts LULC changes using geospatial tools such as remote sensing and GIS. Various satellite imagery datasets such as Landsat TM, ETM? and Landsat 8 OLI of years 1989, 2002 and 2015 were used to analyze urban LULC, which was later used to predict for 2015 and 2028 using Markov transition matrix and was cross-validated with true LULC of 2015. The urban area growth was found 11% more than the predicted value. Slope map was also generated from digital elevation model and urban expansion in 2015 was 67% and with respect to roads it was 60% within 1 km road buffer in 2015 over 2002. Regression equation was developed over decadal population of 1961–2011 to estimate it for years 1989, 2002, 2015 and 2028. The population has increased 102% in 2015 over 1989. However, Markov predicted 43% more urban expansion for year 2028 over 2015. Coarse resolution temporal satellite data can be effectively harnessed to assess LULC change whereas prediction can be done with accuracy as high as 89.02% based on Markov transition matrix. An effective coordination between governments agencies are solicited to achieve sustainable development to be implemented systematically.

TI  - Impact of the Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program towards elimination of filariasis in Vanuatu, 1997-2006.
T2  - Tropical medicine and health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. The filarial worms affect the lymphatic system which leads to abnormal enlargement of body parts, chronic pain, disability, and social discrimination. In 1999, a commitment was made to eliminate LF from the Pacific Region by 2010. The Pacific Program to Eliminate LF began, with Vanuatu being one of the 16 endemic countries included in this program.METHODS: In 1997/1998 a LF prevalence baseline survey was conducted to determine the need for mass drug administration (MDA) in Vanuatu. In 1999, the Vanuatu Lymphatic Filariasis Control Program was established, and nationwide MDA was implemented from 2000 to 2004. LF prevalence was collected during the MDA through sentinel site and spot check surveys, and after 5years of MDA. MDA implementation methods included health worker training, social mobilization, and culturally appropriate health promotion strategies.RESULTS: LF prevalence at baseline was 4.79%; after MDA this declined to 0.16% in 2005/2006. Average MDA coverage ranged from 75.5-81.5% across 5years. All three evaluation units surveyed in 2005/2006 were below the 1% threshold required to stop MDA.CONCLUSIONS: The LF Control Program between 1997 and 2006 was successful in reducing LF prevalence to <1%. High MDA coverage was a critical component of this success. This period of the Vanuatu LF Control Program played an important role in helping to eliminate LF in Vanuatu.

T2  - Polish journal of radiology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKROUND: We aimed to evaluate initial PET/CT features of primary tumour and locoregional metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) in breast cancer and to look for potential relationships between several parameters from PET/CT.MATERIAL/METHODS: Twenty-three women (mean age; 48.66±12.23 years) with a diagnosis of primary invasive ductal carcinoma were included. They underwent PET/CT imaging for the initial tumour staging and had no evidence of distant metastates. Patients were divided into two groups. The LABC (locally advanced breast cancer) group included 17 patients with ipsilateral axillary lymph node (LN) metastases. The Non-LABC group consisted of six patients without LN metastases. PET/CT parameters including tumour size, axillary LN size, SUVmax of ipsilateral axillary LNs (SUVmax-LN), SUVmax of primary tumour (SUVmax-T) and NT ratios (SUVmax-LN/SUVmax-T) were compared between the groups. Correlations between the above-mentioned PET/CT parameters in the LABC group as well as the correlation between tumour size and SUVmax-T within each group were evaluated statistically.RESULTS: The mean values of the initial PET/CT parameters in the LABC group were significantly higher than those of the non-LABC group (p<0.05). The correlation between tumour size and SUVmax-T value within both LABC and non-LABC groups was statistically significant (p<0.05). In the LABC group, the correlations between the size and SUVmax-LN values of metastatic axillary LNs, between tumour size and metastatic axillary LN size, between SUVmax-T values and metastatic axillary LN size, between SUVmax-T and SUVmax-LN values, and between tumour size and SUVmax-LN values were all significant (p<0.05).CONCLUSIONS: We found significant correlations between PET/CT parameters of the primary tumour and those of metastatic axillary LNs. Patients with LN metastases had relatively larger primary tumours and higher SUVmax values.

TI  - Land Masking Methods of Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery for Ship Detection Considering Coastline Changes and Noise
T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing
T2  - 대한원격탐사학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - Since land pixels often generate false alarms in ship detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), land masking is a necessary step which can be processed by a land area map or water database. However, due to the continuous coastline changes caused by new port, bridge, etc., an updated data should be considered to mask either the land or the oceanic part of SAR. Furthermore, coastal concrete facilities make noise signals, mainly caused by side lobe effect. In this paper, we propose two methods. One is a semi-automatic water body data generation method that consists of terrain correction, thresholding, and median filter. Another is a dynamic land masking method based on water database. Based on water database, it uses a breadth-first search algorithm to find and mask noise signals from coastal concrete facilities. We verified our methods using Sentinel-1 SAR data. The result shows that proposed methods remove maximum 84.42% of false alarms.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the paper about NIR (Near-Infrared) remote sensing data and systematically summarized the research and application fields of NIR. To do this, we conducted a case study on the use of NIR in domestic journals, and SCI journals in the field of technology development for the last 5 years. After selection, a total of 281 journals were analyzed. For the statistical analysis, the classification was divided into subclasses and the dominant research trends were examined. As a result, the researchers who wrote the papers made the highest score of about 60% or more at university. In the field of application, 50% of land, 30% of environment, and 11% of disaster were distributed on SCI journals. In Korea, on the other hand, 55% of land, 24% of environment and 10% of disasters were distributed. In addition, 17% of the national land management and 8% of the geological / natural resources.Disaster observation using NIR was used for landslide, drought, weather disaster and flood. In particular, meteorological disasters are a result of study on Asian dust. However, there were no results of forest fire detection in Korea. Considering the domestic situation, it seems necessary to carry out additional and active research on this. It is expected that this statistical analysis data will be used as basic data to help expand the NIR technology development and utilization field in Korea in the future.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In this study, the oceanic Total Precipitable Water (TPW) retrieval algorithm at 16 km altitude of High Altitude Long Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (HALE UAV) is described. Empirical equation based on Wentz method (1995) that uses the 18.7 and 22.235 GHz channels is developed using the simulated brightness temperature and SeeBor training dataset. To do radiative simulation, Satellite Data Simulator Unit (SDSU) Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used. The data of 60% (523) and 40% (349) in the SeeBor training dataset are used to develop and validate the TPW retrieval algorithm, respectively. The range of coefficients for the TPW retrieval at the altitude of 3~18 km with 3 km interval were 153.69~199.87 (α), 54.330~58.468 (β), and 84.519~93.484 (γ). The bias and RMSE at each altitude were found to be about 0.81 kg m2 and 2.17 kg m2, respectively. Correlation coefficients were more than 0.9. Radiosonde observation has been generally operated over land. To validate the accuracy of the oceanic TPW retrieval algorithm, observation data from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) Gisang 1 research vessel about six clear sky cases representing spring, autumn, and summer season is used. Difference between retrieved and observed TPW at 16 km altitude were in the range of 0.53~1.87 kg m2, which is reasonable for most applications. Difference in TPW between retrieval and observation at each altitude (3~15 km) is also presented. Differences of TPW at altitudes more than 6 km were 0.3~1.9 kg m2. Retrieved TPW at 3 km altitude was smaller than upper level with a difference of 0.25~0.75 kg m2 compared to the observed TPW.

AB  - In this study, the empirical models were established to estimate the concentrations of surface-level PM2.5 over Seoul, Korea from 1 January 2012 to 31 December 2013. We used six different multiple linear regression models with aerosol optical thickness (AOT), Angstrom exponents (AE) data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard Terra and Aqua satellites, meteorological data, and planetary boundary layer depth (PBLD) data. The results showed that M6 was the best empirical model and AOT, AE, relative humidity (RH), wind speed, wind direction, PBLD, and air temperature data were used as input data. Statistical analysis showed that the result between the observed PM2.5 and the estimated PM2.5 concentrations using M6 model were correlations (R=0.62) and root square mean error (RMSE=10.70 μg m3). In addition, our study show that the relation strongly depends on the seasons due to seasonal observation characteristics of AOT, with a relatively better correlation in spring (R=0.66) and autumntime (R=0.75) than summer and wintertime (R was about 0.38 and 0.56). These results were due to cloud contamination of summertime and the influence of snow/ice surface of wintertime, compared with those of other seasons. Therefore, the empirical multiple linear regression model used in this study showed that the AOT data retrieved from the satellite was important a dominant variable and we will need to use additional weather variables to improve the results of PM2.5. Also, the result calculated for PM2.5 using empirical multi linear regression model will be useful as a method to enable monitoring of atmospheric environment from satellite and ground meteorological data.

AB  - We, for the first time, estimated daily and monthly surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2) volume mixing ratio (VMR) using three regression models with NO2 tropospheric vertical column density (OMI-Trop NO2 VCD) data obtained from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) in Seoul in South Korea at OMI overpass time (13:45 local time). First linear regression model (M1) is a linear regression equation between OMI-Trop NO2 VCD and in situ NO2 VMR, whereas second linear regression model (M2) incorporates boundary layer height (BLH), temperature, and pressure obtained from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and OMI-Trop NO2 VCD. Last models (M3M & M3D) are a multiple linear regression equations which include OMI-Trop NO2 VCD, BLH and various meteorological data. In this study, we determined three types of regression models for the training period between 2009 and 2011, and the performance of those regression models was evaluated via comparison with the surface NO2 VMR data obtained from in situ measurements (in situ NO2 VMR) in 2012. The monthly mean surface NO2 VMRs estimated by M3M showed good agreements with those of in situ measurements (avg. R = 0.77). In terms of the daily (13:45LT) NO2 estimation, the highest correlations were found between the daily surface NO2 VMRs estimated by M3D and in-situ NO2 VMRs (avg. R = 0.55). The estimated surface NO2 VMRs by three models tend to be underestimated. We also discussed the performance of these empirical models for surface NO2 VMR estimation with respect to other statistical data such as root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias, mean absolute error (MAE), and percent difference. This present study shows a possibility of estimating surface NO2 VMR using the satellite measurement.

TI  - Exploring geospatial changes of wetland in different hydrological paradigms using water presence frequency approach in Barind Tract of West Bengal
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - The Barind tract of West Bengal is composed with old alluvial soil, relatively undulating plain with good number of riparian wetlands. The main source of water of these wetlands is rain water and inundated water from river because most of the natural wetlands are located alongside the river. Under this condition any kind of river flow modification may influence the present wetlands condition.A good number of dam/reservoirs have been constructed on river Atreyee, Punarbhaba, Tangon etc. and it causes flow modification in those rivers in their downstream. The main objective of this paper is to find out the consequence of such river flow modification on areal extent of wetland, seasonal dynamics of wetland, temporal trend and their vulnerability. For doing this work Landsat image of premonsoon and post-monsoon season since 1988–2016 have been collected from USGS website. After that water presence frequency approach is used for wetland mapping and detecting change in pre and post dam regime. From the analysis it is found that in post dam condition both quantitative and qualitative degradation are being happened and their rate varies in different interfluves zones. It is also found that the degree of vulnerability has been increased in post dam condition. Considering the ecological values and their capability of livelihood support scientific delineation of wetland boundary according to their degree of vulnerability is essential.

TI  - Exploring 16 years changing dynamics for land use/land cover in Pearl City (Thoothukudi) with spatial technology
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Land use land cover (LU/LC) changes over the period are essential to understand the development of human activities within a region to define the impact of anthropogenic and natural activities. The virtual assessment of LU/LC changes between 2000 and 2016 is carried out in Pearl City (Thoothukudi) using Remote-Sensing data and GIS tool. This change detection is done by 15 m resolution cloud-free Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data captured during the year 2000 and 2016. The dynamic changes depict the major land use features like settlements, saltpan, crop land, vegetation, barren and water body from satellite data through supervised classifications of a maximum likelihood algorithm.The classified images highlight a series of constructive results in settlement (4.30%), vegetation (4.00%), saltpan (0.24%) and pessimistic results in barren land (-7.68%), crop land (-0.64%) and water body (-0.23%) respectively. The study recommends that urbanization of settlement land usage is highly mobilized in Thoothukudi coastal areas.

AB  - Gastric cancer is the second cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Metastases, including lymph nodes ones, heavily influence the prognosis of this disease. The pathological detection of positive lymph nodes is pivotal for an optimal prognostication and clinical management of affected individuals. Several factors influence the pathological investigation of surgical specimens, ultimately affecting the number of retrieved lymph nodes and, with it, the reliability of N staging. The pathologist plays a central role in optimizing this process. Factors influencing lymph node retrieval and analysis will be herein reviewed, together with the procedures adopted for an optimal pathological analysis of lymph nodes in gastric cancer.

AB  - The estuary in Nakdong River has changes by the construction of harbors, land reclamation and artificial waterway changes. These results lead to changes of extinction and creation of deltaic barrier island. The deltaic barrier island changes in the Nakdong River estuary affect the function of the barrier islands and cause environmental changes. Therefore, it is important to monitor the changes in the area of the Nakdong estuary.In this study, long-term changes of the area and suspended sediment of deltaic barrier island in the Nakdong River estuary were analyzed using Landsat TM/ETM+ images. As a result, end point rate (EPR) values of shoreline in Jinwoodo and Sinjado are about 5m/yr and about 50 m/yr, respectively. The EPR values of north-south and east-west direction in Doyodeung are 20 m/yr and -20 ~ 10 m/yr. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) has a maximum value of 25 g/m3 in the vicinity of Jinwoodo and Sinjado, while it has a maximum concentration of 40 g/m3 in the vicinity of Shinjido and Doyodeung. In other words, the area and the SSC change are small in Jinwoodo, and the area change and the SSC variation are large in Sinjado and Doyodeung. As a result of analysis of correlation between area change and SSC variation using all data, the Pearson coefficient value (r) is 0.36 and it is 0.32 in winter data. In other words, it is considered that the SSC variation affects the deltatic barrier island area change. However, verification using advanced altimetry data is necessary in the future. These studies can be used for coastal monitoring and environmental monitoring.

AB  - The aerosol optical thickness data retrieved by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) of Terra & Aqua and Meteorological Imager (MI) of Communication Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) are analyzed and compared with the measurement data of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) in Northeast Asia. As the result, the aerosol optical thickness retrieved by MODIS and MI were well agreed at ocean region but quite different at cloud edge and barren surface. The reason was that MODIS aerosol optical thickness was retrieved using the visible and infrared channels but MI was retrieved with the visible channel only. Consequentially, the thin cloud be misinterpreted as aerosol by MI and the difference between MODIS and MI aerosol optical thicknesses could be occurred with Normal Distribution Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface property. Therefore, the accuracies of clear/cloud region and surface reflectivity are required in order to improve the aerosol optical thickness algorithm by MI.

TI  - Do we need regional guidelines for breast cancer management in the MENA region? MENA Breast Cancer Guidelines project.
T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females worldwide in general and in the Middle East and the North African region (MENA region) in particular. Management of breast cancer in the MENA region faces a lot of challenges, which include younger age at presentation, aggressive behaviour, lack of national breast screening programmes and lack of reliable data registries as well as socioeconomic factors. These factors make applying the international guidelines for breast cancer management very challenging. The aim of this project is to explore the need for a regional breast cancer guideline as well as to screen the clinical practice of breast cancer management in the MENA region.METHODOLOGY: Three web-based designed surveys were sent to more than 600 oncologists in the MENA region from the period of August 2013 to October 2014. Full descriptive data and information regarding the application of international breast cancer guidelines were collected. The software was using the IP address to prevent duplication of collected data. Descriptive analysis and results were shown as numbers and percentages.RESULTS: During the period of the survey, 104 oncologists responded, representing around an 11% response rate. The majority of replies came from Egypt (59 responses (59%)), followed by Saudi Arabia (ten responses (9.6%)). Fifty-one per cent of responders had more than ten years of experience, and further 31.7% had 5-10 years of experience. Seventy-four per cent were working in governmental hospitals, which is our target sector. There was a major defect in having a genetic counsel unit (78.8% declared an absence of this service), presence of a national breast screening programme (55.8% declared an absence of this service), performing sentinel lymph node biopsy (43.3% declared an absence of this service). The need for regional guidelines for the management of breast cancer was agreed upon by 90.6% of responders.CONCLUSION: There is a clear need to improve the management of breast cancer in the MENA region. Creating a national breast screening programme and a reliable database is essential. A regional guideline is required to establish the best possible management of breast cancer according to the patients and disease specification as well as the regional socioeconomic factors and facilities available. There is also a need to improve clinical research that meets the region's needs.

M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ensuring the safe, effective management of patients requires efficient processes of care within a smoothly operating system in which highly reliable teams of talented, skilled health care providers are able to use the vast array of high-technology resources and intensive care techniques available. Simulation can play a unique role in exploring and improving the complex perioperative system by proactively identifying latent safety threats and mitigating their damage to ensure that all those who work in this critical health care environment can provide optimal levels of patient care.METHODS: A panel of five experts from a wide range of institutions was brought together to discuss the added value of simulation-based training for improving systems-based aspects of the perioperative service line. Panelists shared the way in which simulation was demonstrated at their institutions. The themes discussed by each panel member were delineated into four avenues through which simulation-based techniques have been used.RESULTS: Simulation-based techniques are being used in (1) testing new clinical workspaces and facilities before they open to identify potential latent conditions; (2) practicing how to identify the deteriorating patient and escalate care in an effective manner; (3) performing prospective root cause analyses to address system weaknesses leading to sentinel events; and (4) evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic health record in the perioperative setting.CONCLUSION: This focused review of simulation-based interventions to test and improve components of the perioperative microsystem, which includes literature that has emerged since the panel's presentation, highlights the broad-based utility of simulation-based technologies in health care.

AB  - In this paper, a new classification method based on the combination of semi-supervised learning with spatial similarity of adjacent pixels is presented for crop classification in inaccessible areas.Iterative classification based on semi-supervised learning is applied to extract reliable training data from both the initial classification result with a small number of training data, and classification results of adjacent pixels are also considered to extract new training pixels with less uncertainty. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed method, a case study of the classification of field crops was carried out using multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI acquired in the Daehongdan region, North Korea. From a case study, the misclassification of crops and forests, and isolated pixels in the initial classification result were greatly reduced by applying the proposed semi-supervised learning method. In addition, the combination of classification results of adjacent pixels for the extraction of new training data led to the great reduction of both misclassification results and isolated pixels, compared to the initial classification and traditional semisupervised learning results. Therefore, it is expected that the proposed method would be effectively applied to classify areas in which it is difficult to collect sufficient training data.

TI  - Assessing remotely sensed temperature humidity index as human comfort indicator relative to landuse landcover change in Abuja, Nigeria
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city has witnessed remarkable expansion, growth and developmental activities since its inception in 1976. This mass inrush and settlement of people often leads to the replacement of the natural land cover with urban infrastructural facilities resulting in microclimate change and worsening thermal environmental conditions. It is therefore pertinent to study the thermal environment of the city if Abuja will avoid the associated problems of growing and expanding city like many others in the world. Thus this study examines the use of remote sensing and geographic information system in mapping the temperature humidity index (THI) as human comfort indicator relative to land use land cover change in Abuja using Landsat Thematic Mapper, Enhanced Thematic Mapper ? and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor data of 1987, 1999, 2009 and 2014. This is to assess the changes that have taken place between these periods. Subsequently, an attempt was made at comparing differences in the THI between five different land cover classes: water body, built-up area, closed canopy vegetation, open vegetation and waste land. The results show that the declining trend of vegetation cover between 1987–1999, and 2009–2014 saw a rise in the region with THI[26 (discomfort) while the periods between 1999 and 2009 where there was a remarkable improvement in the vegetation cover saw an increase in region where comfortable condition is achieved. The discomfort index class category is the most dominant across most of the land cover classes except in the water body and closed canopy class categories. This order of dominance is the highest in wasteland and built-up areas land use/land cover categories.

AB  - The increase in the rate of industrialization due to urbanization has caused the Urban Heat Island phenomenon where the temperature of the city is higher than the surrounding area, and its intensity is increasing with climate change. Among the cities where heat island phenomenon occurs, Seoul city has different degree of urbanization, green area ratio, energy consumption, and population density in each administrative district, and as a result, the strength of heat island is also different. So It is necessary to analyze the difference of Urban Heat Island Intensity by administrative district and the cause. In this study, the UHI intensity of the administrative gu and the administrative dong were extracted from the Seoul metropolitan area and the differences among the administrative districts were examined. and linear regression analysis were conducted with The variables included in the three categories (weather condition, anthropogenic heat generation, and land use characteristics) to investigate the cause of the difference in heat UHI intensity in each administrative district. As a result of analysis, UHI Intensity was found to be different according to the characteristics of administrative gu, administrative dong, and surrounding environment. The difference in administrative dong was larger than gu unit, and the UHI Intensity of gu and the UHI Intensity distribution of dongs belonging to the gu were also different. Linear regression analysis showed that there was a difference in heat island development intensity according to the average wind speed, development degree, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Builtup Index (NDBI) value. Among them, the SAVI and NDBI showed a difference in value up to the dong unit and The creation of a wind route environment for the mitigation of the heat island phenomenon is necessary for the administrative dong unit level. Therefore, it is considered that projects for mitigating heat island phenomenon such as land cover improvement plan, wind route improvement plan, and green wall surface plan for development area need to consider administrative dongs belonging to the gu rather than just considering the difference of administrative gu units. The results of this study are expected to provide the directions for urban thermal environment design and policy development in the future by deriving the necessity of analysis unit and the factors to be considered for the administrative city unit to mitigate the urban heat island phenomenon.

TI  - Penile melanoma: a 20-Year analysis of six patients at the National Cancer Institute of Peru, Lima.
T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Melanoma of the urogenital tract is extremely rare, accounting for less than 0.1% of melanoma cases. The global literature currently describes only 220 cases of penile melanoma, most commonly located on the glans penis.RESULTS: Penile melanoma accounts for 0.7% of penile cancers and 0.18% of melanoma cases. The average patient age for the six cases we reviewed was 44.5 years. Three of these cases (50%) involved ulceration, one case (16.7%) involved lymphovascular invasion, and three cases (50%) involved mitosis ≥ 1 mm2 (0.38-4.7 mm). The average depth of invasion (Breslow) in the five cases that reported this measure was 2.1 mm (0.38-4.7 mm). Applying the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumour, node, metastases (AJCC TNM) staging system, one case was Tx (16.7%), two cases were T1 (33.3%), one case was T2 (16.7%), one case was T3 (16.7%), and one case was T4 (16.7%). Five cases (83.3%) involved wide local resection, and only one case involved partial penile amputation. Four cases (66.7%) involved primary bilateral inguinocrural lymphadenectomy, and only one of those four cases involved lymphatic metastatic disease. One case (16.7%) involved lymphatic recurrence at 12 months in a patient who survived 38 months. One case (16.7%) involved local recurrence at 13 months in a patient who has survived 53 months. Eighty per cent of these patients remain alive, with no evidence of disease after an average follow-up of 96.7 months.CONCLUSION: Penile melanoma prognosis depends on the initial clinical stage of the disease. The risk of lymphatic involvement seems to be related to the same risk factors used to assess cutaneous melanoma. Clinicians can thus assess penile melanoma using the AJCC staging system. The use of sentinel lymph node biopsy to determine staging is also becoming more common and could replace prophylactic bilateral inguinal dissection.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to analyze the long-term shoreline oscillations and its impact on coastal environment from a part of coastal zone of Sundarban delta over the last four decades. The present study was executed using four multi-temporal Landsat images during different dates.Automatic shoreline extraction model was developed in ERDAS Imagine software to identify the shorelines from satellite images. Digital shoreline analysis system was employed for estimation of shoreline change rate. Shoreline change analysis (erosion and accretion) study has been carried out by developing a model in ArcGIS model development tool. Transect wise shoreline change study revealed that about two third of the total transects exhibits erosion and about one third of the total transects exhibits accretion. The results of average shoreline change rate during different periods show the negative change. This study provides substantial information on the nature of shoreline changes which would assist in proper planning and management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The public health burden of hypertension is high, but its relationship with long-term residential air pollution, road traffic, and greenness remains unclear.OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations between residential air pollution, traffic, greenness, and hypertension among mothers.METHODS: Information on doctor-diagnosed maternal hypertension was collected at the 15-year follow-up of two large population-based multicenter German birth cohorts-GINIplus and LISAplus (n=3063). Residential air pollution was modelled by land use regression models within the ESCAPE and universal kriging within the APMoSPHERE projects. Road traffic was defined as traffic load on major roads within a 100-m buffer around residences. Vegetation level (ie, greenness) was defined as the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index in a 500-m buffer around residences and was assessed from Landsat 5 TM satellite images. All the exposure variables were averaged over three residential addresses during the last 10 years and categorized into tertiles or dichotomized. The individual associations between each of the exposure variables and hypertension were assessed using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: No significant and consistent associations across different levels of adjustment were observed between the exposures of interest and hypertension. The only significant estimate was found with coarse particulate matter concentrations (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.74; 3rdvs 1st tertile) among mothers residing in the Wesel area. No significant associations were observed with traffic load or greenness.CONCLUSION: This study does not provide evidence on detrimental effects of air pollution and road traffic or beneficial effects of greenness on hypertension among German adults.

AB  - Sea ice which is an important component of the global climate system is being actively detected by satellite because it have been distributed to polar and high-latitude region. and the sea ice detection method using satellite uses reflectance and temperature data. the sea ice detection method of Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is a technique utilizing Ice Surface Temperature (IST) have been utilized by many studies. In this study, we propose a simple and effective method of sea ice detection using the dynamic threshold technique with no IST calculation process. In order to specify the dynamic threshold, pixels with freezing point of MODIS IST of 273.0 K or less were extracted. For the extracted pixels, we analyzed the relationship between MODIS IST, MODIS 11 μm channel brightness temperature(T11 μm) and Brightness Temperature Difference (BTD: T11 μm-T12 μm). As a result of the analysis, the relationship between the three values showed a linear characteristic and the threshold value was designated by using this. In the case of sea ice detection, if T11 μm is below the specified threshold value, it is detected as sea ice on clear sky. And in order to estimate the performance of the proposed sea ice detection method, the accuracy was analyzed using MODIS Sea ice extent and then validation accuracy was higher than 99% in Producer Accuracy (PA).

AB  - Fine temporal and spatial resolution of image data are necessary to monitor the phenology of vegetation. However, there is no single sensor provides fine temporal and spatial resolution. For solve this limitation, researches on spatiotemporal data fusion methods are being conducted. Among them, FSDAF (Flexible spatiotemporal data fusion) can fuse each band in high accuracy. In this study, we applied MODIS NDVI and Landsat NDVI to enhance time resolution of NDVI based on FSDAF algorithm. Then we proposed the possibility of utilization in vegetation phenology monitoring. As a result of FSDAF method, the predicted NDVI from January to December well reflect the seasonal characteristics of broadleaf forest, evergreen forest and farmland. The RMSE values between predicted NDVI and actual NDVI (Landsat NDVI) of August and October were 0.049 and 0.085, and the correlation coefficients were 0.765 and 0.642 respectively. Spatiotemporal data fusion method is a pixel-based fusion technique that can be applied to various spatial resolution images, and expected to be applied to various vegetation-related studies.

AB  - Estuary sand bar of Namdaecheon Stream is located in Yangyang-gun, Gangwon-do in Korea. This unique place is situated between end of Namdaecheon Stream and East Sea. It is an important environment area of the global ecosystem from the transition zone of land and marine environments by forming a variety of coastal circumstance. Some endemic species should be protected which is appearing in the Namdaecheon Stream because of preservation for future generations. Especially, the salmon return to this stream as adults in order to breed which is more than 70 % of the salmon in Korea peninsular. The monitoring of estuary sand bar is need to analyze ecological environment and sustainable development with time. First of all we represents a different shape of estuary sand bar of Namdaecheon Stream from 1984 to 2015 using Landsat satellite imagery series. Particularly movement of the “tidal inlet” is most important factor to investigate the condition of the change for estuary sand bar. The location of tidal inlet is compared with precipitation, height of tide and oceanic current data according to time variation.

TI  - Impact of rapid urbanisation on land cover in Istanbul Province
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Since the industrial revolution, rapid urban sprawl has been one of the main characteristics of urbanised areas worldwide. The main objective of this study was to detect, quantify and characterise the changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in Istanbul Province between 2003 and 2015 using a hybrid geographic information systems (GIS)-remote sensing method. Landsat Thematic Mapper and operational land imager images were co-registered and classified using object-based image classification techniques and visual analysis. Land cover maps were rasterized at the same spatial resolution (30 m) in a GIS environment and the same legend was used for both land cover maps. Urbanised areas and other LULC types were determined for the years 2003 and 2015. The extent and spatial distribution of a number of LULC classes in Istanbul changed between 2003 and 2015. Settlement areas increased by 20,464.1 ha in only 12 years and 2529.89 ha of forested land was destroyed for construction of a new highway. Moreover, forests and agricultural areas became highly fragmented. This study confirms the accuracy of the hybrid GIS-remote sensing method. Moreover, the resulting data highlights the extent of the recent rapid land degradation in Istanbul and calls attention to the importance of protecting the natural ecosystems in this area.

AB  - The Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of Chile consists of many volcanoes, including the Mt.Villarrica and Mt.Llaima, and the two volcanoes are covered with snow at the top of Mountain. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the ice caps and the volcanic activity of the two volcanoes for 25 years by using the satellite image data are available in a time series. A total of 60 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM + data were used for the study from September 1986 to February 2011. Using NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) algorithm and SRTM DEM, snow cover and snowline were extracted. Finally, the snow cover area, lower-snowline, and upper-snowline, which are quantitative indicators of snow cover change, were directly or indirectly affected by volcanic activity, were extracted from the satellite images. The results show that the volcanic activity of Villarrica volcano is more than 55 % when the snow cover is less than 20 and the lower-snowline is 1,880 m in Llaima volcano. In addition, when the upper-snowline of the two volcanoes is below -170 m, it can be confirmed that the volcano is differentiated with a probability of about 90%. Therefore, the changes in volcanic snowfall are closely correlated with volcanic activity, and it is possible to indirectly deduce volcanic activity by monitoring the snow.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Errors in Coarse Scale Data on the Performance of Spatial Downscaling: An Experiment with Synthetic Satellite Precipitation Products
T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing
T2  - 대한원격탐사학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - The performance of spatial downscaling models depends on the quality of input coarse scale products. Thus, the impact of intrinsic errors contained in coarse scale satellite products on predictive performance should be properly assessed in parallel with the development of advanced downscaling models. Such an assessment is the main objective of this paper. Based on a synthetic satellite precipitation product at a coarse scale generated from rain gauge data, two synthetic precipitation products with different amounts of error were generated and used as inputs for spatial downscaling. Geographically weighted regression, which typically has very high explanatory power, was selected as the trend component estimation model, and area-to-point kriging was applied for residual correction in the spatial downscaling experiment. When errors in the coarse scale product were greater, the trend component estimates were much more susceptible to errors. But residual correction could reduce the impact of the erroneous trend component estimates, which improved the predictive performance. However, residual correction could not improve predictive performance significantly when substantial errors were contained in the input coarse scale data. Therefore, the development of advanced spatial downscaling models should be focused on correction of intrinsic errors in the coarse scale satellite product if a priori error information could be available, rather than on the application of advanced regression models with high explanatory power.

TI  - Laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer.
T2  - Translational gastroenterology and hepatology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Currently, the most accurate method for identifying lymph node metastasis is intraoperative diagnosis by sentinel node (SN) biopsy. Based on the SNNS study-a recent large-scale, nationwide, multicenter prospective study-the SN concept seems to be scientifically valid in patients with early gastric cancer. SN biopsy is a multistep technique consisted of six essential elements: indication, the selection of a tracer, a proper tracer injection method, the objective detection of SNs, a reliable biopsy technique, and the precise detection of nodal metastasis. For SN biopsy of gastric cancer, these elements have been validated as follows: the indication should be limited to clinical T1 less than 4 cm in diameter; combination mapping with radioactive colloid and blue dye is used as the standard; and endoscopic submucosal injection is the standard tracer injection. Detection of SNs and a reliable biopsy technique are enabled by adaptation of lymphatic basin dissection, a proper biopsy technique for gastric cancer. Lymphatic basin dissection is a selective lymphadenectomy procedure for dissecting basins en bloc, collecting lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels stained with dye. Lymphatic basin dissection is superior to the ordinary pick-up method, not only for minimizing the rate of missed SNs, but also in terms of oncological safety as it complements an intraoperative frozen section diagnosis by serving as a backup dissection. Moreover, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence mapping has been developed in recent years. ICG fluorescence mapping is superior because of its high sensitivity and signal stability. Moreover, it is feasible for both open and laparoscopic gastrectomy in treating early gastric cancer. SN biopsy has brought dramatic changes to laparoscopic surgery for early gastric cancer. With laparoscopic SN biopsy using ICG fluorescence navigation, laparoscopic surgery for early gastric cancer has changed from the uniform standard gastrectomy with D1+ into a tailor-made function-preserving surgical procedure, such as local resection with lymphatic basin dissection.

T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - India’s energy capitalSingrauli, has conglomeration of various thermal power plants and operational coal mines. Earlier, the area was densely forested, rich in biodiversity and home to various tribal communities. In the last decade, the area has been exploited by the private sector for setting up large scale power generation plants.The land use and its pattern and land surface temperature (LST) were studied for the Sasan Ultra Mega Thermal Power Plant covering an area of 10 km2 for 3 years2005, 2010 and 2015, respectively. Chronologically, the year 2005 is the phase of pre-establishment of the thermal power plant; the year 2010 specifies the construction phase and 2015 is the operational phase. Landsat ETM and Landsat 8 data of remote sensing system were used for this study. The land use/cover (LULC) study shows a significant decrease in the forest cover and barren rocky land, and a dramatic expansion in vegetation and wastelands. These changes in LULC have together widened the range of LST with an overall rise of 6.69  C and an overall decline in the NDVI value from the year 2005 to 2015. The results of Pearson’s correlation analysis depict an inverse co-relationship between LST and NDVI for the study area.Therefore, LST and NDVI are two important parameters to study the metropolitan ecosystem and can be used as an effective tool for evaluating environmental influence on ecosystems.

AB  - Several research cases using remote sensing methods to analyze changes of storage and dynamics of groundwater aquifer were reviewed in this paper. The status of groundwater storage, in an area with regional scale, could be qualitatively inferred from geological feature, surface water altimetry and topography, distribution of vegetation, and difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration.These qualitative indicators could be measured by geological lineament analysis, airborne magnetic survey, DEM analysis, LAI and NDVI calculation, and surface energy balance modeling. It is certain that GRACE and InSAR have received remarkable attentions as direct utilization from satellite data for quantification of groundwater storage and dynamics. GRACE, composed of twin satellites having acceleration sensors, could detect global or regional microgravity changes and transform them into mass changes of water on surface and inside of the Earth. Numerous studies in terms of groundwater storage using GRACE sensor data were performed with several merits such that (1) there is no requirement of sensor data, (2) auxiliary data for quantification of groundwater can be entirely obtained from another satellite sensors, and (3) algorithms for processing measured data have continuously progressed from designated data management center. The limitations of GRACE for groundwater storage measurement could be defined as follows: (1) In an area with small scale, mass change quantification of groundwater might be inaccurate due to detection limit of the acceleration sensor, and (2) the results would be overestimated in case of combination between sensor and field survey data. InSAR can quantify the dynamic characteristics of aquifer by measuring vertical micro displacement, using linear proportional relation between groundwater head and vertical surface movement. However, InSAR data might now constrain their application to arid or semi-arid area whose land cover appear to be simple, and are hard to apply to the area with the anticipation of loss of coherence with surface. Development of GRACE and InSAR sensor data preprocessing algorithms optimized to topography, geology, and natural conditions of Korea should be prioritized to regionally quantify the mass change and dynamics of the groundwater resources of Korea.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to review the background and purpose of the special issue on Theory of Environment Geospatial Information and Its Applications in Korean Journal of Remote Sensing.The significance of the paper was also discussed. Environmental information refers to environment related information (literature, statistics, images, etc.) in a comprehensive manner. Such environmental information as a local change or issue of the environment is defined as environmental spatial information by developing in a spatial form. Remote sensing data is very useful as direct or indirect data including environmental spatial information on wide-area and local environment. Various applications will be possible not only in the environmental field through several improvements. For this purpose, first, refining and scientificization of technology to build environmental spatial information could be performed. Second, the application field can be expanded by developing the concept and contents of existing environmental spatial information. The third method is continuous increase of the application of existing environmental spatial information. In this paper, the direction of development was examined that reflects recent changes of environmental spatial information such as conversion of data formats and integration with ICT (Information and Communications Technologies). In particular, the basic technology for the construction of environmental spatial information was reviewed through various papers. Through the studies related to the above, utilization of domestic environmental spatial information would be diversified. Also, the development of environment policy and efficient management of environmental factors could be possible.

AB  - The estimation of rice yield affects the income of farmers as well as the fields related to agriculture. Moreover, it has an important effect on the government’s policy making including the control of supply demand and the price estimation. Thus, it is necessary to build the crop yield estimation model and from the past, many studies utilizing empirical statistical models or artificial neural network algorithms have been conducted through climatic and satellite data. Presently, scientists have achieved successful results with deep learning algorithms in the field of pattern recognition, computer vision, speech recognition, etc. Among deep learning algorithms, the SSAE (Stacked Sparse AutoEncoder) algorithm has been confirmed to be applicable in the field of forecasting through time series data and in this study, SSAE was utilized to estimate the rice yield in South Korea. The climatic and satellite data were used as the input variables and different types of input data were constructed according to the period of rice growth in South Korea. As a result, the combination of the satellite data from May to September and the climatic data using the 16 day average value showed the best performance with showing average annual %RMSE (percent Root Mean Square Error) and region %RMSE of 7.43% and 7.16% that the applicability of the SSAE algorithm could be proved in the field of rice yield estimation.

AB  - The spatial distribution of mountain slope instability deals with the potential zones for landslides occurrences. In the present study, information value model was modified to make the modified information value model using RS & GIS to assess landslide susceptibility of the Lish river basin of Eastern Darjeeling Himalaya. Eleven important causative factors of slope instability like slope, aspect, curvature, lithology, geomorphology, soil, NDVI, drainage density, relative relief, LULC, elevation were considered and corresponding thematic data layers were generated in Arc GIS (10.1) environments. 87 very small to large various types landslide locations were identified with the help GPS through extensive field survey and incorporating Google earth image (2015). The entire thematic data layers were extracted from ASTER GDEM, Topographical maps (78 B/9; 1: 50,000), LANDSAT 8 OLI satellite image, Google earth image (2015) etc. All the thematic data layers were integrated on GIS environment to generate the landslide susceptibility map of the study area.The Lish river basin was classified into six landslide susceptibility zones i.e. very low, low, moderate, moderately high, high and very high considering the ranges of landslide susceptibility index. Finally, an accuracy assessment was done in Arc GIS by ground truth verification of 54 training sites having landslides from Google earth image (2015) for each landslide susceptibility class and compared with probability model which demonstrates the overall accuracy of the present study is 87.04% and Kappa coefficient is 84.41%.

T2  - Translational gastroenterology and hepatology
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - We developed the laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) technique, which combines endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and laparoscopic gastric resection to resect gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs). Many researchers have reported LECS to be a feasible technique for gastric submucosal tumor resection regardless of tumor location, including the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). Recently, the Japanese National Health Insurance system approved LECS for insurance coverage, and it is now widely applied for gastric submucosal tumor resection. Initially, we applied LECS to gastric SMTs without ulcerative lesions due to concern about the possibility of tumor cells seeding into the peritoneal cavity, in a procedure termed "classical LECS". To expand the indication of LECS for gastric epithelial neoplasms, modified LECS procedures such as inverted LECS, non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery (NEWS), combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with non-exposure technique (CLEAN-NET), and closed laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (closed-LECS) have been developed and applied to patients with gastric epithelial neoplasms. As a future perspective of LECS, we plan to combine the modified LECS procedure and sentinel node (SN) navigation surgery (SNNS) for clinical (c)Stage IA gastric cancer resection. This strategy could be a minimally invasive surgical technique for cStage IA early gastric cancer.

AB  - Green tides that developed along the coast of China in 2015 were detected and tracked using vegetation indices from GOCI and Landsat images. Green tides first appeared near the Jiangsu Province on May 14 before increasing in size and number and moving northward to the Shandong Peninsula in mid-June. Typhoon Cham-hom passed through the Yellow Sea on July 12, significantly decreasing the algal population. An algae patch moved east toward Korea and on June 18 and July 4, several masses were found between the southwestern shores of Korea and Jeju Island. The floating masses found in Korean waters were concentrated at the boundary of the open sea and the Jindo cold pool, a phenomenon also observed at the boundary of coastal and offshore waters in China. Sea surface temperatures, derived from NOAA SST data, were found to play a role in generation of the green tides.

AB  - Antarctica is important area in order to understand climate change. In addition, this area is complex region where indicate warming and cooling trend according to previous studies. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the long-term variability of Antarctic energy budget. Net radiation, one of energy budget factor, is affected by albedo, and albedo cause negative radiative forcing. It is necessary to analyze a relationship between albedo and net radiation in order to analyze relationship between two factors in Antarctic climate changes and ice-albedo feedback. In this study, we calculated net radiation using satellite data and performed an analysis of long-term variability of net radiation over Antarctica. In addition we analyzed correlation between albedo. As a results, net radiation indicates a negative value in land and positive value in ocean during study periods. As an annual changes, oceanic trend indicates an opposed to albedo. Time series pattern of net radiation is symmetrical with albedo. Correlation between the two factors indicate a negative correlation of -0.73 in the land and -0.32 in the ocean.

TI  - Bank erosion and accretion dynamics explored by GIS techniques in lower Ramganga river, Western Uttar Pradesh, India
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - The rivers of Indo-Ganga–Brahmaputra (IGB) plain are widely known for their dynamicity and hazard proneness. All of the large rivers that originated from Himalaya and flowing into the IGB plain (like Ganga, Ghagra, Ramganga, Rapti, Bagmati, Koshi, Teesta, Brahmaputra, etc.), shift their position vigorously and create massive kind of bank erosion. In the present study, we have selected 35.30 km alluvial reach of lower Ramganga river which is one of the major tributaries of the Ganga River. The study aims to quantify the amount and rate of bank erosion and accretion phenomena, also to find out the nature of bank erosion and accretion. In the present paper, we assessed the bank erosion and accretion of 91 years. We have taken 1923 toposheets, and Landsat images of 1972, 1981, 1993, 2003, and 2014 for the study.Demarcation of bank lines and estimation of bank erosion and accretion areas (for left and right bank separately) were done by using ArcGIS. Detailed field works were also done for investigating the nature of bank erosion and accretion as well as for bank line demarcation. The study reveals that in all of the evaluated periods, the river has experienced differential rates and amounts of bank erosion and accretion.The widening of channel, extension of meander bends along with lateral movements of the channel and chute cutoff are mainly responsible for bank erosion and accretion, while liquefaction and flowage of bank materials and shear failure were the principle mechanisms for that.

M3  - Multicenter Study
AB  - INTRODUCTION: HIV and syphilis during pregnancy remain a public health concern especially in developing countries. Pregnant women attending antenatal clinics sites for the first time between September and December 2011 and who accepted to participate in the study were enrolled. The objective was to estimate the syphilis and HIV infection rate in this population.METHODS: A study was conducted in 44 selected ANCs from 12 departments (5 urban and 7 rural). Pregnant women who accepted to participate in the study, attending selected sentinel ANCs sites for the first time between September and December 2011 were enrolled. To detect HIV antibodies, two consecutive ELISA assays were used (Genscreen Ultra HIV Ag/Ac, (BioRad, France) and Enzygnostic Intergral II (Siemens, GMBH, Marbug-Germany). In case of discordant results, the Western blot test II, HIV1 and 2 (Bio-Rad, Marne la Coquette, France) was used as the reference method. The RPR (Bio-Scan, Karnataka, India) test was performed to detect syphilis infection. The RPR positive results were confirmed using the TPHA test (Biotech, Cambridge, UK). Data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 software.RESULTS: A total of 2979 pregnant women attending ANCs were enrolled. The global HIV infection rate was estimated to be 3.6% (CI: 95%; 3.0-4.4). As expected, HIV prevalence was significantly higher in women aged above 25 years (4.4% (3.4-5.6), p = 0.026) and those attending urban ANCs (5.04%, p < 0.01). Also, women living in the urban area are more at risk to be infected (5.04 VS 2.38, p < 0.01). The RPR test was positive in 117 pregnant women (3.92%). The risk for syphilis occurrence was significantly higher among the single women compared to the married ones (4.4% VS 2.7%; p < 0.01). It was also estimated that the HIV and syphilis coinfection occurred in 22 cases (0.73%).CONCLUSION: The prevalence's of syphilis and HIV were relatively low. Marital status and sentinel site location were a risk factor associated with HIV and syphilis infections respectively. Therefore, substantial effort is needed to reinforce prevention strategies in this population to prevent mother-to-child and further horizontal transmissions of these infections.

M3  - Review
AB  - In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), several influenza epidemics are ignored because they are confused with other infectious diseases which have similar symptoms. Our study aims to assess influenza epidemics occurred in the DRC before 2008, year of the implementation of the influenza surveillance program in the DRC. We searched all the documents [articles, report,] about influenza epidemic or acute respiratory infections [ARI] in the DRC before 2008 by using chosen key words. Epidemic description elements were identified and analyzed in each report. 4 documents have been found that had no article published. The sites of the epidemic outbreak were the rural health zones in Koshibanda and Kahemba, Bandundu [1995 and 2007], in Bosobolo, Equator [2002] and in Kinshasa [2002-2003]. Attack and lethality rates were 3.9% and 16% in Koshibanda respectively; 0.1% and 2% in Kinshasa; 47.5% and 1.5% in Bosobolo and 14.6% and 2.9% in Kahemba. Children less than 5 years of age were the most affected. Their attack rates ranged between 22.6 and 57.7% and lethality rates ranged between 3.2 and 3.7%. The two epidemics in Bosobolo and Kinshasa were associated with H3N2 influenza virus. This literature review highlights a high morbidity and mortality due to rare influenza epidemics in the DRC.

TI  - Development of sentinel node biopsy, ROLL and IART in early breast cancer at the European Institute of Oncology, Milan (IEO).
T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - The problem of unnecessary axillary clearance in many patients with early breast cancer was certainly a major issue at IEO when we started working with Prof. Umberto Veronesi in 1994. At that time, axillary dissection in EBC was offered to all patients and this procedure was often hotly debated during our multidisciplinary breast cancer meetings. The question as to whether we could avoid axillary dissection by using PET scans or other nuclear medicine methods was frequently asked by Veronesi. This eventually prompted us to investigate whether, as for melanoma patients, the sentinel node biopsy (SNB) approach could reliably be applied to breast cancer. In December 1995, we proposed a new lymphoscintigraphy protocol to detect the SN in early breast cancer patients to our Ethic Committee, and it was approved. The pilot study was published in 1997 and after only 6 years, the first randomised trial comparing SNB and axillary clearance in breast cancer patients was published. During the pilot study, we optimised the lymphoscintigraphy technique by comparing different radiotracers and different injection modalities. Following the observation that the majority of the radiocolloids injected into the tumour did not migrate to lymph nodes, a new method called ROLL or Radio-guided Occult Lesion Localisation was developed for the localisation of non-palpable breast lesions. This technique was introduced into clinical practice at the European Institute of Oncology in 1996. Several studies showed that the ROLL procedure enabled the surgeon to remove non-palpable breast lesions easily and accurately, overcoming some disadvantages of other methods such as wire-guided localisation (WGL). In addition to SNB and ROLL, other protocols such as the IART (intraoperative avidination for radionuclide therapy)-ARTHE (avidinated radiotherapy) procedure were developed at the IEO Nuclear Medicine Division during the period 1994-2013. I remember that time as the most professionally productive of my career and it would not have been possible without the help, suggestions and encouragement given to me by Umberto Veronesi.

AB  - Columnar aerosol properties retrieved from solar radiation were investigated at the Yongin (YGN) SKYNET site over seven years from October 2008 to October 2015. Hourly averages were calculated when the data were available, and back trajectories were calculated to examine the effects of regional transport. Data recovery rate was low at 6.6%, primarily because solar radiation was measured only under daytime clear-sky conditions. Mean values of the fine-mode volume fraction (FMVF) as well as its seasonal variation were similar to those of PM2.5/PM10 although the coarse-mode fraction of column aerosols tended to be slightly larger. The values of single scattering albedo (SSA) and FMVF were lower in spring due to the effects of mineral dust, and higher in summer due to secondarily-formed inorganic ions. Back trajectories were grouped into five clusters according to the directions of transport paths. Aerosol loading was highest for Cluster 2 from the northwest, but SSA and FMVF were not particularly high or low because aerosols were composed of various materials with different properties. Aerosol loading was lowest for Cluster 5 from the Pacific Ocean passing through the south end of Japan, whose SSA and FMVF were highest as secondarily-formed inorganic ions were mixed.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study presents the method for deriving surface visibility from satellite retrieved AOD. To do this the height of aerosol distribution is required. This distribution would be in this study represented by the two heights; if there is a discrete atmospheric layer, which is physically separated from the above layer, the upper height of the layer is assumed as Aerosol Layer Height(ALH). In this case there is clear minimum in the Relative Humanity vertical distribution. Otherwise PBLH(Planetary Boundary Layer Height) is used. These heights are obtained from the forecast data of Regional Data Assimilation and Prediction System(RDAPS). The surface visibility is estimated from MODIS AOD and ALH/PBLH, using Koschmieder’s Law for ALH and the empirical relations for PBLH. The estimated visibility are evaluated from the visibility measurements of 9 eve-measurement stations and 17 PWD22 stations for the spring of 2015 and 2016. Verification of the estimated visibility shows that there are considerable differences in statistical verification value depending on stations, years, morning(Terra)/afternoon(Aqua). The better results are shown in the midwest part of korean peninsula for Terra of 2016. The results are summarized as; correlation coefficients of higher than 0.65, for low visibility RMSE of 3.62 km and ME of 2.29 km or less, POD of higher than 0.65 and FAR of 0.5 or less. Verification results were better with increase in the number of low-visibility data.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The permafrost active layer plays an important role in permafrost dynamics. Ecological patterns, processes, and water and ice contents in the active layer are spatially and temporally complex depending on landscape heterogeneity and local-scale variations in hydrological processes. Although there has been emerging interest in the application of optical remote sensing techniques to permafrost environments, optical sensors are significantly limited in accessing information on near surface geo-cryological conditions. The primary objective of this study was to investigate capability of L-band SAR data for monitoring spatio-temporal variability of permafrost ecosystems and underlying soil conditions. This study exploits information from different polarimetric SAR observables in relation to permafrost environmental conditions. Experimental results show that each polarimetric radar observable conveys different information on permafrost environments. In the case of the dual-pol mode, the radar observables consist of two backscattering powers and one correlation coefficient between polarimetric channels. Among them, the dual-pol scattering powers are highly sensitive to freeze/thaw transition and can discriminate grasslands or ponds in thermokarst area from other permafrost ecosystems. However, it is difficult to identify the ground conditions with dual-pol observables. Additional backscattering powers and correlation coefficients obtained from quad-pol mode help understanding seasonal variations of radar scattering and assessing geo-cryological information on soil layers. In particular, co-pol coherences at HV-basis and circular-basis were found to be very useful tools for mapping and monitoring near surface soil properties.

AB  - In this study, the dust/smoke detection algorithm was developed with a multi-spectral satellite remote sensing method using Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 1B (L1B) data and the results were validated as RGB composite images of red(R; band 1), green(G; band 4), blue(B; band 3) channels using MODIS L1B data and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) product. In the daytime on March 30, 2007 and April 27, 2012, the consistencies between the dust/smoke detected by this algorithm and verification data were approximately 56.4 %, 72.0 %, respectively. During the nighttime, the similar consistency was 40.5 % on April 27, 2012. Although these results were analyzed for limited cases due to the spatiotemporal matching for the MODIS and CALIPSO satellites, they could be used to utilize the aerosol detection of geostationary satellites for the next generations in Korea through further research.

T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Landsat operational land imager (OLI) data and consequent laboratory measurements were used to predict chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration and the trophic states for an inland lake within the East Kolkata Wetland, India (a Ramsar site). The most suitable band ratio was identified by performing Pearson correlation analysis between Chla concentrations and possible OLI band and band ratios from the study points. The results showed highest correlation coefficient from the band ratio OLI5/OLI4 with an R value of 0.85. The prediction model was then developed by applying regression analysis between the band ratio OLI5/OLI4 and Chl-a concentration of the study points.The reflectance ratios of the validation points were given as input on the prediction model and the model output was considered as predicted Chl-a values of the validation points to check the efficiency of the prediction model. The regression model between laboratory-derived Chl-a value and model-fitted Chl-a value of the validation points revealed a high correlation with an R2 value of 0.78.Trophic State Index (TSI) of the lake was also calculated from laboratory-derived Chl-a value and model-fitted Chla value of the validation points. The study presented a high correlation of TSI determined from predicted data with TSI from laboratory reference data (R = 0.88). The TSI values of the lake ranged from 65 to 75 which indicate that the lake is appeared to be eutrophic to hypereutrophic conditions. This empirical study showed that Landsat 8 OLI imagery can be effectively applied to estimate Chla levels and trophic states for inland lakes.

TI  - Morphometric assessment of Gomati river basin, middle Ganga plain, Uttar Pradesh, North India
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - The Gomati river is draining through the interfluves areas between Ganga and Ghaghra river, which is northern part of Indo-Gangetic foreland basin. The Gomati river basin passes through many stages of degradation and aggradations influenced by subsurface tectonic (neo) activities, base-level changes and climatic variability over time and space. The Gomati river basin covers an area of about 30,843 sq km in the middle Ganga plain. The quantitative approach of basin prioritization of the Gomati river and its four fifth-order sub-basin (SUB1–SUB4) was carried out by the morphometric parameters using LANDSAT and SRTM data. Drainage patterns are mainly in sub-dendritic to dendritic type which indicates that the Gomati river follows the natural gradient of the terrain. It is also observed that the low drainage density values of subbasins indicate that the basins have highly permeable subsoil and thick vegetative cover. The circularity ratio value reveals that the basin is strongly elongated. The asymmetric factor, transverse topography asymmetry and profile section analysis reflect the tilt and upliftment of Gomati basin, signifying the tectonic control on the Gomati basin especially towards the confluence part. This study would help to utilize the water resources and prioritization for sustainable development of the Gomati basin area.

TI  - Role of blue dye for sentinel lymph node detection in early endometrial cancer.
T2  - Gynecological surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel Lymphonode analysis has become a barely new and innovative way to treat early stages of endometrial cancer (Ballester et al., Lancet Oncol 469-476, 2011; Buda et al., Ann Surg Oncol 2975-81, 2016). Indocyanine green cervical injection is considered gold standard for mapping nodes' drainage. Blue dye is used as a valid alternative in many centers, due to the lower cost of execution. The objective of this video is to prove that methylene blue dye's cervical injection is a valid and "low-cost" method to obtain mapping of lymphatic drainage in patient with early endometrial cancer.METHODS: Fifty-four-year old women, with a recent diagnosis of endometrial cancer IA G2, we performed a radical Hysterectomy type A. We diluted in equal proportions the blue dye and saline and injected 1cl in depth and 1cl on the surface of the cervix, at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock. After 20min, it was shown with precision the lymphatic drainage until the first lymph node station from both sides.RESULTS: One external iliac lymph node and one obturator were resected on the left side and one external iliac on the right side. On histological analysis, none of the lymph nodes had any location of metastasis, neither micro-metastasis. Myometrial infiltration was 8/19mm.CONCLUSIONS: Blue dye cervical injection is a "low-cost", safe, and satisfactory procedure to point out Sentinel Lymph Node of uterus drainage. Other tracers, such as indocyanine green, are widely used in gynecological oncology, but with a higher cost of the product and the needing of a dedicated optical filter to be shown on human view.

TI  - Frozen section evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in breast carcinoma: a retrospective analysis.
T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the false-negative rate, sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy of the frozen section analysis of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in early-stage breast cancer compared to the definitive section and to identify the factors that could be associated with the appearance of false-negative cases. Secondarily, to evaluate the pathological results of cases submitted to completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for positive SLN.METHODS: We performed a five-year review of cases (2011-2015), including patients with early-stage breast cancer undergoing SLN biopsy, with frozen section evaluation and subsequent definitive pathological analysis. These results were compared to calculate the false-negative rate and the factors associated with it. The histopathological findings were also evaluated in patients submitted to completion ALND.RESULTS: A total of 281 patients were evaluated, identifying 18 cases with frozen section results as false negative (false-negative rate: 23.7%), and 55.5% of these cases were micrometastases. The false-negative rate in SLN with macrometastasis was 13.1% and for micrometastasis cases was 66.7% (p < 0.001). True-positive patients that were submitted to completion ALND had additional axillary lymph nodes with metastases in 28% of cases, whereas the group of false negatives had additional positive axillary lymph nodes in 40% of patients (p = 0.62).CONCLUSION: Frozen section analysis had a false-negative rate acceptable in SLN biopsy in our institution, and the micrometastasis in the SLN was the most important factor associated with the appearance of this phenomenon.

TI  - Detecting water stress scenario by land use/land cover changes in an agricultural command area
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Hirakud command area, situated in the western part of Odisha, comes under Mahanadi river basin.Mahanadi basin has been identified as critical basin from climate change point of view. The study presents an analysis to identify the possible reasons of groundwater depletion and water quality values with the help of land use and land cover (LULC) change detection methods. An analytic hierarchy process based novel water quality index (WQI) model is utilized. Eight water quality parameters are considered in WQI calculation process. Unsupervised classification, Discriminant function (pixel-based) and Image differencing (pixel-based) change detection methods are used for accurate mapping of spatial and temporal changes in LULC. The change detection analysis have been performed based on satellite data, e.g., Landsat MSS (1975), Landsat TM (1989), Landsat ETM? (2000), LISS III (2009) and Google Earth (2014). Analyses show a significant increase in built-up area compared to increase in the agricultural land over last decade. Overall analyses of groundwater levels reveal the water stress scenario in the command area. The Agricultural activities are the main reason for groundwater table fluctuation during 1995–2014. This analysis is useful for land management strategies framework helpful for decision makers.

TI  - The Battle of Worldviews: A Case Study of Liver Fluke Infection in Khon Kaen, Thailand.
T2  - Journal of evidence-based complementary & alternative medicine
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Control efforts to reduce infection from the parasitic flatworm Opisthorchis viverrini have progressed through understanding the epidemiology of Opisthorchis viverrini, antiparasitic drug developments, technological innovations, health education promoting cooking of fish, and improved hygienic defecation. Yet the problem persists. The case study method was used to examine the fundamental cause of the liver fluke infection problem. Evidence shows that the liver fluke-infected population does not care about living a long life. For them, suffering and death are simply a part of life, and expected. Thus, the cause(s) leading to death is not important. They believe morally bad actions, and predetermined fate associated with kamma in Buddhism, play a big role whether or not one is infected with the liver fluke. Health interventions may be made more effective if they take into account the liver fluke-infected population's worldviews about ethics, morality, life, and death. We researchers should not feel concerned only about medically determined causes of death.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Staging with Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound.
T2  - Current breast cancer reports
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Axillary staging in the context of breast cancer is a contentious topic due to the varied practices across UK, Europe, and America. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has questioned the role of axillary ultrasound in women with breast cancer. Published data has shown that women with ultrasound-positive lymph nodes have a worse prognosis than those with ultrasound-negative lymph nodes. Axillary ultrasound is limited as the sentinel lymph node (SLN) cannot be identified using B-mode ultrasound; however, with the advent of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), this has now changed.RECENT FINDINGS: The published literature has shown that the sentinel lymph node can be identified using CEUS. The rates are equivalent to blue dye alone but currently inferior to the dual technique of sentinel lymph node biopsy. There are several different contrast agents that can be used and the agents that remain in the sentinel lymph node for longer can identify areas of poor enhancement, allowing for targeted biopsy.SUMMARY: CEUS has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage the axilla in the future and may even replace surgical staging.

TI  - Web processing service integrated with mobile application to identify suitable grain storage facility location
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Heavy rains causing a flood like situation affect the grains stored in godowns. To save the grains from floods, they have to be transferred to safer places. Historical flood layers derived using the remote sensing data can be helpful in determining the safe place for transferring the grains from the flood affected godowns. Analyzing of satellite data for determining the safer locations needs specialized skills and GIS software’s. To overcome this, a web based information system, capable of organizing, hosting, and sharing of the flood layers and other spatial datasets as open geospatial consortium compatible web processing services is needed. For transferring the grains, the management must have the existing stock information of the flood affected godown as well as stock information of the godown where the grains are planned to be shifted.Mobile application, capable of reporting the stock information along with the godown location and ground photographs can be an efficient solution to do so. This paper presents work on web processing services integrated with mobile application using open source technologies to identify suitable grain godowns location.

TI  - Automatic procedures analyzing remote sensing data to minimize flood response time: a step towards National flood mapping service
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Value added flood products helps decision makers in an efficient relief and rescue operations. On time availability of flood products, may help decision makers, in early decision making. Indian monsoon causes floods in several Indian states at a time, every year. Mapping multiple states at a time needs lot of man power and expertise.Manual flood mapping process is a time consuming process.Automatic procedures, for delineating flood and generation of value added products from satellite images can reduce the critical time-span. In the present study, an attempt is made to automate the entire flood mapping chain. The prototype study, is demonstrated for the state of Assam and the modules developed are tested for the multiple flood events during the Brahmaputra floods of August–September, 2016. The modules are checked for each stage and their outputs are validated with those as derived from manual procedures. The study has demonstrated significant reduction in the turn out time for flood response, which is very important during rapid disaster response.

TI  - Development of Land fog Detection Algorithm based on the Optical and Textural Properties of Fog using COMS Data
T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing
T2  - 대한원격탐사학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - We developed fog detection algorithm (KNU_FDA) based on the optical and textural properties of fog using satellite (COMS) and ground observation data. The optical properties are dual channel difference (DCD: BT3.7 - BT11) and albedo, and the textural properties are normalized local standard deviation of IR1 and visible channels. Temperature difference between air temperature and BT11 is applied to discriminate the fog from other clouds. Fog detection is performed according to the solar zenith angle of pixel because of the different availability of satellite data: day, night and dawn/dusk. Post-processing is also performed to increase the probability of detection (POD), in particular, at the edge of main fog area. The fog probability is calculated by the weighted sum of threshold tests. The initial threshold and weighting values are optimized using sensitivity tests for the varying threshold values using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The validation results with ground visibility data for the validation cases showed that the performance of KNU_FDA show relatively consistent detection skills but it clearly depends on the fog types and time of day. The average POD and FAR (False Alarm Ratio) for the training and validation cases are ranged from 0.76 to 0.90 and from 0.41 to 0.63, respectively. In general, the performance is relatively good for the fog without high cloud and strong fog but that is significantly decreased for the weak fog. In order to improve the detection skills and stability, optimization of threshold and weighting values are needed through the various training cases.

TI  - Surveillance efforts after mass drug administration to validate elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem in Vanuatu.
T2  - Tropical medicine and health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vanuatu was formerly highly endemic for lymphatic filariasis (LF), caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and transmitted by Anopheles mosquitoes. After a baseline survey showing 4.8% antigen prevalence in 1998, the country conducted nationwide (in one implementation unit) annual mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole and diethylcarbamazine citrate from 2000 to 2004 and achieved prevalence of 0.2% by 2006 in a representative nationwide cluster survey among all age groups.METHODS: Post MDA surveillance was conducted from 2006 to 2012. After MDA, the country was divided for surveillance into three evaluation units (EUs) formed by grouping provinces according to baseline prevalence: EU1: Torba, Sanma and Malampa; EU2: Penama; EU3: Shefa and Tafea. The study compiled all past data and information on surveys in Vanuatu from the country programme. This paper reviews the surveillance activities done after stopping MDA to validate the interruption of transmission and elimination of LF as a public health problem.RESULTS: Post-MDA surveillance consisting of at least three transmission assessment surveys (TAS) in each of the three EUs was conducted between 2006 and 2012. Sentinel and spot check surveys identified a few villages with persistent high prevalence; all antigen positive cases in these sites were treated and additional targeted MDA conducted for 3years in 13 villages in one area of concern. All three EUs passed all TAS in 2007, 2010 and 2012 respectively, with no positives found except in EU2 (Penama province) in 2012 when 2 children tested positive for circulating filariasis antigen. Assessment of the burden of chronic filariasis morbidity found 95 cases in 2003 and 32 remaining cases in 2007, all aged over 60years.CONCLUSIONS: Vanuatu has achieved validation of elimination of LF as a public health problem. Post-validation surveillance is still recommended especially in formerly highly endemic areas.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated whether the field-in-field (FIF) technique improves the homogeneity of the target in high tangent radiation therapy (HTRT).MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 30 patients. In total, 3 HTRT plans were created: 1 with conventional opposed fields (Conv-p), 1 with the FIF technique (FIF-p), and 1 with FIF technique using lung-blocked subfields (FIF-LB-p).RESULTS: The maximum dose of the breast and planning target volume (PTV) was significantly lower for FIF-p and FIF-LB-p than Conv-p. Homogeneity index of PTV was also significantly lower for FIF-p and FIF-LB-p than Conv-p. Homogeneity index of the breast or PTV was significantly better for FIF-p than FIF-LB-p. The volumes of the breast or the PTV receiving 95% and 90% of the prescribed dose were also significantly better for FIF-p, indicating the advantages of FIF-p.CONCLUSIONS: The FIF technique was useful in HTRT and improved homogeneity in the target.

TI  - Pre-operative axillary staging: should core biopsy be preferred to fine needle aspiration cytology?
T2  - Ecancermedicalscience
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology and core needle biopsy (CNB) of axillary lymph nodes pre-operatively in newly diagnosed operable primary breast cancer.METHODS: An observational study for all patients who underwent pre-operative FNA cytology or CNB during September 2013-August 2014 was conducted at our institution (County Hospital, Stafford, UK). The accuracy of pre-operative axillary staging was compared to the post-operative histology. For this sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated.RESULTS: A total of 81 consecutive patients were evaluated by axillary ultrasound. Patients identified with potentially abnormal axillary lymph nodes underwent definitive surgery. Seven patients had positive cytology/histology who did not undergo definitive surgery and were excluded (N = 74) from the study. CNB had a sensitivity of 100% versus 72% (p = 0.006) for FNA cytology. Both had 100% specificity and PPV. The NPV of CNB was 100% versus 72% for FNA cytology. Among 35% of patients that underwent FNA cytology required repeat procedure versus 2.6% of patients who underwent CNB. 0/38 patients that had CNB required a second operation while 7/43 patients with negative FNA cytology had positive lymph nodes identified at sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) requiring surgical re-intervention with axillary node clearance.CONCLUSION: CNB was superior to FNA cytology when interrogating the axilla. We recommend CNB to be adopted routinely in pre-operative axillary staging to reduce surgical re-intervention.

TI  - Worldviews and trust of sources for health information on electronic nicotine delivery systems: Effects on risk perceptions and use.
T2  - SSM - population health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Public health agencies, the news media, and the tobacco/vapor industry have issued contradictory statements about the health effects of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). We investigated the levels of trust that consumers place in different information sources and how trust is associated with cultural worldviews, risk perceptions, ENDS use, and sociodemographic characteristics using a nationally representative sample of 6051 U.S. adults in 2015. Seventeen percent of adults were uncertain about their trust for one or more potential sources. Among the rest, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), health experts, and the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) elicited the highest levels of trust. In contrast, tobacco and vapor manufacturers, vape shop employees, and, to a lesser extent, the news media were distrusted. Adults who had higher incomes and more education or espoused egalitarian and communitarian worldviews expressed more trust in health sources and the FDA, whereas those identifying as non-Hispanic Black or multiracial reported less trust. Current smokers, those who identified as non-Hispanic Black or other race, had lower incomes, and espoused hierarchy and individualism worldviews expressed less distrust toward the tobacco and vapor industry. Greater trust (or less distrust) toward the tobacco and vapor industry and an individualism worldview were associated with perceptions of lower risk of premature death from daily ENDS use, greater uncertainty about those risks, and greater odds of using ENDS. Public health and the FDA should consider consumer trust and worldviews in the design and regulation of public education campaigns regarding the potential health risks and benefits of ENDS.

In this study, we focused on developing GOCI Products Re-processing System (GPRS) based on server virtualization and distributed processing in order to efficiently reprocess massive GOCI data. Experimental results revealed that GPRS allows raising the usage rates of memory and central processing unit (CPU) up to about 100% and 75%, respectively. This means that the proposed system enables us to save the hardware resources and increase the work process speed at the same time when we process massive satellite data.

TI  - A case of tracheo-innominate artery fistula successfully treated with endovascular stent of the innominate artery.
T2  - Journal of general and family medicine
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Tracheo-innominate artery fistula (TIF) is a rare but life-threatening complication of tracheostomy. We describe a 44-year-old man who was admitted for a pressure ulcer infection with a third tracheostomy in place. He showed massive hemoptysis from the TIF, followed by cardiopulmonary arrest. The cuff of the tube was hyperinflated; however, even a slight movement of the tube resulted in recurrent massive hemorrhage. Thus, an endovascular stent graft was placed. Our case shows that sentinel bleeding may be found prior to TIF, and an endovascular repair can be a lifesaving temporizing option, when the hemorrhage was not controlled by hyperinflating the cuff of the tube.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval in farmland using C-band SAR and optical data
T2  - Spatial Information Research
M3  - research-article
AB  - Soil moisture retrieval in vegetation-covered area with space borne synthetic aperture radar is a challenging process due to the impact of vegetation on the multiple scattering of electromagnetic wave. In this paper, a semi-empirical method is proposed to estimate farmland soil moisture by active microwave remote sensing and optical remote sensing. By integrating the vegetation water content estimated from optical data and thermal infrared data into a coupling model based on a water–cloud model, the influence of vegetation on microwave backscattering coefficient was eliminated and thus soil moisture in vegetation-covered area was accurately retrieved. The experiment of soil moisture retrieval was carried out using Radarsat-2 and Landsat 8 datasets in western Great Khingan Mountains, Inner Mongolia, China.The research showed that the accuracy of the coupling model is high and the R2 is up to 0.69 using HH polarization.Moreover, the effects of crop types on soil moisture retrieval, particularly barley, could also be distinguished using the coupling model.

However, most of the proposed techniques have been focused on improving detection accuracy through the advancement of algorithms. In this study, research has been conducted to improve the accuracy of oil spill detection by improving the quality of radar images, which are used as input data to detect oil spills. Thresholding algorithms were used to measure the image improvement both before and after processing. The overall accuracy increased by approximately 16%, the producer accuracy increased by 40%, and the user accuracy increased by 1.5%. The kappa coefficient also increased significantly, from 0.48 to 0.92.

TI  - Comparison of Snow Cover Fraction Functions to Estimate Snow Depth of South Korea from MODIS Imagery
T2  - Korean Journal of Remote Sensing
T2  - 대한원격탐사학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - Estimation of snow depth using optical image is conducted by using correlation with Snow Cover Fraction (SCF). Various algorithms have been proposed for the estimation of snow cover fraction based on Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI). In this study we tested linear, quadratic, and exponential equations for the generation of snow cover fraction maps using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite in order to evaluate their applicability to the complex terrain of South Korea and to search for improvements to the estimation of snow depth on this landscape. The results were validated by comparison with in-situ snowfall data from weather stations, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) calculated as 3.43, 2.37, and 3.99 cm for the linear, quadratic, and exponential approaches, respectively. Although quadratic results showed the best RMSE, this was due to the limitations of the data used in the study; there are few number of in-situ data recorded on the station at the time of image acquisition and even the data is mostly recorded on low snowfall. So, we conclude that linear-based algorithms are better suited for use in South Korea. However, in the case of using the linear equation, the SCF with a negative value can be calculated, so it should be corrected. Since the coefficients of the equation are not optimized for this area, further regression analysis is needed. In addition, if more variables such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), land cover, etc. are considered, it could be possible that estimation of national-scale snow depth with higher accuracy.

AB  - This research aims to analyze spectral reflectance of intertidal zone and its changes under various environmental conditions. We sampled sand of Mongsanpo tidal flat, Korea, and measured its spectral reflectance by using a spectroradiometer under various water contents, compositions and granularity. We also simulated the reflectance of Landsat 7 ETM+ and compared it with an actual satellite data. Five locations were selected for sampling from the coastline towards the ocean. Grain size diminished stepwise from the coastline to ocean direction, while spectral reflectance differed with wavelength. Water contents lowered the overall reflectance especially at the water absorption bands. Spectral reflectance data were then converted into the simulated one by using Landsat 7 ETM+ spectral reflectance function to be compared with the actual Landsat 7 ETM+ images. It showed the decrease of the spectral reflectance due to the increase of moisture contents from seashore towards the ocean. It is shown that Landsat 7 ETM+ imagery can be efficient to extract moisture contents in the tidal flat while compositional analysis needs satellite sensors with much higher spectral resolution.

AB  - This study aims to understand the relationship between lineaments and epicenters in Geochang region, Gyungsangnam-do, South Korea. An instrumental observation of earthquakes has been started by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) since 1978 and there were 6 earthquakes with magnitude ranging 2 to 2.5 in Geochang region from 1978 to 2016. Lineaments were extracted from LANDSAT 8 satellite image and shaded relief map displayed in 3-dimension using Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Then, lineament density was statistically examined by hotspot analysis. Hexagonal grids were generated to perform the analysis because hexagonal pattern expresses lineaments with less discontinuity than square girds, and the size of the grid was selected to minimize a variance of lineament density. Since hotspot analysis measures the extent of clustering with Z score, Z scores computed with lineaments’ frequency (Lf), length (Ld), and intersection (Lt) were used to find lineament clusters in the density map. Furthermore, the Z scores were extracted from the epicenters and examined to see the relevance of each density elements to epicenters. As a result, 15 among 18 densities, recorded as 3 elements in 6 epicenters, were higher than 1.65 which is 95% of the standard normal distribution. This indicates that epicenters coincide with high density area. Especially, Lf and Lt had a significant relationship with epicenter, being located in upper 95% of the standard normal distribution, except for one epicenter in Lt.This study can be used to identify potential seismic zones by improving the accuracy of expressing lineaments’ spatial distribution and analyzing relationship between lineament density and epicenter.However, additional studies in wider study area with more epicenters are recommended to promote the results.

AB  - The number of spaceborne optical sensors including red-edge band has been increasing since red-edge band is known to be effective to enhance the information content on biophysical characteristics of vegetation. Considering that the Agriculture and Forestry Satellite is planning to carry an imaging sensor having red-edge band, we tried to analyze the current status and potential of red-edge band. As a case study, we analyzed the effect of using red-edge band and tried to find the optimum band width and wavelength region of the red-edge band to estimate leaf area index (LAI) of very dense tree canopy. Field spectral measurements were conducted from April to October over two tree species (white oak and pitch pine) having high LAI. Using the spectral measurement data, total 355 red-edge bands reflectance were simulated by varying five band width (10 nm, 20 nm, 30 nm, 40 nm, 50 nm) and 71 central wavelength. Two red-edge based spectral indices (NDRE, CIRE) were derived using the simulated red-edge band and compared with the LAI of two tree species. Both NDRE and CIRE showed higher correlation coefficients with the LAI than NDVI. This would be an alternative to overcome the limitation of the NDVI saturation problem that NDVI has not been effective to estimate LAI over very dense canopy situation. There was no significant difference among five band widths of red-edge band in relation to LAI.The highest correlation coefficients were obtained at the red-edge band of center wavelength near the 720 nm for the white oak and 710 nm for the pitch pine. To select the optimum band width and wavelength region of the red-edge band, further studies are necessary to examine the relationship with other biophysical variables, such as chlorophyll, nitrogen, water content, and biomass.

AB  - Volcanic ash is a fine particle smaller than 2 mm in diameters. It falls after the volcanic eruption and causes various damages to transportation, manufacturing industry and respiration of living things. Therefore diffusion information of volcanic ash is highly significant for preventing the damages from it. It is advantageous to utilize satellites for observing the widely diffusing volcanic ash. In this study volcanic ash diffusion information about two eruptions of Mt. Sakurajima were calculated using the geostationary satellite, Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) Meteorological Imager (MI) and polar-orbiting satellite, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS). The direction and velocity of volcanic ash diffusion were analyzed by extracting the volcanic ash pixels from COMS-MI images and the height was retrieved by adjusting the shadow method to Landsat-8 images. In comparison between the results of this study and those of Volcanic Ash Advisories center (VAAC), the volcanic ash tend to diffuse the same direction in both case. However, the diffusion velocity was about four times slower than VAAC information. Moreover, VAAC only provide an ash height while our study produced a variety of height information with respect to ash diffusion. The reason for different results is measured location. In case of VAAC, they produced approximate ash information around volcano crater to rapid response, while we conducted an analysis of the ash diffusion whole area using ash observed images. It is important to measure ash diffusion when large-scale eruption occurs around the Korean peninsula. In this study, it can be used to produce various ash information about the ash diffusion area using different characteristics satellite images.

AB  - Garlic and onion are grown in major cultivation regions that depend on the crop condition and the meteorology of the production area. Therefore, when yields are to be predicted, it is reasonable to use a statistical model in which both the crop and the meteorological elements are considered. In this paper, using a multiple linear regression model, we predicted garlic and onion yields in major cultivation regions. We used the MODIS NDVI that reflects the crop conditions, and six meteorological elements for 7 major cultivation regions from 2006 to 2015. The multiple linear regression models were suggested by using stepwise regression in the extraction of independent variables. As a result, the MODIS NDVI in February was chosen the significant independent variable of the garlic and onion yield prediction model.In the case of meteorological elements, the garlic yield prediction model were the mean temperature (March), the rainfall (November, March), the relative humidity (April), and the duration time of sunshine (April, May). Also, the rainfall (November), the duration time of sunshine (January), the relative humidity (April), and the minimum temperature (June) were chosen among the variables as the significant meteorological elements of the onion yield prediction model. MODIS NDVI and meteorological elements in the model explain 84.4%, 75.9% of the garlic and onion with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 42.57 kg/10a, 340.29 kg/10a. These lead to the result that the characteristics of variations in garlic and onion growth according to MODIS NDVI and other meteorological elements were well reflected in the model.

AB  - In this paper, we propose the use of hierarchical classification for winter crop mapping based on satellite imagery. A hierarchical classification is a classifier that maps input data into defined subsumptive output categories. This classification method can reduce mixed pixel effects and improve classification performance. The methodology are illustrated focus on winter crops in Gimje city, Jeonbuk with Landsat-8 imagery. First, agriculture fields were extracted from Landsat-8 imagery using Smart Farm Map. And then winter crop fields were extracted from agriculture fields using temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Finally, winter crop fields were then classified into wheat, barley, IRG, whole crop barley and mixed crop fields using signature from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).The results indicate that hierarchical classifier could effectively identify winter crop fields with an overall classification accuracy of 98.99%. Thus, it is expected that the proposed classification method would be effectively used for crop mapping.

AB  - In this study, we tried to analyze the correlation between corn yield and, satellite-based vegetation index, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and various climatic factors in the three provinces of Northeast China during the past 20 years (1996-2015). The corn yields in the corn cultivation area of all three provinces showed a statistically significant positive correlation with the NDVI of the harvest period. Also, these have significant negative correlation with the daily maximum temperature in August and September and the occurrence frequency of above 30Â°C for the summer season. The correlation between the corn yields and the precipitation showed a significant positive coefficient in only Liaoning Province in July, but the correlation was not found in Jilin and Heilongjiang Provinces. In this study, the NDVI and the daily maximum temperature data are suitable to be used as predictors of corn yield in the three provinces of Northeast China provinces.

AB  - With the increasing socio-economic importance of rice as a global staple food, several models have been developed for rice yield estimation by combining remote sensing data with carbon cycle modelling. In this study, we aimed to estimate rice yield in Korea using such an integrative model using satellite remote sensing data in combination with a biophysical crop growth model. Specifically, daily meteorological inputs derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution imaging Spectroradiometer) and radar satellite products were used to run a light use efficiency based crop growth model, which is based on the MODIS gross primary production (GPP) algorithm. The modelled biomass was converted to rice yield using a harvest index model. We estimated rice yield from 2003 to 2014 at the county level and evaluated the modelled yield using the official rice yield and rice straw biomass statistics of Statistics Korea (KOSTAT). The estimated rice biomass, yield, and harvest index and their spatial distributions were investigated. Annual mean rice yield at the national level showed a good agreement with the yield statistics with the yield statistics, a mean error (ME) of +0.56% and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.73%. The estimated county level yield resulted in small ME (+0.10~+2.00%) and MAE (2.10~11.62%), respectively.Compared to the county-level yield statistics, the rice yield was over estimated in the counties in Gangwon province and under estimated in the urban and coastal counties in the south of Chungcheong province.Compared to the rice straw statistics, the estimated rice biomass showed similar error patterns with the yield estimates. The subpixel heterogeneity of the 1 km MODIS FPAR (Fraction of absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation) may have attributed to these errors. In addition, the growth and harvest index models can be further developed to take account of annually varying growth conditions and growth timings.

AB  - Global solar radiation was calculated in this research using ground-base measurement data, meteorological satellite data, and GWNU (Gangneung-Wonju National University) solar radiation model. We also analyzed the accuracy of the GWNU model by comparing the observed solar radiation according to the total cloud cover. Our research was based on the global solar radiation of the GWNU radiation site in 2012, observation data such as temperature and pressure, humidity, aerosol, total ozone amount data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) sensor, and Skyview data used for evaluation of cloud mask and total cloud cover. On a clear day when the total cloud cover was 0 tenth, the calculated global solar radiations using the GWNU model had a high correlation coefficient of 0.98 compared with the observed solar radiation, but root mean square error (RMSE) was relatively high, i.e., 36.62 Wm2 . The Skyview equipment was unable to determine the meteorological condition such as thin clouds, mist, and haze. On a cloudy day, regression equations were used for the radiation model to correct the effect of clouds. The correlation coefficient was 0.92, but the RMSE was high, i.e., 99.50 Wm2 . For more accurate analysis, additional analysis of various elements including shielding of the direct radiation component and cloud optical thickness is required. The results of this study can be useful in the area where the global solar radiation is not observed by calculating the global solar radiation per minute or time.

AB  - In this study, the surface broadband emissivity (3.0-14.0 μm) was calculated using the multiple linear regression model with narrow bands (channels 29, 30, and 31) emissivity data of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Earth Observing System Terra satellite. The 307 types of spectral emissivity data (123 soil types, 32 vegetation types, 19 types of water bodies, 43 manmade materials, and 90 rock) with MODIS University of California Santa Barbara emissivity library and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission & Reflection Radiometer spectral library were used as the spectral emissivity data for the derivation and verification of the multiple linear regression model. The derived determination coefficient (R 2 ) of multiple linear regression model had a high value of 0.95 (p<0.001) and the root mean square error between these model calculated and theoretical broadband emissivities was 0.0070. The surface broadband emissivity from our multiple linear regression model was comparable with that by Wang et al. (2005). The root mean square error between surface broadband emissivities calculated by models in this study and by Wang et al.(2005) during January was 0.0054 in Asia, Africa, and Oceania regions. The minimum and maximum differences of surface broadband emissivities between two model results were 0.0027 and 0.0067 respectively. The similar statistical results were also derived for August. The surface broadband emissivities by our multiple linear regression model could thus be acceptable. However, the various regression models according to different land covers need be applied for the more accurate calculation of the surface broadband emissivities

AB  - Maritime accidents around the Korean Peninsula are increasing, and the ship detection research using remote sensing data is consequently becoming increasingly important. This study presented a new ship detection algorithm using hyperspectral images that provide the spectral information of several hundred channels in the ship detection field, which depends on high resolution optical imagery. We applied a spectral matching algorithm between the reflection spectrum of the ship deck obtained from two field observations and the ship and seawater spectrum of the hyperspectral sensor of an airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer. A total of five detection algorithms were used, namely spectral distance similarity (SDS), spectral correlation similarity (SCS), spectral similarity value (SSV), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and spectral information divergence (SID). SDS showed an error in the detection of seawater inside the ship, and SAM showed a clear classification result with a difference between ship and seawater of approximately 1.8 times. Additionally, the present study classified the vessels included in hyperspectral images by presenting the adaptive thresholds of each technique. As a result, SAM and SID showed superior ship detection abilities compared to those of other detection algorithms.
