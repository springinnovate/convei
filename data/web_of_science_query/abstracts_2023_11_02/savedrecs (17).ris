TI  - Bathymetric mapping and estimation of water storage in a shallow lake using a remote sensing inversion method based on machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate lake depth mapping and estimation of changes in water level and water storage are fundamental significance for understanding the lake water resources on the Tibetan Plateau. In this study, combined with satellite images and bathymetric data, we comprehensively evaluate the accuracy of a multi-factor combined linear regression model (MLR) and machine learning models, create a depth distribution map and compare it with the spatial interpolation, and estimate the change of water level and water storage based on the inverted depth. The results indicated that the precision of the random forest (RF) was the highest with a coefficient of determination (R (2)) value (0.9311) and mean absolute error (MAE) values (1.13 m) in the test dataset and had high reliability in the overall depth distribution. The water level increased by 9.36 m at a rate of 0.47 m/y, and the water storage increased by 1.811 km(3) from 1998 to 2018 based on inversion depth. The water level change was consistent with that of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) method. Our work shows that this method may be employed to study the water depth distribution and its changes by combining with bathymetric data and satellite imagery in shallow lakes.

TI  - Monitoring water color anomaly of lakes based on an integrated method using Landsat-8 OLI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water color is a crucial optical indicator of water quality, polluted water bodies often show water color anomalies. To comprehensively understand the occurrence of water color anomalies in inland lakes, an integrated method was designed using the hue angle based on the Forel-Ule Index (FUI) model, and other remote sensing indices, including the Turbid Water Index (TWI), Floating Algae Index (FAI), and Cyanobacteria and Macrophytes Index (CMI). Based on all available Landsat-8 OLI images from 2013 to 2020, continuous monitoring was conducted in three different lakes in the middle of the Yangtze River, China. The results demonstrated that: (1) The proposed method can accurately identify algal blooms, high sediment loads, and eutrophication from the abnormal water color areas; (2) The calculated hue angles of sediment-dominated water were significantly higher than those of algal blooms and aquatic vegetation, providing a noticeable visual discoloration of water; (3) These water color anomalies exhibited significant correlations with the water quality and environmental conditions. This study serves as an example for accurate and spatially continuous assessment of water color anomaly and supports practical information to facilitate local water environment conservation.

TI  - SPACE, TIME and NUMBER as a holistic unity in the <i>Yijing</i>
T2  - COGENT PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The holistic view (or systematic thinking) of the Yijing (here Yijing refers to the original text in the ancient Chinese Daoist work The Book of Changes) is representative of the philosophical worldview in ancient China, which can reveal the interactive relationship between space, time and number. This study attempts to analyze and summarize human spatial, temporal and numeral processing from the aspects of the linguistic and cultural quantitative system for the three domains, contributing an original cognitive linguistic perspective on the holistic thinking typifying the worldview in ancient China and laying a foundation for further research. It argues that SPACE, TIME and NUMBER are not separated, but a holistic unity (or wholeness), they can be considered as one single domain. In ancient Chinese culture, the three domains cannot be separate, they should be integrated into the "growth of life experience", which is based on the MOTION metaphor and LIFE metaphor of the Yijing. The results of the corpus study of the Yijing text indicate that in this particular context of the Yijing, concepts in the domains of SPACE, TIME and NUMBER are schematized on the basis of further metaphorical extensions of concepts from the source of LIFE and MOTION.

TI  - Mapping of lakes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2016 to 2021: trend and potential regularity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) have large quantities and areas. As an important component of fragile plateau ecosystems, these lakes have attracted increasing attention. However, owing to the limitations of technology and methods, changes in smaller lakes on the TP have received less attention. In this study, we used Google Earth Engine (GEE) with the Analysis Ready Data (ARD) preparation framework to obtain preprocessed Sentinel-1 data covering the plateau. The D-LinkNet framework was introduced to achieve lake extraction, and the lake dataset was completed from 2016 to 2021. The lake dataset showed an area accuracy of 86.49% and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.72-0.99 in different regions. The findings were as follows: during the study period, the TP lakes tended to be stable after increasing, with an increase in area and number of +7.6% and +14.8%. Except for the northwest TP, the other regions show the same general trend. In particular, the Tarim Basin exhibited a lake variation pattern independent of the TP. Significantly, we found frequent lake activity in the Kunlun Mountains, Qaidam Basin, Mountain Qogir, etc. Effects of the ongoing La Nina event on the TP lakes may occur in the next few years.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of GEO-KOMPSAT-2A and FengYun satellite-based precipitation estimates across Northeast Asia
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Geostationary meteorological satellites provide precipitation estimates with a high spatio-temporal resolution, which is important for near real-time precipitation monitoring. This study systematically evaluated geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) from Chinese Fengyun-2 G (FY-2 G), Fengyun-4A (FY-4A), and South Korean Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK-2A) across Northeast Asia in 2020. Compared against ground-based rainfall gauges at a 6-hourly scale, FY-2 G provided the highest accuracy in the China region with a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.53) and a low bias (-0.26 mm) due to the ground calibration process in FY-2 G. Conversely, GK-2A provided more accurate precipitation estimates for South Korea and Japan stations. FY-4A QPE generally showed a large positive bias throughout different seasons, although it provided satisfactory R and categorical statistics. FY-based QPEs slightly overestimated summer precipitation, especially over South Korea and Japan region, while GK-2A tended to underestimate summer precipitation. All examined QPEs showed poor accuracy during the winter season due to the frozen particles and ice clouds. Intensity analysis revealed that FY-based QPEs tended to overestimate the occurrence of no rain and heavy rain cases, whereas GK-2A underestimated no rain and heavy rain cases and overestimated light rain occurrence. It is also found that all examined QPEs captured the temporal variation of precipitation during storm events, while FY-based products overestimated heavy precipitation peaks and GK-2A underestimated peak precipitation. The findings in the study provided valuable information to further improve current infrared precipitation retrieval algorithms.

TI  - A transformer-based Siamese network and an open optical dataset for semantic change detection of remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent change detection (CD) methods focus on the extraction of deep change semantic features. However, existing methods overlook the fine-grained features and have the poor ability to capture long-range space-time information, which leads to the micro changes missing and the edges of change types smoothing. In this paper, a potential transformer-based semantic change detection (SCD) model, Pyramid-SCDFormer is proposed, which precisely recognizes the small changes and fine edges details of the changes. The SCD model selectively merges different semantic tokens in multi-head self-attention block to obtain multiscale features, which is crucial for extraction information of remote sensing images (RSIs) with multiple changes from different scales. Moreover, we create a well-annotated SCD dataset, Landsat-SCD with unprecedented time series and change types in complex scenarios. Comparing with three Convolutional Neural Network-based, one attention-based, and two transformer-based networks, experimental results demonstrate that the Pyramid-SCDFormer stably outperforms the existing state-of-the-art CD models and obtains an improvement in MIoU/F1 of 1.11/0.76%, 0.57/0.50%, and 8.75/8.59% on the LEVIR-CD, WHU_CD, and Landsat-SCD dataset respectively. For change classes proportion less than 1%, the proposed model improves the MIoU by 7.17-19.53% on Landsat-SCD dataset. The recognition performance for small-scale and fine edges of change types has greatly improved.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in surface albedo during the ablation season and linkages with the annual mass balance on Muz Taw Glacier, Altai Mountains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt-albedo feedback on glaciers is recognized as important processes for understanding glacier behavior and its sensitivity to climate change. This study selected the Muz Taw Glacier in the Altai Mountains to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in albedo and their linkages with mass balance, which will improve our knowledge of the recent acceleration of regional glacier shrinkage. Based on the Landsat-derived albedo, the spatial distribution of ablation-period albedo was characterized by a general increase with elevation, and significant east-west differences at the same elevation. The gap-filling MODIS values captured a nonsignificant negative trend of mean ablation-period albedo since 2000, with a total decrease of approximately 4.2%. From May to September, glacier-wide albedo exhibited pronounced V-shaped seasonal variability. A significant decrease in annual minimum albedo was found from 2000 to 2021, with the rate of approximately -0.30% yr(-1) at the 99% confidence level. The bivariate relationship demonstrated that the change of ablation-period albedo explained 82% of the annual mass-balance variability. We applied the albedo method to estimate annual mass balance over the period 2000-2015. Combined with observed values, the average mass balance was -0.82 +/- 0.32 m w.e. yr(-1) between 2000 and 2020, with accelerated mass loss.

TI  - Road traffic crashes and emergency response optimization: a geo-spatial analysis using closest facility and location-allocation methods
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased occurrence of road traffic crashes in Kano metropolis has resulted in a steady loss of lives, injuries, and increased people's risk exposure. This study looked into the emergency response to road traffic crashes in Kano, with a view to improving efficiency by developing linkages and synergy between Emergency Healthcare Facilities (EHCF), ambulances, and crash hotspots. The geographical location and attributes of the major EHCF, crash hotspots along highway intersections, and the two existent ambulances at the Kano State Fire Service (KSFS) and Federal Road Safety Corp head offices (FRSC) were obtained using GPS surveying. Road traffic network data (vector format) was digitized from satellite image, from which two major road classes (highways and minor roads) were identified, as well as their respective speed limits. The length and speed constraints were used to calculate time distances. Nearest Neighbor and Network (closest facility, shortest route, and location-allocation) analyses were carried out. Location-allocation analysis was to determine based on defined criteria the best locations to allocate EHCF or ambulance for optimum coverage. The results demonstrated that EHCF, ambulances, and crash places have different distribution patterns with almost no linkages. Closest ambulance facility analysis revealed the FRSC ambulance takes 9.41 minutes to arrive to crash spot 18 (Maiduguri Road, following NNPC) and 7.52 minutes to arrive at AKTH, the nearest EHCF. Comparatively, getting to Court road incident scene (spot 16) and IRPH as the closest EHCF takes about 3 times the time it takes to get to spot 18 and 4 times the time it takes to get to AKTH. This means that practically almost all victims in the city suffocate before reaching to the hospital. This signifies that, in cases of demand for CPR at the incident scene, there are higher likelihood of dying as it is expected to be provided within the first four minutes after the crash. Based on a maximum of 4 minutes impedance cutoff from all directions towards the occurrences areas, location-allocation analysis found eight new locations to maximize coverage and improve efficiency. It is concluded that current road traffic crash emergency response system has been determined to be ineffective. As a result, more ambulances should be strategically placed to improve emergency response times.

TI  - Double rupture event in the Tianshan Mountains: A case study of the 2021 Mw 5.3 Baicheng NW China
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - On March 23, 2021 (21:14 universal time coordinated), an Mw 5.3 earthquake occurred in Baicheng County in Xinjiang, northwestern China, according to the United States Geological Survey. The earthquake produced a 4-km-long surface rupture at the epicenter, which is generally rare for earthquakes of magnitude 5.3. Thus, investigating the Baicheng earthquake is crucial for understanding the seismogenic structure of the region. We obtained the interferometric synthetic aperture radar deformation field and inverted the slip distribution of the Baicheng earthquake using Sentinel-1A satellite data and surface rupture data. The results indicate that the surface deformation area was elliptical, with long and short axes of approximately 20 and 10 km, respectively. The seismogenic structure is a left-lateral strike-slip fault with a small dip-slip component and strike and dip angles of 248 degrees and 70 degrees, respectively. Two other slip centers were also observed at 2 and 8 km beneath the surface in the dip direction. The maximum slip at 2 km was 0.45 m. Shear deformation between the Tarim Basin and Southern Tianshan Mountains was responsible for the strike-slip features of the Baicheng earthquake.

TI  - Canopy temperatures of selected tree species growing in the forest and outside the forest using aerial thermal infrared (3.6-4.9 μm) data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies conducted in recent years have demonstrated high application potential of thermal remote sensing data in environmental analyses. The main goal of our studies was to determine the variability of tree canopy temperatures using a new sensor which acquires data in the still rarely used thermal spectral range (3.6-4.9 mu m). This study was conducted on five selected tree species growing in the forest and outside the forest: Alnus glutinosa, Pinus sylvestris, Quercus petraea, Quercus rubra and Robinia pseudoacacia. Thermal data were acquired on 9 June 2019, between 8:10 and 14:00 (CET). The findings were as follows: i) Trees growing in the forest are on average 0.4-0.7 degrees C cooler than trees outside the forest; ii) The canopy temperatures of species under study differ statistically irrespective of data acquisition time. Alnus glutinosa, Quercus rubra and Quercus petraea are species with the lowest canopy temperatures, and Pinus sylvestris has the highest canopy temperature. The studies showed that the biggest variation between species in the canopy temperature occurs at noon (12:00-13:00); iii) A thermal spectral range of 3.6-4.9 mu m registers the canopy temperature of tree species with a high accuracy, which supports its usage in remote sensing vegetation studies.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - A catastrophic earthquake (magnitude Mw 7.2) occurred on 14 August 2021 in Haiti. Sea surface temperature (SST) and sea potential temperature (SPT) observed from satellites show pronounced changes prior to the main earthquake event. The changes are observed near the epicenter and the boundary of the Caribbean Plate. Here we have carried out a detailed analysis of ocean, atmosphere and land surface parameters (sea water salinity, chlorophyll-a, latent energy flux, sensible heat flux, specific humidity, air temperature, methane and land surface temperature) using multiple satellite data to understand the possible mechanism of sea temperature changes. The strong coupling among these geophysical and geochemical parameters has been found within 2-week prior to the 2021 Haiti Mw 7.2 earthquake due to the interaction between ocean/land and atmosphere during the last phase of earthquake preparation period caused by the tectonic movement. The spatiotemporal distribution pattern of anomalies is discussed in view of the focal mechanism of the earthquake event.

TI  - Gap-filling MODIS daily aerosol optical depth products by developing a spatiotemporal fitting algorithm
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol loadings and their spatial distribution are among the most important atmospheric information needed for a range of applications such as air quality monitoring, climate research, and public health. A key measure of aerosol quantity is aerosol optical depth (AOD) and it has been routinely observed from space by Earth observing satellites/instrument, especially the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Despite its global coverage and daily temporal resolution, the MODIS Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD product is fraught with missing values, severely limiting its use. A gap-filling method which is suitable for large-area application with high efficiency to obtain gapless AOD with reasonable spatial pattern and complete coverage is still lacking. Here, we proposed a novel spatiotemporal fitting algorithm to gap-fill the daily MODIS AOD product. Our algorithm is a multi-stage method aimed to address the non-stationary nature of AOD time series. First, the trend of daily AOD in a year in each pixel was fitted via smoothing splines and the residual was derived based on the original data and the trend. Second, the residual was spatially interpolated, leveraging the spatial correlation between the target pixel and the neighboring pixels. Third, the actual AOD was calculated as the sum of the trend and interpolated residual. We tested the algorithm against ground-based AOD data from 2011 to 2018 in China and further evaluated it via cross-validation at the global scale based on 10 selected MODIS tiles. Compared to the ground-reference AOD, the RMSE of our gapless datasets were 0.24 and 0.27 for Terra and Aqua, respectively; and the cross-validation showed a RMSE ranging from 0.045 to 0.055 (Terra) and 0.047 to 0.057 (Aqua) under different missing ratios. The novel gap-filling method outperforms the Interpolation-based Correlation Weighting (ICW) and Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) algorithms in accuracy. Meanwhile, the gapless AOD using the novel algorithm shows lower accuracy than original MAIAC AOD, similar accuracy with the AOD from the Long-term Gap-free High-resolution Air Pollutants (LGHAP) concentration dataset, higher accuracy than the AOD from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Overall, the accuracy of gapless AOD using this algorithm meets the need of typical applications in relevant studies. The proposed algorithm is transferable to other regions, with the potential to be used even operationally and efficiently for generating accurate gapless global daily AOD datasets with the input of only MODIS MAIAC AOD data.

TI  - Improving remote sensing estimation of Secchi disk depth for global lakes and reservoirs using machine learning methods
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth (SDD) is a simple but particularly important indicator for characterizing the overall water quality status and assessing the long-term dynamics of water quality for diverse global waters. For this reason, countless efforts have been made to collect SDD data from the field and through remote sensing systems. Many empirical and semianalytical algorithms have been proposed to estimate SDD from different satellite images for a specific or regional water. However, the construction of a robust global SDD estimation model is still challenging due to the nonlinear response of SDD to optical properties and the complex physical and biogeochemical processes of different waters. Therefore, machine learning methods to better interpret nonlinear processes were used to improve remote sensing estimations of SDD for global lakes and reservoirs based on a global matchup dataset from Landsat TM (N = 4099), ETM+ (N = 2420), and OLI (N = 1249) covering in situ SDD from 0.01 m to over 18 m. Overall, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and random forest (RF) had better SDD retrievals than back propagation neural network, support vector regression, empirical and quasi-analytical models showing high precision with mean relative error of approximately 30% and good agreements with the long-term in situ SDD in different waters with various optical properties. Our results can support long-term global-level water quality evaluation and thus making informed decisions about development policy.

As satellite data become available at higher spatial (3-10 m) and temporal (1-3 days) resolution, new opportunities arise to map and quantify urban area changes. While deep learning (DL) models have recently shown great performance when dealing with satellite data, their training requires a lot of labeled data which are not necessarily available at global scale. Satellite benchmark datasets, commonly used to advance methods, provide labeled data, but are rarely used for mapping and area estimation outside the training data. In this study, we aim to utilize the Sentinel-2-based benchmark dataset, Onera Satellite Change Detection (OSCD), to train a DL model and analyze its performance at local scale to map urban land use changes, estimate area of changes and provide characterization of changes. We apply the model over the Washington DC-Baltimore area for 2018-2019. We show that in just one year almost 1% of the total urban area underwent changes with the majority coming from the construction of commercial buildings, followed by residential buildings. Almost 10% of changes were attributed to the construction of new or renovation of existing schools.

TI  - Use of local climate zones to assess the spatiotemporal variations of urban vegetation phenology in Austin, Texas, USA
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenological changes caused by urbanization may provide evidence of how vegetation responds to global warming. However, the phenological characteristics of vegetation in metropolitan areas have been poorly studied, especially in terms of spatiotemporal variations. In this study, we explored the applicability of Local Climate Zones (LCZs) to investigate the spatiotemporal variations in urban vegetation phenology by linking MODIS-derived phenology metrics with LCZs in the Austin metropolitan area in Texas, USA. We extracted three vegetation phenology metrics from MODIS data between 2008 and 2018, including the start of growing season, end of growing season, and length of the growing season (i.e. SOS, EOS, and LOS, respectively). The results showed that during the study period, the EOS and SOS gradually advanced, while LOS showed no obvious change. Statistical analysis was conducted to examine the spatiotemporal variations of the phenology metrics among different LCZs and along "Urban-Rural Gradients" (URGs). There were 37.5%, 75.0%, and 74.3% pairs of LCZs, indicating statistically significant phenological differences in terms of SOS, EOS, and LOS in 2012, respectively. In contrast, most pairs of URGs showed almost no differences in phenological metrics, especially in EOS. Geographically, SOS showed a fluctuating change with an advancing tendency, whereas the EOS decreased very slowly with distance from the city center (i.e. along the URGs). LCZs can be used to help identify distinctive phenology metrics with statistically significant differences, especially in EOS and LOS. Compared to URGs, LCZs offer a unique analytical framework for studying urban ecosystem patterns, functions, and dynamics. Lastly, LCZs can enable the identification of sensitive areas for ecological protection in support of sustainable urban development and environmental stewardship.

TI  - A high-precision image classification network model based on a voting mechanism
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of satellite remote sensing technology, image classification task, as the basis of remote sensing data interpretation, has received wide attention to improving accuracy and robustness. At the same time, in-depth learning technology has been widely used in remote sensing and has a far-reaching impact. Since the existing image classification methods ignore the feature that the general image semantics are the same as the semantics of a single pixel, this paper presents an algorithm that uses the semantics of an image to achieve high-precision image classification. Based on the idea of partial substitution for global, this algorithm designs a split result voting mechanism and builds a Vgg-Vote network model. This mechanism votes on the semantically segmented result of an image and uses the maximum filtering function to select the category containing the most significant number of pixels as the prediction category of the image. Experiments on UC Merced Land-User complete datasets and five types of incomplete datasets with varying degrees of interference, including noise, data occlusion and loss, show that the Vote mechanism dramatically improves the classification accuracy, robustness and anti-jamming capability of Vgg-Vote.

TI  - Injecting spectral indices to transferable convolutional neural network under imbalanced and noisy labels for Landsat image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Stable and continuous remote sensing land-cover mapping is important for agriculture, ecosystems, and land management. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are promising methods for achieving this goal. However, the large number of high-quality training samples required to train a CNN is difficult to acquire. In practice, imbalanced and noisy labels originating from existing land-cover maps can be used as alternatives. Experiments have shown that the inconsistency in the training samples has a significant impact on the performance of the CNN. To overcome this drawback, a method is proposed to inject highly consistent information into the network, to learn general and transferable features to alleviate the impact of imperfect training samples. Spectral indices are important features that can provide consistent information. These indices can be fused with CNN feature maps which utilize information entropy to choose the most appropriate CNN layer, to compensate for the inconsistency caused by the imbalanced, noisy labels. The proposed transferable CNN, tested with imbalanced and noisy labels for inter-regional Landsat time-series, not only is superior in terms of accuracy for land-cover mapping but also demonstrates excellent transferability between regions in both time series and cross-regional Landsat image classification.

TI  - A robust and adaptive spatial-spectral fusion model for PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensors usually compromise between their spatial and spectral resolutions due to the limitations of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio, such as the Very High spatial Resolution (VHR) PlanetScope (PS, four or five 3-m bands) and medium spatial resolution (med-resolution) Sentinel-2 (S2, ten 10-m or 20-m bands) constellations. Concomitant with the growing demand for satellite images with ample spatial details and spectral signatures, Spatial-Spectral image Fusion (SSF) is important for blending the spatial resolution of PS and the spectral resolution of S2 to produce synthetic 3-m image products in the ten bands for different applications. However, the existing studies conducted for fusing PS and S2 data present limited spatial and spectral fidelities to original PS and S2 bands. Hence, this study presents a new SSF method named Robust and Adaptive Spatial-Spectral image Fusion Model (RASSFM) for that purpose. RASSFM improves the spatial and spectral fidelities of the results through: (1) combining the spectral mapping and the spectral correlation to obtain the high-quality spatial information sources for the S2 bands, (2) utilizing the neighborhood information considering both spatial and spectral constraints to improve the spectral fidelities of the fused bands. We conducted the SSF tests at the degraded and original spatial resolutions to comprehensively evaluate the proposed RASSFM method. Furthermore, we examined the performance of RASSFM in four study sites with highly mixed regular or desert urban, heterogeneous agricultural, and vegetation-dominated landscapes. Moreover, we compared our method with twenty representative SSF methods developed for similar purposes. The results demonstrate that RASSFM not only outperforms the other methods but has robust performance in different landscapes and comparable accuracies in different bands, thereby advancing the fusion of VHR and med-resolution images from PS and S2, respectively.

TI  - Upscaling aboveground biomass of larch (<i>Larix olgensis</i> Henry) plantations from field to satellite measurements: a comparison of individual tree-based and area-based approaches
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation primarily relies on an area-based approach (ABA), particularly at a large scale. With the advancement of individual tree detection techniques and the availability of multi-platform remotely sensed data, the individual tree-based approach (ITA) provides the potential of accurate and nondestructive fine AGB mapping. However, the performances of the two approaches on upscaling AGB from individual tree to stand level have not been thoroughly investigated. This study conducted the nondestructive AGB estimation using both ITA and ABA and compared the AGB estimates and their spatial uncertainties from an individual tree- to stand-level based on multi-platform LiDAR and Landsat 8 OLI imagery, taking Larix olgensis that is one of the most notable afforestation tree species in northeastern China as an example. Results showed that the point cloud segmentation (PCS) outperformed CHM-based individual tree crown delineation algorithms and obtained the highest accuracy of individual tree AGB estimate (R-2 = 0.97, RMSE = 28.58 kg, rRMSE = 21.13%) for the dense larch plantations (about 1265 trees/ha). The plot-level AGB estimate aggregated by all detected trees and its uncertainty based on Monte Carlo simulation were 158.16 and 3.64 Mg center dot ha(-1), respectively. The average pixel-level AGB of larch plantations in Maorshan Forest Farm estimated by ITA and ABA were similar (129.66 v.s 144.38 Mg center dot ha(-1)). ITA outperformed ABA in terms of pixel-level AGB accuracy and spatial uncertainty of pixel-level and stand-level AGB estimates. The overestimation of low AGB values, typical in ABA, was effectively eliminated by the ITA. The upscaling frameworks proposed in this study for AGB estimation and spatial uncertainty quantification based on ITA and ABA could be extended to other plantations or uncomplex forests. This study contributes to the accurate quantification of AGB and understanding of the uncertainties in the carbon stock of forest ecosystems at multi-scales.

TI  - Tree regrowth duration map from LCMAP collection 1.0 land cover products in the conterminous United States, 1985-2017
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest covers about one-third of the land area of the conterminous United States (CONUS) and plays an important role in offsetting carbon emissions and supporting local economies. Growing interest in forests as relatively cost-effective nature-based climate solutions, particularly restoration and reforestation activities has increased the demand for information on forest regrowth and recovery following natural and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g. fire, harvest, or thinning). However, a wall-to-wall mapping of the CONUS tree regrowth duration at an annual time interval and 30-m resolution is still challenging. In this study, we utilized the annual land cover products to develop a dataset to quantify forest regrowth duration for CONUS over 1985-2017. The land cover data used to derive the tree regrowth duration map is from the primary land cover product in the U.S. Geological Survey's Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) collection. The LCMAP product used all available Landsat images to detect disturbances over forest and classify Grass/Shrub to Tree Cover transitions on an annual basis. The average regrowth duration was then calculated for each pixel. The regrowth duration map was validated using human-interpreted annual reference data that were collected independently. The validation results show 1 year of underestimation and 6-year standard deviation of error between the reference data and the regrowth duration map. In southeastern CONUS, where major tree regrowth activities have been observed, our map showed higher accuracy with less than one-year bias and 3.6 years standard deviation of error. Forest in the southeast took around 5 years to recover, which was faster than other regions of CONUS. Many pixels had multiple disturbances during the 33-year study period in the region. The spatial pattern of the tree regrowth indicated intense harvesting activities in this region. The Pacific Northwest coast region was the second main area of tree regrowth, but this region often took multiple decades to recover. Given the increasing interest in forests as nature-based climate solutions, the tree regrowth duration map can be used to assess reforestation activities as well as forest recovery following natural disturbance and harvesting.

TI  - For-backward LSTM-based missing data reconstruction for time-series Landsat images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reconstructing the missing data for cloud/shadow-covered optical satellite images has great significance for enhancing the data availability and multi-temporal analysis. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based method for cloud/shadow-covered missing data reconstruction for time-series Landsat images. Central to this method is the combined use of autoencoder, long-short-term memory (AE-LSTM)-based similar pixel clustering and for backward LSTM-based time-series prediction. First, manually delineated cloud/shadow-covered masks were overlaid onto multi-temporal satellite images to produce pixel-wise time-series data with masking values. Second, these pixel-wise time series were clustered by an AE-LSTM-based unsupervised method into multiple clusters, for searching similar pixels. Third, for each cluster of target images, a for-backward-LSTM-based model was established to restore missing values in time series data. Finally, reconstructed data were merged with cloud-free (image) regions to produce cloud-free time-series images. The proposed method was applied onto three datasets of multi-temporal Landsat-8 OLI images to restore cloud/shadow-covered images. The reconstruction results, showing an improvement of greater than 10% in normalized mean-square error compared to the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in time-series reconstruction for satellite images.

TI  - Near-death experiences and the change of worldview in survivors of sudden cardiac arrest: A phenomenological and hermeneutical study.
T2  - Qualitative research in medicine & healthcare
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Near-death experiences (NDEs) can occur during episodes of unconsciousness from life-threatening conditions, such as sudden cardiac arrests (SCAs). This study is based on interviews with patients who had an NDE. The interviews were analyzed with phenomenological hermeneutical method for their lived experiences and the meaning for the view of life and death. Four participants were interviewed 10 weeks after their NDE. Four themes emerged: being on the other side, in another dimension; not dreaming, this is a real experience; being in a non-physical condition without my body; and comparing views of life and death before and after the NDEs. The participants described the NDEs as an experience of another realm as non-physical in nature and existing beyond space and time. This study shows that this experience of another state of being, through the lived experiences of NDEs, gave the participants an entirely new meaning on life and death. To them, death was no longer viewed as an end but a passage into something else and that life continues after death. This realization instantly changed their worldview.

TI  - How to Measure the Amount of Aerosol Optical Thickness in the Atmosphere in a Simple Way: A Calitoo Handheld Sun-Photometer Measurement
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To have useful information about the effects of atmospheric particles on visibility degradation, extinction of solar radiation, climate changes, and tropospheric corrections in remote sensing, aerosol optical thickness (AOT) plays a crucial role. So, the measurement of AOT is an essential task for atmospheric physicists. In this regard, this article presents a systematic way in a simple form using a Calitoo handheld sun-photometer (SPM) to study atmospheric AOT. Zanjan city is selected for a period of six months as an example due to existing reference data for comparison. Hence, we use a schedule distributed in seven times, including 8:00, 9:30, 10:45, solar noon, 13:45, 15:30, and 17:00 in local time. The used wavelengths for recording are 465, 540, and 619 nm. Our data analysis shows that the mean value for AOT at those wavelengths are 0.25, 0.21, and 0.20, respectively. Also, the mean angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) extracted from the AOTs at 465, and 619 nm is 0.80. Accordingly, AE versus AOT plot demonstrates that most of the particles in Zanjan's atmosphere are classified as urban industrial (similar to 64%) and dust plus mixed (similar to 36%) particles. In addition, to have a metric, a comparison between the AOT extracted from simultaneous measurements of Calitoo handheld and Cimel automatic SPMs is employed that indicates a strong correlation (r = 0.99) between them. Furthermore, OMI, Aqua MODIS, and Terra MODIS AOT products are compared with the Calitoo SPM AOT data. The results reveal that there is a better relationship between MODIS and Calitoo data than OMI. This study leads us to conclude that it can open new insights by simple instruments to study the atmospheres that are unknown to scientists due to the limitations of geographical stations.

TI  - Assessment of cropland inundation due to the operation of the Reelfoot Lake spillway in West Tennessee
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Running Reelfoot Bayou (RRB) is the outlet canal of Reelfoot Lake, the largest natural lake in Tennessee. RRB is not able to contain discharge from Reelfoot Lake greater than the bankfull discharge of 28 m(3)/s (1000 ft(3)/s), which typically occurs at the beginning of the growing season (April-June). Historically, the planting of crops has been delayed until flooding subsides and cropland has drained. The objective of this study is a preliminary quantification of cropland inundation to determine its spatial distribution in the RRB floodplain. Inundated croplands in the RRB floodplain were delineated over a range of spillway discharges from 2 to 57 m(3)/s (70-2000 ft(3)/s), using one-dimensional-two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling and multispectral satellite images (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2). The composite maps made by combining the simulated and image-derived flood maps were overlaid on the United States Department of Agriculture CropScape layer to determine the inundation of individual summer crops during the growing season. About 25% of the inundated croplands are flooded at discharges of RRB less than 28 m(3)/s, implying wetland hydrology. The results of this analysis can be used to inform operational management of the Reelfoot Lake spillway.

TI  - Predictors of homeless service utilization and stable housing status among Veterans receiving services from a nationwide homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing program
T2  - EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Homelessness prevention and rapid rehousing (RRH) programs are increasingly important components of the homeless assistance system in the United States. Yet, there are key gaps in knowledge about the dynamics of the utilization of these programs, with scant attention paid to examining the duration of homelessness prevention and RRH service episodes or to patterns of repeated use of these programs over time. To address these gaps, we use data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF) program-the largest program in the country providing homelessness prevention and RRH services-to assess the relationship between individual and program-level factors and exits to stable housing, length of service episodes, and patterns of repeated service use over time. We analyze data for a primary cohort of 570,798 of Veterans who received SSVF services during Fiscal Years (FY) 2012-2021, and for separate cohorts of Veterans who received SSVF prevention and RRH services, respectively, during FY 2016-2021. We find that participants' income, indicators of their health status, their use of other VA homeless programs, and rurality are consistent predictors of our outcomes. These findings have implications for how to allocate homelessness prevention and RRH resources in the most efficient manner to help households maintain or obtain stable housing.

TI  - The extent of agreement between frozen and paraffin block data from axillary samples in patients with early-stage breast cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Patients with early-stage breast cancer currently undergo sentinel lymph node dissection to evaluate the axillary region. Frozen tissue blocks are evaluated intra operatively and paraffin-embedded samples are studied postoperatively. We explored whether sentinel lymph node dissection adequately reflected axillary involvement (as revealed by the paraffin blocks) in patients with early-stage breast cancer; we sought to avoid axillary dissection.Methods: The agreement/non-agreement rates between the results of axillary ultrasonography and biopsy, sentinel lymph node and axillary dissections, and frozen and paraffin block results, were retrospectively analyzed for 200 patients with early-stage breast cancer. The positive predictive values and accuracies were recorded in those who were positive on both ultrasonography and biopsy. The negative predictive values were calculated for doubly negative cases. Results: The frozen and paraffin block results disagreed in 19 (9.5 %) cases and agreed in 181 (90.5 %). The frozen block and dissection results differed in five of 38 patients who underwent axillary dissection (AD) (one patient did not undergo AD); the results were in agreement in 32. Of the 19 block-disagreement cases, 16 were in the non-neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) group and three in the NAC treatment group. Clinically, the negative predictive values of the frozen and paraffin block data were 80 % in patients lacking axillary involvement.Conclusion: Paraffin block evaluations only (thus, without frozen block examinations) of early-stage breast cancer lymph nodes seem to be sufficient to guide treatment. Also, a thorough clinical examination (with ultrasonog-raphy and axillary biopsy) reduces the dissection rate and the associated functional impairments.

AB  - Accurate prediction of future Land Use/Cover Change (LULCC) and its impact on ecosystem carbon storage is of great scientific significance for regional land use decision making and carbon management. However, there are few previous studies that combine spatial and temporal scales to explore the impact of future land use changes on ecosystem carbon storage in coastal zones at the provincial scale. Taking the coastal zone of Hainan Island as an example, Landsat TM (OLI) data from 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used as the main data sources to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of land use from 1990 to 2020. The GeoSOS-FLUS model was used to predict land use patterns under baseline, development priority and ecological priority scenarios in 2030. Based on land use data, ArcGIS and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) models were used to evaluate the carbon storage of ecosystems from 1990 to 2030, to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of LULCC and response of the LULCC to carbon storage, and to reveal the process and mechanism of the impact of the complex land use change process on the carbon sink service function of regional ecosystems in tropical and subtropical coastal zones. The results showed that: 1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of cropland, forest land, grassland and unused land decreased, while the area of water and built-up land increased. Unused land and cropland area continues to decrease, built-up land continues to increase. 2) LULCC has led to a continuous decrease in regional carbon storage over 30 years, reaching 1.5 x 106 t, with an annual change rate of 5.0 x 104 t/a. The extensive expansion of built-up land and the degradation of forest land are significant reasons for the decrease in carbon density, and "unused land-*grassland" is the most obvious reason in the carbon storage increase. "Grassland-*forest land (artificial)" is the most significant mapping reason in the decrease of carbon storage. The spatial and temporal characteristics of regional carbon storage showed a significant positive correlation with the region, and the wetland and mangrove areas in the southwest and northeast directions were the high-high concentration areas of carbon storage. 3) The built-up land in 2020-2030 shows different degrees of expansion in the baseline, development priority and ecological priority scenarios, with an increase of 1.94%, 2.13% and 0.70% respectively, and the development priority scenario has the largest increase. The cropland showed a shrinking trend in 3 simulated scenarios, and the area decreased by 0.87%, 0.97% and 0.87%, respectively. 4) The regional carbon storage in 2020-2030 decreases significantly under the baseline and development priority scenarios, at 1.29 x 105 t and 2.45 x 105 t respectively, while it increases significantly under the ecological priority scenario, at 1.34 x 105 t. The ecological priority scenario can effectively enhance the carbon sink capacity and control the reduction of cropland area. Optimizing the land use structure, controlling the growth rate of built-up land and increasing the area of forest land can have a positive effect on the development and use of coastal zone space and the carbon cycle.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been carried out to examine the trends in the rapidly changing aerosol loading through the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) but very few investigations have acknowledged its long-term implications through the combined optical, physical, and morphological properties of the aerosols. Using a multivariate linear regression trend analysis model on nearly two decades (i.e., 2001-2020) of multi-source global datasets, we tried to relate the contribution of each of the varying aerosol properties such as scattering, absorption, size, and shape, to the changing total AOD trends of that sensor. Region-wise analysis has shown that the decrease (increase) in the total AOD trends observed over North-Eastern America, South America, Europe, North-Western Africa, and Eastern and Central China (Indian) regions are mainly in connection with the decrease (increase) in the finemode and scattering aerosols. However, the major increase over the South African region is from the increase in absorbing and scattering aerosols. Interestingly, the Indo-Gangetic Plain region of India, where high total AOD trends are observed, has seen a plausible slight decrease in its absorbing, non-spherical, and coarse-mode aerosols in recent years. This study also details the region-wise response accompanying the implementation of stringent mitigation strategies to ensure accurate quantification of the changing aerosol patterns in the atmosphere.

TI  - Quantification and evaluation of atmospheric emissions from crop residue burning constrained by satellite observations in China during 2016-2020
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In rural regions of China, crop residue burning (CRB) is the major biomass burning activity, which can result in massive emissions of atmospheric particulate, greenhouse gas, and trace gas pollutants. Based on Himawari-8 satellite fire radiative power and agricultural statistics data, we implemented a daily inventory of agricultural fire emissions in 2016-2020 with a 2-km spatial resolution, including atmospheric pollutants such as CO2, CH4, CO, N2O, NOX, NH3, SO2, PM10, PM2.5, Hg, OC, EC, and NMVOCs. Our inventory constrained by geostationary satellite monitoring is more consistent with the actual CRB emissions in China, as many flaring events occur surreptitiously in the early morning and late evening to avoid regulation, which may be overlooked by polar-orbiting satellites. The spatiotemporal characterizations of various CRB emissions are found to be consistent with multiple satellite trace gas retrievals. We also assessed the effectiveness of field burning bans in China. Combined with other relevant datasets, it was found that although China has been advocating for a long time not to burn straw in the open field, CRB emissions was not successfully controlled nationwide until 2016. We estimated that the cumulative reduction of CO2 CRB emissions alone amounts to 809 +/- 651 (2 sigma) teragram (Tg) during the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), with an average value equivalent to 1.2 times the total annual territorial CO2 emissions by fossil fuels from Germany in 2021 (675 Tg, ranked 1st in EU27 and 7th in the world). Our inventory also suggests that continuous, long-term controls are necessary. Otherwise, CRB emissions may only be delayed on a seasonal scale, rather than reduced.

TI  - The impact of land degradation on agricultural profits and implications for poverty reduction in Central Asia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land degradation is a major challenge to sustainable development and poverty reduction across the world. This paper estimates the contribution of land degradation to the losses in agricultural profits in the four countries in Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. We used a production function approach to relate multiple factors including land quality to farmers' profits; we evaluated the latter by combining hitherto unique nationally representative agricultural household surveys with remotely sensed data on land degradation hotspots. The findings show that land degradation that had occurred over the previous three decades reduced net farming profits among agricultural households by 4.8 times during the 2009-2010 cropping season compared with the case without land degradation. Land degradation reduced net agricultural profits of all categories of agricultural households in the region, both poor and rich. At the same time, contrary to widespread beliefs that poor agricultural households cannot cope with land degradation due to limited access to resources, the results also showed that the poor households applied more sustainable land management practices than the richer agricultural households. This is because they had a stronger dependence on land for their livelihoods; hence, had a stronger incentive to sustainably manage it. These findings mean that poverty does not need to inexorably lead to land degradation and to subsequent vicious cycles exacerbating poverty. At the same time, increasing poor farmers' wealth by sustainable land management alone may be challenging, requiring additional accompanying policies to address structural and institutional reasons for poverty.

TI  - Time series analysis and impact assessment of the temperature changes on the vegetation and the water availability: A case study of Bakun-Murum Catchment Region in Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bakun-Murum (BM) catchment region of the Rajang River Basin (RRB), Sarawak, Malaysia, has been under severe threat for the last few years due to urbanization, global warming, and cli-mate change. The present study aimed to evaluate the time series analysis and impact assessment of the temperature changes on the vegetation/agricultural lands and the water availability within the BM region. For this purpose, the Landsat data for the past thirty years (1990-2020) were used. Remote sensing techniques for estimating the surface temperatures and variation within the vegetation and water bodies were utilized, and validation was done using on-ground weather sta-tions. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and other RS & GIS tools were used for analyzing the time series trends of land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI). The results exposed an overall rise of 1.06 degrees C in the annual mean temperatures over the last thirty years. A maximum annual mean NDVI of 0.48 was recorded for 2018 and 2019. The lowest annual mean NDVI (0.27) was observed in 2005. The an-nual mean NDWI increased to 0.48 in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The statistical correlation re-sults revealed the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.09 and 0.13 for the annual mean LST and annual mean NDVI and the annual mean LST and annual mean NDWI, respectively. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall trend test for the annual mean temperature series indicates a slightly increas-ing trend with Sen's slope of 0.03 degrees C/year. It is found that there is a positive trend in the annual mean rainfall patterns, as Sen's slope indicates a yearly increase of 50.58 mm/year. This study found significant changes in the LST, NDVI, and NDWI of the BM catchment region during the last thirty years, demanding the concerned authorities' instant attention to alleviate the adverse ef-fects of such changes to protect the ecosystem.

TI  - Setting a quality indicator for actual surgery time relative to scheduled surgery time in the context of increasing robotic-assisted thoracic surgery cases
T2  - GENERAL THORACIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to demonstrate to the involved departments the goal of increasing the number of robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) cases/surgeons and acceptable surgery times. MethodsThis retrospective study included 1572 patients who underwent thoracic surgery from fiscal year (FY) 2018 to FY 2021. The factors evaluated included the number of surgery cases and actual and scheduled surgery times. ResultsThe total number of RATS and total surgery cases increased after the quality indicator (QI) setting (n = 363, 360, 417, and 432 in FY 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively). In FY 2020, 93.3% of the QI target was achieved, while in FY 2021, 88% was achieved. The number of RATS lobectomy/segmentectomy increased as the FY progressed (n = 31, 47, 58, and 116 in FY 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively). The mean surgical time by RATS starters decreased in FY 2020 and 2021 (171.4 min.; 74 cases; seven RATS starters) compared with those in FY 2018 and 2019 (198.0 min.; 57 cases; six RATS starters) (P = 0.002). ConclusionsThe goal of increasing the number of surgery cases and RATS cases/surgeons within the given framework was achieved by setting the QI.

TI  - AI-based runoff simulation based on remote sensing observations: A case study of two river basins in the United States and Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven techniques are used extensively for hydrologic time-series prediction. We created various data-driven models (DDMs) based on machine learning: long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector regression (SVR), extreme learning machines, and an artificial neural network with backpropagation, to define the optimal approach to predicting streamflow time series in the Carson River (California, USA) and Montmorency (Canada) catchments. The moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow-coverage dataset was applied to improve the streamflow estimate. In addition to the DDMs, the conceptual snowmelt runoff model was applied to simulate and forecast daily streamflow. The four main predictor variables, namely snow-coverage (S-C), precipitation (P), maximum temperature (T-max), and minimum temperature (T-min), and their corresponding values for each river basin, were obtained from National Climatic Data Center and National Snow and Ice Data Center to develop the model. The most relevant predictor variable was chosen using the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination feature selection approach. The results show that incorporating the MODIS snow-coverage dataset improves the models' prediction accuracies in the snowmelt-dominated basin. SVR and LSTM exhibited the best performances (root mean square error = 8.63 and 9.80) using monthly and daily snowmelt time series, respectively. In summary, machine learning is a reliable method to forecast runoff as it can be employed in global climate forecasts that require high-volume data processing.

T2  - SPORTS BIOMECHANICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The aim of this research was to determine the association between dry-land exercises and the start kinetics in elite swimmers. Fourteen swimmers (eight males and six females) included in a national team took part in this study. A fixed smith-machine was used to measure the maximal full squat strength (Smax). The height of squat (SJ) and countermovement (CMJ) jumps were collected with a contact mat. The ground reaction force of the kick starts in the three-dimensional axis (Fz horizontal; Fy, vertical; Fx, lateral) was obtained by an instrumented force plate in the starting block. Overall, the Smax showed a high and significant association with Fz (r = 0.60) and Fy (r = 0.87). Moderate and significant associations were found between Fy and SJ (r = 0.51) and CMJ (r = 0.57). While Smax in males showed high association with Fy (r = 0.77), the Smax for females showed greater association with Fz (r = 0.84). As conclusion, the full back squat seems to be the dry-land exercise with higher association with the kick start kinetics. While in males the full squat defines better the vertical component, for females it defines the horizontal one.

T2  - HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the use of high-resolution land cover maps is increasing, securing a reasonable level of accuracy in order to preserve detailed land cover information remains a challenge. This study optimized a deep learning model to automatically classify 41 land cover classes with remote sensing data. D-LinkNet, a semantic segmentation network, was selected as an automated extraction method to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of the sub-divided (or level 3) land cover classification. In this study, aerial ortho-photos and level 3 land cover maps were used to train the model and validate the data using model training accuracy. D-LinkNet was applied by utilizing ResNet-34 backbone to classify the 41 semantic classes. The mean intersection over union (mIoU) was used to evaluate the accuracy, the result of which was 22.81%. To improve accuracy, the learning datasets were refined and reclassified from 41 into 28 classes. The model was then improved by exchanging the encoder with ResNet-101 and hyperparameter modifications. The results show that mIoU was improved to 51.24% and 30.1% for the training and test, respectively.

TI  - Leveraging machine learning and remote sensing to monitor long-term spatial-temporal wetland changes: Towards a national RAMSAR inventory in Pakistan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Pakistan, wetlands are of primary focus as they withstand the effects of floods, recharge groundwater, and provide several services in the context of economic, cultural, and climate mitigation aspects. However, the lack of field data and huge monitoring costs hinder their sustainable management in Pakistan. In connection with this, the current study leverages Google Earth Engine (GEE), earth observation data, and machine learning-based Random Forest (RF) algorithm to evaluate spatial-temporal heterogeneities in wetlands in Pakistan between 1990 and 2020. Additionally, the first high-resolution long-term inventory of wetlands in Pakistan is presented to provide a baseline. Our results ascertain an increase in wetlands areas over the last 30 years. The swamps' area increased from 1391.19 km(2) in 1990 to 8510.43 km(2) in 2020 (2.62% annual change rate). Similarly, the marshes area increased between 1990 and 2020 with a similar to 1.04% annual change rate. Conversely, the water area decreased from 8371.97 km(2) in 1990 to 7818.34 km(2) in 2020. The increase in wetlands could be associated with good conservation and planting practices in Pakistan. While these results provide important insights to implement conservation practices in the context of wetland sustainability, the resultant data is essential to the national wetlands inventory database for future evaluations.

TI  - Triple mapping for axillary staging after neoadjuvant therapy: Axillary reverse mapping with indocyanine green and dual agent sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary staging is 1 of the major issues of current breast cancer management after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST). Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an option for clinically node negative patients. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was introduced to identify and preserve the lymphatic drainage from the arm. The aim of the presented study is to employ triple mapping (radiocolloid, blue dye and indocyanine green [ICG]) to assess the crossover rate and metastatic involvement of ARM nodes after NST. Clinically node positive patients before NST who were converted to N0 and scheduled for targeted axillary dissection were included. sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was performed via dual agent mapping. ICG was used for ARM procedure. Blue, hot and fluorescent nodes and lymphatics were visualized in the axilla using infrared camera system and dual opto-nuclear probe (Euoroprobe3). Fifty-two patients underwent targeted axillary dissection and ARM procedures 12 out of whom had axillary node dissection. 45 of the 52 patients had at least 1 hot or blue SLN identified intraoperatively. Of these, 61.5% cases had hot SLNs, 42.3% had hot and blue, 15.4% had hot/blue/fluorescent, 7.7% had blue/fluorescent, 6 11.5% had hot/fluorescent and 7 13.5% had only clipped nodes. The overall identification rate of ARM-nodes by means of ICG technique was 86.5%. Overall crossover of ARM nodes with SLNs was determined in 36.5%. The ICG intensity was found to be higher in both hot and blue SLNS (8 out of 18 ICG positive cases, 44.4%). In 3 of 52 patients (5.7%) metastatic SLNs were hot or blue but fluorescent which predicts metastatic involvement of the ARM-nodes. More than 1-third of the patients revealed a crossover between arm and breast draining nodes. The higher observed rate of overlap might partially explain why more patients develop clinically significant lymphedema after NST even after sentinel lymph node biopsy alone. The triple mapping provides valuable data regarding the competency of lymphatic drainage and would have the potential to serve selecting patients for lymphovenous by-pass procedures at the index procedure. NST reduces the metastatic involvement of the ARM nodes. However, conservative axillary staging with sparing ARM nodes after NST necessitates further studies with larger sample size and longer follow-up.

Although the area of seagrass beds is declining in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of Vietnam, no study has compared the changes in the area of seagrass beds among MPAs using remote sensing technology and GIS for mapping temporal and spatial changes. This is the first study assessing the ecological characteristics of seagrass beds in Ly Son, Nha Trang and Phu Quoc MPAs. In this study, we characterized the current status and historical changes of seagrass beds in three MPAs between 2001 and 2018, but Ly Son MPA between 2001 and 2019. Field surveys, historical satellite remote sensing data and GIS technology were applied to interpret Landsat images and evaluate the relationship between the cover of terrestrial vegetation and seagrass bed ecosystems. The results indicated that the average coverage and shoot density were highest in Phu Quoc MPA (92.5 +/- 6.6%, 6635 +/- 5,111 shoot m-2, respectively), while the total dry biomass was dominant in Ly Son MPA with 2000.3 +/- 949.8 g DW m-2. The Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies of the years 2001 and 2018 (2019) were generally higher than 87% and 0.83, respectively. Between 2001-2018 (2019), the loss of seagrass area was 307.3 ha in Ly Son MPA, 268.4 ha in Nha Trang MPA and 13,225.6 ha in Phu Quoc MPA. Besides the decline in seagrass area, the artificial land covers witnessed a significant increase during the study period. Thus, this study could contribute to basic information for the conservation and management of seagrass resources in MPA.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of fluctuations in vegetation dynamic over Africa using satellite data of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Africa, vegetation is important for the protection of species habitats, maintaining local livelihoods, and the existence of wildlife. A comprehensive evaluation of vegetation dynamics using solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) is needed to acquire important information to understand the current situation of how ecosystems react to human activities and climate change, as well as for conservation planning. The research's purpose was to detect vegetation dynamics in Africa from 2000 to 2017 using global, OCO-2-based SIF (GOSIF) and various datasets, as well as to analyze the factors influencing vegetation changes. The main findings revealed that: (1) The patterns for various vegetation in this study showed that forests experienced more vegetation expansions than croplands, grasslands, shrubland, and sparse vegetation, based on the Land Use Cover Change (LUCC) per vegetation type. (2) According to SIF, the decreasing area accounts for 29.4% of the total vegetation region while expanding area accounts for 70.6%. (3) The Hurst exponent summary exhibited that the majority of studied vegetation variations are consistent and accounted for 79.7%. (4) Based on the residual, we discovered that climatic patterns might be responsible for the greening trend of sparse vegetation and grassland. (5) The Boosted Regression Trees (BRT) showed that during the study period, Vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and the temperature had a greater impact on SIF vegetation dynamics than other factors. Our findings can aid in the development of appropriate vegetation management concepts or strategies to help in vegetation restoration in Africa.

TI  - Survey of malaria vectors on the Cambodia, Thailand and China-Laos Borders
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Anopheles maculatus, Anopheles minimus and Anopheles dirus are the major vectors of malaria transmission in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS). The malaria burden in this region has decreased significantly in recent years as all GMS countries progress towards malaria elimination. It is necessary to investigate the Anopheles diversity and abundance status and assess the Plasmodium infection rates to understand the malaria transmission potential of these vector species in GMS countries to guide the development of up-to-date vector control strategies and interventions. Methods: A survey of mosquitoes was conducted in Stung Treng, Sainyabuli and Phongsaly Provinces on the Cambodia-Laos, Thailand-Laos and China-Laos borders, respectively. Mosquito collection was done by overnight trapping at sentinel sites in each province. After morphological identification, the 18S rRNA-based nested-PCR was performed to detect malaria parasites in the captured Anopheles mosquitoes. Results: A total of 18 965 mosquitoes comprising of 35 species of 2 subgenera (Subgenus Anopheles and Subgenus Cellia) and 4 tribes (Tribes Culicini, Aedini, Armigerini and Mansoniini) were captured. Tribe Culicini accounted for 85.66% of captures, followed by Subgenus Anopheles (8.15%). Anopheles sinensis dominated the Subgenus Anopheles by 99.81%. Plasmodium-infection was found in 25 out of the 1 683 individual or pooled samples of Anopheles. Among the 25 positive samples, 19, 5 and 1 were collected from Loum, Pangkhom and Siem Pang village, respectively. Eight Anopheles species were found infected with Plasmodium, i.e., An. sinensis, Anopheles kochi, Anopheles vagus, An. minimus, Anopheles annularis, Anopheles philippinensis, Anopheles tessellatus and An. dirus. The infection rates of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax and mixture of Plasmodium parasite species were 0.12% (2/1 683), 1.31% (22/1 683) and 0.06% (1/1 683), respectively. Conclusions: Overall, this survey re-confirmed that multiple Anopheles species carry malaria parasites in the international border areas of the GMS countries. Anopheles sinensis dominated the Anopheles collections and as carriers of malaria parasites, therefore may play a significant role in malaria transmission. More extensive investigations of malaria vectors are required to reveal the detailed vector biology, ecology, behaviour, and genetics in GMS regions in order to assist with the planning and implementation of improved malaria control strategies.

TI  - Monitoring threatened species with environmental DNA and open ecological data: Local distribution and habitat preferences of scalloped hammerhead sharks<i> (Sphyrna</i><i> lewini)</i>
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence-based environmental management is urgently required to enable progress towards global conservation commitments. To fill large-scale biodiversity knowledge gaps, governments, organisations and communities must adopt innovative ecological monitoring techniques. The emergence of environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods, as well as the increased availability of in situ ocean observation and satellite remote sensing data, offers opportunities to overcome significant logistic and financial challenges previously associated with traditional biodiversity monitoring. Here, a 1.5 year-long eDNA survey reveals the spatial and temporal presence of 'criti-cally endangered' scalloped hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) in Apra Harbor, Guam. The survey confirms the presence of S. lewini in the region, and shows eDNA detections are most frequent at the beginning of the dry season, in January. Combined analysis of eDNA results with open (freely available) ecological data identifies that S. lewini presence is associated with increases in water velocity, turbidity and wind direction, as well as decreases in temperature and wind speed. Additionally, the data indicate S. lewini are most frequent at sampling sites characterised by high turbidity, shallow depths, and large distances from the harbor entrance. Information on local distribution and habitat preferences generated here is fundamental to the establishment of management protocols that aim to minimise negative anthropogenic impacts on S. lewini in Apra Harbor. The work provides an example of contemporary marine monitoring for the efficient generation of biodiversity data; an approach that will enable informed management decisions and help to reduce the risk and rate of species extinctions throughout the next decade.

TI  - Towards a whole-system framework for wildfire monitoring using Earth observations
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire seasons have become increasingly variable and extreme due to changing climatological, ecological, and social conditions. Earth observation data are critical for monitoring fires and their impacts. Herein, we present a whole-system framework for identifying and synthesizing fire monitoring objectives and data needs throughout the life cycle of a fire event. The four stages of fire monitoring using Earth observation data include the following: (1) pre-fire vegetation inventories, (2) active-fire monitoring, (3) post-fire assessment, and (4) multi-scale synthesis. We identify the challenges and opportunities associated with current approaches to fire monitoring, highlighting four case studies from North American boreal, montane, and grassland ecosystems. While the case studies are localized to these ecosystems and regional contexts, they provide insights for others experiencing similar monitoring challenges worldwide. The field of remote sensing is experiencing a rapid proliferation of new data sources, providing observations that can inform all aspects of our fire monitoring framework; however, significant challenges for meeting fire monitoring objectives remain. We identify future opportunities for data sharing and rapid co-development of information products using cloud computing that benefits from open-access Earth observation and other geospatial data layers.

TI  - Nutritional monitoring of boron in Eucalyptus spp. in the Brazilian cerrado by multispectral bands of the MSI sensor (Sentinel-2)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - B deficiency is one of the most limiting factors for the growth of Eucalyptus spp. in Brazil, especially in the cerrado region, where there is the greatest expansion of forest production of the species. Based on multi or hyperspectral sensors and digital image processing techniques, the application in diagnosis is fast, nondestructive and local in applications with plants. Our hypothesis is that the use of orbital sensors through the spectral bands is sensitive in the diagnosis of B deficiency or toxicity in adult Eucalyptus spp. in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The main objective of this study was to discriminate the adequate levels and boron deficiency from the supervised classification with the SAM algorithm in an area with Eucalyptus spp plantation. and to verify the performance of vegetation indices in distinguishing micronutrient. The experiment was carried out at Brejo Seco Farm in the rural zone of Baixa Grande do Ribeiro municipality (Cerrado biome) in Piaui State, Brazil. Eucalyptus clones MA-2000 (from controlled pollination between Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus tereticornis) trees that were ten years old were considered. This clone is adapted to the edaphic conditions of the region. The planting occurred without amendments or fertilizers, according to a 3 m x 3 m spacing with a density of approximately 1111 plants hectare(- 1). The orbital images used were those of the MSI/Sentinel-2 System/sensor with Level-1C, processed with values of reflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Deficiency classifications were then performed using the spectral angle mapping (SAM) algorithm , the vegetation indices NDVI, NDRE, EVI, CI, PRSI, CCCI, MTCI and HMSSI. Subsequently, a multi-variate analysis of canonical variables was performed to verify the interrelationship between boron levels and each group of variables evaluated in the experiment. From these results, it is possible to discriminate levels of deficient and adequate boron in juvenile Eucalyptus spp. based on the wavelengths of the MSI/Sentinel-2 sensor system. Vegetation indices can be used to monitor boron levels, with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) being the most efficient in discriminating adequate boron levels in Eucalyptus spp. plants.

TI  - A general deep learning based framework for 3D reconstruction from multi-view stereo satellite images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a general deep learning based framework, named Sat-MVSF, to perform threedimensional (3D) reconstruction of the Earth's surface from multi-view optical satellite images. The framework is a complete processing pipeline, including pre-processing, a multi-view stereo (MVS) network for satellite imagery (Sat-MVSNet), and post-processing. The pre-processing handles the geometric and radiometric configuration of the multi-view images and their cropping. The cropped multi-view patches are then fed into SatMVSNet, which includes deep feature extraction, rational polynomial camera (RPC) warping, pyramid cost volume construction, regularization, and regression, to obtain the height maps. The error matches are then filtered out and a digital surface model (DSM) is generated in the post-processing. Considering the complexity and diversity of real-world scenes, we also introduce a self-refinement strategy that does not require any groundtruth labels to enhance the performance and robustness of the Sat-MVSF framework. We comprehensively compare the proposed framework with popular commercial software and open-source methods, to demonstrate the potential of the proposed deep learning framework. On the WHU-TLC dataset, where the images are captured with a three-line camera (TLC), the proposed framework outperforms all the other solutions in terms of reconstruction fineness, and also outperforms most of the other methods in terms of efficiency. On the challenging MVS3D dataset, where the images are captured by the WorldView-3 satellite at different times and seasons, the proposed framework also exceeds the existing methods when using the model pretrained on aerial images and the introduced self-refinement strategy, demonstrating a high generalization ability. We also note that the lack of training samples hinders research in this field, and the availability of more high-quality open-source training data will greatly accelerate the research into deep learning based MVS satellite image reconstruction. The code will be available at https://gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data.

TI  - Precision laparoscopic sentinel node navigation surgery for femoral skin cancer
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Navigation surgery using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging has been used in thoracoabdominal surgery, and its usefulness has been reported in many cases. In this study, laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection was performed using ICG fluorescence imaging in a patient with left femoral spinous cell carcinoma with inguinal and external iliac lymph node metastases. Spinous cell carcinoma is classified as a rare cancer in Japan, and there is a scarcity of evidence for pelvic lymph node dissection, as well as a lack of studies that mention the dissection area. We hypothesized that visualization of lymph nodes and lymph flow using intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging would indicate the area of dissection and lead to more efficient dissection. In conclusion, intraoperative ICG fluorescence imaging may be useful in this area where there is limited evidence, although there are some limitations.

TI  - Parking space inventory from above: Detection on aerial images and estimation for unobserved regions
T2  - IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Parking is a vital component of today's transportation system and descriptive data are therefore of great importance for urban planning and traffic management. However, data quality is often low: managed parking places may only be partially inventoried, or parking at the curbside and on private ground may be missing. This paper presents a processing chain in which remote sensing data and statistical methods are combined to provide parking area estimates. First, parking spaces and other traffic areas are detected from aerial imagery using a convolutional neural network. Individual image segmentations are fused to increase completeness. Next, a Gamma hurdle model is estimated using the detected parking areas and OpenStreetMap and land use data to predict the parking area adjacent to streets. A systematic relationship is found between the road length and type and the parking area obtained. It is suggested that these results are informative to those needing information on parking in structurally similar regions.

TI  - Characterizing nutritional phenotypes using experimental nutrigenomics: Is there nutrient-specificity to different types of dietary stress?
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to directly measure and monitor poor nutrition in individual animals and ecological communities is hampered by methodological limitations. In this study, we use nutrigenomics to identify nutritional biomarkers in a freshwater zooplankter, Daphnia pulex, a ubiquitous primary consumer in lakes and a sentinel of environmental change. We grew animals in six ecologically relevant nutritional treatments: nutrient replete, low carbon (food), low phosphorus, low nitrogen, low calcium and high Cyanobacteria. We extracted RNA for transcriptome sequencing to identify genes that were nutrient responsive and capable of predicting nutritional status with a high degree of accuracy. We selected a list of 125 candidate genes, which were subsequently pruned to 13 predictive potential biomarkers. Using a nearest-neighbour classification algorithm, we demonstrate that these potential biomarkers are capable of classifying our samples into the correct nutritional group with 100% accuracy. The functional annotation of the selected biomarkers revealed some specific nutritional pathways and supported our hypothesis that animal responses to poor nutrition are nutrient specific and not simply different presentations of slow growth or energy limitation. This is a key step in uncovering the causes and consequences of nutritional limitation in animal consumers and their responses to small- and large-scale changes in biogeochemical cycles.

TI  - Integrated biomarker responses and metal contamination survey in the wedge clam <i>Donax trunculus</i> from the Atlantic coast of Morocco
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In Morocco, the marine environment has always been a major occupation for socioeconomic activities (industry, tourism, urbanization, etc.). Thus, this work displays a case study of Taghazout coast in the central Atlantic part of the country, which becomes the center of several development projects, such as the touristic resort Taghazout Bay. In the aim to assess the health status of this coastal ecosystem, a multi-indicator approach based on the response of biomarkers in the wedge clam Donax trunculus was adopted during two years (2016/2017). The undertaken investigations on the response of biomarkers (AChE, GST, MDA, and CAT) in the sentinel species D. trunculus showed an activation of defense mechanisms in this bivalve, which would imply exposure to chemical stress in this ecosystem. The monitoring of seasonal bioaccumulation of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and copper (Cu) by D. trunculus indicates that the bivalves collected have been exposed to these metal sources in the study area. In addition, the correlation study has reported a significant effect of environmental parameters on biomarker response. Overall, the multi-indicator approach has clearly revealed the health status of Taghazout coast registered in a coastal urbanization.

TI  - Land subsidence prediction model based on its influencing factors and machine learning methods
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land subsidence has caused huge economic losses in the Beijing plains (BP) since 1980s. Building land subsidence prediction models that can predict the development of land subsidence is of great significance for improving the safety of cities and reducing economic losses in Eastern Beijing plains. The pattern of evolution of land subsidence is affected by many factors including groundwater level in different aquifers, thicknesses of compressible layers, and static and dynamic loads caused by urban construction. First, we used the small baseline subset Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology on 47 ENVISAT ASAR images and 48 RADARSAT-2 images and used Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Aperture Radar (PS-InSAR) technology on 27 Sentinel-1 images to obtain the land subsidence monitoring results from June 2003 to September 2018. Second, the accuracy of the InSAR monitoring results was validated by using leveling benchmark land subsidence monitoring results. Finally, we built land subsidence rate prediction models and land subsidence gradient prediction models by combining land subsidence influencing factors and four machine learning methods including support vector machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Random forest (RF) and Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT). The findings show: (1) The InSAR monitoring results revealed that the Beijing Plain has experienced serious land subsidence during the 2003-2010, 2011-2015 and 2016-2018 periods. (2): The InSAR monitoring results agreed well with the leveling benchmark monitoring results with the Pearson correlation coefficients of two monitoring results were all greater than 0.95 during the 2003-2010, 2011-2015 and 2016-2018 periods, respectively. (3): We found that the land subsidence prediction based on ERT method is the optimal model among four land subsidence prediction models and that the prediction performance of land subsidence prediction model based on ERT method will be greatly improved when apply this prediction model in sub study areas where the land subsidence mechanism is similar owning to the similar hydrogeological parameters.

TI  - Between Neighbors and Strangers: Representations of the Indigenous People of America and Construction of Jewish Identity in Early Modern Western Europe
T2  - JEWISH HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a time when theological and scientific concepts of the New World were molded, European Jews, like their fellow Christians, were exposed to increasing knowledge about the discoveries in the western hemisphere and endeavored to understand and integrate it into their worldview. As Europe's former Others for centuries, the Jews now had to define their attitudes towards Europe's new Others, the indigenous people of America. To portray a long-range and wide historical process, this article discusses different works by early modern Jewish authors from the sixteenth century through the middle of the seventeenth century. The paper examines the ethnographical aspect of works by Abraham Farissol, Yosef ha-Kohen, and Menasseh ben Israel, along with several other texts, and illustrates the process of knowledge acquisition and construction of new perceptions regarding the conquest of America and its people. The study indicates that these authors held different attitudes towards the colonial project, the conquerors, and the indigenous people, identifying with the European conquerors, but at times criticizing the colonialists, especially their attitude and behavior towards the indigenous people. The analysis of the differing attitudes of Jewish authors, reveals three central models of perceptions regarding native Americans and Christian Europeans: the dichotomous model of Abraham Farissol, the triangular model of Yosef Ha-Kohen, and the multifaceted model of Menasseh ben Israel. Each of these authors identified their own group, primarily as White Europeans, different from the uncivilized natives. Nevertheless, the representations of the stranger-the Others of Europe, the indigenes-became variable, complex and, at times, authors even identified with the conquered and forged an imagined alliance against Europeans. While describing the conquest of America and its indigenous people, Jewish authors were defining the boundaries of their own unique identity vis-a-vis these different Others and constructing their self-perception as Western European in the early modern period.

TI  - Underground mine deformation monitoring using Synthetic Aperture Radar technique: A case study of Rajgamar coal mine of Korba Chhattisgarh, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coal mines are the major source of energy in industries and are important indicators of the economic growth of a country. Excessive withdrawal of coal from underground coal mines without stowing leads to surface defor-mation. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar Technology has been used to identify the surface deformation in the Korba Coal Mines of India. Korba coal mines are major coal-producing mines in India that come under South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL). It covers three underground mines. Depillaring has been done through the caving method, which may lead to the deformation of the area and its surroundings. Deformation may have devastating consequences if overlooked. So, it requires continuous monitoring of the area. Space-based SAR interferometry is the most preferred technique to monitor any mining area over a period of time. In this tech-nique, known as the DInSAR technique, a deformation map can be generated from images of the same area acquired over different points of time. In the present study, images of the month of February of the years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019 have been successfully utilized for DInSAR analysis over the Rajgamar area. The Inter-ferogram allows analysis of an entire mine site including pits and their surrounding area. High precision monitoring over wide coverage enables to bring out accurate deformation results due to the presence of coherent targets and monitoring risk across the study area. Maps generated from data were scrutinized and interpreted. Consequentially, 2015-2016 shows greater deformation than the other two corresponding maps generated 2015-2017 and 2015-2019 data. Results were validated through ground observations. Overall the area of the Rajgamar coal mine is getting deformed at a slow rate.

TI  - Adjuvant Radiotherapy in Stage II Endometrial Cancer: Selective De-intensification of Adjuvant Treatment
T2  - CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: Risk stratification, including nodal assessment, allows for selective de-intensification of adjuvant radiotherapy in stage II endometrial cancer. Patterns of treatment and clinical outcomes, including the use of reduced volume 'mini-pelvis' radiotherapy fields, were evaluated in a population-based study.Materials and methods: All patients diagnosed with pathological stage II endometrial cancer between 2000 and 2014, and received adjuvant radiotherapy in a regional healthcare jurisdiction were reviewed. Registry data were supplemented by a comprehensive review of patient demographics, disease characteristics and treatment details. The Charlson Comorbidity Score was calculated. Survival and recurrence data were analysed.Results: In total, 264 patients met the inclusion criteria. Most patients had endometrioid histology (83%); 41% of patients had International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians grade 1 disease. Half (49%) had surgical nodal evaluation; 11% received chemotherapy. Most patients (59%) were treated with full pelvic radiotherapy fields +/- brachytherapy. Seventeen per cent of patients received mini-pelvis radiotherapy +/- brachytherapy, whereas 24% received brachytherapy alone. Five-year recurrence-free survival was 87% for the entire cohort, with no significant difference by adjuvant radiotherapy approach. Only one patient receiving mini-pelvis radiotherapy +/- brachytherapy recurred in the pelvis but outside of the mini-pelvis field. Recorded late toxicity rates were highest for full pelvis radiotherapy + brachytherapy.Conclusion: Risk stratification in a real-world setting allowed for selective de-intensification of adjuvant radiation with equivalent outcomes for stage II endometrial cancer. Mini-pelvis radiotherapy combined with brachytherapy is effective in highly selected patients, with the potential to decrease toxicity without compromising local control. Brachytherapy should be considered in low-risk stage II patients. (C) 2022 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wastewater-based epidemiology for preventing outbreaks and epidemics in Latin America - Lessons from the past and a look to the future
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is an approach with the potential to complement clinical surveillance systems. Using WBE, it is possible to carry out an early warning of a possible outbreak, monitor spatial and temporal trends of infectious diseases, produce real-time results and generate representative epidemiological information in a territory, especially in areas of social vulnerability. Despite the historical uses of this approach, particularly in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, and for other pathogens, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic that occurred an exponen-tial increase in environmental surveillance programs for SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater, with many experiences and devel-opments in the field of public health using data for decision making and prioritizing actions to control the pandemic. In Latin America, WBE was applied in heterogeneous contexts and with emphasis on populations that present many socio-environmental inequalities, a condition shared by all Latin American countries. This manuscript addresses the concepts and applications of WBE in public health actions, as well as different experiences in Latin American countries, and discusses a model to implement this surveillance system at the local or national level. We emphasize the need to implement this sentinel surveillance system in countries that want to detect the early entry and spread of new patho-gens and monitor outbreaks or epidemics of infectious agents in their territories as a complement of public health surveillance systems.

TI  - Deep learning of sea-level variability and flood for coastal city resilience
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to climate change, it is important to study the relationship between floods and sea-level rise in coastal city resilience. In this research sea surface temperature (SST) from MODIS, wind speed, precipitation, and sea-level rise from satellite altimetry are investigated for dynamic sea-level variability. An annual SST increase of 0.1C degrees is observed around the Gothenburg coast. Also in the middle of the North Sea, an annual increase of about 0.2C degrees is evident. The annual sea surface height (SSH) trend is 3 mm on the Gothenburg coast. We have a strong positive spatial correlation between SST and SSH near the Gothenburg coast. In the next step, dynamic sea-level vari-ability is predicted with a convolution neural network and long short term memory. Root mean square error of wind speed, precipitation, SST, and mean sea-level forecasts are +/- 0.84 m/s, +/- 48.75 mm, +/- 3.48C degrees and +/- 24 mm, respectively. The 5-year trends of mean seal level show a significant increase from 28 mm/year to 46 mm/year in the last 5 year periods and the rate of increase has doubled. In the final step, the water rise of 5-10 m in Gothenburg city was simulated, and in the worst scenario, more than 50 % of the city will be damaged.

TI  - (Paleo)glacier studies in Patagonia over the past decades (1976-2020): A bibliometric perspective based on the Web of Science
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Patagonia features the most extensive glaciers of the Southern Hemisphere, excluding Antarctica, and a vast inventory of glacial landforms, so it is thought to have played a key role in (paleo)glacier studies since the late 19th century. However, no systematic attempts to characterize the specific research trends and the scientific community focused on Patagonian cryosphere have been conducted so far. To fill this gap, we analyzed the metadata associated to 305 articles compiled from the Web of Science database following a bibliometric approach covering the period between 1976 and 2020. Our results point to an irregular but net increase on the number of contributions on Patagonian (paleo)glaciers. Mass balance analyses based on satellite data of presentday glaciers and the reconstruction of past glacier activity by dating glacial landforms formed during the Last Glacial Termination, were the most addressed topics during the analyzed period. Patagonian (paleo)glacier studies are mostly published in generic Earth Sciences publications, followed by Quaternary and glaciological journals. Most of the studies were led by scientists from the United Kingdom, followed by Chile, Argentina and United States. In terms of collaborations, these studies can be divided into two main clusters, one composed by researchers from United States, Chile and Argentina institutions, and another mostly composed by British researchers. So far, the most prolific authors are nearly equally distributed in nationality, yet gender inclusion and international collaborations are still caveats that must be solved. Even though our query on the Web of Science missed highly influential (so-called) grey literature, such as local scientific journals and technical reports, the reviewed scientific literature unambiguously indicates that Patagonia is a privileged location for (paleo)glaciers studies worldwide and that it will continue offering vast opportunities to tackle critical questions related to global cryosphere and past-to-present climate changes.

TI  - A novel remote sensing index for brine shrimp (Artemia) slick detection in salt lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Artemia (brine shrimp) are a widely distributed zooplankton in inland salt lakes and artificial ponds throughout the tropical, subtropical, and temperate zones. Notably, they are of great importance to fishery production and salt lake ecosystem health. Recently, Artemia resources have been threatened by habitat deterioration and overfishing, which mandate adequate monitoring; however, advanced methods for detecting Artemia from remote sensing images have rarely been discussed. Accordingly, this study explored the possibility of detecting the adult Artemia (Artemia) slicks using multispectral optical sensors by analyzing their unique aggregation patterns and consistent optical properties. After measuring Artemia spectra in the field, reflectance troughs were observed at-431 nm and -560 nm, which were deemed likely related to the absorption of beta-carotene and heme, respectively, resulting in their reddish color. These characteristics could also be used to differentiate Artemia from other confounding features, including clean water and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a)-or suspended par-ticulate matter (SPM)-dominated water. Based on these spectral signatures, a brine shrimp index (BSI) was developed using the difference between the reflectance at NIR band and a linear baseline between green and SWIR1 bands of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. Further, a BSI-based Artemia slick pixel extraction method was proposed. Using observation geometry information in conjunction with the BSI value of entire lakes, the BSI thresholds for the Artemia-containing pixels were automatically determined, and > 80% overall accuracy was achieved. The index performance was affected by the presence of residual cloud shadows, high water turbidity, and mixed pixels with low Artemia density. Moreover, BSI values were found to be rela-tively insensitive to atmospheric signals. It was shown here that the BSI detection limit was >0.53% Artemia subpixel coverage under clean water conditions; whereas a higher coverage was required to separate Artemia from Chl-a-or SPM-dominated water. The mean absolute percentage difference of BSI values calculated from Rayleigh-corrected and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance was <4% compared with surface reflectance derived BSI, and the relative difference in coverage area was < +/- 10%. Lastly, time series analyses of Lake Aibi in northwest China and the Great Salt Lake in North America revealed that the annual areal coverage estimation of Artemia slicks based on BSI was a positive indicator of Artemia harvesting, which can facilitate the Artemia resource management.

TI  - Optimal extent of lymph node dissection in gastric cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer still remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Stage-adapted, individualized treatment is crucial to achieving optimal oncological outcomes. Postoperative morbidity and accurate nodal staging are heavily influenced by the extent of lymph node dissection. On one hand, insufficient lymphadenectomy may result in understaging and undertreatment of a patient, on the other hand, unnecessary lymph node dissection may result in a higher rate of postoperative complications. Approximately one-third of patients with gastric cancer undergoes an avoidable lymph node dissection. Many of the recent treatment updates in the management of gastric cancer have a major influence on both surgical and oncological approaches. Currently, a wide range of endoscopic, minimally invasive, and hybrid surgical techniques are available. The concept of sentinel node biopsy and utilization of the Maruyama Computer Program are significant components of stage-adapted gastric cancer surgery. Likewise, centralization and application of national guidelines, widespread use of neoadjuvant therapy, and the stage migration phenomenon are serious concerns to be discussed. Our goal is to review the available surgical strategies for gastric cancer, with a primary focus on lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Tracking spatio-temporal dynamics of harmful algal blooms using long-term MODIS observations of Chaohu Lake in China from 2000 to 2021
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have long been a critical threat to environmental safety and health, especially in inland lakes with rapidly growing socioeconomic development. Although satellite remote sensing provides an efficient manner to observe floating algae blooms, tracing and capturing the distribution of HABs in water bodies remains challenging for their high dynamics in both spatial and temporal dimensions. This study analyzed the spatio-temporal dynamics of HABs in Chaohu Lake, China, from 2000 to 2021. Daily MODIS remote sensing observations, including 7926 images, were utilized. The Floating Algae Index (FAI) was applied to each image to detect the area and severity of HABs. Results show that the HABs in Chaohu Lake have generally been increasing in the past two decades, with two intermittent decreases in 2016-2017 and 2020-2021, and the duration of HABs tended to be longer over the years. HABs were most severe and frequent in the lake's northwestern area. Temperature and precipitation are two main meteorological factors positively correlated with HABs. The fast-growing socio-economy reflected by population and GDP increase lake eutrophication and HABs. However, environment management policies since 2020 have had a significant and rapid influence in decreasing the lake's nutrients, which greatly reduced HABs severity in 2020 and 2021. This study's results further indicate that high -frequency remote sensing observations, although with occasional data missing due to cloud cover, can still perform well in describing HABs, as long as the analysis method is appropriately adopted. This finding provides potential significance for utilizing remote sensing products, especially for highly dynamic object observation where high-quality images are lacking.

TI  - Soil salinity assessment by using spectral salinity indices in Al-Sweira project middle of the Iraqi alluvial plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a significant problem affecting agricultural production, pollution, and the deterioration of extensive lands worldwide, especially irrigated areas. Remote sensing (RS) systems have more significant potential for detecting and monitoring this problem in the long term than traditional methods. Satellites provide economic efficiency, information on soil salinity degrees, rapid data collection, and temporal-monitoring capabilities. Nine indices derived from the visible and infrared bands of the Sentinel-2 satellite were used to map the soil salinity of the Al-Sweira project. These indices were the Normalized Difference Salinity Index (NDSI), Salinity Indices (SI1, SI2, SI3, SI4, SI5, and SI6), Brightness Index (BI), and Vegetation Soil Salinity Index (VSSI). Implement predictive modeling techniques, simple linear regression, exponential regression, and polynomial regression, a correlation was obtained between soil salinity and the selected indices. The polynomial regression showed the best equations for predicting the soil salinity of the study area, and the best correlations for the indices NDSI, SI5, SI6, VSSI, and SI1, respectively. Besides, the highest significant correlation was R = 0.8995, P value 0.01 with the NDSI index, and the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.8092. Four classes of salinity were distributed in the study area, which are highly, slightly, extremely, and moderately saline, with percentages of (34.10, 29.85, 27.68, 8.35%), respectively, while the non-saline class did not appear.

TI  - Assessing the haplotype and spectro-functional traits interactions to explore the intraspecific diversity of common reed in Central Italy
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - As reflectance measured via remote sensing is connected to plant light use and morpho-structural features, it can be used to derive spectral proxies of functional traits, or spectro-functional traits. Focusing on disentangling intraspecific trait variability in nature, we evaluated the links between haplotype and spectro-functional traits in Phragmites australis populations. Haplotypes sequencing and multi-seasonal satellite data were used to evaluate the temporal dynamics of spectro-functional traits for reed stands sampled from seven wetlands in Central Italy, investigating meteo-climatic drivers, the differences across ecological statuses, sites, and haplotypes, and quantifying intraspecific variability due to haplotype or phenotypic plasticity. Five haplotypes were identified, including an unedited one, which explained a substantial portion of intraspecific variability in canopy traits, differing for aquatic and terrestrial stands. We found that meteo-climatic factors impact on aquatic reeds traits (not over terrestrial ones) and a dualism between most and less common haplotypes, pointing to different evolutionary strategies. Dynamics in reed canopy traits were linked to ecological status, site and haplotype, with signs of haplotype-variable effects of dieback on aquatic stands. Evaluating the spectro-functional variability over reed haplotypes may provide a straightforward approach for monitoring the genotype-phenotype relations across scales and assessing their ecological drivers.

TI  - Characterization of the impacts of hydro-dams on wetland inundations in Southeast Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inundations of wetlands play a significant role in wetland ecosystems, but they are vulnerable to hydrological alter-ations. In Southeast Asia, many hydro-dams, which significantly alter the hydrology, have been built, but little is known about the influences of dams on wetland inundations. In this study, we quantified the characteristics of inun-dations and related the alterations to the dams by distinguishing them from influences of climate variabilities and local human activities. A multi-sensor approach using Landsat 8, Sentinel-1, and MODIS was devised to delineate the weekly inundations of 362 Southeast Asian wetlands from 2014 to 2021. The four hydrological characteristics (cyclical pat-terns, trends, intra-annual variability, and amplitude of inundations) were quantified, and the alteration of the charac-teristics caused by dams was separated from climate variabilities and local human activities using correlation analysis and logistic regression models. The results found that cyclical patterns, trends, intra-annual variability, and amplitude of wetland inundations changed significantly over the period, but the magnitudes vary significantly depending on their geographic locations with respect to the dams. Findings showed that dams critically affect the wetlands even though dams are located distantly from the dams. This indicates that wetlands should be monitored and conserved for reduc-ing the influences of dams. This study advances our understanding of the effects of dams on wetlands by using the multi-sensor approach and distinguishing them from climate variabilities and local human activities.

TI  - Trends in normalized difference vegetation index time series in differently regulated cascade reservoirs in Wujiang catchment, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dam construction is economically and ecologically important for power generation and water capture. However, the effects of cascade dams with various regulation types (i.e., daily, weekly, seasonal, yearly) on vegetation coverage are still need to be clarified. In the current study, we investigated the effects of dam construction on vegetation coverage and predicted the dynamic trends of vegetation at the sub-catchment (i.e., the catchment removing the overlapping catchment of the upstream reservoir) and buffer scale of each reservoir. MODIS Terra normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composites (MOD13Q1, 2000-2019) were used to study spatial and temporal changes in riparian vegetation coverage. At the sub-catchment scale, the long-term mean NDVI increased significantly from upstream to downstream from 2000 to 2019, and the NDVI mutation point (i.e., turning point) was consistent with the construction year of the corresponding dam. At the temporal scale, the vegetation trend predictions indicated a greater degree of degradation (23 %-61 %) than in the past (2000-2019; 3 %-32 %). Our findings also showed that reservoir vegetation degradation was associated with regulation type, i.e., daily reservoirs experienced a higher degree of vegetation degradation. Each cascade reservoir exhibited higher past vegetation degradation within the 0-1 km buffer zone compared to the sub-catchment. However, future degradation was predicted to be much higher in the sub-catchment than in the 0-1 km buffer zone, indicating the potential impact of damming on vegetation from adjacent areas (i.e., 0-1 km buffer) with gradual expansion to more distant areas (i.e., sub-catchment) over time. A potential cascade effect of upstream dams on sub-catchment vegetation of downstream dams was also observed. This study provides a reference for watershed management and ecological civilization construction. Relevant laws and policies should be established in areas surrounding reservoirs to help mitigate dam-induced degradation of vegetation communities, especially in res-ervoirs with short retention times.

TI  - Scaling of classification systems-effects of class precision on detection accuracy from medium resolution multispectral data
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Land-cover class definitions are scale-dependent. Up-scaling categorical data must account for that dependence, but most decision rules aggregating categorical data do not produce scale-specific class definitions. However, non-hierarchical, empirically derived classification systems common in phytosociology define scale-specific classes using species co-occurrence patterns. Objectives Evaluate tradeoffs in class precision and representativeness when up-scaling categorical data across natural landscapes using the multi-dimensional grid-point (MDGP)-scaling algorithm, which generates scale-specific class definitions; and compare spectral detection accuracy of MDGP-scaled classes to 'majority-rule' aggregated classes. Methods Vegetation maps created from 2-m resolution WorldView-2 data for two Everglades wetland areas were scaled to the 30-m Landsat grid with the MDGP-scaling algorithm. A full-factorial analysis evaluated the effects of scaled class-label precision and class representativeness on compositional information loss and detection accuracy of scaled classes from multispectral Landsat data. Results MDGP-scaling retained between 3.8 and 27.9% more compositional information than the majority rule as class-label precision increased. Increasing class-label precision and information retention also increased spectral class detection accuracy from Landsat data between 1 and 8.6%. Rare class removal and increase in class-label similarity were controlled by the class representativeness threshold, leading to higher detection accuracy than the majority rule as class representativeness increased. Conclusions When up-scaling categorical data across natural landscapes, negotiating trade-offs in thematic precision, landscape-scale class representativeness and increased information retention in the scaled map results in greater class-detection accuracy from lower-resolution, multispectral, remotely sensed data. MDGP-scaling provides a framework to weigh tradeoffs and to make informed decisions on parameter selection.

TI  - Tracking the evolution of the summit lava dome of Merapi volcano between 2018 and 2019 using DEMs derived from TanDEM-X and Pleiades data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - At andesitic volcanoes, effusive lava flows and dome emplacement alternate with explosive, sometimes very destructive events. It is thus crucial to obtain quantitative information on the dome volume emplaced as well as on the extrusion rate. However, steep slopes and continuous activity make it difficult to install field instruments near many volcano summits. In this study, we take advantage of two high resolution remote-sensing datasets, Pleiades (optical acquisitions in tri-stereo mode) and TanDEM-X (radar acquisitions in bistatic mode), to produce twenty Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) over the summit area of Merapi volcano, Indonesia, between July 2018 and December 2019. We calculate the difference in elevation between each DEM and a reference DEM derived from Pleiades images acquired in 2013, in order to track the evolution of the dome in the crater. Uncertainties are quantified for each dataset by a statistical analysis of areas with no change in elevation. We show that the DEMs derived from Pleiades and TanDEM-X data are consistent with each other and provide good spatiotemporal constraints on the evolution of the dome. Furthermore, the remote-sensing estimate of the lava volume is consistent with local drone measurements carried out by BPPTKG at the time of dome growth. From our DEMs, we show that the dome growth was sustained by a relatively small effusion rate of about 0.0336 +/- 0.0067 m(3).s(-1)(2900 +/- 580 m(3)/day) from August 2018 to February 2019, when it reached a height of 40 m (+/- 5 m) and a volume of 0.64 Mm(3) (+/- 0.03 Mm(3)). The lava dome initially grew radially, and then extended asymmetrically to the northwest and southeast starting in October 2018. From February 2019 onwards, the dome elevation remained constant, but lava was continuously emitted. Lava supply was balanced by destabilization southwards downhill producing an accumulation zone of 400 m long and maximum 15 m (+/- 5 m) high with a volume of 0.37 Mm(3) (+/- 0.29 Mm(3)). The measured accumulation rate between February and September 2019 is 0.0094 +/- 0.001 m(3).s(-1)(810 +/- 90 m(3)/day). In late 2019, several minor explosions partially destroyed the center of the dome. This study highlights the strong potential of the joint use of TanDEM-X and Pleiades DEMs to quantitatively monitor domes at andesitic stratovolcanoes.

TI  - The role of the refugee crises in driving forest cover change and fragmentation in Teknaf, Bangladesh
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research has employed remotely sensed data and image classification techniques for the first time to track three decades (1989 to 2021) of forest cover change and forest fragmentation across the largest Rohingya refugee settlement in the Teknaf peninsula, in Bangladesh. Forest fragmentation was evaluated in terms of forest core, patch, perforated, and edge, to characterize forest morphological changes at the landscape level. The results revealed that the forest occupying the study area was 97,400 acres in 1989, which decreased to 92,400 acres by 2015 (5% change) due to firewood collection. However, a sharp decline in the forest was observed in 2017, when the Rohingya refugees settled in the region causing an additional loss of 600 acres of protected forest and 7500 acres of non-protected forests. Such a drastic forest cover change led by refugee settlements has altered forest morphological patterns. As a result, in 1989, the core forest area was 42% which declined to 25% in 2015, and 20% in 2017. This loss of core area greatly increased the patch, perforated and edge areas. Through the efforts of restoration activities, the area of the core forest increased to 28% in 2019 and further increased to 32% in 2021. By 2019, the 5500 acres of non-protected forest was regained, and the protected forest increased by 770 acres. Forest recovery was sustained through the end of 2021, and the total forest in the study area was estimated to be 93,300 acres by this period. This study provides detailed information on the spatial and temporal evaluation of forest change and forest fragmentation metrics intending to understand the historic and ongoing forest disturbance regime, particularly in the ecologically critical zone of the Teknaf wildlife sanctuary. This analysis should encourage managers to enact varying forest restoration and rehabilitation strategies in the region.

TI  - A physical method for downscaling land surface temperatures using surface energy balance theory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-resolution land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared remote sensing images is a good indicator of surface water status and plays an essential role in the exchange of energy and water between land and atmosphere. A physical surface energy balance (SEB)-based LST downscaling method (DTsEB) is developed to downscale coarse remotely sensed thermal infrared LST products with fine-resolution visible and near-infrared data. The DTsEB method is advantageous for its ability to mechanically interrelate surface variables contributing to the spatial variation of LST, to quantitatively weigh the contributions of each related variable within a physical framework, and to efficaciously avoid the subjective selection of scaling factors and the establishment of statistical regression relationships. The applicability of the DTsEB method was tested by downscaling 12 scenes of 990 m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and aggregated Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST products to 90 m resolution at six overpass times between 2005 and 2015 over three 9.9 km by 9.9 km cropland (mixed by grass, tree, and built-up land) study areas. Three typical LST downscaling methods, namely the widely applied TsHARP, the later developed least median square regression downscaling (LMS) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR), were introduced for inter comparison. The results showed that the DTsEB method could more effectively reconstruct the subpixel spatial variations in LST within the coarse-resolution pixels and achieve a better downscaling accuracy than the TsHARP, LMS and GWR methods. The DTsEB method yielded, on average, root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.01 K and 1.42 K when applied to the MODIS datasets and aggregated ASTER datasets, respectively, which were lower than those obtained with the TsHARP method, with average RMSEs of 2.41 K and 1.71 K, the LMS method, with average RMSEs of 2.35 K and 1.63 K, and the GWR method, with average RMSEs of 2.38 K and 1.64 K, respectively. The contributions of the related surface variables to the subpixel spatial variation in the LST varied both spatially and temporally and were different from each other. In summary, the DTsEB method was demonstrated to outperform the TsHARP, LMS, and GWR methods and could be used as a good alternative for downscaling LST products from coarse to fine resolution with high robustness and accuracy.

TI  - A Complete Map of Fine-Scale Slip Rate Distribution and Earthquake Potential Along the Haiyuan Fault System
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations to derive the first complete map of slip-rate distribution at km-scale along the 1,000-km-long Haiyuan fault system, and further to analyze its earthquake potential. Rate distribution reveals four highly locked asperities (slip rate <1 mm/yr) and three creeping regions (slip rate ranges from 2 to 5 mm/yr) at depths of 0-20 km. Based on the rate distribution, we estimate seismic moment accumulation rate, and by combining historical earthquake records, we calculate the moment deficits on each fault segment. Results show that many fault segments have accumulated a seismic moment that equates to an M-w > 7.0 earthquake. The westernmost fault segment has been rarely mentioned in previous studies, but our calculations show evidently that it is capable of producing M-w > 7.0 earthquakes given the high seismic moment accumulation rate and a lack of small-to-moderate earthquakes.

TI  - A Persian Perception of Two French Stories
T2  - COMPARATIVE LITERATURE-EAST & WEST
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern Persian fiction initially emerged in Iran through translation of western literature, especially from French. The translation movement in Iran was simultaneous with the emergence of Romanticism in Europe; therefore, writers of this literary school are outstanding in translation of western literature into Persian. Using a descriptive, analytic, and comparative method, this article attempts to make a comparison between Bernardin de Saint-Pierre's Le Cafe de Surate (Coffee House of Surat) and La Chaumiere Indienne (Indian Cottage) and Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani's Haftad o do Mellat (Seventy-Two Nations). Motivated by Pierre's broad worldview, Kermani found intellectual and spiritual affinity with his attitude and translated two of his stories into Persian. Despite the popularity of romance stories among Persian readers, Kermani was not quite successful to sustain the attraction of Pierre's original stories in his adaptation due to his lack of acquaintance with modern fiction and scientific methods of translation, revolutionary zeal, extreme Iranian nationalism, religious prejudice, and manipulative outlook on literature Nevertheless, his good translation choice and its due time period gave him a special place in the realm of Persian fiction and also introduced de Saint-Pierre's works to the Iranians.

TI  - Confusion and prospects for carcinogenesis of gastric adenoma and dysplasia: What is the correct answer currently?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - There are differences in the diagnoses of superficial gastric lesions between Japan and other countries. In Japan, superficial gastric lesions are classified as adenoma or cancer. Conversely, outside Japan, the same lesion is classified as low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia, or invasive neoplasia. Gastric carcinogenesis occurs mostly de novo, and the adenoma-carcinoma sequence does not appear to be the main pathway of carcinogenesis. Superficial gastric tumors can be roughly divided into the APC mutation type and the TP53 mutation type, which are mutually exclusive. APC-type tumors have low malignancy and develop into LGD, whereas TP53-type tumors have high malignancy and are considered cancerous even if small. For lesions diagnosed as category 3 or 4 in the Vienna classification, it is desirable to perform complete en bloc resection by endoscopic submucosal dissection followed by staging. If there is lymphovascular or submucosal invasion after mucosal resection, additional surgical treatment of gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is required. In such cases, function-preserving curative gastrectomy guided by sentinel lymph node biopsy may be a good alternative.

TI  - Forward modelling of synthetic aperture radar backscatter from lake ice over Canadian Subarctic Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice provides important social and economic services to local communities, in addition to being a sensitive indicator of climate change. The reduction of ground observations of freshwater ice has led to an increased reliance on the use of satellite remote sensing data. There is currently interest in the retrieval of lake ice properties (e.g., ice thickness, bubble radius, roughness) using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Roughness at the ice-water interface is particularly important as it has been identified as the dominant mechanism for increasing SAR backscatter throughout the ice season and must be considered in numerical radiative transfer models. Therefore, this study determines optimal ice-water interface roughness height for two subarctic lakes in northern Canada and models backscatter throughout two ice seasons using the snow microwave radiative transfer (SMRT) model. The two lakes for this study are Noell Lake and Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Field observations of ice thickness, snow depth, snow density, and the Canadian Lake Ice Model (CLIMo) are used to parameterize SMRT. Modelled L, C, and X-band backscatter at different incidence angles is assessed using SAR imagery from multiple satellite missions. Root mean square errors ranged from 0.38 to 1.45 dB for Noell Lake and 0.70 to 2.33 dB for Malcolm Ramsay Lake. Discrepancies between modelled and observed backscatter were found to be connected to the representation of roughness at different interfaces within the ice column and changes that occurred during freeze-melt events. These results provide insight into how changes in ice properties impact backscatter throughout the ice season. SMRT is valuable for modelling backscatter from lake ice during the cold season and could be used to develop retrieval algorithms for estimating ice-water interface roughness. This would allow for the development of other inversion models for retrieval of surface ice conditions and ice thickness.

TI  - Spatio-temporal estimation of green and blue water consumptions and water and land productivity using satellite remote sensing datasets and WA plus framework: A case study of the Mahi Basin, India
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural activities contribute to the largest share of water consumption in the arid and semi-arid basins. In this study, we demonstrate the application of Water Accounting Plus (WA+) for estimation of the green water consumption (ETGreen) and blue water consumption (ETBlue) for assessing the water productivity (WP) and land productivity (LP) to identify the bright-spots and hot-spots at the district administrative unit level for effectively managing the scarce water resources and sustaining food security in a highly non-resilient semi-arid basin of India. The WA+ framework uses satellite remote sensing datasets from different sources for this purpose and we used the data from 2003 to 2020. The long-term average of ETGreen and ETBlue in the Mahi basin is found to be 15.8 km3/year and 12.32 km3/year, respectively. The blue water index (BWI) and green water index (GWI) in the basin vary from 0.282 to 0.598 and 0.40-0.72. We found that the BWI is highest for the districts of Gujarat, whereas, the GWI is highest for the districts of Madhya Pradesh. The long-term average of the LP and WP for both the irrigated and rainfed cereals in the basin is found as 2287.71 kg/ha & 1713.62 kg/ha and 0.721 kg/ m3 & 0.483 kg/m3 , respectively from 2003 to 2020. The WP (rainfed) of all the districts of the Gujarat is comparatively lower (varying from 0.34 kg/m3 to 0.5 kg/m3) than the districts of the Madhya Pradesh (varying from 0.59 kg/m3 to 0.70 kg/m3 ) and the Rajasthan (varying from 0.48 kg/m3 to 0.73 kg/m3 ). Based on the results, we found that the Ratlam district of the Madhya Pradesh has both highest LP and WP (irrigated) as 2573.96 kg/ha and 2.14 kg/m3, respectively among all the districts of the Mahi basin, and hence it is classified as the 'Bright spot-district'. The Anand district is found to have the lowest WP and LP as 0.44 kg/m3 and 2467.51 kg/ha, respectively and hence it is classified as the 'hot spot-district'. For rainfed cereals, we found that the Neemuch district of Madhya Pradesh has the highest WP and LP as 0.59 kg/m3 and 1948.13 kg /ha, respectively, and the Anand district with the lowest WP as 0.34 kg/m3 and LP of 1572.21 kg/ha, respectively. Therefore, we classified the Neemach district as the 'Bright spot-district' and the Anand district as the hot spot-district for rainfed cereals. These findings will help develop sustainable and actionable agricultural water management plans by the policymakers and stakeholders in the basin.

TI  - Fog Detection and Estimation Using CALIPSO Lidar Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most fog detection from space cannot differentiate fog and low stratus clouds, and cannot estimate fog deposition. This study assessed the feasibility of using spaceborne lidar observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) in fog detection and estimation. We tested the method in the central Namib Desert, Namibia, where frequent fog events occur and fog observations are available. Results showed the CALIPSO backscatter signal at 532 nm can differentiate low clouds and fog due to its high-resolution vertical profiles. Backscatter signals during fog events were significantly higher than those during non-fog periods. The R-2 between backscatter signals and fog observations was 0.85. Moreover, the backscatter signal was also sensitive to relative humidity variation (R-2 = 0.66). These results indicate that the CALIPSO data are feasible to estimate fog occurrence and deposition, providing a new perspective for space-based fog studies.

TI  - Dwindling seagrasses: A multi-temporal analysis on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrasses, a unique group of marine flowering plants, profoundly influence the marine environment by providing an array of critical ecological functions. They serve as the foundational habitat for several endangered and charismatic species, including sea cows, sea turtles, and sea horses, and are often referred to as coastal canaries. In comparison to boreal and tropical forests, they have an amazing ability for carbon storage. Despite their long evolutionary history, they are threatened by rapid environmental changes caused by climate change and human activity. Long-term monitoring is required to comprehend the changes in this fragile ecosystem. Conventional field survey methods for collecting long-term data are laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Hence, this work builds a time-series dataset of the seagrass coverage in the Kalpeni lagoon from 2003 to 2020 by analysing Landsat data on Google Earth Engine. We also evaluated the temporal changes in the seagrass coverage of the study area and studied the influence of selected environmental factors on the seagrass coverage. We observed a negative relationship between sea surface temperature and seagrass coverage. The results revealed a decline in more than 99% of seagrass coverage, indicating an alarming threat to this seagrass ecosystem of the region. With such a drastic shrinkage in the seagrass coverage, the hysteresis must be strong, and the recovery of these meadows may require intensive interventions. By establishing a long-term time series database of seagrass coverage, our study also opens up new avenues for future ecological research on the seagrass meadows.

TI  - Seasonal Patterns of Greenland Ice Velocity From Sentinel-1 SAR Data Linked to Runoff
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate projections of the mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) require a complete understanding of the ice-dynamic response to climate forcings on seasonal and interannual timescales and would greatly benefit from more observational evidence. Here, we analyze a 5-year, high-resolution data set of ice velocities of the GrIS using K-means, an unsupervised clustering algorithm, to identify ice-sheet wide characteristic seasonal flow patterns. We include all areas flowing >0.3 m/d and obtain an ice-sheet wide overview of the seasonality and the interannual variability. It shows both a spatial and interannual variability in seasonal flow patterns, both along individual glaciers and between glaciers. We compare with runoff from a regional climate model and infer that the ice-sheet wide patterns are linked to the availability of water penetrating to the base of the ice.

T2  - TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bacteriophages (phages) are a promising anti-infective option for human disease. Major gaps remain in understanding their potential utility. Methods: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of a single dose of intravenous phage in approximately 72 clinically stable adult cystic fibrosis volunteers recruited from up to 20 US sites with Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway colonization. The single dose of phage consists of a mixture of four anti-pseudomonal phages. Six sentinel participants will be sequentially enrolled with dose escalation of the phage mixture by one log(10) beginning with 4 x 10(7) plaque-forming units in an unblinded stage 1. If no serious adverse events related to the study product are identified, the trial will proceed to a double-blinded stage 2. In stage 2a, 32 participants will be randomly assigned to one of three phage dosages or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 allocation. An interim analysis will be performed to determine the phage dosage with the most favorable safety and microbiological activity profile to inform phage dosing in stage 2b. During stage 2b, up to 32 additional volunteers will be randomized 1:1 to the phage or placebo arm. Primary outcomes include (1) the number of grade 2 or higher treatment-emergent adverse events, (2) change in log(10)P. aeruginosa total colony counts in sputum, and (3) the probability of a randomly selected subject having a more favorable outcome ranking if assigned to receive phage therapy versus placebo. Exploratory outcomes include (1) sputum and serum phage pharmacokinetics, (2) the impact of phage on lung function, (3) the proportion of P. aeruginosa isolates susceptible to the phage mixture before and after study product administration, and (4) changes in quality of life. Discussion: This trial will investigate the activity of phages in reducing P. aeruginosa colony counts and provide insights into the safety profile of phage therapy.

AB  - The Solar Irradiance Science Team (SIST) #2 (SIST-2) program is a competitively solicited National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Earth Science Division science research program providing 3-year awards beginning in July 2018 to quantify and understand the solar irradiance variability and implications for Earth's climate and atmospheric composition. The purpose for the SIST-2 program is limited to the accurate specification of the incoming solar irradiance into the Earth system considering the 44-year satellite data record as well as proxies to which the satellite record can be tied. The SIST-2 program funded eight research grants to study the variability of the total solar irradiance and solar spectral irradiance and to develop improved space-based data sets, solar proxies, and variability models of the solar irradiance. The SIST-2 projects are briefly introduced.

TI  - Combining historical maps and landsat images to delineate the centennial-scale changes of lake wetlands in Taihu Lake Basin, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake wetlands (LWs) are essential components of the ecosystem and play an irreplaceable role in flood regula-tion, carbon fixation, and biodiversity maintenance. Continuous monitoring of LWs' change is necessary in the context of increased human disturbance and climate change, particularly in Taihu Lake Basin, China, an area exposed to early human exploitation. Yet, long-time series of LWs detection in this region is still unavailable due to the data limitation. To quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics of LWs and the associated driving forces, we combined 236 historical topographic maps and thousands of Landsat satellite images from the 1910s to 2021 to delineate the centennial-scale changes of lake wetlands for the first time in this region. We also applied land use transitions and statistical analyses to quantitively explore the climatic and anthropogenic factors behind LWs variations. Our results document a dramatic decline in the area and number of LWs in the Taihu Lake Basin over the last century and a shift in the 2000s: Taihu Lake Basin has seen a total of 89.15% loss in lake littoral wetlands and a decrease of 14.5% in the whole lake wetlands area, with a net reduction of 68 (from 156 in the 1910s to 88 in the 2021) lakes. This decrease has been especially predominant during the 1910s-2000s, because of the policy initiatives for reclamation and aquacultural industries. The area and number of LWs have gradually been recovered since the 2000s as the country strengthened concern on the ecological restoration and sustainable development. The statistical results suggested that human activities played a dominant role in the LWs changes, with GDP and population explained 80.74% of the changes, coupled with climatic contribution of only around 20%. This long-term investigation will provide baseline information for future lake wetlands monitoring. Our findings could also provide a guidance for decision makers regarding water resources management, environ-mental protection and land-use planning in urban areas.

TI  - Impact of satellite AOD data on top-down estimation of biomass burning particulate matter emission
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter emitted from open biomass burning affects climate, air quality and public health. In the develop-ment of remote sensing techniques, top-down methods using satellite observations have become an effective way to estimate particulate matter emissions, but different spatial resolution and coverage of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products introduce great uncertainties. In this work, we assess the differences in total particulate matter (TPM) emission when calculated using different satellite AOD data. To do this, we derive top-down biomass burning TPM emission coefficients (Ce) of Australia based on 1 km and 10 km MODIS AOD products, and compare the results of emission estimation. Using high spatial resolution AOD data, a 90 % decrease of Ce mean value is found in Australia, and the quality of Ce improves by 290 %. When we use 1 km AOD data in place of 10 km AOD data, the estimation of biomass burning TPM emissions in Australia during 2012-2020 drops from 1.08Tg to 0.11Tg; the temporal trends of the two products remain the same. The TPM emission estimates for biome based on higher spatial resolution AOD data in this study are lower than Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEERv1) inventories by factors of 0.08-0.2. Our work shows that using satellite AOD products of higher spatial resolution avoids overestimation of biomass burning TPM emissions, and improves the quality of final estimates, providing a possible way to understand biomass burning emission more accurately.

TI  - Effect of biomass burning on premature mortality associated with long-term exposure to PM2.5 in Equatorial Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The health burden from exposure to ambient fine particulates (PM2.5) in Equatorial Asia is substantially affected by the peatland fires in Indonesia, but the long-term health effect of the fires on local inhabitants is unclear. In this study, PM2.5-associated excess mortality in Equatorial Asia over the past 30 years (1990-2019) was esti-mated and then the health effect of biomass burning was identified. The PM2.5-related death in Equatorial Asia almost tripled from 113 (95% confidence interval, 100-125) thousand in 1990 to 337 (300-373) thousand in 2019, with a rate of increase of 6.4 (6.2-6.9) thousand/yr. The intense biomass burning between 1990 and 2019 was estimated to have induced 317 (282-348) thousand excess deaths in the study regions, with excess deaths mainly occurring in the El Nin similar to o years, such as in 1997, 2006, 2015 and 2019. Although the remote sensing data and emission inventories both reveal that the effective control measures have reduced biomass burning intensity in Equatorial Asia (especially in Sumatra and Borneo), the corresponding health benefit has been offset by variations in demographic factors, i.e., population and age structure. Over the same period, fossil fuel emissions continued to increase rapidly. Thus, more stringent and ambitious policies are required to reduce the health burden from biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions simultaneously to maximize the health benefits from government measures and policies.

TI  - Application value of indocyanine green fluorescence in sentinel lymph node biopsy for early-stage tongue cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.
T2  - Zhong nan da xue xue bao. Yi xue ban = Journal of Central South University. Medical sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Occult cervical lymph node metastasis is the most important reason for recurrence of early-stage tongue cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Cervical sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy may help to identify them. Pigment dyes and radionuclide were used to label SLN. Both of them had shortage. This study aims to investigate the application and clinical value of indocyanine green fluorescence imaging in cervical SLN biopsy for patients with early-stage tongue cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted on 23 patients with early tongue cancer and oropharyngeal cancer, who received surgical treatment and used indocyanine green as a tracer to find SLN in Hunan Cancer Hospital from April to October 2021. The detection rate of SLN was calculated and the distribution of SLN in different regions of the neck was analyzed.RESULTS: SLN was successfully identified in 22 of 23 patients, with a detection rate of 95.65%. Among these 22 patients, 3 patients were found to have cancer metastasis, and the rate of occult lymph node metastasis was 13.63%. No pathologically positive lymph nodes were detected in SLN-negative patients, and thus the positive predictive rate was 100%. For patients with primary lesions located in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue, the constituent ratios of SLN in neck area I, II, III, and IV were 15.15%, 71.72%, 13.13%, and 0, respectively. For patients with primary lesions located in base of the tongue, the constituent ratios of SLN in neck area I, II, III, and IV were 0, 44.44%, 44.44%, and 11.12%, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Indocyanine green fluorescence imaging has a high detection rate with accurate positive prediction in the anterior cervical SLN biopsy in patients with early-stage tongue cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Meanwhile, it can also reflect the lymphatic drainage of tumors located at different primary sites, which has high clinical value.
AB  - 目的: 颈部淋巴结的隐匿性转移是导致舌癌及口咽癌复发的重要原因。颈部前哨淋巴结(sentinel lymph node，SLN)活检有助于筛选存在隐匿性转移的患者。以往多使用活性染料或放射性核素标示SLN，但均存在一定的缺点。本研究使用吲哚菁绿作为示踪剂，探讨其在早期舌癌及口咽癌颈部SLN活检中的应用及临床价值。方法: 回顾性分析2021年4至10月在湖南省肿瘤医院接受外科治疗并使用吲哚菁绿作为示踪剂寻找SLN的早期舌癌及口咽癌患者23例。计算SLN检出率和分析SLN在颈部各区的分布情况。结果: 在23例患者中，22例成功定位SLN，检出率95.65%。在22例成功定位SLN的患者中，共发现3例有癌转移，隐匿性淋巴结转移率13.63%。SLN阴性患者颈部淋巴结清扫标本中未检出病理阳性淋巴结，阳性预测率100%。舌原发病灶位于舌前2/3的患者颈部I、II、III、IV区SLN的占比分别为15.15%、71.72%、13.13%、0；舌原发病灶位于口咽舌根部位的患者颈部I、II、III、IV区SLN的占比分别为0、44.44%、44.44%、11.12%。结论: 在早期舌癌及口咽癌患者颈部SLN活检中使用吲哚菁绿荧光显影可得到较高的SLN检出率，阳性预测准确，同时还可直观反映出不同部位的原发灶的淋巴引流规律，具有较高的临床应用价值。.

AB  - ObjectiveTo compare the independent and combined use of indirect computed tomographic lymphography (ICTL) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in dogs with integumentary mast cell tumors (MCT) and report the metastatic LN rate. Study designProspective clinical study. AnimalsTwenty client-owned dogs. MethodsDogs underwent preoperative ICTL, then intraoperative NIRF SLN mapping and excision of the anatomic lymph node (ALN) and/or SLN, and primary MCT. Technique agreement was complete if the same SLN was detected, and partial if the same SLN was detected along with additional SLN. No agreement occurred if the techniques detected different or no SLN. MCT were graded using two- and three-tier schemes, and LN were graded from HN0-3; HN2-3 were considered metastatic. ResultsComplete, partial, and no agreement between ICTL and NIRF was seen in 8/20 (40%), 8/20 (40%), and 4/20 (20%) dogs, respectively. Detection of ICTL-SLN and NIRF-SLN failed in 1/20 (5%) and 4/20 (20%), respectively. Tumors were grade II/low-grade in 19/20 (95%) and grade III/high-grade in 1/20 (5%) dogs. Nineteen out of 20 (95%) dogs had HN2-3 LN. ConclusionsTechnique agreement of at least one SLN was seen in 16/20 (80%) dogs. Although most MCT were classified as intermediate to low grade, LN metastases were commonly detected. Clinical significanceCombining ICTL and NIRF for MCT SLN mapping yields high SLN detection rates. Lymph node metastasis may be more common than previously reported for intermediate to low grade MCT.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Accurate depiction of the topography of Earth's surface is an essential requirement to produce photogrammetric products like DEM and ortho-images as they are used in hydrological modeling, hydrodynamic modeling and morphological studies. The overriding objective of this study is to generate a high-spatial resolution DEM using Cartosat-1 stereo pair data and ground control points obtained from Differential Global Positioning System. Comparison of the DEM generated from Cartosat-1 stereo pair and publicly available DEMs was also carried out in this study for hydrologic applications. The generated DEM using the Ground Control Points (GCPs) returned a low RMSE value of 0.18 pixels during block triangulation indicating the model error to be much less than one pixel. From the comparative result of vertical accuracy, it was found that the DEM generated from Cartosat-1 stereo pair data performs better followed by SRTM, ALOS PALSAR and ASTER with RMSE values of 2.91, 5.21, 5.69 and 6.17 m, respectively. In the watershed demarcation and stream network delineation analysis, the results obtained from the Cartosat-1 stereo pair DEM and ALOS PALSAR were found to be more accurate than SRTM and ASTER. This study clearly indicates that the high-resolution DEMs generated using the bundle GCPs approach produced a better result with higher accuracy.

T2  - NEUROSCIENCE AND BIOBEHAVIORAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - ARNSTEN, A.F.T., M.K.P. Joyce and A.C. Roberts. The Aversive Lens: Stress effects on the prefrontal-cingulate cortical pathways that regulate emotion. NEUROSCI BIOBEHAV REV XXX-XXX, 2022. The symptoms of major-depressive-disorder include psychic pain and anhedonia, i.e. seeing the world through an "aversive lens". The neurobiology underlying this shift in worldview is emerging. Here these data are reviewed, focusing on how activation of subgenual cingulate (BA25) induces an "aversive lens", and how higher prefrontal cortical (PFC) areas (BA46/10/32) provide top-down regulation of BA25 but are weakened by excessive dopamine and norepinephrine release during stress exposure, and dendritic spine loss with chronic stress exposure. These changes may generate an attractor state, which maintains the brain under the control of BA25, requiring medication or neuromodulatory treatments to return connectivity to a more flexible state. In line with this hy-pothesis, effective anti-depressant treatments reduce the activity of BA25 and restore top-down regulation by higher circuits, e.g. as seen with SSRI medications, ketamine, deep brain stimulation of BA25, or rTMS to strengthen dorsolateral PFC. This research has special relevance in an era of chronic stress caused by the COVID19 pandemic, political unrest and threat of climate change.

T2  - JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Risk of contralateral nodal metastases in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is relatively low, however, many OPSCC patients receive bilateral neck treatment. This study evaluates the oncological outcomes with management of the contralateral cN0 neck based on lymphatic mapping with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT-CT). Methods: Retrospective evaluation of patients with lateralized cT1-2 and contralateral cN0 OPSCC treated with primary surgery between December 2017 and October 2019. All patients underwent pre-operative lymphatic mapping using SPECT-CT. Clinical parameters including demographics, tumor characteristics and oncological outcomes were recorded. Results: Thirteen patients underwent primary site resection with transoral robotic surgery (TORS) and ipsilateral neck dissection with or without adjuvant therapy. Twelve patients (92.3%) had ipsilateral drainage on SPECT-CT, whereas 1 (7.7%) patient had bilateral neck lymphatic drainage. Four patients (30.8%) underwent post-operative radiation therapy (PORT). Three patients with unilateral drainage on SPECT-CT underwent PORT with unilateral neck irradiation, and 1 patient with bilateral drainage underwent PORT with bilateral neck irradiation. Seven (53.8%) patients were staged as pT1, 6 (46.2%) patients as pT2, 6 (46.2%) patients were pN0, 3 (23.1%) patients were pN1, 1 (7.7%) patient was pN2a for and 3 (23.1%) patients were N2b. The median distance of the tumor from midline was 1.05 cm (0.0-1.58). Primary sites included tonsil (n = 10, 76.9%) and tongue base (n = 3, 23.1%). The median follow-up time was 15.4 months. All patients were disease free at the latest follow-up with no contralateral neck failures. Conclusions: Pre-operative mapping of lymphatic drainage in early stage OPSCC with SPECT-CT is a promising tool which can reduce treatment to the contralateral neck potentially without compromising oncological outcomes.

TI  - Glutamine alleviates intestinal injury in a murine burn sepsis model by maintaining intestinal intraepithelial lymphocyte homeostasis
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) play a sentinel role in the mucosal immune system because of their unique anatomical location in the epithelial layer. The disruption of IEL homeostasis is implicated in driving the intestinal injury of many typical inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and sepsis. Therefore, it is meaningful to alleviate intestinal injury by restoring IEL homeostasis in disease conditions. This study explores the effects of glutamine on intestinal IEL homeostasis in a murine model of burn sepsis. We report that glutamine inhibits inflammatory response and reduces injury in the small intestine of burn septic mice. This effect is attributed to the maintaining of IEL homeostasis by suppressing apoptosis and restoring the disrupted subpopulation balance induced by burn sepsis. Mechanistically, we show that glutamine does not affect the IL-15 dependent mechanisms that drive the maintenance and differentiation of IELs. Instead, glutamine sustains IEL homeostasis by upregulate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and interleukin (IL)-22 transcription and expres-sion. Consistently, the protective roles of glutamine in burn septic mice were repressed by further supplement with an AHR antagonist CH-223191. Collectively, our study reveals a new role of glutamine to maintain IEL homeostasis by activating the AHR signaling pathway, which in turn ameliorates intestinal injury in burn sepsis.

TI  - Typhoon-induced destruction and reconstruction of the coastal current system on the inner shelf of East China Sea
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons frequently occur in the East China Sea, which significantly affect the material transport, marine hydrodynamics, and sedimentary environment of coastal currents in a relatively short time scale. Based on the in -situ observation and satellite remote sensing data, this paper analyzes the influence of five typhoons on the coastal currents of East China Sea in 2019 during different seasons. The typhoons Lekima and Mitag, which passed directly, greatly influenced the coastal current, resulting in the disappearance of the tide signal, and stimulated the current to generate new periodic signals of 3-6 days and 1-3 days, respectively. Typically, the wind of Lekima changed the flow field of the East China Sea Coastal Current (ECSCC) from northeastward to southwestward in summer in a short period, and the southwestward volume transport of the ocean current was 4 times that during periods without typhoon occurrence. The remaining water levels of the Haimen, Jiantao, and Damutu tidal level stations showed maximum water level increases during the observation period, whose values were 1.89, 1.26, and 0.90 m, respectively. Mitag only caused a northeastward current transport during autumn, and the water levels of tidal level stations along the coast increased by more than 0.5 m. However, weak and distant typhoons (Danas, Lingling, and Tapah) caused relatively small changes in ocean currents, along with the corresponding change in water transport and deposition. The results show that local wind accompanying typhoons is the main factor affecting the evolution (destruction and reconstruction) of the coastal current system. Therefore, the evolution of the ECSCC under different typhoons can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of typhoons with different paths and intensities on the coastal current.

TI  - Can mismatch repair status be added to sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm in endometrioid endometrial cancer?
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate the relation between mismatch repair (MMR) status and the risk of lymph node metas-tasis in endometrial cancer, and whether this additional data can be incorporated to current SLN (sentinel lymph node) algorithm.Methods. We included a series of 332 women that underwent SLN mapping +/- systematic lymphadenectomy from January 2013 to December 2021. Protein expressions of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 were examined by immuno-histochemistry and considered MMRd (deficient) when at least one protein was not expressed.Results. MMRd was noted in 20.8% of cases and correlated to grade 3 (p = 0.018) and presence of lymphovascular space invasion (p = 0.032). Moreover, MMRd was an independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.36-5.62). Notably, 21.7% (15/69) cases with MMRd had lymph node metastasis compared to 9.5% (25/263) of cases with MMRp (proficient) (p = 0.005). The overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 91.9% and 75.9%, respectively. Of the 80 (24%) cases of non-bilateral SLN detection, 66.2% had low-grade tumors (G1/G2) and myometrial invasion <50%. Considering MMR status an independent prognostic factor for lymph node metastasis, a systematic lymphadenectomy (side specific or bilateral) would forgo in 53.7% (43/80) of cases with non-bilateral detection, representing 13% (43/332) of all endometroid tumors. Conclusion. MMR status was independently related to lymph node metastasis in endometrioid EC. Moreover, MMR status may help to select patients that can forgo systematic lymphadenectomy in case of undetected SLN.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Brain capillary pericytes are metabolic sentinels that control blood flow through a KATP channel-dependent energy switch
T2  - CELL REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the abundance of capillary thin-strand pericytes and their proximity to neurons and glia, little is known of the contributions of these cells to the control of brain hemodynamics. We demonstrate that the pharmacological activation of thin-strand pericyte KATP channels profoundly hyperpolarizes these cells, dilates upstream penetrating arterioles and arteriole-proximate capillaries, and increases capillary blood flow. Focal stimulation of pericytes with a KATP channel agonist is sufficient to evoke this response, mediated via KIR2.1 channel-dependent retrograde propagation of hyperpolarizing signals, whereas genetic inactivation of pericyte KATP channels eliminates these effects. Critically, we show that decreasing extracellular glucose to less than 1 mM or inhibiting glucose uptake by blocking GLUT1 transporters in vivo flips a mechanistic energy switch driving rapid KATP-mediated pericyte hyperpolarization to increase local blood flow. Together, our findings recast capillary pericytes as metabolic sentinels that respond to local energy deficits by increasing blood flow to neurons to prevent energetic shortfalls.

TI  - Assimilation of Aerosol Optical Depth Into the Warn-on-Forecast System for Smoke (WoFS-Smoke)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This research extends the Warn-on-Forecast System for Smoke (WoFS-Smoke) by adding the capability to assimilate aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite Series-R (GOES-R) satellites. The WoFS is a rapidly cycling, ensemble-based analysis and forecasting system designed to generate short term (0-3 hr) forecasts of high impact weather. WoFS-Smoke provides short-term forecasts of smoke aerosols injected into the atmosphere from ongoing wildfires. The vertically integrated concentration of smoke aerosols in the atmosphere can be estimated from satellite based AOD retrievals. To assimilate AOD into WoFS-Smoke, a smoke control variable is added to the prognostic state that is updated during each assimilation cycle. Then, a forward operator is created to relate modeled smoke aerosols to AOD retrievals using a mathematical function developed for the smoke-AOD conversion used by the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh for Smoke. Finally, GOES-R AOD retrievals are quality controlled and are assimilated at 15 min intervals. Comparing analyzed AOD with smoke and other atmospheric variables indicates that assimilating AOD not only directly impacts smoke aerosol concentration in the system, but also has indirect impacts on variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind. Results from two wildfire cases in Oklahoma and Arizona show that assimilating AOD substantially impacts the concentration and distribution of smoke aerosols in the system. Forecast verification against satellite and surface observations indicates the overall impact of assimilating AOD in WoFS-Smoke can improve forecast skill of smoke and the surrounding environment.

TI  - Cascading Delays in the Monsoon Rice Growing Season and Postmonsoon Agricultural Fires Likely Exacerbate Air Pollution in North India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, smoke aerosols from crop residue burning have increasingly degraded postmonsoon (October-November) air quality in north India. We use satellite data and atmospheric modeling to investigate whether cascading delays in monsoon rice growth and postmonsoon fires over 2003-2019 have exacerbated the already poor urban air quality downwind of the fires. Beginning in 2008, a government effort to combat groundwater depletion in Punjab mandated rice sowing until closer to the arrival of monsoon rains. We find evidence of district-level delays in the timing of both monsoon rice growth and postmonsoon fires, which vary from 1 to 4 weeks with largely an east-west gradient. These delays are correlated spatially (r = 0.51-0.77), with northern and western districts in Punjab, which rely less on groundwater for irrigation, tending to have the greatest delays. Had the delays in fire activity not occurred, we estimate that cities downwind and near the fire source would have consistently seen less smoke-related fine particulate matter (PM2.5), on average ranging from 11% to 21% for New Delhi, Bathinda, and Jind during 2008-2019. This net benefit of earlier postmonsoon burning could have been even larger given that (a) a longer rice-to-wheat transition could incentivize farmers to find alternatives to burning crop residues; and (b) background PM2.5 is less abundant earlier in the season, decreasing the likelihood of extreme pollution episodes. Strategies aiming to mitigate air pollution while conserving groundwater may be more effective by promoting an earlier monsoon growing season in districts with less groundwater depletion.

T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tinto River is known globally for having a reddish color due to the high concentration of dissolved metals in its waters. The general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of nanoparticles (NPs) and ultra-fine particles in terrestrial and geospatial suspended sediments (SSs) using Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color In-strument) satellite images; by examining water turbidity levels (TSM_NN), suspended pollution potential (ADG_443_NN) and presence of chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN). The images were collected in the estuary of the Tinto River, in the city of Nerva, Spanish province of Huelva, between 2019 and 2021. The following hazardous el-ements were identified in nanoparticles and ultra-fine particles by FE-SEM/EDS: As, Cd, Ni, V, Se, Mo, Pb, Sb and Sn. Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite images detected a 2019 TSM_NN of 23.47 g-3, and a 2021 reading of 16.38 g-3.

TI  - Large Scale Topographic Mapping Using Stereo Pair Imagery from CAS500-1 Satellite
T2  - KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - A CAS500-1 (Compact Advanced Satellite) is a high-resolution Earth-observing satellite launched in Mar 2021 and being operated by National Land Satellite Center at NGII (National Geographic Information Institute). The mission of the satellite is the periodic monitoring of the land for efficient managements. Having completed the calibration and validation processes, CAS500-1 has been acquiring land images to generate the basic geospatial information that are topographic maps, orthorectified images, and DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Using satellite data has a lot of advantages over aerial images in terms of repeatability, coverage, and accessibility. However, the spatial resolution is relatively lower than that of aerial images. This prohibits the large scale topographic mapping from the satellite data. Therefore, we conducted 1:5,000 large scale topographic mappings using CAS500-1 stereo data and assessed the accuracy. Two test areas were selected including accessible and inaccessible areas. Overlapping CAS500-1 data were automatically processed with GCP (Ground Control Points) chips for better positional accuracy. Then they are used for the epipolar resampled images that can be used for stereo-plotting. Through the stereo display quality assessment, we selected the optimal stereo set for each site. The accuracy of the resulted topographic maps was checked using ground truth data such as GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System)-surveyed points over the accessible area and GCP chips in the inaccessible area, respectively. The experimental results showed the accuracy successfully met the requirement of 1:5,000 topographic map in Korea. We concluded that CAS500-1 data will have more potential for large scale mapping considering that CAS500-2 is scheduled to be launched in 2022 and cooperate with CAS500-1.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, net radiation obtained from the three reanalysis models and a satellite product coded ERA-5, MERRA-2, NCAR/NCEP, and CERES were compared with ground measurement (in situ) from Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) using the comparative statistical analytic metrics. Atmospheric radiation data such as the shortwave and longwave radiative fluxes spanned a period of 13 years (2000-2013) across the four climatic regions viz the Sahel, Guinea savannah, Rainforest, and Coastal regions over Nigeria were used to evaluate net radiation. The correlation, similarity, and bias analyses between the in situ and the remote sensing net radiation were performed using the correlation coefficient (R) metric and Taylor Skill Scores. Analyses showed that net radiation from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research model (NCAR/NCEP) showed best agreement with the in situ net radiation across all the climatic zones in Nigeria. The correlations between NCAR/NCEP and in situ net radiation data have highest R-value of 0.8629 in the Sahel region, 0.6252 in the Guinea Savannah region, 0.7996 in the Rainforest region, and 0.7852 in the Coastal region for the annual timescale. Similar spatial patterns were observed from other analytical metrics for the dry and wet seasons across the four climatic zones. It can be concluded from the results that although all the four remote sensing data show similar patterns of variations but those of ERA-5 revealed significant departure to their in situ counterpart.

TI  - Detecting the Phase of Marine Boundary Layer Clouds: Some Implications for Cloud Albedo
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines rare examples of marine boundary layer clouds that show a sharp transition from supercooled to glaciated phase without other significant changes in appearance. We used the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization's (CALIOP) cloud phase detection algorithm and cloud top height to identify these cases. Measurements by CALIOP were co-located with those by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to determine spectral changes in reflected and emitted radiation along the glaciated to supercooled transition path. In every case, the MODIS 8.5-11 mu m brightness temperature difference abruptly changed from positive to negative, with a relatively constant cloud top temperature. No change was seen in visible reflectivity, and only weak changes were detected in shortwave infrared reflectivity. These glaciated-to-supercooled transitions were incorrectly classified with the MODIS cloud phase classification algorithm. We show that, for boundary layer clouds, it is possible to improve the (passive) remote sensing of the cloud phase using only a single spectral difference in brightness temperature. Using this approach, we closely match CALIOP's climatological distributions of the cloud phase. Our work also indicates that a sudden change in the boundary layer cloud thermodynamic phase from supercooled to glaciated is not accompanied by a shift in shortwave albedo.

TI  - Combined analysis of PS-InSAR and hypsometry integral (HI) for comparing seismic vulnerability and assessment of various regions of Pakistan
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - InSAR-based deformation analysis and the geomorphic hypsometric integral (HI) technique are powerful tools for assessing the susceptibility and comparison of seismic sites to earthquakes. Therefore, this paper mainly focuses on surface deformation analysis associated with the Mw 5.0 earthquake (2019) in Mach and Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan. Sentinel-1 IW data was used to perform PS-InSAR time series analysis. SRTM DEM of 30 m spatial resolution was utilized for the geomorphic Hypsometry Integral (HI) method. The obtained results of the Interferogram indicate the changes in velocity and vertical displacement during pre-seismic, co-seismic, and post-seismic activity. Integral values were calculated using Hypsometry curves delineating the future probability and comparison of vulnerable seismological sites in Mach, Quetta, Ghazaband, Chamman and surroundings of Balochistan region. The combined results of HI and PS-InSAR revealed that Mach and Quetta regions are in between two lines known as the mature stages. Class 1_moderate (0.35 <= HI <= 0.52); with an integral value of HIMach=0.398 and HIQuetta=0.435 with a modest seismic forthcoming rate in future and susceptible to both erosion/uplifting with a vertical displacement rate more than existing +/- 55 mm/year. Class 2_high (HI (>) 0.53) with the younger and more tectonically active region surrounded by Chaman fault, which possesses a future susceptible tendency towards subsidence more than an existing velocity rate similar to 8 mm/year and Ghazaband fault towards uplifting more than 5-6 mm/year. No region of the study area was found at Monadnock: class 3_Low (HI < 0.35) stabilized condition, all sites are unstable and tectonically active. Therefore, obtained results through combined PS-InSAR and HI techniques can be used for the identification of most vulnerable seismic sites and can ascertain future safe metropolitan planning.

TI  - Modeling the effects of land use/land cover changes on water requirements of Urmia Lake basin using CA-Markov and NETWAT models
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake, the largest inland lake in Iran, is facing a severe drying scenario, with dire consequences for the whole region. The rapid expansion of agricultural activities in the Urmia Lake basin has predominately led to tremendous pressure on the limited water resources, which has accelerated the drying process of this lake. The objective of this study is to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) (2000-2020) and simulate agricultural expansion (2030 and 2040) in the Urmia Lake basin. Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based classification approach was used on Landsat satellite imagery from 2000, 2010, and 2020 to derive respective LULC layers. Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov and Land Change Modeler (LCM) were employed to simulate and assess future agricultural growth and land cover changes. Furthermore, the water requirement of agricultural activities was estimated with the NETWAT model. The results showed that the areas covered by irrigated agriculture and gardens are projected to experience a significant increase. These findings indicated that the actual LULC change during 2000-2020 was 68,802 ha of garden growth (174% change), while the simulated change was expected to be 127,613 ha by 2040. Moreover, the statistical result showed an increase of irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands by 147,948 ha (55.98%) and 356,372 ha (145.69%), respectively, by 2040. Adopting the NETWAT model, this study suggests that the changes in LULC of the region will increase the water requirement of agriculture activities from 1500 billion cubic meters in 2000 to more than 4100 billion cubic meters in 2040.

TI  - Prevalence of Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Japan
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance Real-world evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is needed to understand the prevalence of infection in the Japanese population.Objective To conduct sentinel screening of the Japanese population to determine the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic individuals, with complementary analysis for symptomatic patients as reported by active epidemiologic surveillance used by the government.Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study of a sentinel screening program investigated approximately 1 million asymptomatic individuals with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection between February 22 and December 8, 2021. Participants included children, students, employed adults, and older individuals, as well as volunteers to broadly reflect the general Japanese population in the 14 prefectures of Japan that declared a state of emergency. Saliva samples and a cycle threshold (Ct) value of approximately 40 as standard in Japan were used. Polymerase chain reaction testing for symptomatic patients was separately done by public health authorities, and the results were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare of Japan to complement data on asymptomatic infections from the present study.Main Outcomes and Measures Temporal trends in positivity and prevalence (including surges of different variants) and demographic associations (eg, age, geographic location, and vaccination status) were assessed.Results The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 1082976 asymptomatic individuals (52.08% males; mean [SD] age 39.4 [15.7] years) was 0.03% (95% CI, 0.02%-0.05%) during periods without surges and a maximum of 0.33% (95% CI, 0.25%-0.43%) during peak surges at the Japanese standard Ct value of approximately 40; however, the positive rate would have been 10-fold less at a Ct value of 25 as used elsewhere in the world (eg, UK). There was an increase in patients with a positive PCR test result with a Ct value of 25 or 30 preceding surges in infection and hotspots of asymptomatic infections.Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in the general population of Japan in 2021, as investigated by sentinel surveillance, a low rate of infection was seen in the Japanese population compared with reported levels elsewhere in the world. This finding provides real-world data on the state of infection in Japan.This cross-sectional study examines the prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in Japan.

TI  - Inequalities in the omission of axillary dissection in sentinel lymph node positive patients in the Netherlands: Innovative hospitals are early adopters of a de-escalating approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decade completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) was gradually omitted in sentinel lymph node positive (SLN+) breast cancer patients. However, adoption varies among hospitals. We analyzed factors associated with the omission of cALND in all Dutch SLN+ patients. As one of the focus hospital-related factors we defined "innovative " as the percentage of gene-expression profile (GEP) deployment within the indicated group of patients per hospital as a proxy for early adoption of innovations. cT1-2N0M0 SLN+ patients treated between 2011 and 2018 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Hospitals were defined to be innovative based on their GEP use. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was performed to assess the relationship between innovative capacity, patient-, treatment- and hospital-related characteristics and cALND performance. 14 317 patients were included. Treatment in a hospital with high innovative capacity was associated with a lower probability of receiving cALND (OR 0.69, OR 0.46 and OR 0.35 in modestly, fairly and very innovative, respectively). Other factors associated with a lower probability of receiving a cALND were age 70 and 79 years and >= 79 years (ORs 0.59 [95% CI: 0.50-0.68] and 0.21 [95% CI: 0.17-0.26]) and treatment in an academic hospital (OR 0.41 [95% CI: 0.33-0.51]). Factors associated with an increased probability of undergoing cALND were HR-/HER2- tumors (OR 1.46 [95% CI: 1.19-1.80]), macrometastatic lymph node involvement (OR 6.37 [95% CI: 5.70-7.13]) and mastectomy (OR 4.57 [95% CI: 4.09-5.10]). Patients treated in a hospital that early adopted innovations were less likely to receive cALND. Our findings endorse the need for studies on barriers and facilitators of implementing innovations. What's new? Novel treatment insights and adjusted guidelines have propagated a de-escalating treatmentapproach in breast cancer. However, little is known about the factors associated with early orlate adoption of less aggressive strategies. This nationwide prospective study assesses inequal-ities in the omission of completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) in sentinel lymphnode-positive breast cancer patients. Besides known patient and tumor characteristics, treat-ment in an academic or highly innovative hospital lowers the chance of receiving cALND. Thefindings call for further research on the implementation of innovation in clinical practice to helpreduce national inequalities in breast cancer care.

TI  - A change detection approach to flood inundation mapping using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR images, the Brahmaputra River, Assam (India): 2015-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the major disasters occurring worldwide, which occurs frequently and affects many lives and property. In the present study, an automatic flood inundation mapping approach based on Sentinel-1 SAR datasets was used for the assessment of monsoonal flood events of the Brahmaputra River from 2015 to 2020. Google Earth Engine was used to prepare potential flood inundation maps using a change detection technique by processing SAR images. In total, around 144 SAR images were analysed for the study period, and it was found that the flood inundation extent was more in 2015 and 2016 at about 6 lakh hectares; thereby, it decreased in 2017 and 2018 near to 3.5 lakh hectares. Again, an increase in inundation extent was observed of about 6 lakh hectares in 2019 and 2020, respectively. The results were evaluated by applying binarisation thresholding, removing permanent water bodies and shadows from SAR images to delineate the actual flooded areas. It shows an encouraging overall validation accuracy of 93.6% and 95.15% for the pre-flood events of 2019 and 2020, respectively. There was a change in the trend of inundation extent observed in 2015, and it was confirmed with the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation dataset. The results were further analysed for damage assessment, and it was figured out that the flood event in July 2020 resulted in the highest crop area affected. The present study shows the technological advancements over the traditional approach of flood mapping and focuses on rapid flood assessment. The generated flood extent database can be used further by the hydrologist to generate the inundation probability maps based on the forecasting rainfall and hydrological model generated river discharge measurements.

TI  - The Glacial Meltwater Turbidity Algorithm (GaMTA): Adaptation of single-band algorithm retrieving turbidity to satellite and UAV dataset from highly glaciated Antarctic region
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing need for marine polar observations, especially using remote sensing data, necessitates the adaptation of existing algorithms to local conditions. Five satellite imageries acquired by MSI and OLI sensors from 2020 and 2021 depicting Admiralty Bay in King George Island and sixteen multispectral maps created using data from Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAV) flights with a spectral camera over the cove near Zalewski Glacier were analysed. Data were supplemented by field measurements of turbidity. The Glacial Meltwater Turbidity Algorithm (GaMTA) was proposed and compared with well-known semianalytical, single-band algorithms for turbidity retrieval based on spectral imageries of heavily glaciated areas. Comparative analysis showed the ineffectiveness of algorithms applied to medium -resolution satellite images in the area of small glacial coves with high and spatially varying surface water turbidity (R = 0.59-0.61, RMSE = 4.45-7.46), in contrast to open water with low turbidity (R = 0.79-0.88, RMSE = 2.61-3.08). The results from the use of high-resolution UAV data showed the applicability of this algorithm to aerial images (R = 0.96-0.97, RMSE = 5.75-7.57). The use of GaMTA, which is adapted to local conditions, produces better results than the other algorithms, but validation on a larger dataset is needed.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Water clarity monitoring in complex coastal environments: Leveraging seagrass light requirement toward more functional satellite ocean color algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Florida's Big Bend region is home to the second largest contiguous seagrass bed in the continental United States, but the extent and integrity of this seagrass bed is declining as a result of degraded water clarity. Seagrass beds provide important ecological services and support high levels of biodiversity, thus monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of water clarity in the Big Bend region, particularly during the seagrass growth season (April to October), is of vital importance. Satellite remote sensing of coastal water clarity is often challenging due to the optical complexity and heterogeneity of coastal regions as well as frequent clouds and sun glint in the satellite imagery. As such, we developed machine learning (ML) approaches to derive the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm [Kd(490)] from satellite data with partial atmospheric correction. Traditionally, such algorithms would be developed to capture the full range and variation of the parameter of interest. Here, we demonstrate deficiencies in this method, and instead advocate for an alternate approach which leverages seagrass light re-quirements to improve the algorithm design. Specifically, we developed and implemented a 2-stage ML approach, which first classifies the coastal water into two types, then retrieves Kd(490) for the water type within which measurable changes in water clarity may impact seagrass health. We developed and compared the traditional ML approach and the proposed 2-stage ML approach based on data from MODIS/Aqua, OLCI/ Sentinel-3A, and VIIRS/SNPP. Given the outperformance of the 2-stage ML approach, we applied it to the MODIS/Aqua data archive (2003-2020) to generate time-series Kd(490) maps and analyzed how often different areas across the Northern Big Bend region are suitable for seagrass growth each year. The derived information is important toward understanding how the spatial and temporal variation in light availability impacts seagrass growth and distribution in the study region, while the 2-stage ML approach appears applicable to other coastal regions with similar optical complexity.

TI  - Baseline ultrasound and FDG-PET/CT imaging in Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a cutaneous tumor with a high tendency to metastasize, and a significant proportion of patients have metastases at first presentation. This study aims to determine the value of baseline ultrasound (US) and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18)FDG-PET/CT) imaging in both patients with clinically localized MCC (Stage I/II) and patients who present with palpable lymph nodes (Stage III). MethodsThis retrospective cohort included 135 MCC patients who underwent baseline US (with fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)) and/or FDG-PET/CT imaging between 2015 and 2021. ResultsOf the 104 patients with clinically localized disease, 48% were upstaged to Stage III and 3% to Stage IV by imaging or sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). FDG-PET/CT imaging identified regional metastases in 23%, while US with FNAC identified regional metastases in 19%. SLNB was performed in 56 patients, of whom 57% were upstaged to Stage III. Of the 31 patients who presented with palpable lymph nodes, 16% were upstaged to Stage IV by FDG-PET/CT imaging. ConclusionBaseline imaging frequently upstages Stage I/II MCC patients to Stage III, both by US and FDG-PET/CT, Stage IV disease is rarely identified. Patients who present with palpable nodes are frequently upstaged to Stage IV by FDG-PET/CT imaging.

TI  - Assessing the upper elevational limits of vegetation growth in global high-mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper elevational limits of vegetation growth in global high-mountains have been the focus for monitoring and assessment of climate change impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. However, existing studies have relied on field surveys that do not allow for large-scale analysis. Although remote sensing data have been used for local and regional monitoring of the vegetation upper boundaries, a global synthesis of the treeline and vegetation line (the upper altitudinal threshold for the existence of trees and the transition line from vegetation to bare land or permanent snow cover, respectively) in high-mountain ecosystems is still missing. To fill this gap, we developed two independent methods based on (1) the relationship between a Sentinel-2 vegetation index and elevation and (2) the European Space Agency's 10 m resolution land cover dataset (WorldCover), respectively, to automatically identify the upper elevational limits of treeline and vegetation line for each one-quarter degree grid across the global high-mountain areas. We obtained highly consistent results from the two methods, both of which are spatially consistent with ground surveyed treeline elevations. Our results are in line with the current understanding of the global distributions of tree and vegetation lines, which are observed at the highest elevations in the Tibetan plateau and decreasing for increasing latitudes. We find that the tree and vegetation lines are aspect dependent, reaching higher elevations on the equatorial-facing slopes than on the polar-facing slopes in high latitudes, and the opposite in the middle latitudes. Our analysis shows that mountain height is the dominant factor in determining the upper elevational limits of tree and vegetation lines across the globe, while climatic conditions and soil properties also play important roles at regional scales. Our study provides a framework for monitoring the tree and vegetation lines in global high-mountains and provides an important benchmark for further examining their long-term changes in response to climate change.

TI  - Modeling the impact of the future state of land use land cover change patterns on land surface temperatures beyond the frontiers of greater Kumasi: A coupled cellular automaton (CA) and Markov chains approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is ample evidence of the impact of land use/land cover (LULC) on land surface temperatures (LST) in Kumasi. However, the situation in the future is largely unknown. This study predicts the future state of LULC and LST in and beyond the frontiers of Greater Kumasi. The study used coupled Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Cellular-Automaton-Markov chains, and multiple regression to simulate the future state of LULC and LST for 2032 and 2042. Landsat imageries from 1986 to 2022 were acquired from USGS. Road networks, bus stops, and social centers were obtained from OpenStreetMap, and population density from the socioeconomic data and application center (SEDAC). Support vector machine (SVM) was used for image classification. Between 1986 and 2022, built-up areas increased by 18.63%; high-density forests decreased by 42.13%, whereas low-density forests increased by 20.21%. Between 1986 and 2042, the built-up area is expected to expand by 27%, high-density forests are likely to decline by 45%, whereas low-density forest are likely to increase by 19.097%. In contrast, water bodies and bare grounds are expected to decrease by 0.61% and 0.134%, respectively. Very high LSTs increased by 8.23% between 1986 and 2022. Between 1986 and 2042, LSTs are expected to increase spatially by 16.145%. Mean LSTs are expected to increase by 7.43 degrees C (36.03%) between 1986 and 2042. Urban expansion clearly drives the increase in LSTs, and this is more likely to persist in the future. These research findings therefore call for institutional and sector-based coordination between governmental institutions.

The results highlight that during the flu season, for every NPB game held at its home ballpark, there is an average increase of 0.18 cases per sentinel medical institution (SMI) between that week and the following week. The effects are robust to different specifications and placebo tests. This translates to about a 0.1% increase in the number of cases during the overlap of NPB and flu seasons.

TI  - A sensitivity analysis of a FAO-56 dual crop coefficient-based model under various field conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - FAO-56 dual crop coefficient (FAO-2Kc) based model are increasingly applied at large scale for agricultural water monitoring, requiring field-scale data over the spatial extent of interest. Given the lack of in-situ measurements, satellite products can be used to estimate indirectly the parameters through calibration. However, a lack of knowledge about model sensitivity can lead to suboptimal use of satellite data. This study aims to analyze the sensitivity of SAMIR, a FAO-2Kc-based model using satellite data. The Sobol method was applied for evapo-transpiration (ET) and deep percolation (DP) simulations on 37 contrasted agricultural seasons. Results indicate that SAMIR's sensitivity mainly depends on the modeled water stress. We proposed a proxy for the model sensitivity which can determine 84% (73%) of the ET (DP) among the agricultural seasons. An interaction analysis allowed reducing the calibration problem to the adjustment of only two parameters (a_Kcb and Zr_max), accounting for most of the sensitivity.

TI  - Landscape change assessment and its prediction in a mountainous gradient with diverse land-uses
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Land-use change is one of the main threats to the environment and natural resources nowadays. Dealing with the impacts of landscape change and its better management needs up-to-date information and data about the rate and amount of changes in different land-use types and spatial configurations. Remote sensing and landscape assessment provide diverse metrics for analyzing spatiotemporal changes over different scales. The purpose of this study is to quantifying the spatiotemporal analysis of landscape change index (LCI) during 1984 to 2016, and predicting the trend of land-use in 2030 using CA-Markov model. Toward this attempt, the Meshgin-Shahr area was chosen as a region with high potential in agriculture and tourism that has undergone many changes in recent decades. Landsat images were used to change detection, and landscape indices were calculated. Also, the LCI has been quantified in different time intervals under study. Also, the CA-Markov model was employed to predict the trend of changes in 2032. The values of CONTAG_MN, AREA_MN, CONNECT, and edge density (ED) landscape metrics have been increased at the class level. Assessing the trend of changes in the landscape metrics showed that the number of patch (NP), patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), ED, and total edge (TE) had a decreasing trend at the landscape level, which shows a significant decrease from 2008 to 2016. Accordingly, the value of the LCI was 6.67 in 2008-2016 as the most considerable value among consequent periods. Eventually, the LCI for the predicted period (2016-2032) equals 4.97. The result provides a basis for predicting the landscape characteristics in the future and will help managers to develop effective policies for the conservation of landscape integrity and connectivity.

TI  - Outdoor light at night, genetic predisposition and type 2 diabetes mellitus: A prospective cohort study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: According to animal and human epidemiologic studies, exposure to outdoor light at night (LAN) may cause circadian disruption, which may disturb sleep quality and lead to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).Methods: We followed 283,374 persons from 2006 through 2020. Outdoor LAN exposure was estimated using satellite data for individual address with 500 m2 scale buffer during follow-up. Incidence of T2DM was confirmed by hospital inpatient records. We identified potential confounders by a directed acyclic graph, including de-mographic, genetic, individual and regional level socioeconomic status, and environmental risk factors, and calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through time-varying Cox proportional hazard model. Furthermore, we examined the association of outdoor LAN with a defined health sleep scores and moderation of genetic predisposition and shift work on the relationship of outdoor LAN and incident T2DM. Results: We identified 7,775 incident T2DM cases over 3,027,505 person-years. Higher outdoor LAN exposures were significantly associated with higher risk of T2DM. The estimated HR for incident T2DM with an inter -quartile range (IQR: 11.22 nW/cm2/sr) increase in outdoor LAN was 1.05 (95%CI: 1.01, 1.09) in the fully adjusted model. Participants who lived in the highest quarter of outdoor LAN area were more likely to develop T2DM (HR: 1.14,95%CI: 1.02, 1.27). Besides, those who were exposed to higher levels of outdoor LAN had poorer sleep quality. No moderation role of PRS on outdoor LAN-induced T2DM observed both on the multi-plicated and additive scale. The hazards of outdoor LAN were observed in those who never owned a night shift work.Conclusion: Although further work is required to clarify potential mechanisms, our findings indicate that expo-sure to residential outdoor LAN may contribute to T2DM risk and low sleep quality.

TI  - A single-institution retrospective analysis of intraoperative radiation boost during breast-conservation treatment for breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background As part of a breast-conservation strategy for breast cancer, there are presently no data from randomized controlled studies on the use of intraoperative radiation (IORT) as a tumor bed boost. The effectiveness and safety of IORT as a boost therapy at a tertiary cancer center were retrospectively reviewed in this study. Methods Patients had breast-conserving surgery from 2012 to 2016 that included staging of the axillary lymph nodes, a single dose of 20 Gy IORT with 50-kV photons, whole-breast irradiation (WBI), and (neo-)adjuvant systemic treatment (if applicable). During the follow-up patients were monitored for the assessment of acute and late toxicities (using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03). Results included ipsilateral (IBTR), contralateral (CBE), and distant metastasis-free (DMFS) breast progression-free survival, as well as overall survival (OS). Results The 68 patients had a median follow-up of 91.5 months (with a range of 9-125). Most patients (n = 51) had T1 disease and were clinically node negative. Only a small number of individuals had triple negative or high-grade illness. The majority of patients had sentinel node biopsy, and three (4.4%) had to have their tumors removed again since their original margins were positive. Finally, there were no distinct tumor bed margins. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was administered to ten (14.7%). The median duration from BCS to WBI was 54.5 days, and conventionally fractionated WBI was used to accomplish WBI most frequently (n = 57, 96.6%). IORT was administered in a single 20 Gy dosage. 50 Gy was the median WBI dosage (range 40.05-50.4 Gy). There were no grade 4 adverse events for any patients in. Toxicities following surgery were minimal. There were only one patient with grade 3 toxicity (radiation dermatitis) to observe. Five tumor bed recurrences and two contralateral breast incident each occurred. Conclusion This work adds to the preliminary evidence already in the literature and supports the use of IORT in boost settings. When randomized trials like TARGIT-B are eventually published, these hopeful findings should be prospectively evaluated.

TI  - An improved algorithm for small and low-intensity fire detection in the temperate deciduous forests using MODIS data: a preliminary study in the Caspian Forests of Northern Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The past five decades have witnessed satellite remote sensing become one of the most efficient tools for fire detection and estimating total burned areas. Not all algorithms are appropriate for detecting high-temperature events on a global scale. It is difficult for traditional fire detection algorithms to capture small and low-intensity fires with significant accuracy. For this, we propose an improved fire detection algorithm by considering channel 4 and 11 mu m of MODIS data with two different thresholds for hot and cold seasons. Moreover, false alarm rejections caused by the edges of clouds are designed for this algorithm. The validation against 231 reference fires showed good performance of our algorithm over the northern forests of Iran. This algorithm detected 72 fires, while the MODIS fire product, a widely used source for fire detection, detected only 26 fires. The results indicate an outperformance of 19.91%. The results show that our algorithm for the fire detection method overperforms the traditional methods and can be particularly useful for fire detection in the northern forests of Iran and can be applied in similar forests worldwide.

TI  - Modeling outgoing long-wave radiation based on the atmospheric moisture parameters and correlated to the air temperature in Ethiopia
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 85% of the Ethiopian population's livelihood depends on rain-fed agriculture. Therefore, accurate climate estimation is quite useful to improve food security. However, the poor spatial resolution of satellite open access Outgoing Long-wave Radiation (OLR) data and the complicated relationship with the temperature and precipitation over variable topography features, the climate estimation is below the satisfactory level. Hence, to address this problem, this paper aimed to model OLR based on moisture parameters related to the air temperature in Ethiopia. European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) and satellite data from 1981 to 2020 has been used to develop a new OLR model. The atmospheric moisture budget equation was applied for the new OLR mode development. The results indicated that the seasonal variation moisture coefficient (alpha) for winter, spring, summer, and autumn is found 0.99, - 0.29, 0.91, and 0.98 m(3)w(-1) which is satisfied the model requirement. During winter, spring, summer, and autumn, the average value of OLR are found 269.60, 246.10, 247.90, and 255.60 Wm(-2) from satellite direct observation respectively; while from the developed model is found at 268.79, 244.01, 248.97 and 254.93 Wm(-2) respectively. Based on error matrices the developed mode is well agreed with satellite direct observation at a specific point and it is helpful to estimate OLR in the required spatial resolution. Generally the increment of the local moisture which is decreased OLR and increases the air temperature. Hence, stakeholders must pay high attention to the new OLR model adaptations for flood prevention and drought monitoring in Ethiopia.

TI  - Application of GIS-Based AHP Model for the Impact Assessment of COVID-19 Lockdown on Environment Quality: The Case of Kabul City, Afghanistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the industrial, financial, and social aspects of our daily life due to the implementation of lockdown to protect against the spread of the virus. In addition, the lockdown deduced by COVID-19 has promising positive impacts on air quality and environmental pollution. This study aims to monitor the effects of lockdown on environmental degradation during the pandemic in Kabul city, the capital of Afghanistan, using geospatial data and a statistical model of the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). To achieve the purpose of the study, the most essential influencing factors on air quality were generated from different sources using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and GIS environment; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index NDMI) were calculated using Sentinel-2MSI, Carbon Monoxide (CO) was obtained from Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, and land surface temperature was retrieved from MODIS data. The generated thematic layers (before COVID-19, and during a lockdown of COVID-19) were weighted and rated using the AHP analysis. The weighted layers were spatially overlayed to obtain the final output. Consequently, the environmental quality degradation maps before and during COVID-19 were generated to assess the differences over the 22 districts of Kabul city. The findings of the study show that Kabul city is covered by the very low, low, moderate, high, and very high degradation of the environment by 3.17%, 5.33%, 20.54%, 26.63%, 44.32% before COVID-19 in 201,9 respectively, while the percentages are changed to 4.37%, 8.99%. 16.55%, 37.47%, and 32.62% during the lockdown caused by COVID-19 in 2020. The changes in the percentage of environmental degradation in Kabul city particularly in high and very high zones confirm the positive impact of the lockdown of COVID-19.

TI  - ArcOLITIRS: A Toolbox for Radiometric Calibration and Surface Temperature Estimation from Landsat 8 Products in ArcGIS Environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ArcGIS, a leading geospatial software, provides a set of geoprocessing (GP) tools for image processing and raster analysis but lacks advanced image processing and analysis tools specifically for different sensors or camera models offered by other Digital Image Processing (DIP) software like ENVI or ERDAS IMAGINE. To address this gap ArcGIS platform provides an open structure for developers to add their algorithms for advanced image processing by creating custom extensions, tools, or add-ins. Therefore, in the present study, we developed an ArcOLITIRS Toolbox with python script tools for calibrating radiometric measurements and extracting Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Collection-1 (C1) and Collection-2 (C2) products. Tools are demonstrated based on a case study for the Landsat 8 scene (path: 142; row: 51) encompassing Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA) and its surrounding environments. The reason for selecting this region for the present study is that this area falls in the land-sea interface zone with many natural and anthropogenic processes which cover large LULC types. This region has experienced rapid urbanization and population growth in the last three decades, which led to major changes in land use patterns from natural vegetated surfaces to man-made artificial materials with increased heat absorption that reduces the surface albedo in the urban areas resulting in high LST values. Results of the tools are validated with the Landsat 8 metadata file, C2 Level-2 Surface Reflectance (SR) and Temperature (ST) products from USGS Earth Explorer, NDVI, and different LULC types, and observed the results provide similar results, patterns, and correlation. The tools are implemented as ArcPy script tools, offering complete access to geoprocessing in ArcGIS, an easy-to-use graphical user interface, and support batch processing. The source code is open to the community and extensible for future needs.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Accurately characterizing clouds and their shadows is a long-standing problem in the Earth Observation community. Recent works showcase the necessity to improve cloud detection methods for imagery acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellites. However, the lack of consensus and transparency in existing reference datasets hampers the benchmarking of current cloud detection methods. Exploiting the analysis-ready data offered by the Copernicus program, we created CloudSEN12, a new multi-temporal global dataset to foster research in cloud and cloud shadow detection. CloudSEN12 has 49,400 image patches, including (1) Sentinel-2 level-1C and level-2A multi-spectral data, (2) Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data, (3) auxiliary remote sensing products, (4) different hand-crafted annotations to label the presence of thick and thin clouds and cloud shadows, and (5) the results from eight state-of-the-art cloud detection algorithms. At present, CloudSEN12 exceeds all previous efforts in terms of annotation richness, scene variability, geographic distribution, metadata complexity, quality control, and number of samples.

TI  - Living in the World by Dying to the Self: Swami Vivekananda's Modernist Reconfigurations of a Premodern Vedantic Dialectic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HINDU STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is an exploration of the dialectic of this-worldly activism and the practice of self-effacement in Swami Vivekananda's discourses. He often exhorts his audiences to cultivate the vigorous strength to live courageously in the world on the basis of their spiritual conviction that they are rooted in the true self (atman) beyond all spatiotemporal limitations. The boundless atman, to be realized by effacing the egocentric self, would become the imperishable source of their fortitude to live with fearlessness in a world of suffering. Since the atman is not constrained by the egocentric bounds of the I, to become recentered in its illimitable heart is to move towards a universal morality. Through this return to one's imperishable center of existential gravity, one transcends fear and hatred of the other as a radically alien being. While his socioreligious worldview is imprinted with aspects of Advaita as formalized by S endorses the theocentric visions of Ramanuja and Madhva and declares that all these Vedantic pathways point towards the effacement of the ego and the generation of fearlessness.

TI  - A method for estimating surface soil moisture from diurnal land surface temperature observations over vegetated regions: A preliminary result over an AmeriFlux site and the REMEDHUS network
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most current optical/thermal-based surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval methods only utilize the instantaneous measurements made by onboard polar-orbit satellites, and they require soil texture as prior knowledge to obtain the volumetric SSM content. A recent study developed a diurnal land surface temperature (LST)-based SSM retrieval method to directly estimate the volumetric SSM content without the knowledge of soil texture. However, most subsequent studies have only examined the use of this method on bare soils. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the method over vegetated regions with both experimental data and satellite observations. First, the impacts of vegetation on SSM retrieval were investigated through physics-based Common Land Model simulations and high accuracy with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.010 m(3)m(-3) was achieved when the underlying surface was covered by moderate fractional vegetation cover from 0 to 0.6 with a given soil texture. Based on the simulated results, the SSM was then estimated using data from an AmeriFlux site dominated by crops during the growing season in 2018; the results were further verified using in situ measurements, and this showed that the estimated SSM correlated well with in-situ measurements (with an RMSE of 0.078 m(3)m(-3)). A further evaluation of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-derived SSM at the pixel scale was made using the proposed method, and the results revealed an overall acceptable accuracy (RMSE of 0.074 m(3)m(-3) and bias of 0.071 m(3)m(-3)) against the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SSM product at the same spatial resolution of 3 km.

TI  - Using satellite data to assess spatial drivers of bird diversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Birds are useful indicators of overall biodiversity, which continues to decline globally, despite targets to reduce its loss. The aim of this paper is to understand the importance of different spatial drivers for modelling bird distributions. Specifically, it assesses the importance of satellite-derived measures of habitat productivity, heterogeneity and landscape structure for modelling bird diversity across Great Britain. Random forest (RF) regression is used to assess the extent to which a combination of satellite-derived covariates explain woodland and farmland bird diversity and richness. Feature contribution analysis is then applied to assess the relationships between the response variable and the covariates in the final RF models. We show that much of the variation in farmland and woodland bird distributions is explained (R-2 0.64-0.77) using monthly habitat-specific productivity values and landscape structure (FRAGSTATS) metrics. The analysis highlights important spatial drivers of bird species richness and diversity, including high productivity grassland during spring for farmland birds and woodland patch edge length for woodland birds. The feature contribution provides insight into the form of the relationship between the spatial drivers and bird richness and diversity, including when a particular spatial driver affects bird richness positively or negatively. For example, for woodland bird diversity, the May 80th percentile Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for broadleaved woodland has a strong positive effect on bird richness when NDVI is >0.7 and a strong negative effect below. If relationships such as these are stable over time, they offer a useful analytical tool for understanding and comparing the influence of different spatial drivers.

TI  - Screening Patterns of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Children with Obesity in Canadian Primary Care: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common pediatric chronic liver disease, and children with a body mass index (BMI) >= 95th percentile are recommended to be screened for NAFLD by liver enzymes. Objectives. This study aimed to determine the frequency and predictors of screening for NAFLD among children with obesity in Canada and to evaluate a sample of children with suspected NAFLD. Methods. This cross-sectional study used data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network, a repository of electronic medical record data from Canadian primary care practices. Results. Of n = 110,827 children aged 9-18 years, 13.9% (n = 9,888) had a BMI >= 95(th) percentile. Only 8.7% (n = 859) of these patients were screened for NAFLD in the last year, and 23.6% (n = 2336) were ever screened. Using logistic regression, screening in the last year was associated with demographic and clinical characteristics, including previous liver enzyme assessment, prior antidiabetic prescription, and prior anxiolytic prescription. Among children with suspected NAFLD (n = 1,046), 34.7% had a BMI >= 99(th) percentile and approximately 8% were at increased risk of significant liver disease. Conclusion. The study revealed low screening rates for NAFLD in Canadian primary care and highlighted the important role of primary care providers in identifying and managing pediatric NAFLD.

TI  - Global gridded products efficiency in closing water balance models: various modeling scenarios for behavioral assessments
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, large-scale and remotely sensed products have been widely used, and this study aims to investigate the effect of precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) products on the performance of hydrological models, especially the water balance in Gheshlagh and Baghmalek basins in Iran with two different climates and model structures. For this purpose, five large-scale precipitation products, including CHIRPS, ERA, IMERG, TRMM, Terra and ET named GLEAM, SSEbop, MODIS, Terra, and Era, were implemented in five designed scenarios. These scenarios depend on how this information is applied and used in the model calibration process. Moreover, to evaluate the parametric behavior of these models, the uncertainties of their parameters were evaluated by the GLUE method. The parameters of the developed scenarios model with uncertain behavior were also measured in the main model. The results showed that in the absence of ground observations of precipitation or ET, the use of large-scale products in the mountainous and highland watersheds, where such measurements are not possible, is a suitable alternative for wrapping up the water balance equation. Using these products as the model input maintains model performance at the reference model level. The results also indicate that in the simultaneous calibration of ET and streamflow, the use of ET products improves the simulation of ET but reduces the accuracy of the simulated streamflow. No precipitation or ET product shows its best behavior in all conditions and all regions. This issue implies various products' functional values in different regions.

AB  - Globally, the biological invasion has been considered a major driver of biodiversity loss. Studies on the invasive species spatial extent, dynamics and its effects on LULC are currently scarce. In this context, we assessed the invasive dynamics of Prosopis juliflora in Kachchh Biosphere Reserve (KBR) using multi-temporal, multi-sensor satellite data and identified invasion trends using a spatial pattern mining tool. We identified statistically significant trends in the spatial distribution of Mesquite. Results revealed P. juliflora as an aggressive colonizer which has formed distinct scrub thickets. Currently, it occupies an area of 1363.5 km(2) with 1.3% of annual spread rate. Overall, 60.7% area increment was identified under Prosopis. The majority of invasion hotspots are concentrated in the buffer zone (50.1%) and transition zone (37.4%). Spatial trends indicate the prevalence of sporadic Hotspot subsequently, intensifying, consecutive and new hotspots. All BR zones are experiencing severe ecological threats from this noxious mesquite. The generated information can serve as baseline input for conservation planners and managers for systematic planning.

TI  - Path analysis and mediating effects of influencing factors of land use carbon emissions in Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use carbon emission is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases. In order to achieve carbon reduction, it is crucial to clarify the pathways of land use carbon emission influencing factors. The article takes Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration as the study area, combines the land use remote sensing data and energy consumption statistics from 1995 to 2018, and uses the STIRPAT extended model to identify the economic, population, energy, technology, policy, land and opening-up level as the latent variables affecting the land use carbon emission in the study area, to establish PLS-SEM to explore the influence of latent variables on dependent variables and the interaction between latent variables. The results show that the seven selected latent variables had good explanatory power on land use carbon emission with R2 reaching 0.983. Economy, population, energy and land - the latent variables in this study - can directly influence land use carbon emission. This study found that land was the most important factor in increasing land use carbon emissions, with a path coefficient of 1.471, while economy played a negative role, with a path coefficient of -1.401. Latent variables other than energy and land all had mediating effects on the dependent variable or the remaining latent variables directly or indirectly. In-direct effects included complete mediation and partial mediation. For example, technology and opening-up level cannot directly influence the dependent variable, but can have a completely indirect effect by affecting energy (complete mediation). The fitness and superiority of the model developed in this paper were extremely high, with values of 0.067 and 0.846 for SRMR and GOF, respectively. This study helps to clarify the influence paths of land use carbon emission and figuratively depicts the path direction and degree of influence among influencing factors, which will help Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration achieve carbon emission reduction.

TI  - Contribution of time-series data cubes to classify urban vegetation types by remote sensing
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping urban vegetation types is important for urban planning and assessing environmental justice. Nowadays, despite data cubes projects are providing Analysis Ready Data to facilitate time-series analysis, we did not found studies employing these data for improving urban vegetation mapping. By relying solely on open data and software, this work proposes and evaluates the integration of time-series data cubes in a hybrid image classifi-cation method to map the intra-urban space, differentiating Tree cover and Herb-shrub. The urban area of Goiania, Goias, Brazil, is the study area. The hybrid method combined object-based classification of a pan -sharpened CBERS-4A WPM image (spatial resolution of 2 m) with the pixel-based classification of Sentinel-2 MSI time-series data cubes (10 m). Both approaches used the Random Forest algorithm. Objects from the CBERS-4A segmentation composed the spatial unit of analysis and the class assignment depended on the Sentinel-2 time-series urban land cover probabilities. Based on both Maps probabilities, Shannon entropy was calculated to attribute the final urban land cover to the objects. Urban land cover probabilities presented similar spatial distribution patterns for both classification approaches. Regarding the thematic maps, the Herb-shrub cover area was 35% higher in Sentinel-2 time-series classification than in GEOBIA classification, but Tree cover was 21% lower. In general, 75% of the study area was equally classified by the initial approaches. However, for 9% of the remaining area, the hybrid classification improved vegetation classes accuracies by 35%, contributing to the vegetation covers identification. Thus, this study contributes to methodological procedures for urban land cover study and demonstrates that hybrid maps based on open data are effective to reduce classification mistakes, allowing more accurate monitoring, planning, and designing of different urban vegeta-tion types. Future research efforts should focus on scale compatibility between data of different spatial resolu-tions and expand the use of data cubes to integrate time-series information into the GEOBIA classification.

TI  - Field assessment of parasitism on the New Zealand endemic<i> Nyctemera</i><i> annulata</i> by<i> Cotesia</i><i> urabae:</i> Can non-target impacts be ruled out?
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotesia urabae is biological control agent (BCA) that was introduced in New Zealand in 2011 against the Eucalyptus defoliating lepidopteran pest Uraba lugens. During pre-and post-release host specificity testing, one non-target moth, the New Zealand endemic Nyctemera annulata, was occasionally attacked, albeit a poor physiological host for C. urabae development. With the BCA now established in the New Zealand environment, we undertook a sentinel larval trial in the field, which included artificial releases of C. urabae, to assess non -target impacts in habitats, either with or without the presence of the target host and its host plant. Approxi-mately two-thirds of all sentinel larvae released in the field were successfully recovered and reared in the lab-oratory to obtain parasitism. In the overlapping choice habitat (i.e., both target and non-target hosts present along with their host plants), the BCA C. urabae was recovered from 22.3% and 3.1% of target and non-target larvae, respectively. In the habitat devoid of Eucalyptus and its target larvae, C. urabae parasitised only 0.2% of the non-target, suggesting the BCA had immediately dispersed from release sites devoid of host cues. The non -target N. annulata was at greater risk of attack where the habitat overlap was most significant. This provided invaluable data to calibrate non-target risk models. Most importantly, the generalist parasitoids Diolcogaster perniciosus and Meteorus pulchricornis (Braconidae), which were also recovered in our field trials, had a much greater impact upon N. annulata than the specialist BCA.

TI  - Wheat yield estimation using remote sensing data based on machine learning approaches
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate predictions of wheat yields are essential to farmers'production plans and to the international trade in wheat. However, only poor approximations of the productivity of wheat crops in China can be obtained using traditional linear regression models based on vegetation indices and observations of the yield. In this study, Sentinel-2 (multispectral data) and ZY-1 02D (hyperspectral data) were used together with 15709 gridded yield data (with a resolution of 5 m x 5 m) to predict the winter wheat yield. These estimates were based on four mainstream data-driven approaches: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). The method that gave the best estimate of the winter wheat yield was determined, and the accuracy of the estimates based on multispectral and hyperspectral data were compared. The results showed that the LSTM model, for which the RMSE of the estimates was 0.201 t/ha, performed better than the RF (RMSE = 0.260 t/ha), GBDT (RMSE = 0.306 t/ha), and SVR (RMSE = 0.489 t/ha) methods. The estimates based on the ZY-1 02D hyperspectral data were more accurate than those based on the 30-m Sentinel-2 data: RMSE = 0.237 t/ha for the ZY-1 02D data, which is about a 5% improvement on the RSME of 0.307 t/ha for the 30-m Sentinel-2 data. However, the 10-m Sentinel-2 data performed even better, giving an RMSE of 0.219 t/ha. In addition, it was found that the greenness vegetation index SR (simple ratio index) outperformed the traditional vegetation indices. The results highlight the potential of the shortwave infrared bands to replace the visible and near-infrared bands for predicting crop yields Our study demonstrates the advantages of the deep learning method LSTM over machine learning methods in terms of its ability to make accurate estimates of the winter wheat yield.

TI  - Unexpected resilience in relict <i>Abies pinsapo</i> Boiss forests to dieback and mortality induced by climate change
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute and early symptoms of forest dieback linked to climate warming and drought episodes have been reported for relict Abies pinsapo Boiss. fir forests from Southern Spain, particularly at their lower ecotone. Satellite, orthoimages, and field data were used to assess forest decline, tree mortality, and gap formation and recolonization in the lower half of the altitudinal range of A. pinsapo forests (850-1550 m) for the last 36 years (1985-2020). Field surveys were carried out in 2003 and in 2020 to characterize changes in stand canopy structure and mortality rates across the altitudinal range. Time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the end of the dry season (derived from Landsat 5 and 7 imagery) were used for a Dynamic Factor Analysis to detect common trends across altitudinal bands and topographic solar incidence gradients (SI). Historical canopy cover changes were analyzed through aerial orthoimages classification. Here we show that extensive decline and mortality contrast to the almost steady alive basal area for 17 years, as well as the rising photosynthetic activity derived from NDVI since the mid-2000s and an increase in the forest canopy cover in the late years at mid and high altitudes. We hypothesized that these results suggest an unexpected resilience in A. pinsapo forests to climate change-induced dieback, that might be promoted by compensation mechanisms such as (i) recruitment of new A. pinsapo individuals; (ii) facilitative effects on such recruitment mediated by revegetation with other species; and (iii) a 'release effect' in which surviving trees can thrive with fewer resource competition. Future research is needed to understand these compensation mechanisms and their scope in future climate change scenarios.

TI  - Assessing probability of failure of urban landslides through rapid characterization of soil properties and vegetation distribution
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major natural hazard, threatening communities and infrastructure worldwide. The mitigation of these hazards relies on the understanding of their causes and triggering processes, which depends directly on soil properties, land use, and their changes over time. In this study, we propose a novel framework to estimate the probability of failure in highly developed urban areas. The framework combines remote sensing and geophysical data to estimate soil properties and land covers. Such estimate properties are then integrated into a hydrogeomechanical model to provide a robust estimate of the probability of failure. To assess the importance and sensitivity of the input parameters to the probability of failure assessment, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the seven main parameters (density, friction angle, cohesion, soil thickness, slope, water recharge and saturated hydraulic conductivity) of the hydro-geomechanical model. Slope angle, soil thickness and cohesion are shown to be the most important parameters. While the slope angle can be derived from high-resolution digital elevation models, soil thickness and cohesion cannot be assessed. To incorporate the variability of these two parameters into the model, seismic noise measurements were performed to estimate soil thickness. Supervised classification of remote sensing data was used to map vegetation type and related root cohesion, which can impact the cohesion significantly. The results show that slopes with relatively thick soil layers (above 2 m) have up to four times higher probability of failure. Slopes with tall vegetation cover, and hence comparably high root cohesion, reduce the probability of failure, particularly when the soil layer is relatively thin (< 3 m). The developed approach makes use of rapid to acquire geophysical and easily to obtain remote sensing data, and hence is transferable to other study sites. This approach may be of particular importance to areas of active vegetation management that may cause considerable changes in landslide hazard maps.

TI  - Ecosystem extent mapping by integrating Landsat 8, PALSAR-2, and GEDI lidar
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem extent is one of the essential biodiversity variables under the class of ecosystem structure. Due to the scarcity of all elements of an ecosystem, landcover is often used as a proxy though it constitutes only one aspect of it. When landcover is used as a proxy, ecosystem extent and its dynamics can be monitored using remotely sensed datasets. We used spectral, textural, and structural metrics derived from Landsat 8, Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) light detection and ranging (lidar) datasets of the growing season to delineate ecosystem extents at one instant of time in the Gambella region of Ethiopia. The discrete samples of the GEDI canopy height metric were first extrapolated continuously over the study area and stacked with the rest of the datasets before using it in the classification process. Using the random forest classification algorithm, seven landcover classes were generated with an overall classification accuracy of 95.7% and 93.5% kappa coefficient of agreement. Textural, structural, and spectral features constitute the top 5 most important variables for classification. The addition of the canopy height variable also improved the overall classification accuracy by 4%. Our study suggests that combining structural, spectral, and textural variables yields much greater accuracy than using any single source data.

TI  - Modelled direct causes of dust emission change (2001-2020) in southwestern USA and implications for management
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - North American observed atmospheric dust has shown large variability over the last two decades, coinciding with regional patterns of vegetation and wind speed changes. Dust emission models provide the potential to explain how these direct causes of vegetation and wind speed changes are related to changing dust emission. However, those dust models which assume land cover types are homogeneous over vegetation classes and fixed over time, are unlikely to adequately represent changing aerodynamic roughness of herbaceous cover, woody cover, and litter. To overcome these model limitations and explain changing (2001-2020) dust emission, we used a new MODIS albedo-based dust emission model calibrated to satellite-observed magnitude and frequency of dust emission point source (DPS) data. We focused our work on four regions of southwestern USA, identified pre-viously as the main dust emission sources. We classified the interplay of controlling factors (wind speed and aerodynamic roughness) which created disturbance regimes with dust emission change consistent with diverse land use and management drivers. Our calibrated model results show that dust emission is increasing or decreasing, in different regions, at different times, for different reasons, consistent with the absence of a secular change of observed atmospheric dust. Our work demonstrates that using this calibrated dust emission model, sensitive to changing vegetation structure and configuration and wind speeds, provides new insights to the contemporary factors controlling dust emission. With this same approach, the prospect is promising for modelling historical and future dust emission responses using prognostic albedo in Earth System Modelling.

T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing desertification and aeolian erosion processes in the southern Gobi Desert are ranked as one of the most significant global environmental disasters. In this study, we analyzed the decadal progress of eolian erosion in the southern Gobi Desert and traced key factors controlling intensified land degradation (LD) and sand and dust (SD) generation employing satellite data and climatic variables. Columnar dust mass density from climatic data re-analyses as a major SD tracer was combined with the Mann-Kendall (MK) method and the empirical orthogonal function processor. Validation was performed by using ground data sets and field evidence from reference locations. The results revealed that (1) LD/SD patterns and hotspots in the Gobi Desert are significantly controlled by the distribution and trend of precipitation; (2) climatic conditions in the Mongolian Gobi Desert have shifted towards an unfavourable direction with respect to the LD/SD occurrence; (3) surface conditions in southeastern Mongolia have somehow decoupled from the weather factors and the transition zone between the desert and the vegetated terrain has gradually expanded probably due to anthropogenic activities. The correlation analyses between all candidate driving factors of LD/SD indicated that a major control mechanism of spatiotemporal migration of LD/SD in the southern Gobi Desert is the change in precipitation, whereas anthropogenic activity holds a secondary control. The results obtained can be used to prioritize intervention zones in the frame of land use planning processes aimed at adapting to climate change and mitigating LD and SD generation in source areas.

TI  - Three-dimensional observations of particulate organic carbon in shallow eutrophic lakes from space
T2  - WATER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) storage play an essential role in determining carbon sinks and water quality in shallow eutrophic lakes. Although satellite data have been adopted to observe surface POC content, the previous remote sensing results cannot indicate water column-integrated POC storage in shallow eutrophic lakes with vertically nonuniform POC profiles. Based on 272 in-situ POC profiles collected from 19 shallow eutrophic lakes in China's Yangtze-Huai Plain (YHP), this study developed a novel process-oriented method to derive water column-integrated POC storage from OLCI/Sentinel-3A satellite data. The method included three critical steps: remotely estimating surface POC contents, identifying POC profile types (uniform, exponential decay, or power decay) through a binary decision tree, and parameterizing POC profiles using surface POC concentrations. The developed algorithms showed a bias of -25.79% for in-situ match-ups from 15 lakes (N = 88). The POC in the eutrophic lakes was mainly produced by phytoplankton (R2 = 0.87). As a result, the surface POC content pre-sented a unimodal peak in summer. However, in addition to air temperature regulations (0.52 - 68.53%), the water level also showed apparent effects on increasing POC storage, with relative contributions of 29.29 - 95.51% for the six largest lakes. Therefore, multisource satellite data are needed to derive POC storage in global eutrophic lakes remotely. This study is the first attempt to three-dimensionally observe lake POC contents from space and is important for understanding the carbon cycle in shallow eutrophic lakes.

TI  - Pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion induced by amyloid transthyretin in human cardiac fibroblasts
T2  - BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracellular aggregates of wild-type human transthyretin are associated with heart diseases such as wild-type transthyretin (TTR)-derived amyloidosis (ATTR-wt). Due to their strategic location, cardiac fibroblasts act as sentinel cells that sense injury and activate the inflammasome. No studies of the effects of TTR amyloid aggregation on the secretion of inflammatory factors by primary human cardiac fibroblasts (hCFs) have been reported yet. The intracellular internalization of TTR aggregates, which correspond to the early stage of ATTR-wt, were determined using immunofluorescence and Western blotting of cell lysates. A further objective of this study was to analyze the secretion of inflammatory factors by hCFs after analysis of TTR amyloid aggregation using X-MAP (R) Luminex Assay techniques. We show that TTR aggregates are internalized in hCFs and induce the secretion of both Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide(NT-proBNP). Also, pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are secreted without significant changes in the levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). In conclusion, these findings suggest that IL-6 and IL-8 play important roles in the development of ATTR-wt, and indicate that IL-6 in particular could be a potentially important therapeutic target in patients with ATTR-wt.

T2  - NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - As water is considered one of the essential assets of nature, the recognition of the availability of water at a specific location can help government bodies to take necessary action toward water conservation. Monitoring water from satellite images is considered one of the most difficult areas of pattern recognition. In this manner, a novel multi-level feature fusion approach is proposed to predict the pattern of water concerning a specific location to analyze the scale and availability. The proposed framework can access the spatial features from sentinel-2 images by utilizing the concept of structural learning. For evaluating the prediction performance, the calculated outcomes are compared with the traditional and modern pattern recognition approaches. It has been observed that the proposed approach is more robust in terms of pattern analysis as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on different training and testing ratios such as 70:30, 75:25, and 80:20. In this manner, the calculated outcomes define the pattern recognition efficiency of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art approaches by achieving 94.51% of accuracy.

TI  - Artificial intelligence convolutional neural networks map giant kelp forests from satellite imagery
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is producing shifts in the distribution and abundance of marine species. Such is the case of kelp forests, important marine ecosystem-structuring species whose distributional range limits have been shifting worldwide. Synthesizing long-term time series of kelp forest observations is therefore vital for understanding the drivers shaping ecosystem dynamics and for predicting responses to ongoing and future climate changes. Traditional methods of mapping kelp from satellite imagery are time-consuming and expensive, as they require high amount of human effort for image processing and algorithm optimization. Here we propose the use of mask region-based convolutional neural networks (Mask R-CNN) to automatically assimilate data from open-source satellite imagery (Landsat Thematic Mapper) and detect kelp forest canopy cover. The analyses focused on the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera along the shorelines of southern California and Baja California in the northeastern Pacific. Model hyper-parameterization was tuned through cross-validation procedures testing the effect of data augmentation, and different learning rates and anchor sizes. The optimal model detected kelp forests with high performance and low levels of overprediction (Jaccard's index: 0.87 +/- 0.07; Dice index: 0.93 +/- 0.04; over prediction: 0.06) and allowed reconstructing a time series of 32 years in Baja California (Mexico), a region known for its high variability in kelp owing to El Nino events. The proposed framework based on Mask R-CNN now joins the list of cost-efficient tools for long-term marine ecological monitoring, facilitating well-informed biodiversity conservation, management and decision making.

TI  - On the joint use of scattering and damping models to predict X-band co-polarized backscattering from a slick-covered sea surface
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, sea surface scattering with and without surfactants is predicted using the two-scale boundary perturbation model (BPM) and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM) augmented with two different damping models, i.e., the Marangoni one and the model of local balance (MLB). Numerical predictions are showcased for both mineral oil and biogenic slicks. They are contrasted with actual satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) measurements collected at X-band by the German TerraSAR-X sensor over mineral oil and plant oil slicks of known origin. Experimental results show that the two-scale BPM augmented with the Marangoni damping model is more suitable for predicting the normalized radar cross section and the damping ratio of plant oil (biogenic) slicks. In contrast, the AIEM combined with the damping MLB results in a better agreement with SAR measurements collected over mineral oil slicks.

TI  - Avoiding Overtreatment of Women?70 With Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Provider-Level Deimplementation Strategy
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: National guidelines recommend against routine axillary staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) in women >70 y with early stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and clinically negative axilla; however, these practices remain common. Methods: We conducted a prospective pilot study from August 2021 to 2022 using an intervention targeting breast surgeons and radiation oncologists in Michigan that aimed to reduce SLNB and RT in eligible patients. The intervention consisted of (1) a geriatric assessment, (2) an assessment of the patient's medical maximizing-minimizing preferences, and (3) a tailored script with counterpoints to reasons patients commonly seek SLNB or RT. At the end of the study period, participants completed a survey providing feedback with the primary outcomes being: acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, and intention and motivation to use the materials based on validated measures.Results: Participants (n 1/4 23) included 15 breast surgeons and 8 radiation oncologists. Collectively, the materials were used with 115 patients. Considering all materials holistically, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention were high; participants also intended and were motivated to use the intervention. Scores across all measures were highest for the geriatric assessment and lowest for the tailored script. The major barriers to using the intervention were limited time and instances of disagreement on treatment recommendations among surgeons and radiation oncologists.Conclusions: The omission of SLNB and adjuvant RT should be discussed in appropriately selected patients. A multifaceted provider-level deimplementation strategy may be an effective means for achieving this goal.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Localizing the UNGPs - An Afrocentric Approach to Interpreting Pillar II
T2  - BUSINESS AND HUMAN RIGHTS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an alternative epistemic worldview of the corporate responsibility to respect human rights (CR2R) as a norm. It examines how an Afrocentric interpretation of the CR2R norm can contribute to a relational system where corporations promote human rights in African host communities. It uses an African norm - Ubuntu - to reframe and reinterpret Pillar II in Afrocentric terms. It argues that this reframing is important for three reasons. First, Ubuntu reframing increases the CR2R norm's intelligibility in Africa because it clarifies and contextualizes the term 'respect' used in Pillar II. Second, reframing the CR2R norm through Ubuntu fills the ethical gap in the interpretation of the CR2Rnorm. Third, an Ubuntu-inspired interpretation insulates the CR2R norm from some scholars' critique that the CR2R norm's scope is narrow because it only encourages MNCs to avoid infringing on the human rights of others without prescribing positive obligations. This paper then examines channels through which Ubuntu can influence the CR2R norm.

TI  - Evolution and refinement of magnetically guided sentinel lymph node detection in breast cancer: meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) have been used as a tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) localization in breast cancer, demonstrating comparable performance to the combination of radioisotope (RI) and blue dye (BD). Methods A systematic literature search and meta-analysis with subgroup and meta-regression analysis were undertaken to update the available evidence, assess technique evolution, and define knowledge gaps. Recommendations were made using the GRADE approach. Results In 20 comparative studies, the detection rate was 97.5 per cent for SPIO and 96.5 per cent for RI +/- BD (risk ratio 1.006, 95 per cent c.i. 0.992 to 1.019; P = 0.376, high-certainty evidence). Neoadjuvant therapy, injection site, injection volume or nodal metastasis burden did not affect the detection rate, but injection over 24 h before surgery increased the detection rate on meta-regression. Concordance was 99.0 per cent and reverse concordance 97.1 per cent (rate difference 0.003, 95 per cent c.i. -0.009 to 0.015; P = 0.656, high-certainty evidence). Use of SPIO led to retrieval of slightly more SLNs (pooled mean 1.96 versus 1.89) with a higher nodal detection rate (94.1 versus 83.5 per cent; RR 1.098, 1.058 to 1.140; P < 0.001; low-certainty evidence). In meta-regression, injection over 24 h before surgery increased the SPIO nodal yield over that of RI +/- BD. The skin-staining rate was 30.8 per cent (very low-certainty evidence), and possibly prevented with use of smaller doses and peritumoral injection. Conclusion The performance of SPIO is comparable to that of RI +/- BD. Preoperative injection increases the detection rate and nodal yield, without affecting concordance. Whether skin staining and MRI artefacts are reduced by lower dose and peritumoral injection needs to be investigated.The magnetic technique for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has gained interest and popularity in recent years. In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, the performance of the magnetic technique was comparable to that of the isotope and blue dye combination for SLN detection (97.5 versus 96.5 per cent; risk ratio 1.006, 95 per cent c.i. 0.992 to 1.019; P = 0.376). The magnetic technique provides flexibility and facilitates logistics. Further research should focus on the existing knowledge gaps, namely expansion of novel techniques such as delayed SLN biopsy and reduction of the risk of skin staining and artefacts on postoperative MRI.

TI  - Geospatial approaches of TGSI and morphometric analysis in the Mahi River basin using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and SRTM-DEM
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The research objective is to assess the Mahi River basin, morphometric parameters, and structurally controlled morphological terrains about the topsoil grain size index (TGSI), based on satellite data including Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and SRTM-DEM data, using ArcGIS processing software. According to morphometric analysis, the Mahi River basin has an area of 28,844.2 km(2) and is a drainage basin of the 8(th) order. In the sub-basin (SB8), bifurcation ratio reveals structural and geomorphological disorder, and high sinuosity causes significant meandering. These positive dependency factors, such as drainage density (Dd) and stream frequency (Sf), are increasing in SB7, SB8, SB12, and SB13, which results in high permeability, strong runoff, a flat topography, and a gentle slope. TGSI has been performed to analyze the geomorphological features of the structurally controlled Mahi River. The Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS has been utilized for the TGSI analysis, and SRTM-DEM has been utilized for the extraction of structurally controlled lineaments of the river basin. The resultant structurally controlled terrains have been cross-verified based on the DN reflectance of TGSI and the lineament type in the river basin for the morphometry. The results of the TGSI reveal that the minimum and maximum values are -0.1324 and 0.4207; the dominant type of terrain is pediment pediplain complex (PPC), having the TGSI range 0.1322 to 0.4207 with the fracture-type structural dominance with an area of 56.7% of the total area. The results reveal that the structural linear features in the Mahi catchment consist of structural deformed bodies such as faults, fractures, and ridge plains. Thus, it can be observed from the findings that remote sensing data (SRTM-DEM) combined with GIS methodology prove to be an effective tool in morphometric analysis and TGSI data could be utilized in the future for basin management and other hydrological studies.

TI  - Wet tropospheric correction for satellite altimetry using SIRGAS-CON products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODETIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The wet tropospheric correction (WTC) is a required correction to satellite altimetry measurements, mainly due to the atmospheric water vapor delay. On-board microwave radiometers (MWR) provide information for WTC estimation but fail in coastal zones and inland waters. In view to recover the WTC in these areas, the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-derived Path Delay Plus (GPD+) method, developed by the University of Porto, uses Zenith Tropospheric Delays from GNSS global and regional networks' stations combined with other sources of information, providing a WTC solution for all along-track altimeter points. To densify the existing dataset used by GPD+, it is necessary to add new GNSS stations, mainly in the southern hemisphere, in regions such as South America, Africa and Oceania. This work aims to exploit the SIRGAS-CON data and its potential for densification of the GPD+ input dataset in Latin America and to improve GPD+ performance. The results for the three analyzed satellites (Sentinel-3A, Sentinel-3B and CryoSat-2) show that, when compared with the WTC from GNSS and radiosondes, the densified GPD+ WTC leads to a reduction in the RMS of the WTC differences with respect to the non-densified GPD+ solution, up to 2 mm for the whole region and up to 5 mm in some locations.

TI  - Hospital-acquired bacterial infections in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Israel
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:We sought to determine incidence of common hospital-acquired bacteria among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients in Israeli general hospitals during the first year of the pandemic. Methods:We analyzed routinely collected incidence data to determine hospital acquisition of the following sentinel bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Clostridioides difficile. We examined 3 acquisition measures: (1) sentinel bacteria, (2) sentinel bacteremia, and (3) antimicrobial-resistant sentinel bacteremia. The study period was March 1, 2020, through January 31, 2021. Results:Analysis of pooled data from the 26 hospitals surveyed revealed that rates were higher for all 3 acquisition measures among COVID-19 patients than they were among patients on general medical wards in 2019, but lower than those among patients in intensive care units in 2019. The incidence rate was highest during the first COVID-19 wave, despite a lower proportion of severe COVID-19 cases among total hospitalized during this wave. Wide variation in incidence was evident between hospitals. Conclusions:Hospitalized COVID-19 patients experienced nosocomial bacterial infection at rates higher than those of patients on pre-pandemic general medical wards, adding to the complexity of their care. Lower rates of nosocomial infection after the first wave, despite higher proportions of severely ill patients, suggest that healthcare worker practices, rather than patient-related factors, were responsible for most of these infections.

TI  - Evaluating the Effect of External DEMs on the Accuracy of InSAR DEM Generation
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the production of digital elevation models (DEMs) by using the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique has become more useful compared to traditional methods. When DEM production is carried out by using this technique, an external DEM is used in the image processing steps. In this study, new DEMs were produced from an interferometric pair of TerraSAR-X images by using SRTM, ALOSW3D, TANDEM-X and STEREO DEMs with spatial resolutions of 90 m, 30 m, 12 m and 5 m, respectively. In addition, in situ measurements were carried out to collect control points and the accuracy of the obtained products was analyzed. The accuracy of the products obtained by using root mean square error, standard deviation and correlation coefficients were compared. The results obtained in this study demonstrated the effect of external DEMs in the DEM production stage with InSAR pairs and how accuracy increases with better external DEMs. In addition, the effect of the external DEM quality used was shown in the results. It was determined that provided the STEREO DEM reached the highest accuracy with the root mean square error value of 1.52 m. Also, analyzes were made according to different zones. According to the results, it was observed that the statistical errors increased in areas where the slope was steeper. While the RMSE of the rolling zone is 1.17 m, rugged zone is 2.33 m. The analysis results of the other DEMs from high to low quality were TANDEM-X, ALOSW3D and SRTM, respectively. It is thought that the results of this study can help to produce data with the required sensitivity in DEM production.

TI  - A compilation of global bio-optical in situ data for ocean colour satelliteapplications - version three
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A global in situ data set for validation of ocean colour products from the ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) is presented. This version of the compilation, starting in 1997, now extends to 2021, which is important for the validation of the most recent satellite optical sensors such as Sentinel 3B OLCI and NOAA-20 VIIRS. The data set comprises in situ observations of the following variables: spectral remote-sensing reflectance, concentration of chlorophyll-a, spectral inherent optical properties, spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient, and total suspended matter. Data were obtained from multi-project archives acquired via open internet services or from individual projects acquired directly from data providers. Methodologies were implemented for homogenization, quality control, and merging of all data. Minimal changes were made on the original data, other than conversion to a standard format, elimination of some points, after quality control and averaging of observations that were close in time and space. The result is a merged table available in text format. Overall, the size of the data set grew with 148 432 rows, with each row representing a unique station in space and time (cf. 136 250 rows in previous version; Valente et al., 2019). Observations of remote-sensing reflectance increased to 68 641 (cf. 59 781 in previous version; Valente et al., 2019). There was also a near tenfold increase in chlorophyll data since 2016. Metadata of each in situ measurement (original source, cruise or experiment, principal investigator) are included in the final table. By making the metadata available, provenance is better documented and it is also possible to analyse each set of data separately.

TI  - Assessing the impact of ecological security and forest fire susceptibility on carbon stocks in Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province, Vietnam
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An assessment index of landscape ecological security (LES), different from other ecological models namely Pressure-State-Response (PSR), will be more accurate to capture temporal and geographic changes in landscape as well as ecosystem resilience and resistance to interference. In the present study, the impact of ecological security and forest fires on the carbon stock of forests in Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province, central Vietnam was evaluated and analyzed based on remote sensing data and a hybrid model of ant colony optimization (ACO) and neuro-fuzzy system (NFS). The present study indicated that forest fires are generally high throughout the study area, concentrating on areas exposed to and affected by human reclamation and production activities. The artificial neural network (ANN) model based on principal component analysis (PCA) combined Sentinel-1A data performed a higher prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.74), being much greater than biomass estimation using optical data. It reveals that there is a reliability in estimating the aboveground carbon stocks (AGCs) from the above-ground biomass (AGB). The calculated data suggest the AGCs in the study area is high, but these parameters will loss severely in the coming years due to the nature and humans impacts. These results show that utilizing remote sensing combined with PCA-ANN model would have increased the accuracy of forest fire susceptibility, and detected assessment of the LES and forest fires on the AGCs. The above obtainings supply helpful information for managers and forest rangers to guard the forests in the study area better, and to limit human encroachment, thereby offering actions that contribute to sustainable development.

TI  - Global seamless and high-resolution temperature dataset (GSHTD), 2001-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (Ts) and near-surface air temperature (Ta) are key parameters in multiple research fields. In this study, a global seamless (without missing values) and high-resolution (30 arcsecond spatial res-olution) temperature (for both Ts and Ta) dataset (GSHTD) from 2001 to 2020 was developed. First, a method called the estimation of the temperature difference (ETD) was proposed to reconstruct both clear-and cloudy-sky Ts. A global seamless 8-day and monthly average all-and clear-sky Ts data were then created using the MODIS Ts data and the ETD method. The seamless monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum Ta data were further developed using the seamless Ts data, in situ Ta data and Cubist machine learning algorithm. GSHTD has four main advantages. First, GSHTD includes seven types of temperature data: clear-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, all-sky daytime and nighttime Ts, and mean, maximum and minimum Ta. Second, it has global coverage and high spatial resolution. Third, using the ETD method proposed in this study, GSHTD has no missing values. Fourth, the accuracy of GSHTD is high; the average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of ETD in reconstructing the 25 x 25 and 150 x 150 pixel clear-sky daytime (nighttime) Ts data were 0.724 (0.552) and 1.024 (0.895) degrees C, respectively. The MAEs of ETD were on average 23.2% and 23.7% lower than those of Remotely Sensed DAily land Surface Temperature reconstruction (RSDAST) and interpolation of the mean anomalies (IMAs). The MAEs of the estimated monthly average of the mean, maximum and minimum Ta data were 0.797, 0.994 and 1.056 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Morroniside ameliorates inflammatory skeletal muscle atrophy <i>via</i> inhibiting canonical and non-canonical NF-κB and regulating protein synthesis/degradation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - No drug options exist for skeletal muscle atrophy in clinical, which poses a huge socio-economic burden, making development on drug interventions a general wellbeing need. Patients with a variety of pathologic conditions associated with skeletal muscle atrophy have systemically elevated inflammatory factors. Morroniside, derived from medicinal herb Cornus officinalis, possesses anti-inflammatory effect. However, whether and how morroniside combat muscle atrophy remain unknown. Here, we identified crucial genetic associations between TNF alpha/NF-kappa B pathway and grip strength based on population using 377,807 European participants from the United Kingdom Biobank dataset. Denervation increased TNF alpha in atrophying skeletal muscles, which inhibited myotube formation in vitro. Notably, morroniside treatment rescued TNF alpha-induced myotube atrophy in vitro and impeded skeletal muscle atrophy in vivo, resulting in increased body/muscles weights, No. of satellite cells, size of type IIA, IIX and IIB myofibers, and percentage of type IIA myofibers in denervated mice. Mechanistically, in vitro and/or in vivo studies demonstrated that morroniside could not only inhibit canonical and non-canonical NF-kappa B, inflammatory mediators (IL6, IL-1b, CRP, NIRP3, PTGS2, TNF alpha), but also down-regulate protein degradation signals (Follistatin, Myostatin, ALK4/5/7, Smad7/3), ubiquitin-proteasome molecules (FoxO3, Atrogin-1, MuRF1), autophagy-lysosomal molecules (Bnip3, LC3A, and LC3B), while promoting protein synthesis signals (IGF-1/IGF-1R/IRS-1/PI3K/Akt, and BMP14/BMPR2/ALK2/3/Smad5/9). Moreover, morroniside had no obvious liver and kidney toxicity. This human genetic, cells and mice pathological evidence indicates that morroniside is an efficacious and safe inflammatory muscle atrophy treatment and suggests its translational potential on muscle wasting.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of abandoned cropland in the Karst Plateau of eastern Yunnan, China based on Landsat time series images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karst Plateau in eastern Yunnan, China (KPEYC) is densely populated. In this area, rocks are widely exposed, and soil erosion and rock desertification are serious issues. Furthermore, the conflict between humans and land is prominent. It is important to monitor abandoned croplands to ensure regional food security, preserve the ecological environment, and promote sustainable regional development. Regarding the lack of historical data and inaccurate identification of abandoned cropland, this study proposed a monitoring method for abandoned croplands based on Landsat time series remote sensing images. First, a decision tree was used to generate constant samples from 2000 to 2020. Thereafter, land use in KPEYC was classified year-by-year based on the random forest method and abandoned cropland pixels were identified based on land use data. Finally, the spatial and temporal characteristics of abandoned cropland in the KPEYC were analysed. Based on the results, the overall accuracy of the method was 0.75. Cropland abandonment in the eastern Yunnan Karst Plateau displayed a rapid growth trend and a slow decrease during the study period, with a significant growth rate from 2001 to 2010. The abandoned cropland was mainly concentrated in southwestern Zhaotong City, the entire territory of Qujing City, and northwestern Wenshan Prefecture, among which Fuyuan County, Luoping County, and Huize County repeatedly experienced more serious cropland abandonment. In addition to social factors, topography had a greater influence on cropland abandonment in the KPEYC, and the greater the slope or altitude, the more severe the cropland abandonment.

TI  - The effect of incentives on motivated numeracy amidst COVID-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - How does political ideology affect the processing of information incongruent with one's worldview? The disagreement in prior research about this question lies in how one's ideology interacts with cognitive ability to shape motivated numeracy or the tendency to misinterpret data to confirm one's prior beliefs. Our study conceptually replicates and extends previous research on motivated numeracy by testing whether monetary incentives for accuracy lessen motivated reasoning when high- and low-numeracy partisans interpret data about mask mandates and COVID-19 cases. This research leverages the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, as Americans are polarized along party lines regarding an appropriate government response to the pandemic.

TI  - An evaluation of biomass burning aerosol mass, extinction, and sizedistribution in GEOS using observations from CAMP<SUP>2</SUP>Ex
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning aerosol impacts aspects of the atmosphere and Earth system through direct and semi-direct effects, as well as influencing air quality. Despite its importance, the representation of biomass burning aerosol is not always accurate in numerical weather prediction and climate models or reanalysis products. Using observations collected as part of the Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) in August through October of 2019, aerosol concentration and optical properties are evaluated within the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) and its underlying aerosol module, GOCART. In the operational configuration, GEOS assimilates aerosol optical depth observations at 550 nm from AERONET and MODIS to constrain aerosol fields. Particularly for biomass burning aerosol, without the assimilation of aerosol optical depth, aerosol extinction is underestimated compared to observations collected in the Philippines region during the CAMP2Ex campaign. The assimilation process adds excessive amounts of carbon to account for the underestimated extinction, resulting in positive biases in the mass of black and organic carbon, especially within the boundary layer, relative to in situ observations from the Langley Aerosol Research Group Experiment. Counteracting this, GEOS is deficient in sulfate and nitrate aerosol just above the boundary layer. Aerosol extinction within GEOS is a function of the mass of different aerosol species, the ambient relative humidity, the assumed spectral optical properties, and particle size distribution per species. The relationship between dry and ambient extinction in GEOS reveals that hygroscopic growth is too high within the model for biomass burning aerosol. An additional concern lies in the assumed particle size distribution for GEOS, which has a single mode radius that is too small for organic carbon. Variability in the observed particle size distribution for biomass burning aerosol within a single flight also illuminates the fact that a single assumed particle size distribution is not sufficient and that for a proper representation, a more advanced aerosol module within GEOS may be necessary.

TI  - Integrated approach for the assessment of forest fire risk and burn severity mapping using GIS, AHP method, and Google Earth Engine in Western Algeria
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In Algeria, more than 29% of the forest heritage is located in the western part where forest fires remain the most devastating factor. The assessment of the Forest Fire Risk (FFR) and the mapping of very vulnerable areas seem to be the most effective ways to meet this alarming situation. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS)-based multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods have improved their efficiency in this domain. In addition, the web platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE) has made the processing of remote sensing data very fast. This study, conducted in the Louza Forest located in Sidi Bel Abbes province in western Algeria, aims to assess FFR using two methods: the Dong model and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, which integrate both three effective factor types such as vegetation cover, topography, and human activities. Likewise, the Burn Severity Map (BSM) was made using the Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) obtained from Landsat data. The obtained FFR maps from the two models were compared with BSM. Results show a dominance of moderate and high burn severity of 57.68% and 29.13% of the total forest area. The statistical analysis demonstrates that most of the burned areas were located in the moderate, high, and very high risk levels with a rate of 64.27% and 69.41% for Dong and AHP models, respectively. This study shows the effective contribution of GIS and remote sensing to provide a very useful solution for forest managers for sustainable management and the preparation of forest fire protection plans.

TI  - 'Swear by Thy Gracious Self': North American Medical Oath-Taking in 2014/2015
T2  - NEW BIOETHICS-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY AND THE BODY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past century, six studies - the most recent data from 2000 - and one review have comprehensively examined the content of medical oaths and oath-taking practices, all focusing on North America, providing an insight into the ethical beliefs of each era. Our study sought to establish a new point of reference. In 2014/2015, oaths from 150 of all 153 US and Canadian medical schools were collected and analyzed. All but one school administered medical oaths and most schools administered more than one. Since 2000, student-written oaths became more popular, and new themes, such as self-care and professionalism, were identified in the oaths for the first time. However, as was identified in 2000, the oaths' contents are disparate and even conflicting at times, raising questions as to whether medicine is being taught or practiced with a coherent ethical worldview.

TI  - Using body size as an indicator for age structure in field populations of <i>Aedes</i><i>aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Aedesaegypti mosquito is a vector of several viruses including dengue, chikungunya, zika, and yellow fever. Vector surveillance and control are the primary methods used for the control and prevention of disease transmission; however, public health institutions largely rely on measures of population abundance as a trigger for initiating control activities. Previous research found evidence that at the northern edge of Ae.aegypti's geographic range, survival, rather than abundance, is likely to be the factor limiting disease transmission. In this study, we sought to test the utility of using body size as an entomological index to surveil changes in the age structure of field-collected female Aedesaegypti. Methods: We collected female Ae.aegypti mosquitoes using BG sentinel traps in three cities at the northern edge of their geographic range. Collections took place during their active season over the course of 3 years. Female wing size was measured as an estimate of body size, and reproductive status was characterized by examining ovary tracheation. Chronological age was determined by measuring transcript abundance of an age-dependent gene. These data were then tested with female abundance at each site and weather data from the estimated larval development period and adulthood (1 week prior to capture). Two sources of weather data were tested to determine which was more appropriate for evaluating impacts on mosquito physiology. All variables were then used to parameterize structural equation models to predict age. Results: In comparing city-specific NOAA weather data and site-specific data from HOBO remote temperature and humidity loggers, we found that HOBO data were more tightly associated with body size. This information is useful for justifying the cost of more precise weather monitoring when studying intra-population heterogeneity of eco-physiological factors. We found that body size itself was not significantly associated with age. Of all the variables measured, we found that best fitting model for age included temperature during development, body size, female abundance, and relative humidity in the 1 week prior to capture . The strength of models improved drastically when testing one city at a time, with Hermosillo (the only study city with seasonal dengue transmission) having the best fitting model for age. Despite our finding that there was a bias in the body size of mosquitoes collected alive from the BG sentinel traps that favored large females, there was still sufficient variation in the size of females collected alive to show that inclusion of this entomological indicator improved the predictive capacity of our models. Conclusions: Inclusion of body size data increased the strength of weather-based models for age. Importantly, we found that variation in age was greater within cities than between cities, suggesting that modeling of age must be made on a city-by-city basis. These results contribute to efforts to use weather forecasts to predict changes in the probability of disease transmission by mosquito vectors.

TI  - Using MODIS data to track the long-term variations of dissolved oxygen in Lake Taihu
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved oxygen (DO) is crucial for the health of aquatic ecosystems, and plays an essential role in regulating biogeochemical processes in inland lakes. Traditional measurements of DO using the probe or analysis in a laboratory are time-consuming and cannot obtain data with high frequency and broad coverage. Satellites can provide daily/hourly observations within a broad scale and have been used as an important technique for aquatic environments monitoring. However, satellite-derived DO in waters is challenging due to its non-optically active property. Here, we developed a two-step model for retrieving DO concentration in Lake Taihu from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua images. A machine learning model (eXtreme gradient boosting) was developed to estimate DO from field water temperature, water clarity, and chlorophyll-a (Chla) (root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.98 mg L-1, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 7.9%) and subsequently was validated on MODIS-derived water temperature, water clarity, and Chla matchups with a satisfactory accuracy (RMSE = 1.28 mg L-1, MAPE = 9.9%). MODIS-derived DO in Lake Taihu from 2002 to 2021 demonstrated that DO ranged from 7.2 mg L-1 to 14.2 mg L-1, with a mean value of 9.3 mg L-1. DO in the northern region was higher than in the central and southern regions, and higher in winter than in summer. We revealed that DO in this decade (2010-2021) was considerably lower than that in the last decade (2002-2009). Meanwhile, annual mean of DO increased in 2002-2009 and decreased from 2010 to 2021. The spatial distribution of DO in Lake Taihu was related to Chla and water clarity, while seasonal and interannual variations in DO resulted from air temperature primarily. This research enhances the potential use of machine learning approaches in monitoring non-optically active constituents from satellite imagery and indicates the possibility of long-term and high-range variations in more water quality parameters in lakes.

TI  - A review of agricultural drought assessment with remote sensing data: methods, issues, challenges and opportunities
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Drought is a frequent hydrometeorological phenomenon that affects every individual, including animals. It causes significant economic and human losses. Various traditional methods are used to assess droughts in the early stages. However, conventional ways are time-consuming, expensive, and laborious. This has led to exploring remote sensing with recent methods for drought assessment. Therefore, the current paper gives a comprehensive overview of the recent studies on agricultural drought impact and its assessment using remote sensing datasets and various spectral index methods. The available satellite data sources have been provided with their sensors and spectral, spatial, and temporal information. Furthermore, we have also provided the general schema for agricultural drought assessment, essential indices, and drought severity methods with their importance and limitations. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), standardized soil moisture index (SSMI), soil moisture percentile (SMP), normalized soil moisture (NSM), standardized precipitation index (SPI), vegetation health index (VHI), and soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) are the most used indices by researchers for drought detection and its assessment. Lastly, this review examines the challenges that need to be handled for the early detection of agricultural drought episodes. It is concluded that a long-term historical record of satellite images and meteorological data is required to calculate drought severity levels and identify drought-prone areas. This review can detect the hidden risks of agricultural drought and offer a theoretical foundation for decision-makers and mitigation agencies.

TI  - Index-based impact monitoring of water infrastructures in climate change mitigation projects: A case study of MGNREGA-IWMP projects in Maharashtra
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is currently the largest funded rural development program in India to ensure rural livelihood by providing employment through different activities. Owing to climate change impacts and water scarcity for the last 5 years, approximately more than 70% of activities (budget of 5 billion USD per year) are focused on water issues. For better utilization of resources, MGNREGA has been implementing these works in convergence with many other schemes like the integrated watershed management programme (IWMP), with the aim of restoring rural natural resources, like soil, vegetation, and water. Although the largest Rural Development Scheme in India, the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) does not focus on the actual impact on water resources but only focuses on the amount spent. This can lead to only information on funds spent but does not have much an impact on water resources and earmarking data for monitoring. The recent advancements in remote sensing techniques have provided open access to high-resolution satellite data along with the processing platform. Considering the available technologies and gaps in the existing M&E framework, the current study developed a low-cost, comprehensive, robust, and near real-time M&E framework to assess the impact of water projects. A novel remote sensing-based ecological index (RSEI) has been developed to assess the overall ecological status of land surfaces due to the water infrastructures developed. The performance of RSEI has also been assessed using the secondary data of crop production, which shows excellent results (adjusted R-2 value of 82% and Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.92). In addition, RSEI results were compared against the results of government audits (e.g., by the Comptroller Auditor General of India), wherein RSEI found similar areas of increased water status and crop productivity. The results indicate that the use of the RSEI-based M&E framework will allow for an impact assessment of water infrastructure and also aid to identify the priority areas demanding immediate intervention. Thus, RSEI can be used as a decision support system for stakeholders, including for smooth planning, designing, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of water infrastructure for combating climate change extremes such as droughts.

TI  - High-resolution spatiotemporal modeling of daily near-surface air temperature in Germany over the period 2000-2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The commonly used weather stations cannot fully capture the spatiotemporal variability of near-surface air temperature (Tair), leading to exposure misclassification and biased health effect estimates. We aimed to improve the spatiotemporal coverage of Tair data in Germany by using multi-stage modeling to estimate daily 1 x 1 km minimum (Tmin), mean (Tmean), maximum (Tmax) Tair and diurnal Tair range during 2000-2020. We used weather station Tair observations, satellite-based land surface temperature (LST), elevation, vegetation and various land use predictors. In the first stage, we built a linear mixed model with daily random intercepts and slopes for LST adjusted for several spatial predictors to estimate Tair from cells with both Tair and LST available. In the second stage, we used this model to predict Tair for cells with only LST available. In the third stage, we regressed the second stage predictions against interpolated Tair values to obtain Tair countrywide. All models achieved high accuracy (0.91 <= R2 <= 0.98) and low errors (1.03 degrees C <= Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) <= 2.02 degrees C). Validation with external data confirmed the good performance, locally, i.e., in Augsburg for all models (0.74 <= R2 <= 0.99, 0.87 degrees C <= RMSE <= 2.05 degrees C) and countrywide, for the Tmean model (0.71 <= R2 <= 0.99, 0.79 degrees C <= RMSE <= 1.19 degrees C). Annual Tmean averages ranged from 8.56 degrees C to 10.42 degrees C with the years beyond 2016 being constantly hotter than the 21-year average. The spatial variability within Germany exceeded 15 degrees C annually on average following patterns including mountains, rivers and urbanization. Using a case study, we showed that modeling leads to broader Tair variability representation for exposure assessment of participants in health cohorts. Our results indicate the proposed models as suitable for estimating nationwide Tair at high resolution. Our product is critical for temperature-based epidemiological studies and is also available for other research purposes.

TI  - High-resolution water level and storage variation datasets for 338reservoirs in China during 2010-2021
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoirs and dams are essential infrastructure in water management; thus, information of their surface water area (SWA), water surface elevation (WSE), and reservoir water storage change (RWSC) is crucial for understanding their properties and interactions in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. However, knowledge of these reservoir characteristics is scarce or inconsistent at the national scale. Here, we introduce comprehensive reservoir datasets of 338 reservoirs in China, with a total of 470.6 km3 storage capacity (50 % Chinese reservoir storage capacity). Given the scarcity of publicly available gauged observations and operational applications of satellites for hydrological cycles, we utilize multiple satellite altimetry missions (SARAL/AltiKa, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B, CroySat-2, Jason-3, and ICESat-2) and imagery data from Landsat and Sentinel-2 to produce a comprehensive reservoir dataset on the WSE, SWA, and RWSC during 2010-2021. Validation against gauged measurements of 93 reservoirs demonstrates the relatively high accuracy and reliability of our remotely sensed datasets. (1) Across gauge comparisons of RWSC, the median statistics of the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) are 0.89, 11 %, and 0.021 km3, with a total of 91 % validated reservoirs (83 of 91) having good RMSE from 0.002 to 0.31 km(3) and NRMSE values smaller than 20 %. (2) Comparisons of WSE retracked by six satellite altimeters and gauges show good agreement. Specifically, the percentages of reservoirs having good and moderate RMSE values smaller than 1.0 m for CryoSat-2 (validated in 30 reservoirs), SARAL/AltiKa (9), Sentinel-3A (34), Sentinel-3B (25), Jason-3 (11), and ICESat-2 (26) are 77 %, 75 %, 79 %, 87 %, 81 %, and 82 %, respectively. By taking advantages of six satellite altimeters, we are able to densify WSE observations across spatiotemporal scales. Statistically, around 96 % of validated reservoirs (71 of 74) have RMSE values below 1.0 m, while 57 % of reservoirs (42 of 74) have good data quality with RMSE values below 0.6 m. Overall, our study fills such a data gap with regard to comprehensive reservoir information in China and provides strong support for many aspects such as hydrological processes, water resources, and other studies. .

TI  - Efficiency of assimilating leaf area index into a soybean model to assess within-field yield variability
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for accurately estimating within-field yield are essential to improve site-specific crop management and resource use efficiencies, which would be a major step toward sustainable intensification of agricultural systems. We set out to assess the accuracy of within-field soybean yields predicted by two data assimilation methods and to assess these methods' assimilation efficiency (AE). Yields were estimated by assimilating remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) data from Sentinel-2 into a soybean crop growth model on a pixel basis. The LAI data was integrated into the model by Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) or by recalibrating with the Subplex algorithm (recalibration-based). An open-loop setting which only integrates information on the soil layers was used as a baseline scenario for quantifying the AE. We assessed both data assimilation techniques on eight fields (3067 pixels) in the Corn Belt region (Nebraska, Kansas and Kentucky) in the United States. The data set encompassed substantial variation in crop growth conditions: three growing seasons (2018, 2019 and 2020), rainfed and irrigated fields, and early and late planting dates. Ground truth yield acquired from combine monitors was used to validate the yield estimations. Agreement between predicted and observed yield at pixel level was two times higher for both data assimilation methods compared to the open-loop. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 476 kg.ha(-1) (RRMSE of 10 %) in the recalibration-based method and 573 kg.ha(-1) (RRMSE of 12 %) in the EnKF-based method. For both data assimilation methods, assimilating the LAI improved predictions for 68 % of the pixels. For a further 12 % of pixels, there was no accuracy improvement. For the remaining 20 %, AE was positive for one of the two assimilation methods. The high proportion of pixels with positive AE indicates the potential for overcoming the limitations in applying crop models at high spatial resolution by integrating a crop growth indicator. Assimilating an in-season indicator of crop growth (LAI) into a soybean model made it possible to adjust the simulation pathway, thereby greatly improving the accuracy of the yield estimations at the pixel level. This study elucidates the practical applications of data assimilation strategies for fine-scale within-field crop yield mapping.

TI  - Remote sensing of aerosol water fraction, dry size distribution and soluble fraction using multi-angle, multi-spectral polarimetry
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework to infer volume water fraction, soluble fraction and dry size distributions of fine-mode aerosol from multi-angle, multi-spectral polarimetry retrievals of column-averaged ambient aerosol properties is presented. The method is applied to observations of the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) obtained during two NASA aircraft campaigns, namely the Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) and the Cloud, Aerosol, and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex). All aerosol retrievals are statistically evaluated using in situ data. Volume water fraction is inferred from the retrieved ambient real part of the refractive index, assuming a dry refractive index of 1.54 and by applying a volume mixing rule to obtain the effective ambient refractive index. The uncertainties in inferred volume water fraction resulting from this simplified model are discussed and estimated to be lower than 0.2 and decreasing with increasing volume water fraction. The daily mean retrieved volume water fractions correlate well with the in situ values with a mean absolute difference of 0.09. Polarimeter-retrieved ambient effective radius for daily data is shown to increase as a function of volume water fraction as expected. Furthermore, the effective variance of the size distributions also increases with increasing effective radius, which we show is consistent with an external mixture of soluble and insoluble aerosol. The relative variations of effective radius and variance over an observation period are then used to estimate the soluble fraction of the aerosol. Daily results of soluble fraction correlate well with in situ-observed sulfate mass fraction with a correlation coefficient of 0.79. Subsequently, inferred water and soluble fractions are used to derive dry fine-mode size distributions from their ambient counterparts. While dry effective radii obtained in situ and from RSP show similar ranges, in situ values are generally substantially smaller during the ACTIVATE deployments, which may be due to biases in RSP retrievals or in the in situ observations, or both. Both RSP and in situ observations indicate the dominance of aerosol with low hygroscopicity during the ACTIVATE and CAMP2Ex campaigns. Furthermore, RSP indicates a high degree of external mixing of particles with low and high hygroscopicity. These retrievals of fine-mode water volume fraction and soluble fraction may be used for the evaluation of water uptake in atmospheric models. Furthermore, the framework allows us to estimate the variation in the concentration of fine-mode aerosol larger than a specific dry radius limit, which can be used as a proxy for the variation in cloud condensation nucleus concentrations. This framework may be applied to multi-angle, multi-spectral satellite data expected to be available in the near future.

TI  - The ethics of artificial intelligence, UNESCO and the African Ubuntu perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & ETHICS IN SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to demonstrate the relevance of worldviews of the global south to debates of artificial intelligence, enhancing the human rights debate on artificial intelligence (AI) and critically reviewing the paper of UNESCO Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology (COMEST) that preceded the drafting of the UNESCO guidelines on AI. Different value systems may lead to different choices in programming and application of AI. Programming languages may acerbate existing biases as a people's worldview is captured in its language. What are the implications for AI when seen from a collective ontology? Ubuntu (I am a person through other persons) starts from collective morals rather than individual ethics. Design/methodology/approachLiterature overview on the African philosophy of Ubuntu as applied to artificial intelligence. Application of it to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) debates on establishing guidelines to the ethics of artificial intelligence. FindingsMetaphysically, Ubuntu and its conception of social personhood (attained during one's life) largely rejects transhumanism. When confronted with economic choices, Ubuntu favors sharing above competition and thus an anticapitalist logic of equitable distribution of AI benefits, humaneness and nonexploitation. When confronted with issues of privacy, Ubuntu emphasizes transparency to group members, rather than individual privacy, yet it calls for stronger (group privacy) protection. In democratic terms, it promotes consensus decision-making over representative democracy. Certain applications of AI may be more controversial in Africa than in other parts of the world, like care for the elderly, that deserve the utmost respect and attention, and which builds moral personhood. At the same time, AI may be helpful, as care from the home and community is encouraged from an Ubuntu perspective. The report on AI and ethics of the UNESCO World COMEST formulated principles as input, which are analyzed from the African ontological point of view. COMEST departs from "universal" concepts of individual human rights, sustainability and good governance which are not necessarily fully compatible with relatedness, including future and past generations. Next to rules based approaches, which may hamper diversity, bottom-up approaches are needed with intercultural deep learning algorithms. Research limitations/implicationsThere is very few existing literature on AI and Ubuntu. Therefore, this paper is of an explorative nature. Practical implicationsThe ethics of Ubuntu offers unique vantage points in looking at the organization of society and economics today, which are also relevant for development of AI, especially in its tenet of relatedness rather than individuality (and practical use of AI for individuals), taking responsibility for society as a whole (such as analyzing the benefit of AI for all strata of society), and embodying true inclusiveness. Whether looking at top-down guidelines for the development and implementation of AI or the bottom-up ethical learning process of AI (deep learning), ethics of the Global South can have an important role to play to combat global individualist tendencies and inequity, likely reinforced by AI. This warrants far more research. Social implicationsApplications of AI in Africa are not contextualized, do not address the most pressing needs of the African continent, lead to cybersecurity issues and also do not incorporate African ethics.UNESCO's work in this regard is important but expert inputs are largely centered around Western "universal" principles and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and EU precedence. African ethics have, so far, a small role to play in global ethics and philosophy and therefore risk to be overlooked in the discussion on AI and ethics. This is why the consultation process of UNESCO on ethics of AI was of paramount importance. However, it does not automatically lead to consultation of African philosophers or sages, as many are educated in Western (ized) education systems. See further details under practical implications. Originality/valueThis is a new area of research in which little work has been done so far. This paper offers the opportunity to widen the debate on AI and ethics beyond the conventional discourse, involving multiple worldviews, of which Ubuntu is just one.

TI  - Investigating the impact of multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI on carbon emissions in the belt and road initiative region: Direct and spillover effects
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate ambition led by the net zero goal has prompted growing concern among international organizations about the carbon emissions effects of urbanization and foreign direct investment (FDI) in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) region. Due to the limited data experiments, the direction and externalities of the impact of urbanization and FDI on carbon emissions in the BRI region remain largely unclear, and accounting for ur-banization is also isolated. To address this knowledge gap, this study quantified the direct and spillover effects of multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI on carbon emissions using multiple remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018. The study explored the spatial distribution, evolutionary trends, bivariate evolutionary relationships, and influence mechanisms of carbon emissions with multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI by combining temporal trend (Slope), bivariate spatial autocorrelation, spatial Durbin model (SDM), and other methods. The results indicate that from 2000 to 2018, the total BRI carbon emissions added 253 million tons at an average annual growth rate of 3.68%; since 2013, the average annual growth rate has dropped sharply to 1.34%. East and South Asian countries (especially China and India) posted the highest increase in carbon emissions and had faster growth rates in multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI. Only some European countries, such as France and Germany, achieved overall carbon reduction. The results highlight the adaptability of the "Environmental Kuznets Curve" hypothesis. The "Low-Low" was the main cluster type of the evolutionary trends of carbon emissions associated with each variable. Multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI directly contributed to local carbon emissions, but the effects have gradually weakened over time (except for land urbanization). After controlling for the direct effects, we found a widespread consistently enhanced positive effects of population urbanization and land urbanization on carbon emissions in adjacent areas (especially after the BRI imple-mentation), while FDI reduced the direct impact and strengthened the gain effect on carbon reduction in adjacent regions. Our findings confirm the importance of integrating policies to reduce emissions in population, economy, land, and foreign investment and provide strong evidence for joint governance of carbon emissions among BRI countries.

TI  - Use of LigaSure vessel sealing system versus conventional axillary dissection in breast cancer patients: a retrospective comparative study
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In locally advanced breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection remains a pivotal component of surgical therapy. Apart from this, it has been mostly replaced by sentinel node biopsy. Complications after axillary dissection include wound infection, neuropathy, lymphedema and-most frequently-seroma. In this retrospective multi-centre study, we compared the use of LigaSure (TM) with monopolar electrocautery regarding perioperative outcome.Methods: A retrospective data analysis from female breast cancer patients who underwent axillary dissection at two breast centres in Austria that are using two different surgical techniques was performed for this study. We compared the rate of complications and re-operations, length of hospital stay, time to drain removal, total drain fluid, seroma formation after drain removal, number of seroma aspirations and total seroma fluid.Results: Seventy one female patients with a median age of 63 (30-83) were included in this study. In 35 patients LigaSure (TM) and in 36 monopolar cautery was used for axillary dissection. There was no significant difference regarding intraoperative complications and rate of re-operations between the two groups (2.9 vs. 5.6%; p = 1 and 2.9 vs. 13.9%; p = 0.199). The time to drain removal and the length of hospital stay was similar in both groups. A significant difference in the occurence of postoperative wound infection could also not be shown. However, we found a significantly smaller total drain fluid in the LigaSure (TM)-group compared to the cautery-group (364.6 ml vs. 643.4 ml; p = 0.004). Seroma formation after drain removal was more frequent in the LigaSure (TM)-group (68.6 vs. 41.7%; p = 0.032) with a higher number of outpatient seroma aspirations (2.0 vs. 0.9; p = 0.005).Conclusion: LigaSure (TM) and monopolar cautery provide equivalent techniques in axillary lymph node dissection with comparable postoperative outcomes.

AB  - IntroductionThrough remote sensing images, we can understand and observe the terrain, and its application scope is relatively large, such as agriculture, military, etc. MethodsIn order to achieve more accurate and efficient multi-source remote sensing data fusion and classification, this study proposes DB-CNN algorithm, introduces SVM algorithm and ELM algorithm, and compares and verifies their performance through relevant experiments. ResultsFrom the results, we can find that for the dual branch CNN network structure, hyperspectral data and laser mines joint classification of data can achieve higher classification accuracy. On different data sets, the global classification accuracy of the joint classification method is 98.46%. DB-CNN model has the highest training accuracy and fastest speed in training and testing. In addition, the DB-CNN model has the lowest test error, about 0.026, 0.037 lower than the ELM model and 0.056 lower than the SVM model. The AUC value corresponding to the ROC curve of its model is about 0.922, higher than that of the other two models. DiscussionIt can be seen that the method used in this paper can significantly improve the effect of multi-source remote sensing data fusion and classification, and has certain practical value.

TI  - Application of machine learning approaches for land cover monitoring in northern Cameroon
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) models are a leading analytical technique used to monitor, map and quantify land use and land cover (LULC) and its change over time. Models such as k-nearest neighbour (kNN), support vector machines (SVM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and random forests (RF) have been used effectively to classify LULC types at a range of geographical scales. However, ML models have not been widely applied in African tropical regions due to methodological challenges that arise from relying on the coarse-resolution satellite images available for these areas. In this study, we compared the performance of four ML algorithms (kNN, SVM, ANN and RF) applied to LULC monitoring within the Mayo Rey department, North Province, Cameroon. We used satellite data from the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) combined with 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images of northern Cameroon for November 2000 and November 2020. Our results showed that all four classification algorithms produced relatively high accuracy (overall classification accuracy >80%), with the RF model (> 90% classification accuracy) outperforming the kNN, SVM, and ANN models. We found that approximately 7% of all forested areas (dense forest and woody savanna) were converted to other land cover types between 2000 and 2020; this forest loss is particularly associated with an expansion of both croplands and built-up areas. Our study represents a novel application and comparison of statistical and ML approaches to LULC monitoring using coarse-resolution satellite images in an African tropical forest and savanna setting. The resulting land cover maps serve as an important baseline that will be useful to the Cameroon government for policy development, conservation planning, urban planning, and deforestation and agricultural monitoring.

TI  - The Multiple Snow Data Assimilation System (MuSA v1.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the seasonal snow distribution is vital in several domains including ecology, water resources management, and tourism. Current spaceborne sensors provide a useful but incomplete description of the snowpack. Many studies suggest that the assimilation of remotely sensed products in physically based snowpack models is a promising path forward to estimate the spatial distribution of snow water equivalent (SWE). However, to date there is no standalone, open-source, community-driven project dedicated to snow data assimilation, which makes it difficult to compare existing algorithms and fragments development efforts. Here we introduce a new data assimilation toolbox, the Multiple Snow Data Assimilation System (MuSA), to help fill this gap. MuSA was developed to fuse remotely sensed information that is available at different timescales with the energy and mass balance Flexible Snow Model (FSM2). MuSA was designed to be user-friendly and scalable. It enables assimilation of different state variables such as the snow depth, SWE, snow surface temperature, binary or fractional snow-covered area, and snow albedo and could be easily upgraded to assimilate other variables such as liquid water content or snow density in the future. MuSA allows the joint assimilation of an arbitrary number of these variables, through the generation of an ensemble of FSM2 simulations. The characteristics of the ensemble (i.e., the number of particles and their prior covariance) may be controlled by the user, and it is generated by perturbing the meteorological forcing of FSM2. The observational variables may be assimilated using different algorithms including particle filters and smoothers as well as ensemble Kalman filters and smoothers along with their iterative variants. We demonstrate the wide capabilities of MuSA through two snow data assimilation experiments. First, 5 m resolution snow depth maps derived from drone surveys are assimilated in a distributed fashion in the Izas catchment (central Pyrenees). Furthermore, we conducted a joint-assimilation experiment, fusing MODIS land surface temperature and fractional snow-covered area with FSM2 in a single-cell experiment. In light of these experiments, we discuss the pros and cons of the assimilation algorithms, including their computational cost.

TI  - Understanding the Inherent Interconnectedness and other Salient Characteristics of Nature crucial for Sustainability
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Sustainability is understood as a dynamic balance in economic, environmental, and social dimensions to fulfill all human needs for all generations at all times. However, with the increasing signs of losing the dynamic balance between socio-economic human living and the rest of Nature, the survival of the human species itself is in question. Efforts being made worldwide through the United Nations to restore this balance have shown marginal impacts at ground level. Though Nature, when observed closely, is easily visible as a dynamically evolving self-sustainable system, but, generally this fact is not considered/ overlooked while planning sustainable developmental activities. Therefore, in the present paper, an effort has been made to uncover these inherent characteristics of Nature responsible for its dynamic sustainability. Various well-established pieces of evidence from ecological and modern sciences, arguments, and philosophical and spiritual aspects are discussed which show that there are fundamental characteristics of Nature i.e..& mdash;interconnectedness and coexistence that exist everywhere even at a sub-atomic level. These characteristics are essential for designing/achieving sustainable development programs. Based on the evolved characteristics, a holistic co-existential model ensuring dynamic sustainability for all generations at all times is proposed.

TI  - Is palpable DCIS more aggressive than screen-detected DCIS?
T2  - SURGERY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Palpable ductal carcinoma in-situ (pDCIS) is a subset of DCIS presenting with a clinical mass. We hy-pothesized pDCIS would have more aggressive clinical and pathological features, and higher rates of recurrence and upgrade to invasive disease compared to screen-detected DCIS.Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of female patients (age 28-76) with DCIS on core-needle biopsy. pDCIS patients had a physician documented palpable mass prior to initial biopsy. Descriptive statistics were performed to compare groups.Results: This study included 83 patients, 26 had pDCIS and 57 had screen-detected DCIS. Mean duration of follow-up was 49.4 months. pDCIS patients had significantly larger lesions (p = 0.03) which were more frequently biopsied via ultrasound (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, pDCIS was associated with ultrasound guided core needle biopsy, size of DCIS >2 cm, and comedo pattern (p = 0.001, p = 0.007 and p = 0.022, respectively). 7.7 % of pDCIS cases versus 3.5 % of screen-detected cases were upgraded to invasive cancer (p = 0.59). There was no difference in local recurrence (p = 0.55) between groups. Neither group experienced regional or distant re-currence.Conclusions: pDCIS was associated with some aggressive pathologic and clinical features and was more frequently diagnosed by ultrasound guided core-needle biopsy than screen-detected DCIS. However, there was no signifi-cant difference in rate of recurrence or upgrade to invasive disease between groups. Key message: Although pDCIS was associated with some aggressive pathologic and clinical features, there was no significant difference in rate of recurrence or upgrade to invasive disease compared to screen-detected DCIS.(c) 2022 The Authors.

These areas are very sensitive and therefore, changes in the region of interest (ROI) require special attention due to the consequences. The changes observed in the coastal zone of Benin, such as: coastal erosion, the decrease of mangrove ecosystems and its consequences, and the pressure on agricultural land, have motivated this study, which aims to assess land use land cover in the coastal zone of Benin in order to better anticipate the phenomena of loss and fragmentation of ecosystems and to provide guidelines for policy-making. To achieve this objective, remote sensing and field surveys were used. Spot and Landsat satellite images of the years 1991-2006 and 2021 have been uploaded to regards. cnes.fr and USGS. Direct field observations and group discussions to determine the driving forces behind the changes were conducted. Supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood approach of ENVI software was used and QGIS 3.16 to process the data. Significant changes have been observed in the coastal zone our study area over the past thirty years. During the period 1991-2006, palm fields constituted the largest land use with 84786 ha or 28.9% of the total area. This occupation will decrease over time to reach 66773.2 ha in 2006 (22.7% of the total area) and 27406.5 ha or 7.2% of the total area in 2021. Classes such as Mosaic of crop and out of crop, dense forest have experienced the same evolution while the opposite trend is observed in built-up areas. From 11543 ha or 3.9% of the total area in 1991, this class has increased to 25138 ha or 8.7% of the total area in 2006 and 44418.5 ha or 15.1% in 2021. Urbanization and the need for agricultural land have been identified as driving forces behind these changes and Markov chain analysis reveals future regression of coastal ecosystems such as mangroves, dense forest, swamp, and crop ender palm. These outcomes have far-reaching policy direction of environmental sustainability target in Benin coast.

TI  - Quantifying dust emission potential of playa and desert surfaces in the Salton Sea Air Basin, California, United States
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating the ability of natural surfaces to generate wind driven dust emissions into the atmosphere is essential to the development and refinement of local to regional and global emissions models and the assessment of environmental hazards posed by windblown dust. Close to 3,900 individual PM10 emission tests were conducted with the Portable-In Situ Wind ERosion Laboratory (PI-SWERL) between fall 2015 and spring 2021 on exposed Salton Sea playa and adjacent desert areas, California, United States. Each test location was also evaluated for surface characteristics and geomorphological unit. On playa surfaces, the crust type, presence of loose, erodible surface sand, soil moisture, and percent crust cover were found to have significant effects (P < 0.001) on PM10 emission potentials. On desert surfaces, PM10 emission potential varied significantly between geomorphic landforms (P < 0.001). In general, PM10 emission potentials tended to be higher for desert landforms and less variable compared to playa surfaces. Highly emissive surfaces were generally dry and had sufficient loose surface sand to initiate and sustain saltation and the associated liberation of dust-sized particles. Surfaces characterized by low dust emissions exhibited moist conditions, stable crusts, or gravel lag deposits. The geometric mean potential emission rates ranged over two orders of magnitude, with a low and high of 4 and 398 mu g m- 2 s- 1 (at an RPM of 3,000 or a u* range of 0.56-0.73 m s-1). Based on differences in surface area and emission potentials, the overall dust emissions in the study domain are dominated by emissions from desert sources.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise, ACIX-II Land: An assessment of atmospheric correction processors for Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 over land
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The correction of the atmospheric effects on optical satellite images is essential for quantitative and multi -temporal remote sensing applications. In order to study the performance of the state-of-the-art methods in an integrated way, a voluntary and open-access benchmark Atmospheric Correction Inter-comparison eXercise (ACIX) was initiated in 2016 in the frame of Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration & Validation (WGCV). The first exercise was extended in a second edition wherein twelve at-mospheric correction (AC) processors, a substantially larger testing dataset and additional validation metrics were involved. The sites for the inter-comparison analysis were defined by investigating the full catalogue of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites for coincident measurements with satellites' overpass. Although there were more than one hundred sites for Copernicus Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 acquisitions, the analysis presented in this paper concerns only the common matchups amongst all processors, reducing the number to 79 and 62 sites respectively. Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Water Vapour (WV) retrievals were consequently validated based on the available AERONET observations. The processors mostly succeeded in retrieving AOD for relatively light to medium aerosol loading (AOD < 0.2) with uncertainties <0.08, while the overall uncertainty values were typically 0.23 +/- 0.15. Better performances were observed for WV retrievals with >90% of the results falling within the suggested empirical specifications and with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being mostly <0.25 g/cm2. Regarding Surface Reflectance (SR) validation two main approaches were followed. For the first one, a simulated SR reference dataset was computed over all of the test sites by using the 6SV (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum vector code) full radiative transfer modelling (RTM) and AERONET measurements for the required aerosol variables and water vapour content. The performance assessment demonstrated that the retrievals were not biased for most of the bands. The uncertainties ranged from approximately 0.003 to 0.01 (excluding B01) for the best performing processors in both sensors' analyses. For the second one, measurements from the radiometric calibration network RadCalNet over La Crau (France) and Gobabeb (Namibia) were involved in the validation. The performance of the processors was in general consistent across all bands for both sensors and with low standard deviations (<0.04) between on-site and estimated surface reflectance. Overall, our study provides a good insight of AC algorithms' performance to developers and users, pointing out similarities and differences for AOD, WV and SR retrievals. Such validation though still lacks of ground-based measurements of known uncertainty to better assess and characterize the uncertainties in SR retrievals.

TI  - Retrieval of lake water surface albedo from Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Of the many factors that affect heat flux, water surface albedo can affect the heat flux and energy balance at the water-atmosphere interface. As a result, lake water surface albedo can act on key climate-change factors through its impact on lake-atmosphere heat exchange. Most of the available global water cycle models, however, still use value specific water surface albedos and often produce estimation with relative errors of 5-15 % due to time and location differences. The lake albedo inversion model based on Sentinel-2 MSI sensor was obtained in this research. From the perspective of energy transmission, this research selects an inversion method of converting narrowband albedo to broadband albedo, and using Sentinel-2A spatial resolution image for the study area for 10 m lakes albedo product. Based on the measured albedo data, using the determination coefficient (R2), mean relative error(MRE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for validation, the result of the inversion results show that the R2 is 0.62, MRE is 0.25, RMSE is 0.039. The values of lake albedo in the study area ranged from 0 to 0.45, with an average value of 0.14. The high value of lake albedo appears in the south of the Songnen Plain lake area, with a size between 0.28 and 0.45, and the low-value gathering area appears in the Qiqihar Lake Group. The central lake area of Jilin also has a low value, with a size between 0 and 0.10. From the west to the middle of Jilin Province, the albedo value tends to decrease gradually, and some areas have higher values. In a typical lake, the average albedo is arranged as follows: Yangsha lake > Shitoukoumen reservoir > Chagan lake > Moon lake > Erlong lake > Xinlicheng reservoir.

TI  - Land suitability modelling for rainbow trout farming in the Eastern Himalayan Region, India, using GIS-MCE approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of India's extensive cold-water resource base, cold-water fish farming, particularly for rainbow trout, is one of the country's most promising industries. The output potential has not yet been fully realised, despite the recent increase in production. To expand horizontally, the conventional technique is used, which opens up the possibility for more cross-sectoral conflicts to escalate. Thus, a geographic information system (GIS)-based model has been designed for rainbow trout aquaculture in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh, India, considering the wise and sustainable utilisation of cold-water resources. Fourteen critical criteria were identified for site selection based on topography, water quality, and infrastructure facilities. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was used to create sensitive enough peer-to-peer comparison matrices for the selection process, allowing each criterion to be given a specific weight. Data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM DEM-30 m) satellite were analysed for elevation and slope characteristics. Landsat 8 (OLI) data were employed to classify the current land use pattern. Based on a field survey and secondary data, the GPS locations of infrastructure facilities, like marketplaces, hatcheries, etc., were marked to delineate them. Using a geographical information system-multi-criteria evaluation (GIS-MCE) approach based on a weighted map overlay, we found that 0.14% (340.21 ha), 0.77% (1810.98 ha) and 0.02% (50.70 ha) of the region is most suitable, moderately suitable and least suitable, respectively, for rainbow trout farming. This model will facilitate the equitable distribution of available resources and give policymakers and other interested parties a common ground to build practical plans for the growth of cold-water aquaculture in the region.

TI  - Estimation of wheat tiller density using remote sensing data and machine learning methods
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The tiller density is a key agronomic trait of winter wheat that is essential to field management and yield estimation. The traditional method of obtaining the wheat tiller density is based on manual counting, which is inefficient and error prone. In this study, we established machine learning models to estimate the wheat tiller density in the field using hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing data. The results showed that the vegetation indices related to vegetation cover and leaf area index are more suitable for tiller density estimation. The optimal mean relative error for hyperspectral data was 5.46%, indicating that the results were more accurate than those for multispectral data, which had a mean relative error of 7.71%. The gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT) and random forest (RF) methods gave the best estimation accuracy when the number of samples was less than around 140 and greater than around 140, respectively. The results of this study support the extension of the tested methods to the large-scale monitoring of tiller density based on remote sensing data.

TI  - Using Fish as a Sentinel in Risk Management of Contaminated Sediments
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediments polluted by historical emissions from anthropogenic point sources are common in industrialized parts of the world and pose a potential threat to the function of aquatic ecosystems. Gradient studies using fish as a bioindicator are an option to assess the ecological impact of locally polluted areas. This study investigates the remaining effects of historical emissions on sediments outside ten Swedish pulp and paper mills using perch (Perca fluviatilis). The aim has been to obtain a general picture of the impact area of local deposits of cellulose fiber-rich sediments containing elevated levels of trace metals, e.g., Hg, and organochlorines, e.g., dioxins. In addition to analyzing contaminant levels in muscle and liver tissue, morphological measures in the fish that constitute biomarkers for health and reproductivity were measured. Another aim was to augment existing historical data sets to observe possible signs of environmental recovery. Overall, the results indicate only a minor elevation in contaminant levels and a minor impact on the fish health status in the polluted areas, which in several cases is an improvement from historical conditions. However, exceptions exist. Differences in the ecosystems' responses to pollution loads are primarily explained by abiotic factors such as water turnover rate, bottom dynamic conditions, and water chemistry. Weaknesses in the sampling methodology and processing of data were identified. After minor modifications, the applied survey strategy has the potential to be a management tool for decision-makers working on the remediation of contaminated areas.

TI  - Three-dimensional reconstruction with dual-source computed tomography for evaluating graft deformation and bone tunnel position following reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament
T2  - MEDICAL ENGINEERING & PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Considering the limitations of MRI and X-ray and few studies on the use of dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction are limited, this study explored the clinical application of DSCT for three-dimensional reconstruction of graft deformation and bone tunnel position images following ACL reconstruction.Methods: The data of 123 patients who underwent single-bundle ACL reconstruction under arthroscopy from January 2017 to October 2021 were retrieved. Two weeks after surgery, DSCT was used to assess graft defor-mation and tunnel widening. Based on the positions of ACL graft deformation and bone tunnel, the patients were divided into a collision group (n = 35), posterior group (n = 37) and satisfactory group (n = 51). The groups were compared in terms of the relative position of the central point of the femoral tunnel (FX, FY) and tibial tunnel (TX, TY), the straight-line distances of the grafts (L), the sagittal plane angle (z alpha), and the coronal plane angle (z3) between the two bone tunnels.Results: Tx, Ty, z alpha and z3 were significantly different among the three groups, while no difference in Fx, Fy and L were observed. Tx, Ty and z alpha were identified as independent risk factors for collisions between the graft and intercondylar notch. Ty and z alpha were independent risk factors for posterior deviation of tibial tunnel position.Conclusion: DSCT demonstrated promising clinical applicability to evaluate graft deformation and bone tunnel position after reconstruction of ACL and could guide preoperative positioning and postoperative evaluation.

TI  - SENTINEL LYMPH NODE IDENTIFICATION IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER USING LYMPHOSONOGRAPHY
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - objective of the work described here was to evaluate the efficacy of lymphosonography in identi-fying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with breast cancer undergoing surgical excision. Of the 86 individ-uals enrolled, 79 completed this institutional review board-approved study. Participants received subcutaneous 1.0-mL injections of ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) around the tumor. An ultrasound scanner with contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) capabilities was used to identify SLNs. Participants were administered with blue dye and radioactive tracer to guide SLN excision as standard-of-care. Excised SLNs were classified as positive or negative for the presence of blue dye, radioactive tracer and UCA, and sent for pathology. Two hundred fifty-two SLNs were excised; 158 were positive for blue dye, 222 were positive for radioactive tracer and 223 were positive for UCA. Comparison with blue dye revealed accuracies of 96.2% for radioactive tracer and 99.4% for lympho-sonography (p > 0.15). Relative to radioactive tracer, blue dye had an accuracy of 68.5%, and lymphosonography achieved 86.5% (p < 0.0001). Of 252 SLNs excised, 34 were determined to be malignant by pathology; 18 were positive for blue dye (detection rate = 53%), 23 for radioactive tracer (detection rate = 68%) and 34 for UCA (detection rate = 100%) (p < 0.0001). Lymphosonography was similar in accuracy to radioactive tracer and higher in accuracy than blue dye in identifying SLNs. All 34 malignant SLNs were identified by lymphosonogra-phy.

TI  - Seasonal monitoring of urban heat island based on the relationship between land surface temperature and land use/cover: a case study of Kabul City, Afghanistan
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to monitor the impacts of seasonal urban heat island based on the relationship between seasonal land surface temperature and Land Use/ Cover (LU/LC) fluctuations in Kabul city, the capital of Afghanistan in 2020.To do this, areas affected by Urban Heat Island (UHI) were detected. The relationship between UHI spatiotemporal fluctuations and LULC classes was also evaluated. The composition of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical Landsat 8 OLI images were used to extract the LU/LC type of the study area with higher accuracy for all seasons. Random forest supervised classifier was used to classify Kabul city into four different LU/LC classes (vegetation, water body, built-up, and bare land). Landsat 8 thermal bands were used to derive land surface temperature (LST) change patterns. The outputs revealed that the UHIs created in Kabul city have distinct causes depending on the type of LU/LC classes. The mean land surface temperature of the four LU/LC classes in different seasons demonstrated that the distribution mode of UHIs in the city was in line with the type of LU/LC. Based on overall assessments, the results revealed that nine districts in Kabul city (D-19, D-15, D-21, D-16, D-20, D-17, D-6, D-9, and D-1) are highly affected by urban heat islands. The UHIaffected regions in Kabul city, mostly consist of industrial parks, factories, the airport, industrial complexes, brick kilns, high volume of daily traffic congestion, densely populated, crush plant stations, and residential settlements. To validate the results, daytime and nighttime MODIS LST maps were generated. The daytime LST map similarly demonstrated that the spatial distribution of UHIs is related to the types of LU/LC. On the other hand, the results from nighttime LST maps revealed that nighttime heat islands are more intense than daytime heat islands, with the main concentrations of UHIs spreading towards the most populated areas in the central and eastern portion of Kabul city. This is due to the absorption of solar radiation throughout the day and emission during the nighttime. Remote sensing techniques were shown to be productive and economic, particularly in terms of minimizing the time for the evaluation of urban heat island variations based on the relationship between land surface temperature and LU/LC changes. Precise and updated remote sensing assessments of UHIs will pave the way for urban planners and land management organizations in addressing challenges related to the phenomenon.

TI  - On Problematic Situations and Problematizations: Study Practices and the Pragmatics of a World to-Be-Made
T2  - EDUCATIONAL THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, Hans Schildermans suggests practices of study as a way for universities to respond to socio-ecological questions, issues, and problems related to the Anthropocene. He elaborates the concept of study practices by drawing on traditional pragmatic notions, such as problematic situation and problematization, as these are articulated in John Dewey's theory of inquiry. Prompted by concerns about the closed problem-solution nexus, as well as questions concerning the (egological) worldview underlying this theory, Schildermans aims to reread these ideas through the lens of contemporary authors such as Isabelle Stengers. In doing so, he articulates the educational dynamics of practices of study that address problematic situations, with specific attention to matters of educational futurity. In other words, centrally important to this analysis is the question of how these practices of study participate in a world in-the-making by activating possible futures - or, to formulate it somewhat differently, how practices of study give shape to a pragmatics of a world to-be-made

TI  - Environmental assessments in dense mining areas using remote sensing information over Qian?an and Qianxi regions China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense mining areas are regions with relatively concentrated mining enterprises or occupied land, which are also regions with intense economic and resource development conflicts and environmental protection. However, ecological assessments by remotely sensed technology do not consider the characteristics of mining areas. To fill the knowledge gap, we employed seven indexes, i.e., fractional vegetation cover, greenness above bare soil, wetness, black particulates, land surface temperature, iron oxides, and the landscape fragmentation index, to construct the iron mine remote sensing-based ecological index (IM-RSEI) by Landsat data. We chose Qian'an City and Qianxi County in Tangshan City, China, as the study area where iron ore-related industries are concentrated. The results showed that the ecological environment generally deteriorated first and then improved that the IM-RSEI values for 1992, 2000, 2009, and 2018 were 0.5102, 0.4776, 0.4882, and 0.5001, respectively. The mean IM-RSEI values for the dense mining area and surrounding multi-gradient buffer zones, from near to far, were 0.5412, 0.5146, 0.5076, 0.4756, and 0.4563, implying that mining activities endangered the surrounding ecological quality. This study assessed the ecological environment in dense mining areas from multiple per-spectives by remote sensing technology. The research conclusions can provide a reference for pollution control during mining development in Qian'an, Qianxi, and similar mining areas.

TI  - Exploring Sentinel-1 backscatter time series over the Atacama Desert (Chile) for seasonal dynamics of surface soil moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research indicates an inverse relation between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal and near-surface soil moisture (SM) over very dry sediments, arid to hyper-arid soils resp., caused by subsurface scattering ef-fects. This phenomenon can lead to large errors when it comes to modelling and remote sensing-based estimation of SM. While the effect of subsurface scattering and its influence on SM estimates is well described and modelled in literature, its actual presence in recorded SAR data is largely unknown. Here we investigate the relation between C-Band SAR backscatter and SM in the hyper-arid environment of the Atacama Desert (Chile). Time series (2018-2020) of Sentinel-1 VV/VH intensities are compared to in situ SM, measured at 17 stations located across the Atacama Desert. Linear and non-linear regression modelling is applied to uncover the relationship between the SAR intensities and in situ SM, while, in addition, SM variations triggered by seasonal varying humidity (i.e., not by precipitation) are investigated. Results indicate (i) a very weak linear relationship between SM variations and SAR intensities (VV/VH) for most meteorological stations in the Atacama (R2 < 0.5). In particular, noticeable and significant exceptions are found for stations located in the northern uplands of the Coastal Cordillera and on sediments, which are characterized by thick atmospheric dust deposits on top of subsurface cemented crusts; (ii) over these sites a strong inverse linear relationship is present (R2 up to 0.84) and the observable seasonal variations in SAR intensity are linked to the seasonal variations in SM; (iii) remarkably low changes in SM (ranging from approx. 1 to 3%) lead to comparable high changes in SAR intensity (up to 5.5 dB in VH and up to 4.0 dB in VV); (iv) employing a non-linear regression modelling to the SAR time series allowed identifying the occurrence and the strength of seasonal variations over the central desert. This study contributes to a better understanding of SAR scattering over arid to hyper-arid soils, indicates a moisture -regulated complex interplay of surface and subsurface scattering, and proves the presence of subsurface scat-tering effects in Sentinel-1C-Band data to occur over large parts of the Atacama Desert.

TI  - Estimating fractional cover of saltmarsh vegetation species in coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta, China using ensemble learning model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saltmarshes in coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services. Satellite remote sensing has been widely used for mapping and classification of saltmarsh vegetation, however, medium-spatial-resolution satellite datasets such as Landsat-series imagery may induce mixed pixel problems over saltmarsh landscapes which are spatially heterogeneous. Sub-pixel fractional cover estimation of saltmarsh vegetation at species level are required to better understand the distribution and canopy structure of saltmarsh vegetation. In this study, we presented an approach framework for estimating and mapping the fractional cover of major saltmarsh species in the Yellow River Delta, China based on time series Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data. To solve the problem that the coastal area is frequently covered by clouds, we adopted the recently developed virtual image-based cloud removal (VICR) algorithm to reconstruct missing image values under the cloud/cloud shadows over the time series Landsat imagery. Then, we developed an ensemble learning model (ELM), which incorporates Random Forest Regression (RFR), K-Nearest Neighbor Regression (KNNR) and Gradient Boosted Regression Tree (GBRT) based on temporal-spectral features derived from the time-series cloudless images to estimate the fractional cover of major vegetation types, i.e., Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa and the invasive species, Spartina alterniflora. High spatial resolution imagery acquired by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Gaofen-6 satellites were used for reference sample collections. The results showed that our approach successfully estimated the fractional cover of each saltmarsh species (average of R-square:0.891, RMSE: 7.48%). Through four scenarios of experiments, we found that the ELM is advantageous over each individual model. When the images during key months were absent, cloud removal for the Landsat images considerably improved the estimation accuracies. In the study area, Spartina alterniflora covers the largest area (5753.97 ha), followed by Phragmites australis with spatial extent area of 4208.4 ha and Suaeda salsa of 1984.41 ha. The average fractional cover of S. alterniflora was 58.45%, that of P. australis was 51.64% and that of S.salsa was 51.64%.

TI  - Long-term reconstruction of satellite-based precipitation, soil moisture,and snow water equivalent in China
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term high-resolution national dataset of precipitation (P), soil moisture (SM), and snow water equivalent (SWE) is necessary for predicting floods and droughts and assessing the impacts of climate change on streamflow in China. Current long-term daily or sub-daily datasets of P, SM, and SWE are limited by a coarse spatial resolution or the lack of local correction. Although SM and SWE data derived from hydrological simulations at a national scale have fine spatial resolutions and take advantage of local forcing data, hydrological models are not directly calibrated with SM and SWE data. In this study, we produced a daily 0.1 degrees dataset of P, SM, and SWE in 1981-2017 across China, using global background data and local on-site data as forcing input and satellite-based data as reconstruction benchmarks. Global 0.1 degrees and local 0.25 degrees P data in 1981-2017 are merged to reconstruct the historical P of the 0.1 degrees China Merged Precipitation Analysis (CMPA) available in 2008-2017 using a stacking machine learning model. The reconstructed P data are used to drive the HBV hydrological model to simulate SM and SWE data in 1981-2017. The SM simulation is calibrated by Soil Moisture Active Passive Level 4 (SMAP-L4) data. The SWE simulation is calibrated by the national satellite-based snow depth dataset in China (Che and Dai, 2015) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover data. Cross-validated by the spatial and temporal splitting of the CMPA data, the median Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of the reconstructed P is 0.68 for all grids at a daily scale. The median KGE of SM in calibration is 0.61 for all grids at a daily scale. For grids in two snow-rich regions, the median KGEs of SWE in calibration are 0.55 and-2.41 in the Songhua and Liaohe basins and the northwest continental basin respectively at a daily scale. Generally, the reconstruction dataset performs better in southern and eastern China than in northern and western China for P and SM and performs better in northeast China than in other regions for SWE. As the first long-term 0.1?daily dataset of P, SM, and SWE that combines information from local observations and satellite-based data benchmarks, this reconstruction product is valuable for future national investigations of hydrological processes.1 Introduction A long-term national terrestrial hydrological dataset with high spatiotemporal resolutions can be used in many hydrological applications such as exploring the controls of rainfall-runoff events (Tarasova et al., 2020; Yang et al.,2020b; Stein et al., 2021), predicting floods and droughts(Van Steenbergen and Willems, 2013; Reager et al., 2014;Abelen et al., 2015), and assessing the impacts of climate change on streamflow and floods (Sharma et al., 2018;Bloschl et al., 2019; Li et al, 2019). As key variables in the hydrological cycle, precipitation (P), soil moisture (SM),and snow water equivalent (SWE) generate riverine run off and determine the wetness states of the basins. Although long-term (at least 30 years) daily P, SM, and SWE can be obtained from many data products in China, these products suffer from a coarse spatial resolution and a lack of local in-formation.

TI  - FLI-1/Melan-A dual stain is an alternative to PRAME in differentiating metastatic melanoma from nodal nevus: A monocentric retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CUTANEOUS PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Melanocytic nevi existing in lymph nodes create a diagnostic challenge by mimicking metastases. PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma (PRAME) immunohistochemical (IHC) stain can differentiate one from another. FLI-1 IHC expression has been shown in malignant melanoma with variable sensitivity while melanocytic nevi were reported to be negative. We hypothesized that FLI-1/Melan-A dual IHC staining may be used in the distinction of metastatic melanoma from nodal nevi and can be an alternative and/or complementary to PRAME. In this study, we examined 13 lymph nodes with metastatic melanoma and 13 lymph nodes with benign deposits. We stained all of the lymph nodes with FLI-1, FLI-1/Melan-A dual, and PRAME IHC stains. In addition, we stained paired skin samples of the metastatic lymph nodes with FLI-1 and PRAME. In primary cutaneous melanomas, 11 of 13 were positive for FLI-1 and PRAME expression (85%). Malignant cells in 12 and 13 lymph nodes showed positive expression of PRAME and FLI-1, respectively. Only one case with a nevic cell deposit was weakly positive for FLI-1 and the remaining benign cases were negative for both FLI-1 and PRAME. Our results show that FLI-1/Melan-A dual stain is as sensitive and specific as PRAME in distinguishing lymph nodes with metastatic melanoma from nodal nevi. Further studies with larger case numbers are needed to support our significant results.

TI  - A global dataset of daily maximum and minimum near-surface air temperature at 1 km resolution over land (2003-2020)
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Near-surface air temperature (Ta) is a key variable in global climate studies. A global gridded dataset of daily maximum and minimum Ta (Tmax and Tmin) is particularly valuable and critically needed in the scientific and policy communities but is still not available. In this paper, we developed a global dataset of daily Tmax and Tmin at 1 km resolution over land across 50 & LCIRC; S-79 & LCIRC; N from 2003 to 2020 through the combined use of ground-station-based Ta measurements and satellite observations (i.e., digital elevation model and land surface temperature) via a state-of-the-art statistical method named Spatially Varying Coefficient Models with Sign Preservation (SVCM-SP). The root mean square errors in our estimates ranged from 1.20 to 2.44 & LCIRC;C for Tmax and 1.69 to 2.39 & LCIRC;C for Tmin. We found that the accuracies were affected primarily by land cover types, elevation ranges, and climate backgrounds. Our dataset correctly represents a negative relationship between Ta and elevation and a positive relationship between Ta and land surface temperature; it captured spatial and temporal patterns of Ta realistically. This global 1 km gridded daily Tmax and Tmin dataset is the first of its kind, and we expect it to be of great value to global studies such as the urban heat island phenomenon, hydrological modeling, and epidemic forecasting. The data have been published by Iowa State University at (Zhang and Zhou, 2022).

TI  - Recent advances in using Chinese Earth observation satellites for remote sensing of vegetation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important component of the Earth system as it supports other terrestrial biological activities through photosynthetic production. The biophysical and biochemical parameters of vegetation retrieved from satellite observations have been extensively used in global vegetation monitoring and Earth system modeling. So far, most of the remote sensing data used for vegetation-related applications are from sensors onboard American or European satellites. From the users' perspective, it would be beneficial to have well-calibrated science-quality Earth observation data from a diverse sources that can not only secure data continuity in case of sensor retirement or failure, but also enable multi-sensor research opportunities such as data fusion or multi-angle remote sensing. In this regard, it is worth exploring the usefulness of the Chinese Earth Observation Satellites (CEOSs) for remote sensing of vegetation. Here we reviewed the recent progress in using the CEOSs data for retrieving key vegetation parameters. We focused on the uncertainty and limitation in using the CEOSs by critically examining the available studies conducted on different vegetation types. We also made recommendations on research opportunities in combining CEOSs data with the existing data from other space agencies. The hope is to offer the community an up-to-date overview of what could be useful to their specific applications by leveraging the orbiting and the planned CEOSs sensors. In addition, critical evaluations from the community are expected to feed back and lead to improved CEOSs data in the future.

TI  - Mapping urban morphology changes in the last two decades based on local climate zone scheme: A case study of three major urban agglomerations in China
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has been bringing extensive land use and land cover change over the last several decades, which has an impact on the urban climate and also further affects public health and energy consumption, due to human activities. The local climate zone (LCZ) classification system was proposed in 2012 to depict the complexity of urban morphology. However, until the present, LCZ long-time series product was rarely seen for its mapping difficulty. This study proposed a framework for mapping annual LCZ time series with spatial-temporal consistency in the three major urban agglomerations in China and the temporal and spatial pattern of LCZ time series was also revealed. The result showed that the high-rise and open urban LCZ types tended to occupy higher proportion in the urban area in the past two decades and urban morphology varied much in urban expansion areas and urban renewal areas. From 2000 to 2020, the differences in urban morphology between the three urban agglomerations and urban areas of different urban sizes narrowed, but the differences between urban areas with different land uses widened.

TI  - Refining adjuvant treatment in endometrial cancer based on molecular features: the RAINBO clinical trial program
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The endometrial cancer molecular classification has been integrated into the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) diagnostic classification and European treatment guidelines, and provides direction towards more effective and less toxic adjuvant treatment strategies for women with endometrial cancer. Primary objective(s) The RAINBO program of clinical trials will investigate four molecular class-directed adjuvant treatment strategies following surgical resection to either increase cure rates through the addition of novel targeted therapies or safely reduce toxicity and improve quality of life through treatment de-escalation. Study hypothesis Molecular-directed adjuvant treatment strategies will improve clinical outcomes and reduce toxicity of unwarranted therapies in women with endometrial cancer. The overarching and translational research RAINBO program will advance knowledge of predictive and prognostic (bio)markers that will improve prognostication and treatment allocation. Trial design The RAINBO program is a platform of four international clinical trials and an overarching research program. The randomized phase III p53abn-RED trial for women with invasive stage I-III p53abn endometrial cancer compares adjuvant chemoradiation followed by olaparib for 2 years with adjuvant chemoradiation alone. The randomized phase III MMRd-GREEN trial for women with stage II (with lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI)) or stage III mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) endometrial cancer compares adjuvant radiotherapy with concurrent and adjuvant durvalumab for 1 year to radiotherapy alone. The randomized phase III NSMP-ORANGE trial is a treatment de-escalation trial for women with estrogen receptor positive stage II (with LVSI) or stage III no specific molecular profile (NSMP) endometrial cancer comparing radiotherapy followed by progestin for 2 years to adjuvant chemoradiation. The POLEmut-BLUE trial is a phase II trial in which the safety of de-escalation of adjuvant therapy is investigated for women with stage I-III POLEmut endometrial cancer: no adjuvant therapy for lower-risk disease and no adjuvant therapy or radiotherapy alone for higher-risk disease. The overarching RAINBO program will combine data and tumor material of all participants to perform translational research and evaluate molecular class-based adjuvant therapy in terms of efficacy, toxicity, quality of life, and cost-utility. Major inclusion/exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria include a histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometrial cancer treated by hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy or sentinel lymph node biopsy, with no macroscopic residual disease after surgery and no distant metastases, and molecular classification according to the WHO 2020 algorithm. Primary endpoint(s) Recurrence-free survival at 3 years in the p53abn-RED, MMRd-GREEN, and NSMP-ORANGE trials and pelvic recurrence at 3 years in the POLEmut-BLUE trial. Sample size The p53abn-RED trial will include 554 patients, the MMRd-GREEN trial 316, the NSMP-ORANGE trial 600, and the POLEmut-BLUE trial 145 (120 for lower-risk disease and approximately 25 for higher-risk disease). The overarching research program will pool the four sub-trials resulting in a total sample size of around 1600. Estimated dates for completing accrual and presenting resultsThe four clinical trials will have different completion dates; main results are expected from 2028.

TI  - Assessing the broadscale effects of wildfire under extreme drought conditions to boreal peatlands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming and changing fire regimes in the North American boreal zone have the capacity to alter the hydrology and ecology of the landscape with long term consequences to peatland ecosystems and their traditional role as carbon sinks. It is important to understand how peatlands are affected by wildfire in relation to both extent of burn and severity of burn to the organic soil (peat) layers where most of the C is stored. Peatlands cover more than 75% of the landscape in the southern Northwest Territories, Canada where extreme drought led to widespread wildfires in 2014-2015. To assess the wildfire effects across a 14.6 million ha study area including 136 wildfire events, we used an integration of field data collection, land cover mapping of peatland and upland ecotypes, Landsat-8-based mapping of burn severity to the soil organic layers, and MODIS-hotspot mapping of fire progression for season of burning. The intersection of these geospatial products allows for a broadscale assessment of wildfire effects across gradients of ecotype, ecoregions, seasons, and year of burn. Using a series of chi-squared goodness of fit tests, we found that peatlands are more susceptible to wildfire on the Taiga shield where they are smaller and hydrologically isolated by the rocky landscape. There burning affected proportionally larger peat areas with an evenness of burn severity to the organic soil layers which may lead to less spatial diversity in post-fire recovery, making the landscape less resilient to future fire. The most resilient peatlands are expected to be hydrologically well-connected to both ground water systems and larger peatland complexes such as those on the Taiga plains which exhibited large unburned and singed patches across the landscape, and greater variability in burn severity across seasons and ecotypes. Understanding the tipping point of drought conditions at which the landscape becomes connected, and peatlands are susceptible to wildfire with deeper burning of the organic soil layers is important for understanding the potential future effects of climate change and projected increases in wildfire on peatlands. This is critical for C accounting and climate mitigation strategies.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) is an important component for identifying carbon stocks, monitoring the impacts of climate change, and evaluating merchantable timber. Accurate prediction of forest AGB is central to the correct interpretation of these components and to produce usable data for planners and researchers. In this study, remotely sensed time-series data derived from Landsat 8 (reflectance (R) and vegetation indices (VI)), topo-graphic (T) and climate (C) data were used as independent variables to predict AGB of pure Calabrian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) stands using multiple regression analysis (MLR) and support vector machines (SVM) methods. The AGB modeling was done by using independent variables individually and by combining variables, and the AGB maps of the most successful models obtained from MLR and SVM methods were produced. It was determined that the most successful variable group was the VI when the independent variables were used one by one (MLR Training R2 = 0.50, SVM Training R2 = 0.67). The most successful predictions in AGB modeling were obtained with combining all independent variables and using the SVM method (Training R2 = 0.85, Validation R2 = 0.69). In the combination of independent variables, VI and C data made the greatest contribution to the success of the AGB prediction. The 'green leaf index' vegetation indices had the most significant effect on the modeling AGB. In this study, T and C in addition to spectral data has increased the AGB estimation performance. It has been found that the SVM method yielded higher model accuracy than MLR method in predicting AGB. Overall, the spectral data and the SVM method can contribute to improving the accuracy of AGB estimates and provide an effective approach towards the capability for forest ecosystem monitoring.

TI  - Evaluating methods to map burned area at 30-meter resolution in forests and agricultural areas of Central India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is a major phenomenon that plays an important role in small-scale ecological processes such as vegetation dynamics and soil erosion, and global processes such as hydrological cycles and climate change. However, global fire databases have low accuracies for burned area detection in areas with small fires, low biomass and in woodlands and open forests that characterize Central India. The present study uses higher resolution (30 meter) Landsat imagery to test accuracies for burned area detection using spectral indices (SI), machine learning (ML) algorithms and supervised classification. We find that detection of burned area by global fire product Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) is very low (<20%). Accuracies are higher for Landsat-based classification of burned area using supervised classification, random forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Accuracies are higher in April-May than in February-March and vary by azimuth angle on the day of image acquisition. RF produced the most consistently high classification accuracies for April (>80%), but had a tendency to misclassify less frequently available land covers; SVM had similar classification accuracies but had a tendency to overfit the model. Both lead to the potential for increasing commission errors and need to be used carefully when predicting burned area. Inclusion of SI had high relative importance in predicting burned area and reduced commission errors. Given these caveats, we recommend using ML algorithms for mapping burned area in the future, as it requires less time investment than classification and can yield consistent results. Accurate mapping of high-resolution fires is important for more accurate inputs into carbon inventories and ecological understanding of land-use dynamics and drivers.

TI  - Dual polarimetric decomposition in Sentinel-1 images to estimate aboveground biomass of arboreal caatinga
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga is a typical biome of the Brazilian semiarid region, and there is a lack of studies to estimate its plant biomass using SAR images. Also, there are no studies at this topic that use information from polarimetric decomposition. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) of the arboreal Caatinga under different phenological conditions using entropy and alpha angle data obtained by different polarimetric filters by Dual Polarimetric Decomposition in Sentinel-1 SAR images. The forest inventory was carried out in 19 sample plots with an area of 30 x 30 m in the Caatinga of Sergipe state, Brazil, using an allometric equation to estimate the AGB. Sentinel-1 images were obtained in 3 phenological conditions of the Caatinga (Greenness, Intermediate and Dryness) to which polarimetric filters (BoxCar - BC, IDAN, Improved Lee Sigma - ILS and Refined Lee - RL) were applied and obtained the entropy (H) and alpha angle (alpha) attributes after Dual Polarimetric Decomposition. The attributes of each polarimetric filter were related to the AGB using linear regressions. The combination of attributes provided higher accuracy than individual estimates: data from Intermediate period provided higher accuracy for AGB estimates, using H of the IDAN filtering and alpha using ILS (R2: 32.05%). The attributes generated through Dual Polarimetric Decomposition in Sentinel-1 images showed a low relationship with the AGB of the Caatinga in the study area. Nevertheless, the study made it possible to indicate which polarimetric filters depending on the different leaf cover conditions in the Caatinga offer greater precision in relation to the measured AGB, serving as the basis for future studies.

TI  - Assessment of Water Quality and Modeling Trophic Level of Lake Manzala, Egypt Using Remotely Sensed Observations after Recent Enhancement Project
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important technology for studying water quality and eutrophication in the aquatic environment. In the present study, Lake Manzala was selected as a case study that is considered the biggest Northern Delta Lake with the highest fish production. A very recent and intensive national dredging project of the lake bottom has been done by the Egyptian government, to enhance the lake's properties and productivity. Fifteen water samples were collected during July, 2021, at the same satellite transit time. Physicochemical parameters of water quality were measured. A new methodology using a modeling approach integrated with remote sensing of Lake Manzala water quality was implemented. Using multivariate data analyses, only four water quality parameters were selected to perform spatial monitoring from satellite data according to R-2, root mean square error and p value through Design Expert 13. These four models were as follows: pH correlates with B2 (Blue), B4 (Red), and B5 near Infrared (NIR), ammonia and phosphate correlate with B5, B6 (SWIR 1), and B7 (SWIR 2), respectively, while nitrate correlates with B1, B3 (Green), and B4 with R2, with respective correlation coefficients of 0.61, 0.89, 0.95, and 0.78. Following the model's calibration and validation, the spatial variation of water quality was identified using satellite data. The results showed that this approach is effective and valid for modeling and spatiotemporal mapping of the water quality in Lake Manzala. Finally, the trophic state index (TSI) shows three classes of eutrophication; moderately mesotrophic, eutrophic and hypereutrophic. Hypereutrophic is the term used to describe the region of the Lake in the south where Bahr El-Baqr empties. Given that it can be used in other regions with comparable conditions, this tool offers action planners and stakeholder's invaluable assistance. In order to select the bands that were correlated with the quality measurements, statistical modeling was carried out. Next, a stepwise regression analysis was used to model each parameter. Finally, a spatiotemporal mapping of water quality was presented.

TI  - Delineation of vegetation shaded ox-bow lakes in Ganges flood plain, India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Floating vegetation cover over the ox-bow lake withstands against its sharp delineation. A good many spectral indices are successfully used for water body delineation. But how far these are applicable in vegetation-shaded ox-bow lakes is a research question. The study also aimed that if the existing indices are not satisfactory and how a new index could be endorsed for resolving the problem. The study additionally monitored the ox-bow lake and vegetation cover area from 1991 to 2021 based on Landsat satellite images. Normalized differences water index (NDWI), Modified NDWI (MNDWI), Re-modified NDWI (RmNDWI), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spectral indices were used for delineating ox-bow lakes and multiple accuracy test measures revealed that these are not highly satisfactory. Vegetation inclusive aggregated water index (ViAWI) was built by coupling mentioned spectral indices with the vegetation index and the ensemble map was found more accurate. Monitoring the ox-bow lake area clearly showed that these declined in the last 30 years irrespective of the historical drainage modification legacy of the major rivers to which the ox-bow lakes belonged. Aquatic vegetation cover within ox-bow lakes changed dynamically. The endorsed ViAWI would be a good approach for resolving wetland delineation shaded with floating vegetation and it could be used in other regional units worldwide. Quantitative information regarding ox-bow lake and vegetation cover within ox-bow lakes would be valuable data support for adopting ox-bow lake conservation and restoration planning.

TI  - Assessing predictability of post-monsoon crop residue fires in Northwestern India
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past five decades, the Green Revolution in India has been a great success resulting in significantly increased crop yields and food grain productivity. Northwestern India, also known as the country's breadbasket, alone produces two-thirds of the wheat and rice grains under the crop rotation system. Our previous study has shown that the post-monsoon rice crop production in the Punjab state of India has increased by 25%. The crop yields produce proportionate amounts of residue, a large part of which is subjected to burn in the open fields due to the near-absence of a wide-scale, affordable, and environmentally sustainable removal mechanism. A significant increase in crop productivity coincides with a 60% increase in post-harvest crop residue burning during 2002-2016. The study also demonstrated a robust relationship between satellite measurements of vegetation index-a proxy for crop amounts, and post-harvest fires-a precursor of air pollution events, for predicting seasonal agricultural burning. In this report, the efficacy of the proposed prediction model is assessed by comparing the forecasted seasonal fire activity against the actual detection of active fires for the post-monsoon burning seasons of 2017-2021. A simple linear regression model allows efficient prediction of seasonal fire activity within an error of up to 10%. In addition to forecasting seasonal fire activity, the linear regression model offers a practical tool to track and evaluate the effectiveness of the residue management system intended to reduce fire activities and resulting air pollution.

M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection using carbon nanoparticles in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer and the value of lymph node pathological ultrastaging detection.METHODS: A total of 79 patients with cervical cancer in IA2, IB1, IB2, IIA1 and IIICp1 stages admitted to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Nanfang Hospital between June, 2018 and January, 2021 were included in this study. During the operation, the patients were injected with a total of 0.25 mL carbon nanoparticles at 3 and 9 o'clock of the normal cervix after general anesthesia. The first black-dyed lymph nodes were identified as SLNs and removed one by one. All the patients underwent pelvic lymph node dissection and radical hysterectomy with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy. The black-dyed SLNs were removed for routine pathological examination. Thirty patients with negative SLNs were randomly selected for pathological ultrastaging.RESULTS: In 67 of the 79 patients, a total of 417 SLNs were detected with a detection rate of 84.8%; in each patient, at least 1 SLN was detected with a mean SLN number of 5.28. After the operation, 5 patients were found to have positive SLNs; 1 patient was negative for SLN but positive for non-SLN. The sensitivity of SLN biopsy was 83.3% with a specificity of 100%, false negative rate of 16.7%, an accuracy of 98.5% and a negative predictive value of 98.4%. SLN was distributed mainly in the obturator region, the external iliac region, the internal iliac region and the total iliac region (15.11%). Univariate and multivariate analyses suggested that preoperative cervical coning (P=0.045 and 0.009) and tumor size (P=0.033 and 0.008) significantly affected the overall detection rate of SLN. Kappa test showed a high consistency between SLN and pelvic lymph node metastasis status (Kappa value=0.901, P < 0.001). In 30 patients with negative pathological results of SLN, pathological ultrastaging detection identified no micrometastases or isolated tumor cells.CONCLUSION: Carbon nanoparticle tracing of the SLNs is safe and feasible in the diagnosis and treatment of cervical cancer, and SLN detection is safe in patients with primary lesion size below 2 cm or without cervical conization. SLN combined with pathological ultrastaging detection does not improve the detection rate of isolated tumor cells or micrometastases.

TI  - Examining human disturbances and inundation dynamics in China's marsh wetlands by using time series remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological regime is one of the most significant characteristics of wetlands, which maintains the structural and functional integrity of wetland ecosystems. China experienced rapid economic development since the 1990s, which caused severe degradation of all types of wetlands, especially marsh wetlands that are easily converted through filling or draining. Therefore, it is crucial to examine the inundation alterations in marshes as well as the forces behind the changes. In this study, the inundation dynamics in marsh wetlands of China were documented using time-series Landsat observations from 1992 to 2018. Then, nighttime light data was utilized to indicate the intensity of urbaniza-tion and infrastructure construction, which was incorporated with historical statistics to conduct attribution analyses of wetland inundation changes. Great spatial heterogeneity in the water distribution and change trajectory was ob-served in different areas. Severe wetland desiccation took place in Inner Mongolia and East China, in which the inun-dation area decreased by 51.3 % and 20.9 %, respectively. By contrast, the water area in North China and Tibetan Plateau increased by 58.2 % and 21.0 %, respectively. Behind the tremendous changes, anthropogenic factors played dominant roles. The marsh wetlands in East China, North China, and Southwest China took up only 1.9 % of the total marsh area but accounted for 26.0 % of the entire nighttime light volume. In East China and Southwest China, urban-ization and infrastructure construction had significantly negative effects on wetland inundation. Overgrazing or unreg-ulated irrigation altered the original inundation dynamics of marsh wetlands in Inner Mongolia, Southwest China, the Tibetan plateau, and Northeast China. This study illustrated the possible driving forces behind wetland inundation changes, which could help to locate degrading marsh wetlands triggered by anthropogenic activities. Then, targeted management and conservation actions could be implemented.

TI  - Analysis of land use/land cover change trends over Birr River Watershed, Abbay Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABILITY INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use/land cover (LULC) are a global environmental concern that has a significant impact on sustainable land and water resource management and development as well as hydrological processes. The pri-mary driving forces of LULC changes in developing countries are population pressure, demand for firewood collection and construction material, shortage of cultivated land, land tenure insecurity, and deforestation. Focusing on the Ethiopian Birr river watershed, the study investigates changes in LULC trends, extents, and magnitudes over the last 32 years using geospatial technologies such as Landsat images of 1986, 2001, and 2018. The supervised land use land cover classification technique was applied to classify the LULC classes using the maximum likelihood algorithm technique. Between 1986 and 2018, agricultural land increased significantly from 56.39% to 70.19%, while settlements increased from 0.73%) to 1.42%. On the other hand, bushlands, forest areas, and grasslands LULC classes in the study area decreased from 26.18% to 19.30%, 4.94%-1.92%, and 11.77%-7.16%, respectively. The findings suggest that integrated watershed management and land use planning should be concerned and implemented in the Birr River watershed.

AB  - The Oncology Grand Rounds series is designed to place original reports published in the Journal into clinical context. A case presentation is followed by a description of diagnostic and management challenges, a review of the relevant literature, and a summary of the authors' suggested management approaches. The goal of this series is to help readers better understand how to apply the results of key studies, including those published in Journal of Clinical Oncology, to patients seen in their own clinical practice.The following case represents a relatively common clinical scenario of a postmenopausal female patient who presents with low-risk, estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, early-stage, left-sided breast cancer to discuss the role of postoperative radiation (RT) following wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel node biopsy. The spectrum of choices, ranging from omission of RT, accelerated partial breast irradiation (PBI), whole-breast radiation therapy, and the nuances of various dose/fractionation regimens for each option, are discussed in the context of the Danish Breast Cancer Study Group (DBCSG) PBI trial published in this issue, with additional review of other key trials that inform these treatment recommendations. After consideration of the clinical-pathologic features in the framework of the existing data and an in-depth discussion taking into consideration the patient's preferences/goals, the decision was made to deliver moderately hypofractionated RT (40 Gy/15 fractions) to a PBI volume, in concordance with the DBCSG-PBI trial.

TI  - Joint use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data for rapid mapping of volcanic eruption deposits in Southeast Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia and Papua New Guinea (PNG) have 97 active volcanoes with high concentration of human life in the very close proximity to them. In case of a volcanic eruption, provision of detailed information on affected regions is very crucial to support rescue and humanitarian relief organizations. In this paper, we present a semi-automated unsupervised knowledge-based region growing procedure that utilizes Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, from Sentinel-1, and optical data, from Sentinel-2, for mapping land surface changes after volcanic eruptions. With initial seed points, being placed on active volcano vents and areas affected by thermal anomalies (derived from Sentinel-2), the region growing procedure considers interferometric coherence data in unvegetated sites, and radar brightness and polarimetric decomposition features at vegetated sites. We selected five eruptive events that occurred between 2018 and 2021 at the Indonesian volcanoes of Karangetang, Semeru, Sinabung and at Ulawun Volcano on PNG. The eruption patterns varied with respect to duration, spatial extent and ejected volcanic materials. The results indicated that usage of radar brightness features with interferometric coherence already gives good change delineation. However, in the Ulawun test case, where heavy ash and scoria fall occurred, the addition of polarimetric decomposition features substantially improved the output accuracy due to the improved detection of ash deposits. The presented change detection method is straight forward to implement, and will strongly improve rapid mapping activities during as well as after major volcano eruptions.

TI  - Egg parasitoids of green shield bug, <i>Palomena prasina</i> L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in hazelnut orchards of Turkey
T2  - BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Green shield bug (GSB), Palomena prasina L. (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an important pest of hazelnut orchards causing significant yield and quality losses in Turkey. The application of insecticides is the only option to manage GSB in Turkey; however, effective and alternative eco-friendly control practices are needed to manage the pest in the country. Surveys of egg parasitoids using frozen sentinel egg masses were conducted in the main hazelnut-growing regions of Turkey. Furthermore, the composition of native species parasitising GSB eggs and their parasitism rates were determined under field conditions. A total of 11,570 eggs were exposed to field conditions, of which 10,386 eggs were recovered from the surveyed area after 7 days in 2018 and 2019. Trissolcus cultratus, Tr. belenus, Tr. sp1, Telenomus turesis, and Te. sp1 were morphologically identified as egg parasitoids, which was molecularly confirmed based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (CO1). The parasitism rate was 9.3% for all eggs exposed to field conditions. Trissolcus cultratus was the predominant species and responsible for 70.06% of the parasitism rate, followed by Tr. belenus (15.75%), Te. turesis (10.26%), Te. sp1 (3.83%), and Tr. sp1 (0.01%). The existence of Tr. cultratus is reported for the first time in Turkey. The egg parasitoid species of GSB determined in this study witnessed the presence of natural parasitism in the natural habitat of the pest. Furthermore, it must be considered that Tr. cultratus can act as a facultative hyperparasitoid.

TI  - Validating remotely sensed land surface phenology with leaf out records from a citizen science network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology indices derived from multispectral remote sensing data are used to estimate primary productivity, track impacts of climate change and predict fire seasons. Such indices may, however, lack accuracy due to effects of snow and water, different vegetation types, and parameter choices for determining green-up and green-down. Here, we compare remotely sensed green-up dates with an extensive database of 57,000 leaf out and flowering observations from the Alberta PlantWatch citizen science network. We evaluate older global 5 km resolution VIP-NDVI and VIP-EVI2 v4 and v5 products, a regional 250 m resolution MOD09Q1-NDVI v6 product specifically designed for Alberta, and a recent 500 m resolution MCD12Q2-EVI2 v6 product. Overall, we find that MCD12Q2-EVI2 had the highest precision and least bias relative to ground observations, representing a signif-icant advance over earlier phenology products. Different vegetation types showed a staged remotely sensed phenology in Alberta, with deciduous forest green-up first, followed by grasslands about 5 days later, and conifer forests green-up with a 10-day delay, allowing for corrections for different vegetation types. All products showed reduced interannual variability compared to ground observations, which may also lead to underestimating im-pacts of directional climate change. However, also in this respect MCD12Q2-EVI2 was superior, maintaining approximately 60% of the interannual variability. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that remotely sensed time series estimations of advances in leaf out may benefit from bias correction.

Lax definitions are the reason, but such symbolic worlds will not disappear even if we do not refer to them, and we need operational and heuristic conceptualizations, both to analyze such symbolic parameters as a study objective and to refer to them as the appropriate understanding contexts of other topics. Here, definitions with a multidimensional structure that imply heuristic potential are specified as a solution; previous proposals are reviewed; the needs for improvement are set out; and a consequent conceptualization is proposed. Then onto-epistemic tenets of the main cultures on Earth and of history are briefly described as such worldviews, a case in Basque culture tested to assess the heuristic potential, and an outstanding 'transversal' implication is advanced: worldviews should not only be considered multidimensional concepts with heuristic potential, but also formed with areas around prototypes by cognitive-linguistic operators across the tenets.

TI  - Automatic shadow detection in high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadows in high-resolution remote sensing satellite images distort both apparent shapes hues leading to lost features and difficult object analysis when processing these images. This negatively affects image color correction, recognition, classification, and urban reconstruction uses for these images. Although many shadow detection methods have been developed, there are still cases of missing detection of small shadows and misclassification of blue, green, and dark areas. We propose a novel logarithmic normalized mixed property-based shadow index (LNMPSI) for shadow detection in high resolution images using analysis of multispectral characteristics to improve on existing methods. Using color images from WorldView-3 and Gaofen-1, our method outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative terms. With good visual results and average accuracy in excess of 91%, our method is feasible, stable, and effective in detecting shadow regions and further reduces false positives caused by the loss of small details and misclassification of difficult areas.

TI  - Automated attribution of forest disturbance types from remote sensing data: A synthesis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Remote sensing is widely used to detect forest disturbances (e.g., wildfires, harvest, or outbreaks of pathogens or insects) over spatiotemporal scales that are infeasible to capture with field surveys. To understand forest ecosystem dynamics and the ecological role of human and natural disturbances, researchers and managers would like to characterize spatiotemporal patterns of several types of disturbance. Recent advances include the development and testing of algorithms to automatically detect and attribute an array of disturbance types across large forest landscapes from remotely sensed imagery. We reviewed the scientific literature for automated disturbance type attribution in forest ecosystems to synthesize current knowledge and inform future work. We created metrics that characterize study contexts, methods, and outcomes to evaluate 34 studies that automated the attribution of several (two or more) forest disturbance types. Reported accuracies of similar to 80% for up to eight disturbance types at local (500 km(2)) to continental (6.5 x 106 km(2)) spatial extents reaffirm the potential for attributing forest disturbances from remote sensing data at scales relevant to ecological research and forest management. Generally, greater accuracies were reported for attributing disturbance types that affect most of a pixel and exhibit spectral signatures distinct from other disturbances or the prior (undisturbed) condition. Accuracy of attributing disturbance type tends to be notably lower for disturbances with smaller spatial extents or resulting in subtle spectral changes, such as small patches of tree mortality covering <40% of a pixel or areas of tree damage without evident mortality (e.g., defoliator outbreaks). Nearly all (33 of 34) studies used Landsat image time series to attribute disturbance types because the Landsat archive is freely accessible, spans several decades (allowing longer-term change analyses), is calibrated to facilitate change analyses, and has multiple spectral bands that aid algorithms. In our synthesis, most studies focused on specific disturbance types of interest within a particular study area, rather than a comprehensive list of types that would make the algorithm more generally applicable at broader spatial extents. We recommend several future research areas to improve the thematic resolution, accuracy, and potentially the transferability of attribution algorithms. Further development and testing of algorithms will continue to reveal the most effective approaches for attributing disturbance types that have been more difficult to detect with available spectral data to date, such as insect damage or low severity wildfire, and to evaluate model sensitivity as well as accuracy. The lessons that collectively emerge from automated forest disturbance attribution studies have the potential to guide future research and management applications.

TI  - Geomorphic diversity of the middle Araguaia River, Brazil: A segment-scale classification to support river management
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex mosaic of geomorphic units that characterizes the fluvial corridor of large rivers poses challenges to effectively describe and discriminate the landforms diversity, and is relationships with the hydrosedimentological dynamics and state of the system. Consequently, the classification of the diverse array of fluvial features into discrete segments can be a systematic and organized approach useful to sustain geomorphicallyinformed management strategies. Here we propose a methodological approach and characterize the geomorphic diversity of the middle Araguaia River by applying a classification of reaches into segments with a certain consistent level of morphological variability. A GIS framework developed for this purpose relied on the survey, analysis, and statistical treatment of morphological variables derived from remote sensing data. It allowed to differentiate 19 distinct reaches (R1-R19) that were further clustered into five major segments (SI-SV). We investigated the first-order controls of the fluvial style in each of the identified segments and found that changes in valley gradient influence in a major way the segments I, III, and IV, while the entrance of important tributaries and the nature of the valley floor are natural governing factors in segments II and V, respectively. The system exhibits a significant morphological diversity among segments, and it is strongly influenced by the late Holocene avulsion history of the river. Given the increasing pressure of human activities on the hydrological system, the present study can be of use to subsidize sustainable management plans aiming to safeguard the last large freeflowing river of the Cerrado biome, and our methodological proposal is valid for use in other large rivers worldwide.

TI  - Influence of host age and low-temperature storage on parasitization by the egg parasitoid <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae)
T2  - APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the usefulness of cold-stored eggs of the fruit-piercing stink bug, Glaucias subpunctatus (Walker) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) for a field survey of the egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae). Laboratory surveys revealed the effects of host age and storage under low temperatures on parasitism. The rate of parasitizing 0-3 day-old host eggs was close to 100%, but it significantly decreased for 4 and 5 day-old eggs. The storage temperature and the storage period significantly affected the parasitism rate. Adequate parasitism rates of eggs stored at + 4 or - 80 ? were also confirmed in a field survey. From these results, we clarified the optimal age and storage temperature of host eggs for a field survey of this egg parasitoid.

TI  - High abundance of solar wind-derived water in lunar soils from the middle latitude
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data revealed that the presence of water (OH/H2O) on the Moon is latitude-dependent and probably time-of-day variation, suggesting a solar wind (SW)-originated water with a high degassing loss rate on the lunar surface. However, it is unknown whether or not the SW-derived water in lunar soil grains can be preserved beneath the surface. We report ion microprobe analyses of hydrogen abundances, and deuterium/hydrogen ratios of the lunar soil grains returned by the Chang'e-5 mission from a higher latitude than previous missions. Most of the grain rims (topmost similar to 100 nm) show high abundances of hydrogen (1,116 to 2,516 ppm) with extremely low delta D values (-908 to -992 parts per thousand), implying nearly exclusively a SW origin. The hydrogen-content depth distribution in the grain rims is phase-dependent, either bell-shaped for glass or monotonic decrease for mineral grains. This reveals the dynamic equilib-rium between implantation and outgassing of SW-hydrogen in soil grains on the lunar surface. Heating experiments on a subset of the grains further demonstrate that the SW-implanted hydrogen could be preserved after burial. By comparing with the Apollo data, both observations and simulations provide constraints on the governing role of temperature (latitude) on hydrogen implantation/migration in lunar soils. We predict an even higher abundance of hydrogen in the grain rims in the lunar polar regions (average similar to 9,500 ppm), which corresponds to an estimation of the bulk water content of similar to 560 ppm in the polar soils assuming the same grain size distribution as Apollo soils, consistent with the orbit remote sensing result.

TI  - The role of surveillance imaging for resected high-risk melanoma
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecommendations for surveillance imaging for resected melanoma vary considerably. This study examined the utility of imaging in patients with a high-risk primary melanoma undergoing a protocolized imaging schedule. MethodsThis retrospective study involved data collection regarding imaging, recurrence, and outcome characteristics for patients referred to the Victorian Melanoma Service from January 2016-April 2020 and managed for resected stage IIC or III melanoma. Patients with a T4b tumor who did not undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy were included (T4bNX). Recurrences were "clinically detected" if they were primarily detected by patient symptoms or physical examination, or 'imaging-detected' if the patient was asymptomatic. Cox regression models including time-varying co-variates were used to assess the impact of imaging-detected versus clinically-detected recurrence on overall survival. ResultsOver a median follow-up time of 2.7 years, 199 patients underwent surveillance imaging (T4bNX:22, IIC:33, IIIA:22, IIIB:60, IIIC:61, IIID:1), and 44% (n = 88) experienced disease recurrence. Imaging detected over half (53%) of all recurrences. In adjusted analyses, mortality risk was reduced after an imaging-detected compared to clinically-detected recurrence at any given time from the start of surveillance (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.10-0.66, p = .005). ConclusionOur study indicates that routine imaging in the early follow-up period of resected T4bNX, stage IIC and III melanoma plays an important role in the detection of asymptomatic recurrences. Imaging-detected recurrence may be associated with a survival benefit and studies with more prolonged follow-up are required to confirm these findings.

TI  - Extraction of long time series wetland information based on Google Earth Engine and random forest algorithm for a plateau lake basin-A case study of Dianchi Lake, Yunnan Province, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are transitional zones between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. They have the potential to contin-uously provide human beings with food, raw materials, and other substances. Also, wetland landscape pattern changes have profound impacts on the climate of plateau areas and accelerate the rate of climate change, so it is crucial to extract long time series of plateau wetland information. Concurrent with large-scale urbanization, industrial development and construction, and rapid population increases, the lakeside wetlands in the Dianchi Lake Basin are changing rapidly. However, scholars have not yet extracted long time series wetland information for this area, so the long-term evolution of these wetlands cannot be clarified. In this study, we used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to extract wetland information for the Dianchi Basin from 1988 to 2020 from Landsat data and generated 33 wetland maps by applying a random forest classification model to identify trends and a confusion matrix to assess accuracy. The results showed that the overall trend of wetland area from 1988 to 2020 showed an increasing area, and the total wetland area increased by 31.11 km2 (+9.67 %). Furthermore, the overall accuracy of most years exceeded 80 %, the QADI was no higher than 0.2, the user accuracy and producer accuracy were higher than 80 % and 70 %, respectively, for swamps and water bodies, and the remaining non -wetland categories also achieved robust classification accuracy. Thus, the results of this study can compensate for the lack of information on wetland changes in the region over the past 33 years and provide data support and a scientific basis for sustainable wetland development in the plateau.

TI  - Fuzzy Risk Assessment of a Stormwater Storage System in a Poorly Gauged Mine Site: The Case of the Golgohar Mine Site
T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although many approaches have been proposed for flood risk assessment in urban areas, an equivalent methodology for remote mine sites with poor hydrological data records is still needed. This paper provides a fuzzy methodology based on calculating the hydrological return period discharge and the resistance-load theory for embankment failure risk assessment of an existing drainage storage system (lake) at the Golgohar mine site. The uncertainty of the two uncertain components, load and resistance, were endowed with triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs) describing possible values the two components may have. First, based on a comparison of two consecutive Sentinel-2A images and the model water volume, a new manual storm water management model (SWMM) calibration technique was introduced. Then, three well-known synthetic rainfall hyetograph generation methods based on a single point of the rainfall curve were input into the calibrated SWMM model. Second, the BRCH-J model was used to calculate the maximum water level in the lake if an embankment breach occurs in two scenarios, with an unprotected and a fully riprap-protected downstream face. Afterward, the SWMM and BRCH-J outputs were used to define the TFN parameters representing the load (surface flow) and resistance (lake capacity). Finally, on the basis that both TFNs must match, a fuzzy risk product with alpha-cut principles was defined, as was the difference between the TFNs representing the load and resistance. The result indicates that the available stormwater storage volume exceeded the expected capacity; the risk of embankment failure was 0.15%, which was less than the design risk (1%, based on the hydrological return period concept).

TI  - Epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus in children younger than 5 years in England during the COVID-19 pandemic, measured by laboratory, clinical, and syndromic surveillance: a retrospective observational study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Seasonal epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cause a clinically significant burden of disease among young children. Non-pharmaceutical interventions targeted at SARS-CoV-2 have affected the activity of other respiratory pathogens. We describe changes in the epidemiology of RSV among children younger than 5 years in England since 2020.Methods Surveillance data on RSV infections, comprising laboratory-confirmed cases, proportion of positive tests, hospital admissions for RSV-attributable illness, and syndromic indicators for RSV-associated disease (emergency department attendances for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis, non-emergency health advice telephone service [NHS 111] calls for cough, general practitioner [GP] in-hours consultations for respiratory tract infections, and GP out-of-hours contacts for acute bronchitis or bronchiolitis) were analysed from Dec 29, 2014 to March 13, 2022, for children younger than 5 years. Data were extracted from national laboratory, clinical, and syndromic surveillance systems. Time-series analyses using generalised linear models were used to estimate the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting SARS-CoV-2 on RSV indicators, with absolute and relative changes calculated by comparing observed and predicted values.Findings RSV-associated activity was reduced for all RSV indicators during winter 2020-21 in England, with 10 280 (relative change -99middot5% [95% prediction interval -100middot0 to -99middot1]) fewer laboratory-confirmed cases, 22middot2 (-99middot6%) percentage points lower test positivity, 92 530 (-80middot8% [-80middot9 to -80middot8]) fewer hospital admissions, 96 672 (-73middot7% [-73middot7 to -73middot7]) fewer NHS 111 calls, 2924 (-88middot8% [-90middot4 to -87middot2]) fewer out-of-hours GP contacts, 91 304 (-89middot9% [-90middot0 to -89middot9]) in-hours GP consultations, and 27 486 (-85middot3% [-85middot4 to -85middot2]) fewer emergency department attendances for children younger than 5 years compared with predicted values based on winter seasons before the COVID-19 pandemic. An unprecedented summer surge of RSV activity occurred in 2021, including 11 255 (1258middot3% [1178middot3 to 1345middot8]) extra laboratory-confirmed cases, 11middot6 percentage points (527middot3%) higher test positivity, 7604 (10middot7% [10middot7 to 10middot8]) additional hospital admissions, 84 425 (124middot8% [124middot7 to 124middot9]) more calls to NHS 111, 409 (39middot0% [36middot6 to 41middot8]) more out-of-hours GP contacts, and 9789 (84middot9% [84middot5 to 85middot4]) more emergency department attendances compared with the predicted values, although there were 21 805 (-34middot1% [-34middot1 to -34middot0]) fewer in-hours GP consultations than expected. Most indicators were also lower than expected in winter 2021-22, although to a lesser extent than in winter 2020-21.Interpretation The extraordinary absence of RSV during winter 2020-21 probably resulted in a cohort of young children without natural immunity to RSV, thereby raising the potential for increased RSV incidence, out-of-season activity, and health-service pressures when measures to restrict SARS-CoV-2 transmission were relaxed.Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended sediment concentrations in coastal waters of the South China Sea, off Sarawak, Borneo: ocean colour remote sensing observations and analysis
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-quality ocean colour observations are increasingly accessible to support various monitoring and research activities for water quality measurements. In this paper, we present a newly developed regional total suspended solids (TSSs) empirical model using MODIS Aqua's Rrs(530) and Rrs(666) reflectance bands to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in TSS dynamics along the southwest coast of Sarawak, Borneo, with the application of the Open Data Cube (ODC) platform. The performance of this TSS retrieval model was evaluated using error metrics (bias = 1.0, MAE = 1.47, and RMSE = 0.22, in milligrams per litre) with a log10 transformation prior to calculation as well as using a k-fold cross-validation technique. The temporally averaged map of the TSS distribution, using daily MODIS Aqua satellite datasets from 2003 until 2019, revealed that large TSS plumes were detected - particularly in the Lupar and Rajang coastal areas - on a yearly basis. The average TSS concentration in these coastal waters was in the range of 15-20 mgL(-1). Moreover, the spatial map of the TSS coefficient of variation (CV) indicated strong TSS variability (approximately 90 %) in the Samunsam-Sematan coastal areas, which could potentially impact nearby coral reef habitats in this region. Study of the temporal TSS variation provides further evidence that monsoonal patterns drive the TSS release in these tropical water systems, with distinct and widespread TSS plume variations observed between the northeast and southwest monsoon periods. A map of relative TSS distribution anomalies revealed strong spatial TSS variations in the Samunsam-Sematan coastal areas, while 2010 recorded a major increase (approximately 100 %) and widespread TSS distribution with respect to the long-term mean. Furthermore, study of the contribution of river discharge to the TSS distribution showed a weak correlation across time at both the Lupar and Rajang river mouth points. The variability in the TSS distribution across coastal river points was studied by investigating the variation in the TSS pixels at three transect points, stretching from the river mouth into territorial and open-water zones, for eight main rivers. The results showed a progressively decreasing pattern of nearly 50 % in relation to the distance from shore, with exceptions in the northeast regions of the study area. Essentially, our findings demonstrate that the TSS levels on the southwest coast of Sarawak are within local water quality standards, promoting various marine and socio-economic activities. This study presents the first observation of TSS distributions in Sarawak coastal systems with the application of remote sensing technologies and aims at enhancing coastal sediment management strategies for the sustainable use of coastal waters and their resources.

TI  - Predictive nomogram based on serum tumor markers and clinicopathological features for stratifying lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study was aimed to establish the nomogram to predict patients' axillary node status by using patients' clinicopathological and tumor characteristic factors. Methods: A total of 705 patients with breast cancer were enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly divided into a training group and a validation group. Univariate and multivariate ordered logistic regression were used to determine the predictive ability of each variable. A nomogram was performed based on the factors selected from logistic regression results. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, calibration plots and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the discriminative ability and accuracy of the models. Results: Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that CEA, CA125, CA153, tumor size, vascular-invasion, calcification, and tumor grade were independent prognostic factors for positive ALNs. Integrating all the predictive factors, a nomogram was successfully developed and validated. The C-indexes of the nomogram for prediction of no ALN metastasis, positive ALN, and four and more ALN metastasis were 0.826, 0.706, and 0.855 in training group and 0.836, 0.731, and 0.897 in validation group. Furthermore, calibration plots and DCA demonstrated a satisfactory performance of our nomogram. Conclusion: We successfully construct and validate the nomogram to predict patients' axillary node status by using patients' clinicopathological and tumor characteristic factors.

A1  - Local Burden Dis Sub-Saharan Afric
TI  - Mapping age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence in adults in sub-Saharan Africa, 2000-2018
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is still among the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and the world is not on track to meet targets set for ending the epidemic by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Precise HIV burden information is critical for effective geographic and epidemiological targeting of prevention and treatment interventions. Age- and sex-specific HIV prevalence estimates are widely available at the national level, and region-wide local estimates were recently published for adults overall. We add further dimensionality to previous analyses by estimating HIV prevalence at local scales, stratified into sex-specific 5-year age groups for adults ages 15-59 years across SSA.MethodsWe analyzed data from 91 seroprevalence surveys and sentinel surveillance among antenatal care clinic (ANC) attendees using model-based geostatistical methods to produce estimates of HIV prevalence across 43 countries in SSA, from years 2000 to 2018, at a 5x5-km resolution and presented among second administrative level (typically districts or counties) units.ResultsWe found substantial variation in HIV prevalence across localities, ages, and sexes that have been masked in earlier analyses. Within-country variation in prevalence in 2018 was a median 3.5 times greater across ages and sexes, compared to for all adults combined. We note large within-district prevalence differences between age groups: for men, 50% of districts displayed at least a 14-fold difference between age groups with the highest and lowest prevalence, and at least a 9-fold difference for women. Prevalence trends also varied over time; between 2000 and 2018, 70% of all districts saw a reduction in prevalence greater than five percentage points in at least one sex and age group. Meanwhile, over 30% of all districts saw at least a five percentage point prevalence increase in one or more sex and age group.ConclusionsAs the HIV epidemic persists and evolves in SSA, geographic and demographic shifts in prevention and treatment efforts are necessary. These estimates offer epidemiologically informative detail to better guide more targeted interventions, vital for combating HIV in SSA.

TI  - Impact of seasonal fluctuations of ice velocity on decadal trends observed in Southwest Greenland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - By tracking the feature displacement between satellite images spaced approximately one year apart, surface runoff has been shown to have a long-term impact on the average ice flow of a land-terminating sector of Greenland. In this study, we revisit the multi-year trends in ice flow by assessing more carefully the impact of seasonal fluctuation in velocity on the annual mean ice velocity. We find that, depending on the length and period used to measure displacement, seasonal fluctuations do have an impact on observed velocities on up to 15%, and can affect decadal trends. Nevertheless, the magnitude of this fluctuation is small enough to confirm the general slowdown observed during the 2000-2012 period. Between 2012 and 2019, we find significant re-acceleration of low-lying glaciers tongue but velocity trends elsewhere are generally insignificant and not spatially consistent. Finally, we propose a more selective approach to recovering velocity trends using satellite imagery that involves using only measurements where the image pair starting date is before summer, in order to have comparable measurements for every year, sampling a melt season and the following winter.

TI  - Evaluation method of ecological water demand threshold of natural vegetation in arid-region inland river basin based on satellite data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological water demand (EWD) of natural vegetation is a key issue in regional water resource allocation and ecosystem management. Although the evaluation of the EWD of vegetation has been emphasized in numerous studies, research on the threshold EWD of vegetation, including the minimum and optimum EWD, as well as an effective quantitative analysis framework, are still lacking. Therefore, in this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation in the plain area of the Tarim River Basin over the last22 years was estimated based on remote sensing image data. Additionally, the multi-year dynamics of the EWD of natural vegetation were analyzed. In this study, the concept of "latitude" was adopted from studies of ecosystem resilience, to propose a novel analytical framework to measure the minimum and optimal EWD of natural vegetation in inland arid areas. The results show that the average minimum and optimum EWD of natural vegetation is105.45 and 135.53 mm, respectively. The average minimum EWD of woodland and high-and low-coverage grassland is 129.13, 284.38, and 111.40 mm, respectively, and the mean value of the optimum EWD is 152.96, 382.05, and 141.16 mm, respectively. The novel approach of this study is simple and easy to use, and provides an effective method for quantitative evaluation of the EWD threshold of natural vegetation.

TI  - Modeling gridded urban fractional change using the temporal context information in the urban cellular automata model
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The cellular automata (CA) based models have been extensively used in urban sprawl modeling to support sustainable urban planning. However, in most existing urban CA models, only abrupt conversion (i.e., from non urban to urban) was considered, whereas the difference in urbanization levels among different grids, as well as the nature of continuous urban evolution process with gradually increasing urban densities, were commonly ignored. Here, we proposed an impervious surface area (ISA) based urban CA model that can simulate the urban fractional change within each grid, using annual urban extent time series data from satellite observations. We implemented the developed ISA-based urban CA model in Beijing (China) and evaluated its performance through model comparison and scenario analyses. We found the ISA-based urban CA model can well capture the dynamics of urban sprawl with improved performance compared to the traditional urban CA model. The spatial pattern of modeled ISA is generally consistent with observed satellite data, with the root mean square error between the modeled and referred results of 0.14 across all changed pixels. Besides, results from our developed model agree well with the binary urban CA model, with notably reduced overestimation errors. The urban fractional change within each grid revealed in our model can provide more details than the traditional binary urban CA models, showing great potential in supporting sustainable urban development. Furthermore, the developed ISA-based urban CA model can be used for regional, even global scale urban sprawl modeling with urban fractional information in each grid, to support decision-making on the sustainable management and conservation of natural land resources.

TI  - An Integrated Approach to Unravel the Structural Controls on Groundwater Potentialities in Hyper-arid Regions Using Satellite and Land-Based Geophysics: A Case Study in Southwestern Desert of Egypt
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Groundwater exploration is the most promising way to overcome water scarcity in hyper-arid regions around the world. Due to the scarcity of hydrogeological information in these regions, groundwater exploration is a challenging issue requiring the joint application of satellite and land-based information to delineate the groundwater aquifers in such harsh environments. In this research, an integrative approach was undertaken for groundwater exploration in the southwestern corner of Egypt as one of the most hyper-arid regions in North Africa. To fill the knowledge gap in this large area, two high-resolution satellite gravity datasets (EIGEN-6C4 and TOPEX-1min) were employed in combination with land-based geophysical surveys for a better understanding of groundwater potentialities in terms of structural controls. Further, the approaches of high-pass filter, tilt angle derivative, and enhanced horizontal gradient amplitude were used to analyze EIGEN-6C4 dataset. Additionally, 2D and 3D models along with a high-pass filtered gravity map were constructed to provide the subsurface barriers and preferential groundwater flow pathways. Several NNE windows have been recognized, particularly to the east of Gabel Kamel along Uweinat-Aswan uplifting allowing groundwater flow along northeastern structural trends. To verify this assumption, land-based magnetic and DC resistivity sounding surveys were executed at two selected sites based on the interpretation of satellite gravity and remote sensing data. The resistivity and 2D magnetic modeling reveal the presence of remarkable sub-basins with sufficient saturated sedimentary cover. Ultimately, the review of the different datasets, including satellite gravity and land-based geophysical investigations, facilitated the geological interpretation for detecting the structural controls on the groundwater flow paths and produced satisfactory results at shorter time frames and lower costs compared to typical groundwater exploration in arid or hyper-arid regions of the same characteristics elsewhere.

TI  - Spatio-temporal fluctuations analysis of land surface temperature (LST) using Remote Sensing data (LANDSAT TM5/8) and multifractal technique to characterize the urban heat Islands (UHIs)
T2  - SUSTAINABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES AND ASSESSMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the microenvironment and radiative susceptibility, as well as forecasting of climate and weather scenarios in urban contexts, are critical for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). Rapid urbanization has a substantial impact on both the local and global atmosphere, resulting in Urban Heat Islands (UHIs). This study is the first to attempt to analyze spatiotemporal space-borne sensor datasets in the Indian Himalayan foothills using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MDFA). The coefficients derived through MDFA such as holder exponent (h), spectral width (alpha), irregularity, truncation spectra, and spatial distribution are analyzed for various land features to illustrate the dynamic patterns and corroborate the multi-fractality behavior of the land surface temperature (LST). The negative correlation between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) suggests that vegetated land can assist to mitigate the effects of UHIs, whereas the positive correlation between LST and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) suggests that urbanization can aggravate the effects of UHIs. The obtained result encourages to implementation of the sug-gested framework to address anthropogenic heat and the transportation of surface heat fluxes, as well as em-powers to work on non-linear dynamic climate models, which are critical for building real-time resilient infrastructure to meet environmental sustainability.

TI  - Air pollution in central European capital (Budapest) via self-made passive samplers and Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is to identify the types of ultra-fine air pollutants present in the local atmosphere. The authors utilize Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images to identify the presence of Aerosol Optical Thickness (T550), and later verify this presence through physical sample collection using self-made passive samplers (SMPSs) at various locations in Budapest ((A) Passenger Cruise Port, (B) Kunsthalle, (C) Szechenyi Lanchid, and (D) Liberty Bridge). The samples obtained from the SMPSs were analyzed by X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to identify the minerals present in ultra-fine phases (e. g. minerals and ultra-fine amorphous). The images from the Sentinel-3B SYN satellite, taken between 2018, 2019 and 2021 allowed us to identify the Aerosol Optical Thickness (T550) at these same locations in Budapest. The SMPS samples revealed the presence of ultra-fine particles containing elements dangerous to human health, such as: As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Ti, V and Ni. The points analyzed in the Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images showed a 50.89% reduction in T550 levels in the city of Budapest, attributed to the COVID-19 epidemic, which clearly demonstrates the need to reduce pollutants for a better quality of life in this central capital of Europe.

TI  - These hills called home: quantifying urban forest dynamics in the hills of the Guwahati metropolitan area, india
T2  - GEOGRAFISK TIDSSKRIFT-DANISH JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest loss and fragmentation are critical issues that confront urban landscapes. The urban forests in the hills of the Guwahati Metropolitan Area (GMA) in India have experienced significant transformations. This study assesses the temporal changes of forests in protected and non-protected hills of the GMA. Landsat imageries between 1976 and 2018 were used to understand changes in forest composition and fragmentation using landscape metrics namely, percentage of landscape, number of patches, mean patch size, patch density and largest patch index. The results revealed that the forests of GMA were experiencing intense losses and fragmentation due to increasing non-forest anthropogenic developments. The dense and moderately dense forests declined by 44 and 43%, respectively, as non-forest area increased by 1475 ha between 1976 and 2018. Dense forest demonstrated increasing fragmentation due to the rising number of small patches from 568 to 780. Today, dense forest patches are limited to only three of the eight reserved forests within GMA. The non-protected hills reported a significant 1309% increase of non-forest landuse. Thus, both protected and non-protected forests sustained substantial losses and fragmentation. The analysis could enable policymakers to prioritize urban forest conservation efforts in the GMA.

TI  - What is going on within google earth engine? A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a geospatial processing platform based on geo-information applica-tions in the 'cloud'. This platform provides free access to huge volumes of satellite data for com-puting, and offers support tools to monitor and analyse environmental features on a large scale. Such facilities have been widely used in numerous studies about land management and planning. Considering the current lack of relevant overviews, it may be useful to evaluate the utilization paths of GEE and its impact on the scientific community. For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted using the PRISMA methodology based on 343 articles published from 2020 to 2022 in high-impact scientific journals, selected from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After an overview of the publishing context, an analysis of the frequency of satellite features, pro-cessing methods, applications are carried out, and a special attention is given to the COVID-19 studies. Finally, the geographical distribution of the reviewed articles is evaluated, and the cita-tion impact metrics is analysed. On a bibliometric approach, 90 journals published articles on GEE in the reference period (January 2020 to April 2022), and this large number of journals re-veals the multidisciplinary application of GEE platform as well as the interest of publishers to-wards this topic of relevance for the international scientific community. The results of the meta -analysis following the systematic review showed that: (i) the Landsat 8 was the most widely-used satellite (25%); (i) the non-parametric classification methods, mainly Random Forest, were the most recurrent algorithms (31%); and (iii) the water resources assessment and prediction were the most common methodological applications (22%). A low number of articles about COVID-19, in spite of the planetary importance of the pandemic effects. The reviewed articles were geo-graphically distributed among 86 countries, China, United States, and India accounting for the large number. 'Remote Sensing' and 'Remote Sensing of Environment' were the leading journals in the citation impact metrics, while the Random Forest method and the agriculture-related appli-cations being the mostly cited. It is expected that these results might change over the mid to long term, due to fast progress in environmental and spatial information technologies, although cur-rently our findings may be worthwhile and useful for assessing the current global deployment of GEE platform.

TI  - What drives the decrease of glacier surface albedo in High Mountain Asia in the past two decades?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface albedo is an important factor affecting glacier ablation, and a positive feedback mechanism has been observed between the surface albedo and mass balance of glaciers. It is important to understand the driving factors and mechanisms of glacier albedo changes (GAC). Based on the MODIS (Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)-derived MOD10A1 and MYD10A1 albedo products, the glacier albedo trends in each MODIS grid cell during each melt season in High-Mountains Asia (HMA) from 2000 to 2020 were calculated. Decreasing gla-cier albedo trends were found, with a decline rate of 0.25 x 10-2 yr-1; in addition, the GACs exhibited great spatial differences among the 15 subregions. The geographical detector model (GDM) is a new spatial statistical method that can quantitatively reveal the driving forces of climate factors and light-absorbing particles on GAC under single-factor and two-factor interactions. These driving forces can be measured by the corresponding q value. The results showed that on the whole, solid precipitation (snowfall) had the strongest impact on GAC, followed by the glacier surface tem-perature. The q values of black carbon (BC) and dust were <0.1, but BC or dust had the greatest q value in the 9 sub-regions. The effects of each factor differed among different elevation zones. The interaction detector indicated that the q value under the influence of two factors was greater than that under a single factor, and the strongest interaction was between snowfall and BC, followed by between snowfall and dust. In 15 subregions, most of the greatest q values in each region corresponded to an interaction with BC or dust. Here, we obtained the main driving factors of GAC in dif-ferent regions and emphasized the interactions between climatic factors and light-absorbing particles; these results provide references for further studies of glacier mass balance and surface albedo.

TI  - Surface soil moisture modeling using C-band SAR observations at different stages of agricultural crops
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) can be helpful in irrigation monitoring, water conservation, and a variety of other hydrological modeling applications. The majority of previous researches concentrated on the applicability or development of soil moisture models at only one stage of agricultural crop. The goal of this research is to model SSM of agricultural crops at different crop stages using C-band SAR data. The SSM of agricultural crops modeled include Paddy, Tomato, Sugarcane, and Maize fields. The whole crop cycle of these crops are divided into vegetative, maturity and yield stage. Field data like soil moisture, roughness, and Vegetation Water Content (VWC) were gathered in synchronization with the satellite pass over the study area. SEM's for each crop stage is developed and compared to existing models like Oh 2004 and WCM. From the study, it is observed temporal variation of SSM is almost uniform for the whole crop cycle of sugarcane (similar to 5%). But in case of other crops, SSM is high during the seedling/vegetative stage and comparatively less during the yield stage. Developed SSM models using SAR data is performing well in vegetative and maturity stage of all crops whereas in yield formation stage of maize and paddy error is comparatively high. On the hand, both developed and existing models did not perform well in case of sugarcane crop at maturity and yield stage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only study that deals with surface soil moisture modeling of different crops and their stages at the plot scale in the semi-arid tropics.

TI  - Challenges in automatic forest change reporting through land cover mapping
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date knowledge about changes in forest resources and their spatial distribution is essential for sustainable forest management. Therefore, monitoring of forest evolution is increasingly demanded by national and international agencies to design forestry policies and to track their progress. Annually updated land cover maps based on open access satellite imagery may serve as a primary tool for monitoring forest surface evolution over time. Spatially detailed information about forest change might be obtained by comparing land cover maps over time. This study aims to better understand the processes underlying pixels whose land cover changes from 1 year's map to the next and to understand why errors occur. In this study, two annual land cover maps were produced using Sentinel-2 images and afterwards they were compared. The comparison was performed in terms of total surface occupied in each map by each of the classes (net comparison) and in terms of spatial agreement, comparing the results pixel to pixel. The study was performed for the entire region of Galicia (in the Northwest of Spain) for the years 2019 and 2020. Land cover maps obtained had overall accuracies of 82 and 85 per cent. Differences in the total surface of change were encountered when performing the net comparison and spatial agreement comparison. The detailed analysis performed in this study helps to better understand the processes underlying the maps' discrepancies revealing the processes leading to wrongly identified forest changes. Future studies could aim to integrate this knowledge into the monitoring system to improve the ultimate usability of land cover maps to retrieve information about forest changes.

TI  - Evaluating the faithfulness of saliency maps in explaining deep learning models using realistic perturbations
T2  - INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep Learning has reached human-level performance in several medical tasks including clas-sification of histopathological images. Continuous effort has been made at finding effective strategies to interpret these types of models, among them saliency maps, which depict the weights of the pixels on the classification as an heatmap of intensity values, have been by far the most used for image classification. However, there is a lack of tools for the systematic evaluation of saliency maps, and existing works introduce non-natural noise such as random or uniform values. To address this issue, we propose an approach to evaluate the faithfulness of the saliency maps by introducing natural perturbations in the image, based on oppose-class substitution, and studying their impact on evaluation metrics adapted from saliency models. We validate the proposed approach on a breast cancer metastases detection dataset PatchCamelyon with 327,680 patches of histopathological images of sentinel lymph node sections. Results show that GradCAM, Guided-GradCAM and gradient-based saliency map methods are sensitive to natural perturbations and correlate to the presence of tumor evidence in the image. Overall, this approach proves to be a solution for the validation of saliency map methods without introducing confounding variables and shows potential for application on other medical imaging tasks.

TI  - Soil moisture estimates over sporadically flooded farmlands: synergies and biases of remote sensing and in situ sources
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological processes in ecosystems and regulates water and energy exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. Global coverage of surface soil moisture (SSM) satellite estimates makes them a fundamental source of information, while the validation of these estimates is usually based on in situ measurements, ideally from networks that cover areas similar to the satellite data resolution. However, as we expose in this study, both SSM data sources face challenges over extremely flat regions with large SSM variability. A homogenous farming region in the subhumid Pampas of Argentina, characterized by a large interannual rainfall variability as well as a marked annual cycle of rainfall and cropping, was taken as a case study. The region is almost devoid of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, is subject to large episodic flood and waterlogging events and holds an in situ network belonging to the Argentinean National Commission for Space Activities. This in situ network was set to evaluate the soil moisture estimated by satellite missions, such as SMAP and SAOCOM. However, several of these sites have been placed close to homesteads in a more uniform perennial vegetation than the prevailing seasonal crop. In this work, we examine how this placement bias influences SSM dynamics and its interpretation. We find that in situ data fails to capture the large seasonal and daily SSM variability caused by the cropping dynamics as well as the situation of waterlogging. As for the satellite SSM estimates, provided by the SMOS and SMAP missions in this study, while they capture the impact of cropping on SSM, data gaps can hinder robust statistical analysis. During periods of waterlogging, SSM values can lie outside the dynamic range considered valid by satellite missions, and thus are usually removed by users, creating 'blind spots' for high soil water content stages in flood-prone lands. Our study underlines the importance of using multiple sources of information to interpret the hydrological status, including data from in situ measurements and remote sensing estimations of SSM as well as, when available, locally collected information such as reports from national, sub-national and private agro-industrial agencies.

TI  - How does the fire regime change after creating a protected area in the Brazilian Cerrado?
T2  - JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire is a natural factor maintaining biodiversity and several ecological processes. The Brazilian Cerrado, considered the savanna with the highest biodiversity, is characterized by climatic seasonality, vegetation mosaics and topographic variations that together with fire determine its different plant physiognomies. The Chapada das Mesas National Park (CMNP), located in the south of the state of Maranha similar to o (Brazil), has different savanna plant physiognomies with high ecological potential and archaeological and water wealth. The aim of the present study was to reconstruct the fire history over 28 years for the park and its surroundings (20 km buffer area), endeavouring to understand the impact of the creation of this National Park on its fire regime. Landsat satellite images were used from the TM, ETM + and OLI sensors to map the fire scars, which were identified and vec-torized manually. The database created was used to analyze the total annual burned area, burned area per-centage, density ignition, mean burn scar area and fire frequency during the mapped period. In total, 86 % of the CMNP was burn at least once between 1990 and 2017, while 72 % of the buffer area was burn. The creation of the park had significant effects on the density ignition when the periods before (1990-2005) and after (2006-2017) its creation were compared, and showed no significant effects on total annual area burned and average burn scar area. Despite the amount of burned area over time did not change significantly between the years before and after, the main change was observed in the fire seasonality after the creation of the park. In the park, 38 % of the area had a frequency of burn areas higher than ten times in the 28-year interval while 13 % of the buffer area was burn more than 10 times. In contrast, 23 % and 15 % had a fire frequency of 2 to 4 times on the buffer and the park respectively. Although the park was created to mitigate the human impacts of fire, the geographic isolation, the current occupation of the park by local populations and the pressure from agricultural expansion in the surroundings are influencing these conservation measures. Understanding the spatial-temporal distribution of fire in protected areas of the Cerrado contributes to improving management, preservation and conservation actions, so that in future studies other factors can be included to better understand the dynamic of fire occurrence in the region of the CMNP and in other protected areas of the Cerrado.

TI  - Change detection in a rural landscape: A case study of processes and main driving factors along with its response to thermal environment in Farim, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study aims to investigate the alteration of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change and its response to changes in land surface temperature (LST) and heat island phenomena of a rural district known as Farim in the north of Iran from 1990 to 2020 using multi-date Landsat data. The random forest-based algorithm, supported by Google Earth Engine, is used to execute the LULC classification with an overall accuracy of more than 92%. Based on the LULC results, in terms of area changes, the classes of bare land, rice fields, and water bodies encountered an increase, but woods and dry farms decreased. The present study also incorporates the trends of land cover change that are analyzed using regression based on the temporal datasets of the three leading driving factors: temperature, precipitation, and population. The result demonstrates that the main changing factors of the mostly changed class (bare land) are population/precipitation and temperature/population. Additionally, the effect of LULC change on seasonal LST and urban heat island (UHI) is also analyzed in this study. The result witnessed a significant LST rise in the summer and winter seasons of about 12.87 & DEG;C and 14.2 & DEG;C, respectively over the study period. The Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), characterizing the heat island phenomenon, shows that the strongest UTFVI zone is in the central area and the none UTFVI zone is in the surrounding region. Moreover, both seasons have seen a significant rise in none UTFVI zones compared to decreasing strongest UTFVI zone. The result of the present study will be helpful for urban planners and climate researchers who study future land cover change and its associated driving factors.

TI  - Exploring the potential of Sentinel-3 delay Doppler altimetry for enhanced detection of coastal currents along the Northwest Atlantic shelf
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we evaluate Sentinel-3A satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) altimeter observations along the Northwest Atlantic coast, spanning the Nova Scotian Shelf, Gulf of Maine, and Mid-Atlantic Bight. Comparisons are made of altimeter sea surface height (SSH) measurements from three different altimeter data processing approaches: fully-focused synthetic aperture radar (FFSAR), un-focused SAR (UFSAR), and conventional low-resolution mode (LRM). Results show that fully-focused SAR data always outperform LRM data and are comparable or slightly better than the nominal un-focused SAR product. SSH measurement noise in both SAR-mode datasets is significantly reduced compared to LRM. FFSAR SSH 20-Hz noise levels, derived from 80-Hz FFSAR data, are lower than 20-Hz UFSAR SSH with 25% noise reduction offshore of 5 km, and 55-70% within 5 km of the coast. The offshore noise improvement is most likely due to the higher native along-track data posting rate (80 Hz for FFSAR, and 20 Hz for UFSAR), while the large coastal improvement indicates an apparent FFSAR data processing advantage approaching the coastlines. FFSAR-derived geostrophic ocean current estimates exhibit the lowest bias and noise when compared to in situ buoy-measured currents. Assessment at short spatial scales of 5-20 km reveals that Sentinel-3A SAR data provide sharper and more realistic measurement of small-scale sea surface slopes asso-ciated with expected nearshore coastal currents and small-scale gyre features that are much less well resolved in conventional altimetric LRM data.(c) 2022 COSPAR.

TI  - Retrieval of total suspended solids from remote sensing reflectance in highly eutrophic lakes in Hanoi (Vietnam)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of suspended solids can cause water quality deterioration, leading to ecological degradation of the aquatic environment. In highly eutrophic waters, they are important carriers of pollutants and nutrients. Therefore, quantifying total suspended solids concentration (C-TSS) is critical for any water quality monitoring program. This study proposes two band ratio algorithms for estimating C-TSS in highly eutrophic lakes based on a data set of 180 in situ samples of remote-sensing reflectance, R-rs lambda , and C-TSS measured simultaneously across 10 dates in four lakes and reservoirs in Hanoi (Vietnam). The in situ C-TSS ranges from 2.7 to 73.3 mg l(-1), averaging at 24.9 mg l(-1), and is highly correlated to water transparency (the correlation coefficient, r = 0.73), chl-a concentration (r = 0.78), and the trophic state index (r = 0.89). Our analyses demonstrate the appropriateness of the near-infrared/red spectral ratio, R-rs 815/R-rs 655 , model (N = 124) for estimating C-TSS in the study lakes (the determination coefficient, R-2 = 0.84). The model was then verified with a small error (the root mean square error, RMSE = 4.1 mg l(-1)) using independent multi-date-obtained data sets (N = 56). The model is further optimized to establish a regional C-TSS estimation model for Landsat 8/OLI and Sentinel 2/MSI bands using the 865 and 655 (or 665) nm bands. The band ratios showed reasonable estimations when applying to the respective spectral band ratios, i.e. the OLI's band 5/band 4 (R-2 = 0.58; RMSE = 7.7) and the MSI band 8/band 4 (R-2 = 0.73; RMSE = 6.1).

TI  - Sea ice image classification based on ResFPG network and heterogeneous data fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice detection has played an important role in climate protection and strategic deployment. Due to the autonomous learning characteristics of deep learning, it has been gradually applied to the classification of remote sensing sea ice images. At present, deep learning models are mostly used in sea ice classification of single source remote sensing data. Due to the limitations of single source data and the information loss of deep learning model in the process of feature extraction layer by layer, it is inevitable to encounter a bottleneck in sea ice detection requiring fine classification. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a sea ice image classification method based on ResNet16-feature pyramid networks-spatial pyramid pooling-gated fusion network (ResFPG) and heterogeneous data fusion. In the feature extraction part, the method uses the improved ResNet16 to extract the multi-level feature information of sea ice in synthetic aperture radar data and optical data, reducing information loss in the feature extraction process, then mines and fuses the low-level spatial information and high-level semantic information through the improved feature pyramid networks (FPN), and then collects and fuses the output features of different scales through the spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network. In the feature fusion part, a gated feature-level fusion strategy is designed to further improve the overall classification accuracy by adaptively adjusting the feature contribution of two heterogeneous sources of data through the gated fusion network (GFN). In order to verify the effectiveness of this method, we use two sets of heterogeneous sea ice remote sensing data located in Hudson Bay area for experiments. The experimental results show that compared with other image classification methods, the proposed method fully excavates and integrates the multi-scale and multi-level features in heterogeneous data, effectively distinguishes the feature contribution, and achieves better classification results (97.14% and 95.85%).

TI  - An Ensemble Hydrologic Modeling System for Runoff and Evapotranspiration Evaluation over an Agricultural Watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling framework for simulation at a finer scale is important for long-term water resources planning for management. It has always been a challenge to select the appropriate model to simulate the hydrology of a watershed/river basin at a finer spatial resolution. Comparative evaluation of models based on field observations could help researchers to select the suitable model for their purpose. However, a single hydrologic model generally leads to simulation uncertainties due to poor input data, model structure, and model output uncertainty in large-scale exercises. The ensemble model approach could be a better decision-making tool to overcome uncertainty in modeling hydrological processes. In the present study, a widely used macroscale hydrologic model, the three-layer Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC-3L), was employed to simulate runoff and evapotranspiration (ET) at 3' x 3' grids (similar to 5.5 km) resolution over an agriculture-based Marol watershed (5092 km(2)) of India. The VIC-simulated results were compared and assessed with the results obtained from the Hydrologic Response Unit (HRU)-based Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model. Further, the ensemble of VIC and SWAT outputs (EnSwaVi; averages of individual model-simulated datasets with equal weights) was also assessed. Simulated runoff and ET were evaluated using observed discharge data at the outlet of the watershed and the actual ET product (MOD16A2) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), respectively. The simulated discharge values generated by the two models were closely matched with the observed flow. Conversely, ET simulated by VIC was found to be more precise as compared to SWAT. A minimal difference between two model results can be due to the difference in the model structure and runoff simulation method. In general, the ensembles of VIC and SWAT outputs (EnSwaVi) were found better than the individual model outputs. The ensemble modeling approach could provide more reliable assessments of hydrological processes for the planning and management of water resources.

TI  - Effects of Selenium-Enriched Rape Returning Amount on Available Selenium Content in Paddy Soil and Selenium Accumulation in Rice
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Selenium-rich rape "Selenium Ziyuan No.1" was used as green manure to study the effects of different amounts of green manure returned to the field on the release characteristics of available selenium in acidic paddy soil in southern China, and to analyze the absorption and transformation of selenium in rice, so as to provide a theoretical basis for planting natural selenium-rich rice in acidic areas of southern China. Six treatments with different amounts of selenium-enriched rapeseed returning (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 t/hm(2)) were set up. Two rice varieties (selenium-rich rice variety Meixiangzhan 2 and common rice variety Zhongguangxiang 1) were selected. The results showed that (1) with the increase of selenium-rich rapeseed returning amount, the available selenium in soil showed an increasing trend. Over time, soil available selenium showed a significant increasing trend, and the content of soil available selenium reached the maximum at tillering stage, and then decreased. (2) For selenium-rich varieties, when the amount of selenium-rich rapeseed returned to the field was less than 15 t/hm(2), the selenium content in rice grains increased significantly with the increase of the amount of selenium-rich rapeseed returned to the field, then remained basically stable. For conventional varieties, with the increase of the amount of selenium-rich rapeseed returned to the field, the selenium content of rice grains showed an increasing trend, but the overall selenium content was much lower than that of selenium-rich variety. (3) With the increase of the amount of rapeseed returned to the field, the rice yield had an increasing trend, but the maximum rice yields appeared when the amount of selenium-rich rapeseed returned to the field was 15 t/hm(2). Therefore, Se-enriched rape returning could promote the release of available selenium in soil and the enrichment of selenium in rice plants, and significantly increase the selenium content in rice. According to the selenium content and yield of rice, it is suggested that the selenium-rich rice variety Meixiangzhan 2 was chosen and the amount of Se-rich rape returning is 15 t/hm(2).

TI  - Socio-ecological conflicts and (cosmo)political reconfigurations in the Peruvian Amazonia: the case of the Wampis Nation
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL AMERICAN AND CARIBBEAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper, which draws on research carried out in collaboration with the first indigenous government to be officially constituted in the Peruvian Amazonia, the Gobierno Territorial Autonomo de la Nacion Wampis (GTANW), describes the governance structure and territorial policies of this new political actor. Research activities conducted between June and August 2017 included fourteen interviews with Wampis political leaders and GTANW activists, three discussion groups organized and co-animated by the participants and the participant observation of a variety of activities related to the democratic life and territorial governance of the Wampis Nation. In the context of an explosion of social conflictuality caused by the expansion of extractive industries in Wampis territory, the GTANW puts into practice a vision of indigenous political and territorial self-determination that revendicates Wampis cosmopraxis, ancestral knowledge and traditional institutions of political leadership. Through a participatory democracy based on consensus building, Wampis political leaders and GTANW activists seek to establish an economic development model compatible with their worldview. Results suggest that, in the Peruvian Amazonian context, socio-ecological conflicts are rooted in different ontological understandings of the territory that is being disputed and of the stakeholder entities involved in the conflict, and therefore do not occur in a unified system of signs and cosmovisions shared by all the conflict stakeholders. The newly formed indigenous government's intent is to create spaces for political dialogue in epistemic equality by translating their cosmovisions into terms that are negotiable to the State and other institutions.

TI  - Fusion level of satellite and UAV image data for soil salinity inversion in the coastal area of the Yellow River Delta
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and accurate determination of soil salt content (SSC) and its spatial distribution are of great significance for the prevention and improvement of soil salinization. Satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data have complementary advantages. The fusion of satellite and UAV multisource remote sensing data to improve the accuracy of SSC based on inversion methods has become a hot topic, and the appropriate fusion level of multisource remote sensing data needs to be explored and determined. The objective of this study was to determine the appropriate fusion level of Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (Sentinel-MSI) and UAV image data for SSC inversion by comparing the fusion effect of three levels (spectral data, spectral index, and spectral model). A numerical regression method was employed to analyse the relationship between Sentinel-MSI and UAV image data (MSI-UAV), and MSI-UAV data were fused at different levels. Then, the appropriate fusion level and best inversion model were optimized to realize regional SSC inversion. The results indicate that spectral data fusion was better than spectral index fusion for enhancing the SSC spectral response, with the correlation between spectral indices and SSC increasing by 0.139-0.167 after fusion. After spectral data fusion, the model improved the SSC inversion accuracy most obviously, with a calibration R-2 of 0.623, validation R-2 of 0.571, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) of 1.821. Therefore, spectral data fusion was found to be superior in enhancing the spectral response of soil salinity and in improving the accuracy of the estimation model. This research optimized spectral data fusion as the appropriate fusion level of MSI-UAV for SSC inversion and formed a set of high-precision MSI-UAV multisource remote sensing fusion inversion approaches for SSC.

TI  - Classification and mapping of low-statured shrubland cover types in post-agricultural landscapes of the US Northeast
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Novel plant communities reshape landscapes and pose challenges for land cover classification and mapping that can constrain research and stewardship efforts. In the US Northeast, emergence of low-statured woody vegetation, or shrublands, instead of secondary forests in post-agricultural landscapes is well documented by field studies, but poorly understood from a landscape perspective, which limits the ability to systematically study and manage these lands. To address gaps in classification/mapping of low-statured cover types where they have been historically rare, we developed models to predict shrubland distributions at 30 m resolution across New York State (NYS), using a stacked ensemble combining a random forest, gradient boosting machine, and artificial neural network to integrate remote sensing of structural (airborne LIDAR) and optical (satellite imagery) properties of vegetation cover. We first classified a 1 m canopy height model (CHM), derived from a patchwork of available LIDAR coverages, to define shrubland presence/absence. Next, these non-contiguous maps were used to train a model ensemble based on temporally segmented imagery to predict shrubland probability for the entire study landscape (NYS). Approximately 2.5% of the CHM coverage area was classified as shrubland. Models using Landsat predictors trained on the classified CHM were effective at identifying shrubland (test set AUC = 0.893, real-world AUC = 0.904), in discriminating between shrub/young forest and other cover classes, and produced qualitatively sensible maps, even when extending beyond the original training data. After ground-truthing, we expect these shrubland maps and models will have many research and stewardship applications including wildlife conservation, invasive species mitigation and natural climate solutions. Our results suggest that incorporation of airborne LiDAR, even from a discontinuous patchwork of coverages, can improve land cover classification of historically rare but increasingly prevalent shrubland habitats across broader areas.

TI  - Exploring the effect of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns on urban cooling: A tale of three cities
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on our society, environment and public health, in both positive and negative ways. The main aim of this study is to monitor the effect of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns on urban cooling. To do so, satellite images of Landsat 8 for Milan and Rome in Italy, and Wuhan in China were used to look at pre-lockdown and during the lockdown. First, the surface biophysical characteristics for the pre-lockdown and within-lockdown dates of COVID-19 were calculated. Then, the land surface tem-perature (LST) retrieved from Landsat thermal data was normalized based on cold pixels LST and statistical parameters of normalized LST (NLST) were calculated. Thereafter, the correlation coefficient (r) between the NLST and index-based built-up index (IBI) was esti-mated. Finally, the surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) of different cities on the lockdown and pre-lockdown periods was com-pared with each other. The mean NLST of built-up lands in Milan (from 7.71 degrees C to 2.32 degrees C), Rome (from 5.05 degrees C to 3.54 degrees C) and Wuhan (from 3.57 degrees C to 1.77 degrees C) decreased during the lockdown dates compared to pre-lockdown dates. The r (absolute value) between NLST and IBI for Milan, Rome and Wuhan decreased from 0.43, 0.41 and 0.16 in the pre-lockdown dates to 0.25, 0.24, and 0.12 during lock -down dates respectively, which shows a large decrease for all cities. Analysis of SUHI for these cities showed that SUHII during the lockdown dates compared to pre-lockdown dates decreased by 0.89 degrees C, 1.78 degrees C, and 1.07 degrees C respectively. The results indicated a high and substantial impact of anthropogenic activities and anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) on the SUHI due to the substantial reduction of huge anthropogenic pressure in cities. Our conclusions draw attention to the contribution of COVID-19 lockdowns (reducing the anthro-pogenic activities) to creating cooler cities.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Synergy of dual - polarimetric radar vegetation descriptor and Gaussian processes regression algorithm for estimation of leaf area index
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) emerged as a powerful algorithm since last decade in many applications. However, it is not fully explored in remote sensing applications, especially for predicting plant biophysical variables in the heterogeneous environment of India. This kernel-based machine learning technique has effectively replaced conventional approaches for estimating vegetation characteristics from remotely sensed data. In this work, an attempt has been made to test the ability of GPR to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) of wheat crops using the Sentinel-1 (S1) derived Dual-Polarized Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI) and Sentinel-2 (S2) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) products. Further, the ability of the atmospheric correction procedure was tested by S2 Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) images. To accomplish this, the field measurements of LAI were carried out from January to March 2020. Further comparisons of the GPR's performance were made with the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) coupled with the PROSAIL (PROSPECT+SAIL) radiative transfer model, available through the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) Biophysical processor. The accuracy of the estimated LAI was evaluated using the statistical indicators, for example, coefficient of determination (R ( 2 )), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE). The results showed that the synergy of the GPR and DpRVI provided the most accurate result (R ( 2 ) = 0.822, RMSE = 0.503 m(2) m(-2), NSE = 0.831) as compared to the GPR and TOA (R (2) = 0.816, RMSE = 0.596 m(2) m(-2), NSE = 0.803) and SNAP biophysical processor (based on ANN) (R (2) = 0.696, RMSE = 0.760 m(2) m(-2), NSE = 0.578). Therefore, the study demonstrated the importance of S1 SAR images and GPR as an alternative tool among the other well-established machine learning algorithms to estimate the crop biophysical parameters.

TI  - Prediction of geosynchronous electron fluxes using an artificial neural network driven by solar wind parameters
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are hundreds of satellites operating at the geosynchronous (GEO) orbit where relativistic electrons can cause severe damage. Thus, predicting relativistic electron fluxes is significant for spacecraft safety. In this study, using GOES satellite data during 2011-2020, we propose two neural network models with two hidden layers to predict geosynchronous relativistic electron fluxes at two energy chan-nels (>0.8 MeV and > 2 MeV). The number of input neurons of the two channels (>0.8 MeV and > 2 MeV) are determined to be 36 and 44, respectively. The > 0.8 MeV model has 22 and 9 neurons in the hidden layers, while the > 2 MeV model has 25 and 15 neurons in the hidden layers. The input parameters include the north-south component of the interplanetary magnetic field, solar wind speed, solar wind dynamic pressure and solar wind proton density. Through the analysis of different time delays, we determine that the optimal time delays of two energy channels (>0.8 MeV and > 2 MeV) are 8 days and 10 days, respectively. The training set and validation set (Jan 2011-Dec 2018) are divided by the 10-fold cross-validation method, and the remaining data (Jan 2019-Feb 2020) is used to analyze the model performance as a test set. The prediction results of both energy channels show good agreement with satellite observations indi-cated by low RMSE (-0.3 cm-2sr-1s-1), high PE (-0.8) and CC (-0.9). These results suggest that only using solar wind parameters is capable of obtaining reasonable predictions of geosynchronous relativistic electron fluxes.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Station-dependent satellite laser ranging measurement corrections for TOPEX/Poseidon
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The TOPEX/Poseidon (T/P) altimetry mission with its main objectives to monitor variations of the global and regional sea level as well as ocean circulation is a milestone in Earth observation. The spacecraft was launched in 1992 and it is the predecessor mission of the Jason series and Sentinel-6A. For laser ranging measurements from the Earth to the spacecraft, T/P was equipped with a non-ideally designed annular retroreflector array. Its large dimensions of over 160 cm in diameter caused huge optical phase centre variations which limit the orbit accuracy. In this study, we developed a continuous, analytical correction function that counteracts both, phase centre vari-ations at the spacecraft and station-related laser ranging measurement errors such as range biases. For most Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) ground stations that tracked the T/P spacecraft, an individual set of six correction parameters is estimated. The parameters are valid for the entire mission or, in some cases, for a defined period. The developed function uses the observation's viewing angles to determine a correction value which is added to the range measurement. Applying the measurement correction reduces the overall T/P mission root mean square fit of SLR residuals from 33.78 cm to 1.97 cm (1.59 cm for SLR core stations). External orbits based on the joint analysis of two different space-geodetic techniques are used to validate the quality of our improved orbit solution. The com-parisons show good agreement. The mean values of the radial, transverse, and normal components differ by 0.0,-0.1, and-0.2 cm, respectively. To investigate the impact of the corrected orbit on sea level computations, a single-satellite crossover analysis is performed. When using the corrected measurements, the standard deviation of crossover differences reduces from 16 cm to 6 cm. The computed coef-ficients of the measurement correction function are provided publicly and can be used in any software package to obtain T/P orbits. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The study of Fengyun4A temperature profile data assimilation in a southwest vortex heavy rainfall case
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A data assimilation and forecasting system was built to ensure operational safety along the Sichuan-Tibet Railway. Based on the system, the Fengyun4A satellite (FY-4A) temperature profile data quality control and assimilation were processed in a heavy rainfall event in Sichuan Province during June 25-27, 2020. The data quality of the FY-4A temperature profile in the clear-sky area was better than that in the cloudy area. The temperature profile assimilation after cloud detection reduced temperature biases in lower troposphere for the analysis and forecast field, further improving the 48 h precipitation forecast. Based on that, the corrected observation error of the FY-4A temperature profile in the clear-sky was obtained using sounding observations. After adopting the FY-4A temperature profile observation error to correct the original static temperature observation error, the temperature biases in the analysis and forecast field were further reduced, and the precipitation forecast was significantly improved. The southwest vortex (SWV) was the main weather system dominating the precipitation process. The analysis field after observation error correction had the adjustments of warming, humidifying and enhancing the southwesterly wind on the 700 hPa environmental field. After assimilation, the near-surface stratification tends to be unstable, and the positive vorticity at 700 hPa increases in the Sichuan Basin. With favorable dynamic and thermal conditions, the SWV intensity was enhanced and caused precipitation. In contrast, the original FY-4A temperature profile assimilation was drastic for temperature, humidity and wind field adjustments. The adjusted environmental field was not conducive to the development of the SWV and subsequent precipitation.

TI  - The use of drones for mosquito surveillance and control
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, global health security has been threatened by the geographical expansion of vector-borne infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, Zika and chikungunya. For a range of these vector-borne diseases, an increase in residual (exophagic) transmission together with ecological heterogeneity in everything from weather to local human migration and housing to mosquito species' behaviours presents many challenges to effective mosquito control. The novel use of drones (or uncrewed aerial vehicles) may play a major role in the success of mosquito surveillance and control programmes in the coming decades since the global landscape of mosquito-borne diseases and disease dynamics fluctuates frequently and there could be serious public health consequences if the issues of insecticide resistance and outdoor transmission are not adequately addressed. For controlling both aquatic and adult stages, for several years now remote sensing data have been used together with predictive modelling for risk, incidence and detection of transmission hot spots and landscape profiles in relation to mosquito-borne pathogens. The field of drone-based remote sensing is under continuous change due to new technology development, operation regulations and innovative applications. In this review we outline the opportunities and challenges for integrating drones into vector surveillance (i.e. identification of breeding sites or mapping micro-environmental composition) and control strategies (i.e. applying larval source management activities or deploying genetically modified agents) across the mosquito life-cycle. We present a five-step systematic environmental mapping strategy that we recommend be undertaken in locations where a drone is expected to be used, outline the key considerations for incorporating drone or other Earth Observation data into vector surveillance and provide two case studies of the advantages of using drones equipped with multispectral cameras. In conclusion, recent developments mean that drones can be effective for accurately conducting surveillance, assessing habitat suitability for larval and/or adult mosquitoes and implementing interventions. In addition, we briefly discuss the need to consider permissions, costs, safety/privacy perceptions and community acceptance for deploying drone activities.

TI  - Exploiting Sentinel-2 dataset to assess flow intermittency in non-perennial rivers
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the frequency and duration of each flowing status of non-perennial rivers is severely limited by the small number of streamflow gauges and reliable prediction of surface water presence by hydrological models. In this study, multispectral Sentinel- 2 images were used to detect and monitor changes in water surface presence along three non-perennial Mediterranean rivers located in southern Italy. Examining the reflectance values of water, sediment and vegetation covers, the bands in which these classes are most differentiated were identified. It emerged that the false-color composition of the Sentinel-2 bands SWIR, NIR and RED allows water surfaces to be clearly distinguished from the other components of the river corridor. From the false-color composite images, it was possible to identify the three distinct flowing status of non-perennial rivers: "flowing" (F), "ponding" (P) and "dry" (D). The results were compared with field data and very high-resolution images. The flowing status was identified for all archive images not affected by cloud cover. The obtained dataset allowed to train Random Forest (RF) models able to fill temporal gaps between satellite images, and predict the occurrence of one of the three flowing status (F/P/D) on a daily scale. The most important predictors of the RF models were the cumulative rainfall and air temperature data before the date of satellite image acquisition. The performances of RF models were very high, with total accuracy of 0.82-0.97 and true skill statistic of 0.64-0.95. The annual non-flowing period (phases P and D) of the monitored rivers was assessed in range 5 to 192 days depending on the river reach. Due to the easy-to-use algorithm and the global, freely available satellite imagery, this innovative technique has large application potential to describe flowing status of non-perennial rivers and estimate frequency and duration of surface water presence.

TI  - Analysing the role of land use and land cover changes in increasing urban heat phenomenon in Chandannagar city, West Bengal, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The current work attempts to understand the spatiotemporal patterns of the urban heat phenomenon (UHP) and its relationship with the transformation of land-use/land-cover in Chandannagar city of India in four different phases, e.g., in pre-monsoon and post-monsoon of 1988 and 2020 based on Landsat satellite data. To investigate the city's thermal and environmental conditions in a better way, UHP and non-UHP areas are identified separately. Moreover, multiple linear regression (MLR) and simple linear regression (SLR) models are used to envisage the predictability of land surface temperature (LST) by various remote sensing indices and UHP by built-up areas. The results assert that mean LST in both pre monsoon and post-monsoon from 1988 to 2020 has increased at the rate of 0.11 degrees C and 0.1 degrees C each year, respectively. Built-up areas, UHP areas and mean LST linearly increase in those directions from the city centre where vegetation cover and non-UHP areas decrease rapidly. Moreover, growth of multiple UHP areas, the highest increase in UHP intensity and good applicability of MLR and SLR models are observed in pre-monsoon than post-monsoon. Therefore the information regarding urban thermal environments is expected to be very useful for policymakers and urban planners in adopting suitable mitigation measures against unplanned urbanisation leading to UHP effects.

TI  - Reconstruction of Zonal Precipitation From Sparse Historical Observations Using Climate Model Information and Statistical Learning
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Future projected changes in precipitation substantially impact societies worldwide. However, large uncertainties remain due to sparse historical observational coverage, large internal climate variability, and climate model disagreement. Here, we present a novel reconstruction of seasonally averaged zonal precipitation metrics from sparse rain-gauge data using regularized regression techniques that are trained across climate model simulations. Subsequently, we test the reconstruction on independent satellite data and reanalyzed precipitation, and find a large fraction of historical zonal mean precipitation (ZMP) variability is recovered, in particular over the Northern hemisphere and in parts of the tropics. Finally, we demonstrate that the reconstructed ZMP trends are outside the variability of pre-industrial control simulations, and are largely consistent with the range of historical simulations driven by external forcing. Overall, we illustrate a novel way of estimating seasonally averaged zonal precipitation from gauge data, and trends therein that show a signal very likely caused by human influence.

TI  - The impact of the satellite ground track shift on the accuracy of altimetric measurements on rivers: A case study of the Sentinel-3 altimetry on the Odra/Oder River
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first attempt to investigate the bias of the Sentinel-3 altimetry measurements over rivers resulting from the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope. Altimetry-based water levels are measured at the so-called virtual stations (VS), which are defined as the area where the satellite pass intersects with a river channel. Since the ground tracks of the Sentinel-3 satellites can shift up to 1 km away from the nominal track, the calculated heights over VS correspond to different locations on the river. However, all measurements at a given VS are combined into one time series of water levels, assigned to a single reference position. Because rivers are inclined water bodies, the upstream measurements are characterized by a positive bias, while the downstream measurements reveal a negative bias. In this study, we investigate water levels measured at 16 VS of the Sentinel-3 satellites, located on the middle Odra/Oder River. To correct the measurements for the bias, we calculate the river slope by employing two separate approaches: (1) using in situ water levels, referenced to a common vertical datum (Kronsztadt'86), calculating the slope for each satellite measurement time, as well as (2) using the means of water levels from VS, calculating the slope once for the entire study period. The uncorrected water level anomalies, compared to the anomalies from the neighbouring gauges, are characterized by a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 22 cm. The correction of water levels utilizing both approaches led to similar outputs, and resulted in a statistically significant improvement in mean accuracy by 5.64 cm and 5.74 cm for the gauge-based and VS-based approaches, respectively (i.e. over 25% improvement in mean RMSE). The percentage improvement varied from 4.99% to 53.23%, depending on VS. This study confirms the importance of the bias caused by the satellite ground track shift and the associated river slope, determines its contribution to the overall altimetry measurement error budget, and provides a fully automated approach to correct the time series for the slope effect.

TI  - Automated Forest Harvest Detection With a Normalized PlanetScope Imagery Time Series
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of CubeSat constellations is revolutionizing the ability to observe Earth systems through time. The improved spatial and temporal resolutions from these data could assist in tracking forest harvesting by forest management companies or government organizations interested in monitoring the sustainable management of forest resources. However, differing characteristics of individual satellites in each constellation requires study into geometric and radiometric normalization of the imagery and tuning parameters for change detection algorithms. In this study, a method for the spatial and temporal detection of forest harvest operations using images from the PlanetScope constellation was developed and implemented for a managed forest in Ontario, Canada. Temporal smoothing was applied on Landsat-normalized PlanetScope values of the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), and change points were detected based on the first derivative of the NDVI trend. Detected changes were compared to known locations of harvesting machines. Results indicate that 80-90% of harvested areas were detected, with temporal errors of approximately 9-10 days for two sites. Overall, this study demonstrated that forest harvesting can be detected with relative accuracy, deriving previously unavailable levels of spatial and temporal detail and enhancing the ability of forest stakeholders to monitor the sustainable use of forest resources.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of single axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer: Emphasis on the location of lymph nodes
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To evaluate the frequency and location of abnormal lymph nodes (LNs) in breast cancer patients with a single axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis on breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We retrospectively reviewed the MRI findings of 219 consecutive patients with breast cancer with single ALN metastasis who were surgically confirmed at our institution between January 2018 and December 2018. The morphological features and locations of the abnormal LN on MRI were analyzed. Pathology reports were reviewed to evaluate the size of the metastases and whether they were sentinel LNs (SLNs). Of the 219 patients with a single ALN metastasis, 56 (25.6%) showed abnormal MRI findings. Of these, 54 (96.4%) had either the lowest or second-lowest LN in the level I axilla. In 184 (91.5%) of 201 patients who underwent SLN biopsy, the metastatic LN were SLN. Macrometastases were found more frequently in cases with abnormal LNs than in those with normal-looking LNs (P = .004). The most frequent morphological feature of metastatic ALNs was a diffuse cortical thickening of 3 to 5 mm (37.5%). Although MRI findings of single ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients are none or minimal, abnormalities are observed in the lowest or second-lowest LN in the lower axilla when present, suggesting the location of the SLNs.

T2  - CANADIAN METALLURGICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissimilar junctions between the zirconium alloy (Zy-4) and 304L stainless steel (SS) are prepared via two bonding processes: solid-phase diffusion at T-1 = 1223 K and in transient liquid phase (TLP) at T-2 = 1293 K and T-3 = 1323 K for an identical isothermal hold time of 2700 s. The formed layers and phases at the interface were characterised by the combination of EDS-EBSD-ESEM, EPMA and X-RD and impact fracturing tests. The Zy-4/SS interface is formed of three layers containing Cr-rich alpha-Fe and Zr(Fe,Cr)(2) and Zr-2(Fe,Ni) intermetallic compounds. We establish the relationship between the interface microstructures and hot cracking formation which are of thermo-mechanical and solidification origin. The knowledge of the solidification path of the TLP obtained in LIII layer at T-2 and T-3 makes it possible to explain the formation of micro-pores. The fracture is for both bonding processes, takes place in the brittle mode, of the intergranular type by cleavage and is in the LIII layer of the junction.

TI  - Simulating carbon and water fluxes using a coupled process-based terrestrial biosphere model and joint assimilation of leaf area index and surface soil moisture
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable modeling of carbon and water fluxes is essential for understanding the terrestrial carbon and water cycles and informing policy strategies aimed at constraining carbon emissions and improving water use efficiency. We designed an assimilation framework (LPJ-Vegetation and soil moisture Joint Assimilation, or LPJ-VSJA) to improve gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates globally. The integrated model, LPJ-PM (LPJ-PT-JPLSM Model) as the underlying model, was coupled from the Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM version 3.01) and a hydrology module (i.e., the updated Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model, PT-JPLSM). Satellite-based soil moisture products derived from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and leaf area index (LAI) from the Global LAnd and Surface Satellite (GLASS) product were assimilated into LPJ-PM to improve GPP and ET simulations using a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based ensemble four-dimensional variational assimilation method (PODEn4DVar). The joint assimilation framework LPJ-VSJA achieved the best model performance (with an R-2 ( coefficient of determination) of 0.91 and 0.81 and an ubRMSD (unbiased root mean square deviation) reduced by 40.3 % and 29.9 % for GPP and ET, respectively, compared with those of LPJ-DGVM at the monthly scale). The GPP and ET resulting from the assimilation demonstrated a better performance in the arid and semi-arid regions (GPP: R-2 = 0.73, ubRMSD = 1.05 g C m(-2) d(-1); ET: R-2 = 0.73, ubRMSD = 0.61 mm d(-1)) than in the humid and sub-dry humid regions (GPP: R-2 = 0.61, ubRMSD = 1.23 g C m(-2) d(-1); ET: R-2 = 0.66; ubRMSD = 0.67 mm d(-1)). The ET simulated by LPJ-PM that assimilated SMAP or SMOS data had a slight difference, and the SMAP soil moisture data performed better than SMOS data. Our global simulation modeled by LPJ-VSJA was compared with several global GPP and ET products (e.g., GLASS GPP, GOSIF GPP, GLDAS ET, and GLEAM ET) using the triple collocation (TC) method. Our products, especially ET, exhibited advantages in the overall error distribution (estimated error (mu): 3.4 mm per month; estimated standard deviation of mu: 1.91 mm per month). Our research showed that the assimilation of multiple datasets could reduce model uncertainties, while the model performance differed across regions and plant functional types. Our assimilation framework (LPJ-VSJA) can improve the model simulation performance of daily GPP and ET globally, especially in water-limited regions.

TI  - Evaluating biochemical and biophysical characteristics of tropical deciduous forests of eastern India using remote sensing and in-situ parameter estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to such a crucial role that forests perform in an ecosystem, studying the vegetation dynam-ics in terms of its productivity becomes inevitable. The study aimed to assess forest productivity and biochemical variability of Dalma Wildlife Sanctuary (DWS), Eastern India coupling remote sensing and in-situ measurements of 51 samples comprising 17 different species. Vegetative Pho-tosynthesis Model (VPM) was incorporated for measuring the gross primary productivity (GPP) using Sentinel-2A data. The result showed that microclimatic conditions that determine the nutri-ent content of the plant, as some plant species(Shorea robusta) present at different locations showed different concentrations of chlorophyll(25.4 mgg-1), N(2.2%), P(0.5%), and K(2.0%). The relationship between biophysical and biochemical properties of the forest was analyzed by cou-pling laboratory-based leaf samples analysis and satellite-based retrieval methods. High values of GPP was present in the dense forested (core) region dominated by species like Shorea robusta, Bauhinia tomentosa, Butea monosperma, Syzygium cumini, Cleistanthus collinus, Diospyros melanoxy-lon, etc. as compared to buffer regions. The central region of DWS dominated by dense vegetation contributed higher GPP value of 21 gCm-2day-1 to 24 gCm-2day-1. The degraded peripheral area exhibited GPP value of 8 gCm-2day-1. Shorea robusta being the most dominant species in this re-gion, exhibited total chlorophyll of 25.4 mgg-1 (lab estimates) with a standard error of 2.0 mgg-1. Correlation analysis between Sentinel-2 satellite-based biophysical parameters and laboratory -based biochemical parameters showed a close relationship between the variables. The correlation between GPP and FAPAR was found to be more profound (R2 = 0.625), whereas GPP and LAI showed a moderate correlation of R2 = 0.58. Nitrogen and Phosphorous content in leaf samples showed a negative relationship (R2 = 0.414) indicating their individual concentration do not ac-tuate to the coefficient of correlation. With rational limitations, the study finds wide application for studying carbon cycle and biochemical assessment in the region with remote sensing driven techniques backed by in-situ parameter estimation.

TI  - Long-lived afterslip of the 2013 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.1 Minab earthquake detected by Persistent Scatterer Interferometry along the Irer fault (western Makran-Zagros transition zone, Iran)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ratio of seismogenic to aseismic deformation along active faults is needed to estimate their seismogenic potential and hazards. Seismologic and geodetic methods routinely capture coseismic displacements, but data acquisition requirements to fully document post-seismic deformation are not well known. Our study documents afterslip between about 18 months and 4 years after a mid-size earthquake and, based on remote structural mapping, we document fault rupture segments not previously associated with that earthquake. Persistent scatterer interferometric analysis of Sentinel-1A aperture radar data acquired between October 2014 and December 2018 reveals prolonged post-seismic deformation following the 11 May 2013 M-w 6.1 Minab earthquake and its aftershocks. The surface deformation data yield a sharp contrast across both the main seismogenic fault (here named the Irer fault) and its northeastern splay, and it is compatible with left-lateral motion along both faults. The PSI data helped us to identify and map the splay fault in the satellite imagery. We could then measure the geological offset along both faults, finding maximum displacements of about 1 km (main fault) and 350 m (splay). Our modelling of the observed post-seismic surface deformation pattern shows that post-seismic deformation was accommodated by left-lateral afterslip, not viscoelastic relaxation. This result is consistent with previous propositions that M-w 6 earthquakes do not measurably excite deeply seated viscoelastic relaxation mechanisms. Our afterslip modelling yields a slip pattern from the surface to a depth of 6 km to maximum 16 km, in agreement with the depth of the coseismic slip-distribution, and a maximum displacement of similar to 7 cm along the fault, but located similar to 8 km to the east of the coseismic slip maximum. Moment release during the observed afterslip in our study is M-w 5.7, or 12% of the coseismic moment released by main shock and aftershocks together. Combined with previously published results for the early post-seismic period (first 2 months), we estimate the aseismic moment to be at least similar to 37% of the total, implying a high ratio of aseismic to seismic moment release for the Irer fault. Our results show that observation time windows well beyond 5 years are needed to record afterslip following mid-sized earthquakes. Thus, progress in understanding the transition from post-seismic to interseismic fault behaviour critically depends on the availability of data provided by satellite missions such as Copernicus Sentinel-1A. Similarly, robust comparison of the post-seismic rates with long-term geological rates requires palaeoseismic study and dating of related morphotectonic features.

TI  - Land use/land cover classification with Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 satellite images: a comparative analysis between forest- and agriculture-dominated landscapes using different machine learning methods
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Landsat program, which started in 1972 with Landsat-1, continues today with its newest satellite, Landsat-9, launched on 27 October 2021. The Landsat-9 data have been freely distributed since 10 February 2022 on the Earth Explorer platform. However, no scientific study on Landsat-9 for land use/land cover (LULC) mapping has yet been published, focusing on specific eco-systems. Therefore, the present study investigates the potential of Landsat-9 images for LULC classification in forest and agricultural systems. To achieve this, we selected two study areas, i.e. Kaynarca (forest-dominated) and Hocalar (agriculture-dominated), from different ecoregions of Turkey. Then, we mapped their LULCs using Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 data with the Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) methods. The classification accuracies were assessed with the F1-score, taking the stand-types maps of the case areas as reference. It was seen that the best maps were generated by the 3D-CNN method with accuracy rates of 88.0% for Kaynarca (Landsat-8) and 87.4% for Hocalar (Landsat-9) at the landscape level. Unlike other methods, 3D-CNN removed the "salt-and-pepper effect " on the maps providing better spatial structure for further analyses. Regardless of the satellite missions, the mapping accuracies for the "productive forest " and "agriculture " classes were > 90% for Kaynarca and Hocalar, respectively. The comparative results suggest that Landsat-9 offers satisfactory LULC maps with similar classification accuracies as Landsat-8 and can be effectively used as a freely available remote sensing resource in monitoring and mapping forest- and agriculture-dominated landscapes.

AB  - In the past years, many vital improvements in image fusion have been recognised, particularly in the fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors. Many kinds of research have been published focusing on pixel-level fusion of SAR and optical images. This paper focuses on pixel-level SAR-optical fusion methods, along with performance assessment and applications. Five categories (component substitution, numerical method, model-based, multi-resolution, and hybrid methods) of fusion are presented. Subjective, objective , and comprehensive methods are surveyed to assess fusion. Experimental findings utilising Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data corroborate the assessment. Finally, paper suggests that there is still space for investigation into SAR-optical fusion.

TI  - Which factors determine the invasion of plant species? Machine learning based habitat modelling integrating environmental factors and climate scenarios
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the spread of invasive plant species (IPS) causes major disturbances to ecosystem functions. Monitoring systems are considered necessary to implement effective measures against their spread. We created species distribution models that identify the potentially suitable habitat under present and future climatic conditions for 46 IPS in Germany and incorporated habitat types obtained through remote sensing methods to assess their influence on habitat suitability.We included 18 environmental variables that describe habitat characteristics, including soil type, altitude, land use, transport infrastructure, temperature and precipitation. Models were based on two machine learning techniques: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). SVM classification of Natura2000 habitat types using MODIS reflectance data was included to provide a vegetation type-based approach to interspecific competition. We integrated predicted climate variables to determine changes in habitat suitability for two forecast periods (2041-2060 and 2061-2080) and three Representative Concentration Pathways. Averaging over all species, the models showed good predictive power, with the quality of BRT (AUC 0.861; RMSE 0.225) surpassing that of SVM (AUC 0.804; RMSE 0.285). We observe that the majority of the species have not yet filled their potentially suitable habitat. An increase in habitat suitability for predicted climatic conditions is implied for most species.Our results indicate that the dynamics of biological invasions will intensify with anticipated climatic changes. Climate factors, soil type and transport infrastructure are of great relevance for the distribution of IPS, while interspecific competition, indirectly assessed through the distribution of habitat types, is only relevant for some species.

TI  - Derivation of Emissions From Satellite-Observed Column Amounts and Its Application to TROPOMI NO<sub>2</sub> and CO Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A unified framework that connects emissions with satellite-observed column amounts is derived from first principles. The emission information originates from the inner product of the horizontal wind and the gradient of column amount, which is more accurate than the horizontal flux divergence as used in previous studies. Additionally, the topographical and chemical effects are accounted for through fitted scale height and chemical lifetime. This framework is applied to derive NOx and CO emissions over the CONUS from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument NO2 and CO observations. High-resolution (0.04 & DEG;) emission mapping over the CONUS reveals unprecedented details, including CO emissions in major cities and NOx emissions from large cities, power plants, and major roadways. Monthly resolved NOx emissions show decrease and rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic. This framework is integrated with the physical oversampling algorithm and can be readily applied to other products from the new-generation satellite instruments.

TI  - Net primary productivity changes associated with landslides induced by the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake triggered massive landslide erosion, especially in mountainous terrain, which had a great impact on carbon storage of the local terrestrial ecosystem. However, variation in carbon flux and restoration of ecosystem function after the Wenchuan Earthquake remain open issues. In this study, we evaluated the current restored vegetation productive capability on the coseismic landslide scars through moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) net primary productivity (NPP) imagery, and explored their sensitivity to meteorological, topographical, and geological factors. The spatio-temporal evolution and future sustainability of NPP of the landslides after the Earthquake were revealed. The following results were obtained: (i) After 13 years, only 45.36% of the vegetation productivity capability of the landslide scars reached the pre-earthquake level. (ii) Meteorological factors (precipitation and temperature) have strongest influences on vegetation productivity capability recovery over the coseismic landslide scars, followed by topography (aspect, slope, and altitude) and the lithology of landslides. (iii) The extremely significant improvement (p < 0.01) and significant improvement (0.01 <= p < 0.05) in annual NPP pixel values from 2008 to 2021 accounted for 18.92% and 28.30% of the total area, respectively. The slight degradation (p < 0.1) in annual NPP pixel values from 2008 to 2021 account for 0.01% of the total area. In general, the NPP has shown an improving trend since the Wenchuan Earthquake. Moreover, 60.95% of the total area shows the trends of continuous improvement in the future. This study provides important insight into how mega-earthquakes affect regional ecosystem carbon flux and contributes to our understanding of ecosystem carbon cycles along with earthquake-induced geohazard chains.

TI  - Malaria vector feeding, peak biting time and resting place preference behaviors in line with Indoor based intervention tools and its implication: scenario from selected sentinel sites of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - In Ethiopia, malaria incidence has significantly reduced in the past decade through the combined use of conventional vector control approaches and treatment using antimalarial drugs. However, the sustainability of this achievement is threatened by the shift in biting and resting behaviors and emergence of insecticide resistance by the primary malaria vector. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the behaviour of malaria mosquitoes in different sentinel sites is crucial to design effective prevention and control methods in the local context. Entomological investigations were conducted in three sentinel sites for five consecutive months during the major malaria transmission season. The species composition, population dynamics, biting and resting behaviours of malaria vectors were determined using center for disease control and prevention (CDC) light trap, human landing catch (HLC), pyrethrum spray catch (PSC) and Pitfall shelter collection (PFS). Accordingly, 10 households for CDC, 10 households for PSC, 10 households for PFS and 5 households for HLC from each site were randomly enrolled for mosquito collection. A total of 8,297 anopheline mosquitoes were collected from the three sites, out of which 4,525 (54.5 %) were An. gambiae, s.l. 2,028 (24.4 %) were An. pharoensis, 160 (1.9 %) were An. funestus and the rest 1,584 (19 %) were other anophelines (An. coustani, An. cinerus and An. tenebrosus). No significant variation (P 1/4 0.476) was observed between indoor (25.2/trap-night and outdoor collections (20.1/trap-night). Six hundred seventy six (43.3%) of An. gambiae s.l. (primary vector) were collected between 18:00 and 22:00 h. Biting activity declined between 00:00 and 02:00 h. The national malaria control program should pay close attention to the shifting behavior of vector mosquitoes as the observed outdoor feeding tendency of the vector population could pose challenges to the indoor intervention tools IRS and LLINs.

TI  - Impacts of land use and land cover change on ecosystem service values in the Afroalpine area of Guna Mountain, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem service changes caused by land use and land cover change (LULCC) is an important indictor and early warning of ecological changes. However, few attempts have been made to evaluate the effects of LULCC on ecosystem services in the Afroalpine highlands of Northwestern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the impacts of LULCC on ecosystem services values in the afro-alpine area of Guna Mountain, Northwestern Ethiopia. Image classification was carried out using Landsat imageries of 1995, 2008, and 2020 following Random Forest algorithm with Google Earth Engine(GEE) based on filtered sample points. A modified benefit transfer method was used to evaluate ecosystem service value (ESV) changes in response to LULCC. The results revealed that the most notable feature of LULCC in the afro-alpine area of Guna Mountain was the expansion of cropland and built-up areas at the expense of grassland, forest, and shrubland. The overall ESV of the study site was estimated at USD 46.97 x 106 in 1995, USD 36.77 x 106 in 2008, and USD 37.19 x 106 in 2020. The net ESVs of the study site declined by USD 9.78 x 106 between 1995 and 2020. The regulating service values accounted for the greatest share, accounting for over 42% in all periods, followed by provisioning and supporting service values, which accounted for over 29% and 13%, respectively, while cultural services accounted for the smallest amount of the total ESV. The ecosystem service value of food production experienced the highest increase. However, the values of the remaining 16 types of ecosystem services declined with varying degrees of reduction over the study periods. The results of this study is necessary for land-use planners and decision-makers who require site-specific information on impacts of LULCC on ecosystem service.

TI  - High-resolution tracking of hyrax social interactions highlights nighttime drivers of animal sociality
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Network structure is a key driver of animal fitness, pathogen transmission, information spread, and population demographics in the wild. Although a considerable body of research applied network analysis to animal societies, only little effort has been devoted to separate daytime and nighttime sociality and explicitly test working hypotheses on social structures emerging at night. Here, we investigated the nighttime sociality of a wild population of rock hyraxes (Procavia capensis) and its relation to daytime social structure. We recorded nearly 15,000 encounters over 27 consecutive days and nights using proximity loggers. Overall, we show that hyraxes are more selective of their social affiliates at night compared to daytime. We also show that hyraxes maintain their overall network topology while reallocating the weights of social relationships at the daily and monthly scales, which could help hyraxes maintain their social structure over long periods while adapting to local constraints and generate complex social dynamics. These results suggest that complex network dynamics can be a by-product of simple daily social tactics and do not require high cognitive abilities. Our work sheds light on the function of nighttime social interactions in diurnal social species.

TI  - Semantic segmentation of clouds in satellite images based on U-Net plus plus architecture and attention mechanism
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of clouds in satellite imagery may pose hindrances to the accurate and reliable analysis of the objects present on the land. Therefore, automatic cloud detection is a vital pre-processing step before lending the satellite images to any further analysis. This is a challenging task due to the varying thickness and densities of clouds. It is also very difficult to distinguish clouds from certain terrains such as snow and white sandy beaches. This paper proposes a deep learning based algorithm to solve the problem of cloud segmentation on the Landsat 8 multispectral dataset, 95-Cloud: SEUNet++. Specifically, the proposed model consists of a U-Net++ semantic segmentation model with a lightweight channel attention mechanism. We also experimented with using different encoder backbones in the U-Net++ encoder-decoder architecture such as ResNet (Residual Neural Networks) variants including ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, DenseNet-264, CSPNet (Cross Stage Partial Network), and EfficientNet-B8 and compared their performance. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture achieves an IoU (Intersection over Union) score of 91.8 %, improving the state-of-the-art on the task by 0.23 %. It also boosts the accuracy, precision, and recall values creating crisp cloud boundaries and detecting even thin layers of clouds. We also experimented using transfer learning and found that it has a positive impact on the cloud segmentation task. The proposed model also beats the original U-Net++ architecture in terms of various evaluation metrics such as the IoU score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The experimental results thereby demonstrate that our model is computationally efficient and achieves precise segmentation results.

TI  - Global warming is increasing the discrepancy between green (actual) and thermal (potential) seasons of temperate trees
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Over the past decades, global warming has led to a lengthening of the time window during which temperatures remain favorable for carbon assimilation and tree growth, resulting in a lengthening of the green season. The extent to which forest green seasons have tracked the lengthening of this favorable period under climate warming, however, has not been quantified to date. Here, we used remote sensing data and long-term ground observations of leaf-out and coloration for six dominant species of European trees at 1773 sites, for a total of 6060 species-site combinations, during 1980-2016 and found that actual green season extensions (GS: 3.1 +/- 0.1 day decade(-1)) lag four times behind extensions of the potential thermal season (TS: 12.6 +/- 0.1 day decade(-1)). Similar but less pronounced differences were obtained using satellite-derived vegetation phenology observations, that is, a lengthening of 4.4 +/- 0.13 and 7.5 +/- 0.13 day decade(-1) for GS and TS, respectively. This difference was mainly driven by the larger advance in the onset of the thermal season compared to the actual advance of leaf-out dates (spring mismatch: 7.2 +/- 0.1 day decade(-1)), but to a less extent caused by a phenological mismatch between GS and TS in autumn (2.4 +/- 0.1 day decade(-1)). Our results showed that forest trees do not linearly track the new thermal window extension, indicating more complex interactions between winter and spring temperatures and photoperiod and a justification of demonstrating that using more sophisticated models that include the influence of chilling and photoperiod is needed to accurately predict spring phenological changes under warmer climate. They urge caution if such mechanisms are omitted to predict, for example, how vegetative health and growth, species distribution and crop yields will change in the future.

TI  - The relationship between spatial patterns of urban land uses and air pollutants in the Tehran metropolis, Iran
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Urban expansion has led to land use changes in metropolises, which in turn cause landscape pattern changes and ecological issues in urban areas. Objective The main objective of this research is to investigate the relationship between different land use patterns and air pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, O-3) in the metropolis of Tehran. Methods The Local Climate Zone scheme and Landsat 8 satellite images were used to extract urban land uses in Tehran. Additionally, Sentinel-5P satellite images were used to calculate and evaluate air pollutants in summer (2020) and winter (2021).Then, the relationship between the spatial composition and configuration of urban land uses and air pollutants was computed. Results The results show that the correlation of the distribution or concentration of air pollutants is different from the spatial pattern of land use. The spatial composition and configuration of anthropogenic land uses, including the classes of compact mid-rise, compact low-rise, large low-rise, and heavy industry, had a positive correlation with NO2 and SO2 (P < 0/05). In contrast, the pollutant CO had a significant negative correlation with the green spaces of types A (dense trees) (P < 0/01) and B (scattered trees) (P < 0/05). Conversely, the spatial composition and configuration of anthropogenic land uses had a negative correlation with O-3 (P < 0/05) while had a positive correlation with green spaces (P < 0/05). Conclusion Generally, the spatial pattern of the anthropogenic land uses had a direct and positive correlation in both spatial configurations with NO2, SO2, and CO and a negative correlation with O-3.

TI  - Dynamic threats of nighttime light-represented human activities to giant pandas and their habitat
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities are one of the main factors threatening the long-term survival of wild giant pandas. Long-term and large-scale human activities can be quickly assessed by night light remote sensing data, which has been more and more widely used. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial patterns of nighttime light intensity and their dynamic changes from 2000 to 2020 in the entire giant panda distribution area using long-term nighttime light remote sensing data, and evaluated the dynamic threats of nighttime light-represented human activities to giant panda populations by proximity of light source and its intensity. We also assessed the relationships between the nighttime light dynamics and the trends of habitat fragmentation. Results showed that the intensity and range of the nighttime light around panda habitat had increased significantly from 2000 to 2020. The nighttime light intensity inside the natural reserves is significantly lower than outside, and it becomes more obvious over time. The intensity and range of nighttime light inside the natural reserves first increased and then decreased during the two decades, indicating that the protection inside the natural reserves effectively reversed the rapid increase in human activities in the previous decade. From 2000 to 2020, nighttime light sources became closer to local panda populations. In particular, they approached the pandas in the first decade, and stayed away in the second decade. This is mainly reflected in the weakened threats of nighttime light-represented human activities on the core large populations of the Qinling, Minshan and Qionglai Mountains from 2010 to 2020, but the threats on the peripheral populations continued to strengthen, where nighttime light became not only closer but also more intensified. The increase in nighttime light intensity and range were also significantly positively correlated with the increase in habitat fragmentation, especially during 2000-2010. Our study reveals the dynamic changes of nighttime light-represented human activities' threats to wild giant panda and its habitat, gives advices for effectively protecting giant pandas and their habitats from human activities, and has implications for the assessment of human activities' threats to other species in the world.

TI  - Landsat- and Sentinel-derived glacial lake dataset in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor from 1990 to 2020
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is one of the flagship projects of the One Belt One Road Initiative, which faces threats from water shortage and mountain disasters in the high-elevation region, such as glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). An up-to-date high-quality glacial lake dataset with parameters such as lake area, volume, and type, which is fundamental to water resource and flood risk assessments and prediction of glacier-lake evolutions, is still largely absent for the entire CPEC. This study describes a glacial lake dataset for the CPEC using a threshold-based mapping method associated with rigorous visual inspection workflows. This dataset includes (1) multi-temporal inventories for 1990, 2000, and 2020 produced from 30 m resolution Landsat images and (2) a glacial lake inventory for the year 2020 at 10 m resolution produced from Sentinel-2 images. The results show that, in 2020, 2234 lakes were derived from the Landsat images, covering a total area of 86.31 +/- 14.98 km(2) with a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 5 pixels (4500 m(2)), whereas 7560 glacial lakes were derived from the Sentinel-2 images with a total area of 103.70 +/- 8.45 km(2)) with an MMU of 5 pixels (500 m(2))). The discrepancy shows that Sentinel-2 can detect a large quantity of smaller lakes compared to Landsat due to its finer spatial resolution. Glacial lake data in 2020 were validated by Google Earth-derived lake boundaries with a median (+/- standard deviation) difference of 7.66 +/- 4.96 % for the Landsat-derived product and 4.46 +/- 4.62 % for the Sentinel-derived product. The total number and area of glacial lakes from consistent 30 m resolution Landsat images remain relatively stable despite a slight increase from 1990 to 2020. A range of critical attributes has been generated in the dataset, including lake types and mapping uncertainty estimated by an improved equation of Hanshaw and Bookhagen (2014). This comprehensive glacial lake dataset has the potential to be widely applied in studies on water resource assessment, glacial lake-related hazards, and glacier-lake interactions and is freely available at (Lesi et al., 2022).

TI  - Mapping tree species composition in a Caspian temperate mixed forest based on spectral-temporal metrics and machine learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The tree species composition (TSC) reflects a forest's tree species diversity and is relevant for forest planning, biodiversity conservation, and forest resources management. Yet, accurate information on tree species composition at landscape scale is largely missing, especially for mixed forests and remote areas. One reason being that mapping tree species is time-consuming, and costly, especially in mixed forests and remote areas. Here we develop a robust method for mapping TSC in a mixed temperate forest. Based on forest inventory plots and considering the frequency of dominant tree species in the inventory dataset, five species groups were defined: pure oriental beech, mixed oriental beech, pure common hornbeam, mixed common hornbeam, and mixed deciduous. The classification is based on three-year time series data of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) derived spectral-temporal features (STMs) and vegetation indices within the long-term, seasonal, and monthly time scales. Model performances of three Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) were compared and revealed different classification accuracies (overall accuracies (OAs) between similar to 70 % and 86 %). Highest OA was obtained using SVM regardless of the classification dataset (STMs and satellite time series). The comparisons between different time scales indicated that with both L8 and S2 time series the seasonal STMs produced higher accuracies than monthly and long-term STMs with S2 outperforming L8 across all time scales and with all tested ML algorithms. We conclude that the freely available satellite time series, spectral-temporal features, and ML algorithms are favourable for accurate TSC mapping.

TI  - Quantifying spatio-temporal variation in aquaculture production areas in Satkhira, Bangladesh using geospatial and social survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite Bangladesh being one of the leading countries in aquaculture food production worldwide, there is a considerable lack of updated scientific information about aquaculture activities in remote sites, making it difficult to manage sustainably. This study explored the use of geospatial and field data to monitor spatio-temporal changes in aquaculture production sites in the Satkhira district from 2017-2019. We used Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM) to locate aquaculture ponds based on the terrain elevation and slope. Radar backscatter information from the Sentinel-1 satellite, and different water indices derived from Sentinel-2 were used to assess the spatio-temporal extents of aquaculture areas. An image segmentation algorithm was applied to detect aquaculture ponds based on backscattering intensity, size and shape characteristics. Our results show that the highest number of aquaculture ponds were observed in January, with a size of more than 30,000 ha. Object-based image classification of Sentinel-1 data showed an overall accuracy above 80%. The key factors responsible for the variation in aquaculture were investigated using field surveys. We noticed that despite a significant number of aquaculture ponds in the study area, shrimp production and export are decreasing because of a lack of infrastructure, poor governance, and lack of awareness in the local communities. The result of this study can provide in-depth information about aquaculture areas, which is vital for policymakers and environmental administrators for successful aquaculture management in Satkhira, Bangladesh and other countries with similar issues.

TI  - Enhancing monitoring of mangrove spatiotemporal tree diversity and distribution patterns
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Spatiotemporal information on mangrove species assemblage of natural, disturbed, and rehabilitated is an essential prerequisite for effective strategies for biodiversity conservation and management. However, appropriate field-based sampling strategies of spatial heterogeneity still hamper the detection of the species distribution and its temporal development. An increasing amount of remote sensing data seems the perfect way to tackle these challenges. With this article, we fill this gap by presenting a review of the challenges and limitations to assess the current status of species diversity. We conclude that species discrimination based on remote sensing techniques is still limited by atmospheric contamination and tidal fluctuations. The lack of accurate information on the spatiotemporal development of species diversity and forest structure further curtails an understanding of functional indicators and the predictive power of modeling approaches. Nevertheless, multi-source remote-sensing techniques could seemingly capture the landscape heterogeneity and support systematic sampling designs. Spatially balanced (systematic) training and validation data are necessary to compile robust spatiotemporal information, supporting reliable predictions for optimizing restoration efforts. A systematic sampling of spatiotemporal ecological information is vital to derive the historical state of mangroves, detecting their degradation, and predicting future patterns of species distribution that are generally crucial for restoration, and particularly to rehabilitate species diversity.

TI  - Reducing hospital acquired pressure injury in a learning health center: Making the case for quality
T2  - LEARNING HEALTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this descriptive study is to examine a learning health system (LHS) continuous improvement and learning approach as a case for increased quality, standardized processes, redesigned workflows, and better resource utilization. Hospital acquired pressure injuries (HAPI) commonly occur in the hospitalized patient and are costly and preventable. This study examines the effect of a LHS approach to reducing HAPI within a large academic medical center.Methods: Our learning health center implemented a 6-year series of iterative improvements that included both process and technology changes, with robust data and analytical reforms. In this descriptive, observational study, we retrospectively examined longitudinal data from April 1, 2018 to March 31, 2022, examining the variables of total number of all-stage HAPI counts and average length of stay (ALOS). We also analyzed patient characteristics observed/expected mortality ratios, as well as total patient days, and the case-mix index to determine whether these factors varied over the study period. We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality cost estimates to identify the estimated financial benefit of HAPI reductions on an annualized basis.Results: HAPI per 1000 patient days for FY 20 (October 1-September 30) and FY 21, decreased from 2.30 to 1.30 and annualized event AHRQ cost estimates for HAPI decreased by $4 786 980 from FY 20 to FY 21. A strong, statistically significant, negative and seemingly counterintuitive correlation was found (r = -.524, P =.003) between HAPI and ALOS.Conclusions: The LHS efforts directed toward HAPI reduction led to sustained improvements during the study period. These results demonstrate the benefits of a holistic approach to quality improvement offered by the LHS model. The LHS model goes beyond a problem-based approach to process improvement. Rather than targeting a specific problem to solve, the LHS system creates structures that yield process improvement benefits over a continued time period.

TI  - Retrievals of X<sub>CO2</sub>, X<sub>CH4</sub> and X<sub>CO</sub> from portable, near-infrared Fourier transform spectrometer solar observations in Antarctica
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The COllaborative Carbon Column Observing Network (COCCON) uses low-resolution, portable EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometers (FTSs) to make retrievals of column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (DMFs, represented as X-gas) of CO2, CH4, CO and H2O from near-infrared solar absorption spectra. The COCCON has developed rapidly over recent years and complements the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). In this work, we provide details of the first seasonal time series of near-infrared X-CO2, X-CH4 and X-CO retrievals from measurements made in Antarctica during the deployment of an EM27/SUN to the Arrival Heights laboratory on Ross Island over the austral summer of 2019-2020 under the auspices of the COCCON. The DMFs of all three species were lower in Antarctica than at mid-latitude, and for X-CO2 and X-CO, the retrieved values were less variable. For X-CH4 however, the variability was significantly greater and it was found that this was strongly correlated to the proximity of the polar vortex. In order to ensure the stability of the instrument and the traceability of the retrievals, side-by-side comparisons to the TCCON station at Lauder, New Zealand and retrievals of the instrument line shape (ILS) were made before and after the measurements in Antarctica. These indicate that, over the course of the deployment, the instrument stability was such that the change in retrieved X-CO2 was well below 0.1 %. The value of these data for satellite validation is demonstrated by making comparisons with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 precursor (S5P) satellite. The dataset is available from the COCCON central facility hosted by the ESA Atmospheric Validation Data Centre (EVDC) .

TI  - Trends and characteristics of attempted and completed suicides reported to general practitioners before <i>vs</i> during the COVID-19 pandemic in France: Data from a nationwide monitoring system, 2010-2022
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Most studies published to date have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal acts using hospital data. Trends from primary care in a country such as France are crucial, as individuals may not consult hospital services after suicide attempts (SAs) but rather see their general practitioner (GP). Objectives We aimed to evaluate whether the incidence and characteristics of SAs and completed suicides (CSs) reported to French GPs were different during the COVID-19 pandemic than those of before. Methods and findings We conducted a retrospective observational study using data from a nationwide monitoring system, the French Sentinel Network (FSN). All SAs and CSs reported by GPs to the FSN from January 1, 2010, to March 10, 2022 were included. The annual incidence rates (IRs) and the characteristics of SAs and CSs during the pandemic (March 11, 2020, to March 10, 2022) were compared to those of before. In total, 687 SAs and 169 CSs were included. The IRs remained stable for SAs and CSs before and during the pandemic (overlap in confidence intervals). The mean IRs were 52 (95%CI = 44; 57) per 100,000 inhabitants for SAs during the pandemic versus 47 [36; 57] during the pre-pandemic period (p = 0.49), and 5 (95%CI = 2; 9) for CSs versus 11 [6; 16] (p = 0.30). During the pandemic, SA were slightly different from those before in terms of age and occupational status (young/students and older/retirees over-represented), history of consultation and expression of suicidal ideas to GP (more frequent), and CS in terms of occupational status (students over-represented) (p<0.05). Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic had no major effect on the overall incidence of SAs and CSs reported to French GPs. However, more suicidal acts were reported among younger and older individuals. Suicidal patients and GPs have adapted by improving the expression of suicidal ideas.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 and animals, a long story that doesn't have to end now: What we need to learn from the emergence of the Omicron variant
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - OIE, the world organization for animal health, recently released an update on the state of the art of knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 in animals. For farmed animals, ferrets and minks were found to be highly susceptible to the virus and develop symptomatic disease both in natural conditions and in experimental infections. Lagomorphs of the species Oryctolagus cuniculus are indicated as highly susceptible to the virus under experimental conditions, but show no symptoms of the disease and do not transmit the virus between conspecifics, unlike raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), which in addition to being highly susceptible to the virus under experimental conditions, can also transmit the virus between conspecifics. Among felines, the circulation of the virus has reached a level of cases such as sometimes suggests the experimental use of vaccines for human use or treatments with monoclonal antibodies. But even among wild animals, several species (White-tailed deer, Egyptian rousettes, and minks) have now been described as potential natural reservoirs of the virus. This proven circulation of SARS-CoV-2 among animals has not been accompanied by the development of an adequate surveillance system that allows following the evolution of the virus among its natural hosts. This will be all the more relevant as the surveillance system in humans inevitably drops and we move to surveillance by sentinels similar to the human flu virus. The lesson that we can draw from the emergence of Omicron and, more than likely, its animal origin must not be lost, and in this mini-review, we explain why.

TI  - A novel nomogram for the preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background or Purpose: A practical noninvasive method to identify sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in breast cancer patients, who had a suspicious axillary lymph node (ALN) at ultrasound (US), but a negative clinical physical examina-tion is needed. To predict SLN metastasis using a nomogram based on US and biopsy- based pathological features, this retrospective study investigated associa-tions between clinicopathological features and SLN status.Methods: Patients treated with SLN dissection at four centers were appor-tioned to training, internal, or external validation sets (n = 472, 175, and 81). Lymph node ultrasound and pathological characteristics were compared using chi-squared and t- tests. A nomogram predicting SLN metastasis was constructed using multivariate logistic regression models.Results: In the training set, statistically significant factors associated with SLN+ were as follows: histology type (p < 0.001); progesterone receptor (PR: p = 0.003); Her- 2 status (p = 0.049); and ALN- US shape (p = 0.034), corticomedullary demar-cation (CMD: p < 0.001), and blood flow (p = 0.001). With multivariate analysis,five independent variables (histological type, PR status, ALN- US shape, CMD, and blood flow) were integrated into the nomogram (C-statistic 0.714 [95% CI: 0.688- 0.740]) and validated internally (0.816 [95% CI: 0.784- 0.849]) and externally (0.942 [95% CI: 0.918- 0.966]), with good predictive accuracy and clinical applicability.Conclusion: This nomogram could be a direct and reliable tool for individual preoperative evaluation of SLN status, and therefore aids decisions concerning ALN dissection and adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Estimation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration in Sichuan Province Based on Improved Linear Mixed Effect Model and Geo-intelligent Randon Forest
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution PM2.5 spatial distribution data is of great significance for dynamic monitoring and control of PM2.5 pollution. Himawari-8 AOD data, ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data, DEM, land-use data, night light remote-sensing data were used as estimation variables, using an improved resampling method was used for data matching, and an improved linear mixed model (iLME) combined with Geo-intelligent random forest model to build the combined model for estimate PM2.5 concentration. The results show that: sic Among the selected estimated variables selected, AOD,SP, TEMP, RH, and BLH were important factors affecting the PM2.5 concentration of Sichuan Province in 2016, and the correlation coefficients are 0.65, 0.58, 0.55, 0.54 and 0.35 respectively. sic The prediction accuracy of the iLME + Geoi-RF model is greatly improved compared with other models. The model fitting R-2, RMSR and MAE were 0.94, 5.72 mu g.m(-3),and 3.92 mu g.m(-3), and the cross-validation R-2, RMSR and MAE were 0.82, 10.20 mu g.m(-3),and 6.44 mu g.m(-3), respectively. The model can obtain more accurate spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 in Sichuan Province and provide a more reasonable scientific refernce for regional air quality assessment, Human exposure risk assessment, and environmental pollution control. sic There were significant seasonal differences in PM2.5 concentrations in Sichuan Province, with the highest concentration of PM2.5 in winter, followed by spring and autumn, with the concentration of PM2.5 in summer being the lowest. In 2016, the monthly average PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province showed a V shape that first decreased and then increased, with the minimum value in June, the maximum value was in December, and slight fluctuations in August and November. In terms of spatial distribution, the PM2.5 concentration in Sichuan Province was generally higher than that in the west, and the local pollution level was relatively high. The high-valued areas are mainly distributed in the eastern region, where the cities have been developing rapidly and the population was densely distributed, whereas the low-valued areas were mainly distributed in the western region, where it is sparsely populated with backward economic development. sic Although the overall distribution of PM2.5 concentration estimated by the different models was essentially the same, the iLME + Geoi-RF model can more accurately and effectively estimate the spatial distribution of pollution in this study area.

TI  - Submesoscale oceanic eddy detection in SAR images using context and edge association network
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic eddies have a non-negligible impact on ocean energy transfer, nutrient distribution, and biological migration in global oceans. The fine detection of oceanic eddies is significant for the development of marine science. Remarkable achievements of eddy recognition were achieved by mining the satellite altimeter data and its derived data. However, due to the limited spatial resolution of the altimeters, it is difficult to detect the submesoscale oceanic eddies with radial dimensions less than 10 km. Different from the previous works, the context and edge association network (CEA-Net) is proposed to identify submesoscale oceanic eddies with high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 data. The edge information fusion module (EIFM) is designed to associate the context and edge feature more accurately and efficiently. Furthermore, a multi-scale eddy detection strategy is proposed and applied to Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath data to solve the scale problem of oceanic eddy detection. Specifically, a manually interpreted dataset, SAR-Eddy 2019, was constructed to address the dilemma of insufficient datasets for submesoscale oceanic eddy detection. The experimental results demonstrate that CEA-Net can outperform other mainstream models with the highest mAP reaching 85.47% with SAR-Eddy 2019 dataset. The CEA-Net proposed in this research provides important significance for the study of submesoscale oceanic eddies.

TI  - Fostering deep learning approaches to evaluate the impact of urbanization on vegetation and future prospects
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an essential component of our global ecosystem and an important indicator of the dynamics and productivity of land cover. Vegetation forecasting research has been accelerated using several deep learning (DL) algorithms through remote sensing (RS) data. In this context, we used artificial intelligence (AI) and the longshort-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) method to explore and forecast future urban-rural vegetation disparities (Delta EVI, where EVI is the enhanced vegetation index) in Pakistan's six megacities using MODIS EVI data. The forecast results revealed that Delta EVI is decreasing in all cities. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were used to evaluate LSTM-RNN. RSME values were recorded as 0.03, 0.07, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.06 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively. MAPE was estimated as 0.12, 0.55, 0.24, 0.18, 0.28, and 0.47 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively. This situation indicates that LSTM-RNN can be used as a new reliable AI technique for forecasting. The results suggested that the average of forecasted Delta EVI for the next 10 years is -0.23, -0.21, -0.09, -0.13, -0.22, and -0.11 for Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, respectively. The findings of this study will help evaluate the impact of urbanization on EVI by leveraging DL techniques along with implementing an urbanization policy for urban development and environmental protection for long-term urban sustainability.

TI  - Defining healthcare never events to effect system change: A protocol for systematic review
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction A never event is the most egregious of patient safety incidents. It refers to events that should theoretically never happen, such amputating the wrong limb. The term "never event" is used around the world by a variety of medical and patient safety organizations and is synonymous with sentinel events and serious reportable events. Unfortunately, there is little consensus about which events, in particular, are never events. These differing lists hinder potential collaboration or large-scale analyses. A recent systematic review by Hegarty et al. (2020) identified the need for a standardized definition for serious reportable events. The objective of our systematic review is to build on this by identifying which events are consistently or frequently identified as never events in order to isolate those which are core never events.Materials and methods A systematic review will be conducted using Medline, Medline in Process, Scopus, PsychINFO, Embase via OVID, and CINAHL via EBSCO databases, as well as grey literature. We will include articles of any study design that discuss never events or one of its synonymous terms in the context of medical care. Four independent reviewers will conduct the title and abstract as well as the full-text screening, and 2 reviewers will abstract data. Data will be analyzed using narrative synthesis. Results will be categorized by year and geographic location, and by other factors determined during full-text screening.Discussion and conclusion The lack of consensus regarding never events hinders progress in reducing their occurrence. Differing data sources makes comparison challenging, and limits the ability for patient safety groups to work collaboratively and share learnings with others. Identifying a core set of never events will serve as a first step to focus our efforts to reduce these harmful incidents.

AB  - BackgroundThis study investigated whether a novel multi-injection intertransverse process block could provide non-inferior analgesia and recovery quality following major breast cancer surgery compared with the multi-injection thoracic paravertebral block. MethodsEighty-eight females who underwent mastectomy plus sentinel or axillary lymph node dissection were randomized to receive either intertransverse process block or thoracic paravertebral block, both performed at T2-6 with 5 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine per level. The primary outcome was the worst resting pain score (11-point Numerical Rating Scale) within 30 min in the recovery room. The secondary outcome was recovery quality (15-item quality of recovery scale) 24 hours after surgery, which was tested following a gatekeeping procedure. ResultsThe worst resting pain scores were 0 (0, 1) in the intertransverse process block group vs 0.5 (0, 2) in the thoracic paravertebral block group, with a median difference of 0 (95% CI 0 to 0); the upper 95% CI limit was lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1 point (non-inferiority p<0.001). Aggregate scores of recovery quality at 24 hours postoperatively were 137.5 (126.5, 142.8) and 137.5 (127.8, 145.0) for the intertransverse process and thoracic paravertebral block groups, respectively, with a median difference of -1 (95% CI -6 to 3); the lower 95% CI limit was larger than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of -8 (non-inferiority p=0.006). ConclusionsCompared with a multi-injection thoracic paravertebral block, the multi-injection intertransverse process block provided non-inferior analgesia within 30 min in the recovery room and recovery quality at 24 hours following major breast cancer surgery in females.

TI  - Predictors of need for endovascular intervention in hepatic trauma
T2  - ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Non-operative management of hepatic trauma with adjunctive hepatic arterial embolization (HAE) is widely accepted. Despite careful patient selection utilizing CTA, a substantial proportion of angiograms are negative for arterial injury and no HAE is performed. This study aims to determine which CT imaging findings and clinical factors are associated with the presence of active extravasation on subsequent angiography in patients with hepatic trauma. Materials and methods The charts of 243 adults who presented with abdominal trauma and underwent abdominal CTA followed by conventional angiography were retrospectively reviewed. Of these patients, 49 had hepatic injuries on CTA. Hepatic injuries were graded using the American association for the surgery of trauma (AAST) CT classification, and CT images were assessed for active contrast extravasation, arterial pseudoaneurysm, sentinel clot, hemoperitoneum, laceration in-volving more than 2 segments, and laceration involving specific anatomic landmarks (porta hepatis, hepatic veins, and gallbladder fossa). Medical records were reviewed for pre- and post-angiography blood pressures, hemoglobin levels, and transfusion requirements. Angiographic images and reports were reviewed for hepatic arterial injury and performance of HAE. Results In multivariate analysis, AAST hepatic injury grade was significantly associated with increased odds of HAE (Odds ratio: 2.5, 95% CI 1.1, 7.1, p = 0.049). Univariate analyses demonstrated no significant association between CT liver injury grade, CT characteristics of liver injury, or pre-angiographic clinical data with need for HAE. Conclusion In patients with hepatic trauma, prediction of need for HAE based on CT findings alone is challenging; such patients require consideration of both clinical factors and imaging findings.

TI  - <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> strain ZY-312 promotes intestinal barrier integrity via upregulating the STAT3 pathway in a radiation-induced intestinal injury mouse model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation-induced intestinal injury is characterized by intestinal barrier impairment. However, the therapeutic effects of probiotics for intestinal epithelial barrier repair in a mouse model of radiation-induced intestinal injury remain unclear. Previously, we isolated a strain of Bacteroides fragilis from the feces of a healthy infant and named it as B. fragilis strain ZY-312 (B. fragilis). In this study, we showed that B. fragilis can ameliorate radiation-induced intestinal injury in mice, manifested by decreased weight loss, intestinal length shortening, and intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) shedding. Moreover, we found that B. fragilis promoted IEC proliferation, stem cell regeneration, mucus secretion, and tight junction integrity by upregulating the STAT3 signaling pathway, through an experimental verification in Stat3(oIEC) mice (STAT3 defects in intestinal epithelial cells). Thus, the underlying protective mechanism of B. fragilis in radiation-induced intestinal injury is related to IEC proliferation, stem cell regeneration, goblet cell secretion, and tight junction repair via activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. In addition, the therapeutic effects of B. fragilis were studied to provide new insights into its application as a functional and clinical drug for radiation-induced intestinal injury after radiotherapy.

TI  - Application of Dempster-Shafer theory for optimization of precipitation classification and estimation results from remote sensing data using machine learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a technique based on Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) is proposed to combine three classifiers, namely Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) in order to improve the precipitation estimation over the North of Algeria. Data from SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) radiometer on board MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) is used. First, the three classifiers were applied for the classification of instan-taneous precipitation scenes into three classes (stratiform class, convective class or no-rain class). Secondly, to apply the DST and to calculate the mass functions, normalized probabilities from the classifications are determined. The mass functions of the different classifiers were combined us-ing DST. Maximum plausibility or maximum belief are calculated and used for the final assign-ment decision. The DST-ANN/SVM/RF method shows interesting performances compared to the separate use of the three classifiers. The proposed method has also been compared to some techniques combining two, three and six classifiers based on machine learning. The results show that Demp-ster-Shafer Theory performs better than other combination techniques. The estimation results are well correlated with the reference radar measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.96 for the developped technique against 0.94 for the technique combining six classifiers, 0.90 for the technique combining three classifiers, 0 0.87 for the technique combining two classifiers and 0.85 for the technique with a single classifier.

TI  - A Bayesian optimization hyperband-optimized incremental deep belief network for online battery behaviour modelling for a satellite simulator
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulation tools play crucial roles in the stable implementation of space missions during satellite operations; they are typically utilized for satellite behaviour monitoring by comparing obtained telemetry values and predicted values according to pretrained prediction models. However, as telemetry data streams arrive in a chunk-by-chunk manner, a common practice is to retrain the employed simulation tool based on the newly arrived data, which results in the consumption of many computing resources and time lags. Therefore, an incremental learning algorithm is required to achieve accurate and fast satellite behaviour prediction. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization hyperband-optimized incremental learning-based deep belief network (BOHB-ILDBN) to reproduce battery voltage behaviours, where the BOHB algorithm is utilized to obtain a group of optimal hyperparameter configurations to initialize a DBN model, the DBN model is incrementally updated by a fine-tuning process, and the variance difference between the actual and forecasted values is taken as the criterion for determining the completion of model training. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the model are verified on telemetry data obtained from an on-orbit sun-synchronous remote sensing satellite, the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4A).

TI  - Woody plant cover trends and potential drivers in the Horqin temperate steppe, northeast China: Remote sensing-based computation and modeling
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Horqin temperate steppe is the largest grassland in northern China. With the combined disturbance of multiple potential drivers, the native herbaceous vegetation has degraded with different intensity, and woody plants have transformed into the dominant vegetation in this area. On the one hand, woody plants play an important role in sand control, food/timber product provision, etc. On the other hand, this transformation process significantly affects the steppe ecosystem structure and function. It is necessary to clarify the patterns and determinants of woody plant cover changes. In view of the lack of high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing data for woody cover. Here, based on high-resolution satellite images and the random forest model, the study reports the annual mean woody plant cover of the Horqin temperate steppe is 17.55 % over the past 35 years, and the significant increase area is approximately 43.7 % of the total area. Analysis of the boosted regression tree model showed potential drivers were mainly attributed to climate change (i.e., mean annual temperature, mean annual wind speed, and annual precipitation) and grazing intensity, with the cumulative contribution approaching 70 %. Furthermore, large-scale and high-density afforestation could also be responsible for the increase in woody plant cover. Against the background of frequent climate extremes, maintaining and improving steppe productivity, avoiding regional climate deterioration caused by blind afforestation, and developing a reasonable grazing management policy is the urgently needed to ensure the relative ecological stability of semiarid temperate steppes and to achieve relatively sustainable development of the regional agro-pastoral economy.

TI  - Shoreline Change Along Raigarh Coast, Maharashtra- a Bi-decadal Scenario
T2  - THALASSAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic nature of the shoreline makes the coastal areas vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Changes in any shoreline concerning erosion and deposition affect the coastal landforms and population. Delineating the shoreline and mapping the areas of erosion/deposition would undoubtedly augment the knowledge base in the coastal region and help the environmental planners better maintain the coastal tracts. Shoreline delineation is challenging; however, remote sensing data combined with the Geoinformatics technique helps extract and monitor shorelines. The present paper attempts to delineate and analyze the shoreline changes over the bi-decade time frame for the coastal tracts of Raigarh. Satellite data (Landsat) and tide level data were employed in this work. Short-time shoreline change has been analyzed for five-time sections starting from 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, 2016, and 2019, and long-term shoreline change encompasses the 2000 to 2019 scenario. The methodology adopted for this study involved image processing techniques for delineating the shoreline. The automated Shorelines were extracted using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) for the images prepared by employing a few indices using the ISODATA unsupervised classification technique. The present analysis results portray the Raigarh coast's dynamic nature. A cyclic pattern of erosion and deposition has been observed in the short-time analysis. Over twenty years, the Raigarh shoreline exhibits an overall erosion of -0.12 m/yr. A detailed analysis had done on the small section depicting mangrove patches, and this is to understand the response of mangroves at the zone of erosion and deposition. Mangrove patches with anthropogenic stress represent a zone of erosion, and patches with mature growth, protected from human interference, represent a zone of deposition. The mangrove patches, specifically over the northernmost parts like Kamothe, Khandeshwar, and Vaghivali, which are close to urban agglomeration or other allied anthropogenic activities like industry, exhibit an active erosion process. Mangrove patches with mature trees have well-developed root systems representing the deposition zone. Navedarbeli well represents such cases. Patches like Kalinje reported deposition, which is the result of a successful conservation program by the mangrove cell of Maharashtra. Overall, the headland regions of Alibag, Murud, and Srivardhan talukas are more susceptible to erosion. This type of study will help in monitoring the shoreline as well as will help in restoring and preserving the mangrove habitat.

TI  - Manganese porphyrin/ICG nanoparticles as magnetic resonance/fluorescent dual-mode probes for imaging of sentinel lymph node metastasis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
M3  - Article
AB  - Diagnosis of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis and its status are key parameters for predicting overall disease prognosis. In this work, Pluronic F127 stabilized ICG/tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin-Mn(iii) (TCPP(Mn)) nanoparticles (F127-ICG/Mn NPs) as fluorescent/magnetic resonance (FL/MR) dual-modality probes were prepared. The application of F127-ICG/Mn NPs in SLN imaging was mainly evaluated from two perspectives: the difference between the normal LN and the metastatic SLN and the difference between micrometastasis and macrometastasis. Normal and metastatic SLNs and micro- and macro-SLN metastasis were successfully distinguished through fluorescence and MR imaging with the help of F127-ICG/Mn NPs. In contrast, for the ICG group, the micro- and macro-SLN metastasis status could not be differentiated by fluorescence imaging. Besides, the lymph nodes can be stained green by the F127-ICG/Mn NPs and clearly visualized by the naked eye. In general, F127-ICG/Mn NPs demonstrated the potential of the preoperative diagnosis of SLN metastasis and its status, as well as intraoperative navigation by green-stained SLN and NIR FL imaging. This work provides a reference for developing multimodal nanoparticles for SLN metastasis diagnosis.

TI  - In-season and dynamic crop mapping using 3D convolution neural networks and sentinel-2 time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate, frequently updated, automatic and reproducible mapping procedure to identify seasonal cultivated crops is a prerequisite for many crop monitoring activities. Deep learning was demonstrated to be an effective mapping approach already successfully applied to decametric resolution satellite images (like Sentinel-2 data) to produce yearly crop maps. In this framework, algorithm training is performed with ground truth typically consisting of spatially explicit information available after the end of the season (e.g. yearly crop maps and/or farmer declaration for subsidies at parcel level); however, such data (i) does not allow performing in-season prediction, and (ii) does not provide temporal details fundamental to describe a dynamic crop succession and/or to understand crop management (i.e. planting and harvesting). In this paper we present a Deep Neural Network-based approach capable of generating (i) a crop map of the current season at a specific point in time ("In season mapping"conventionally at the end of the current year), along with (ii) all intermediate maps during the season able to describe in near real-time the evolution of crop presence ("Dynamic-mapping"at the temporal granularity of satellite imagery revisiting, e.g., 5 days for Sentinel-2 data). This approach adopts a smart training procedure of a Deep Neural model by exploiting historical satellite data and ground truth. We introduce a method to automatically generate "short-term"ground truth maps (i.e. 5 days reference) starting from the "long-term"ones (i.e. available yearly static reference) and characterizing temporally the different crop presence by performing a phenological analysis of historical time series. The model was trained and validated in Lombardy (North of Italy) exploiting multi-annual authoritative crop maps from 2016 to 2019. Validation was performed both in time (same areas used for training in a different year) and space (different location) for the year 2019. The quantitative error metrics calculation and Spatio-temporal analysis clearly demonstrate that the model can predict in-season crop presence with a generalization capacity over the long-term (yearly maps: OA > 70% and Kappa > 0.64%) and that the short-term predictions (5 days maps) are coherent with the reference information from expert knowledge (local crop calendars). The model can produce dynamically along the season short-term maps with a medium-high crop-specific User Accuracy at the maximum green-up phase (UA > 53% up to 95%). These products are of extreme interest for final users providing information at the peak of plant development that dynamically changes according to the considered crop, the specific location and the investigated season. These results demonstrate that it is possible to produce a crop map early in the season and extract useful additional information such as crop intensity (e.g. double crops presence) and crop dynamics related to different sowing dates.

TI  - PFD-SENTINEL: Development of a screening tool for pelvic floor dysfunction in female athletes through an international Delphi consensus
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - To develop a screening tool for pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) in female athletes for use by sports medicine clinicians (eg, musculoskeletal/sports physiotherapists, sports and exercise medicine physicians), which guides referral to a PFD specialist (eg, pelvic floor/women's health physiotherapist, gynaecologist, urogynaecologist, urologist).Between February and April 2022, an international two-round modified Delphi study was conducted to assess expert opinion on which symptoms, risk factors and clinical and sports-related characteristics (items) should be included in a screening tool. We defined consensus a priori as >67% response agreement to pass each round.41 and 34 experts participated in rounds 1 and 2, respectively. Overall, seven general statements were endorsed as relevant by most participants highlighting the importance of screening for PFD in female athletes. Through consensus, the panel developed the Pelvic Floor Dysfunction-ScrEeNing Tool IN fEmale athLetes (PFD-SENTINEL) and agreed to a cluster of PFD symptoms (n=5) and items (risk factors, clinical and sports-related characteristics; n=28) that should prompt specialist care. A clinical algorithm was also created: a direct referral is recommended when at least one symptom or 14 items are reported. If these thresholds are not reached, continuous monitoring of the athlete's health is indicated.Despite increasing awareness and clinical relevance, barriers to identify PFD in female athletes are still present. The PFD-SENTINEL is a new resource for sports medicine clinicians who regularly assess female athletes and represents the first step towards early PFD identification and management. Further studies to validate the tool are needed.

TI  - Identifying driving factors of the runoff coefficient based on the geographic detector model in the upper reaches of Huaihe River Basin
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Various climate and watershed characteristics determine the runoff coefficient (RC), and their interactions are complicated. Understanding the driving factors of the RC is important for understanding the long-term water balance and how it might change. Using the upper reaches of the Huaihe River Basin as the study area, remote sensing data were used to produce a RC map. The geographical detector was selected to quantify the individual and interactive influences of 13 driving factors on the RC. The results revealed that moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer evapotranspiration (ET) data can be used to produce a mean average RC map based on the water balance equation. The dominant factors influencing the RC were found to vary at different scales. Precipitation had the largest correlation coefficient with the RC at the watershed scale. For the pixel scale, results from the geographical detector indicated that actual evapotranspiration (AET) and precipitation had the highest explanatory rate for the RC in the small watershed region and the whole study area (0.785 and 0.248, respectively). Climate factors, elevation, and normalized difference vegetation index had a substantial influence on the RC. Any two factors exhibited bilinear or nonlinear enhanced relationships in their interactions. The largest interactions between the factors were AET and precipitation, which exceeded 0.900. This study serves to better understand and explain runoff's complex interrelationships.

TI  - Multi-source knowledge graph reasoning for ocean oil spill detection from satellite SAR images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spills can cause severe damage to the marine environment and biological resources. Using satellite remote sensing technology is one of the best ways to monitor the sea surface in near real-time to obtain oil spill information. The existing methods in the literature either use deep convolutional neural networks in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to directly identify oil spills or use traditional methods based on artificial features sequentially to distinguish oil spills from sea surface. However, both approaches currently only use image information and ignore some valuable auxiliary information, such as marine weather conditions, distances from oil spill candidates to oil spill sources, etc. In this study, we proposed a novel method to help detect marine oil spills by constructing a multi-source knowledge graph, which was the first one specifically designed for oil spill detection in the remote sensing field. Our method can rationally organize and utilize various oil spill-related information obtained from multiple data sources, such as remote sensing images, vectors, texts, and atmosphere-ocean model data, which can be stored in a graph database for user-friendly query and management. In order to identify oil spills more effectively, we also proposed 13 new dark spot features and then used a feature selection technique to create a feature subset that was favorable to oil spill detection. Furthermore, we proposed a knowledge graph-based oil spill reasoning method that combines rule inference and graph neural network technology, which pre-inferred and eliminated most non-oil spills using statistical rules to alleviate the problem of imbalanced data categories (oil slick and non-oil slick). Entity recognition is ultimately performed on the remaining oil spill candidates using a graph neural network algorithm. To verify the effectiveness of our knowledge graph approach, we collected 35 large SAR images to construct a new dataset, for which the training set contained 110 oil slicks and 66264 non-oil slicks from 18 SAR images, the validation set contained 35 oil slicks and 69005 non-oil slicks from 10 SAR images, and the testing set contained 36 oil slicks and 36281 non-oil slicks from the remaining 7 SAR images. The results showed that some traditional oil spill detection methods and deep learning models failed when the dataset suffered a severe imbalance, while our proposed method identified oil spills with a sensitivity of 0.8428, specificity of 0.9985, and precision of 0.2781 under those same conditions. The knowledge graph method we proposed using multi -source data can not only help solve the problem of information island in oil spill detection, but serve as a guide for construction of remote sensing knowledge graphs in many other applications as well. The dataset gathered has been made freely available online (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DDaqIljhjSMEUHyaATDIYA?pwd=qmt6).

TI  - Assessing medical product safety during pregnancy using parameterizable tools in the sentinel distributed database
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The US Food and Drug Administration established the Sentinel System to monitor the safety of medical products. A component of this system includes parameterizable analytic tools to identify mother-infant pairs and evaluate infant outcomes to enable the routine monitoring of the utilization and safety of drugs used in pregnancy. We assessed the feasibility of using the data and tools in the Sentinel System by assessing a known association between topiramate use during pregnancy and oral clefts in the infant.Methods: We identified mother-infant pairs using the mother-infant linkage table from six data partners contributing to the Sentinel Distributed Database from January 1, 2000, to September 30, 2015. We compared mother-infant pairs with first-trimester exposure to topiramate to mother-infant pairs that were topiramate-unexposed or lamotrigine-exposed and used a validated algorithm to identify oral clefts in the infant. We estimated adjusted risk ratios through propensity score stratification.Results: There were 2007 topiramate-exposed and 1 066 086 unexposed mother-infant pairs in the main comparison. In the active-comparator analysis, there were 1996 topiramate-exposed and 2859 lamotrigine-exposed mother-infant pairs. After propensity score stratification, the odds ratio for oral clefts was 2.92 (95% CI: 1.43, 5.93) comparing the topiramate-exposed to unexposed groups and 2.72 (95% CI: 0.75, 9.93) comparing the topiramate-exposed to lamotrigine-exposed groups.Conclusions: We found an increased risk of oral clefts after topiramate exposure in the first trimester in the Sentinel database. These results are similar to prior published observational study results and demonstrate the ability of Sentinel's data and analytic tools to assess medical product safety in cohorts of mother-infant pairs in a timely manner.

TI  - Volcanic cloud detection using Sentinel-3 satellite data by means of neural networks: the Raikoke 2019 eruption test case
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate automatic volcanic cloud detection by means of satellite data is achallenging task and is of great concern for both the scientific community andaviation stakeholders due to well-known issues generated by strong eruptionevents in relation to aviation safety and health impacts. In this context,machine learning techniques applied to satellite data acquired from recentspaceborne sensors have shown promising results in the last few years. This work focuses on the application of a neural-network-based model toSentinel-3 SLSTR (Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer) daytimeproducts in order to detect volcanic ash plumes generated by the 2019Raikoke eruption. A classification of meteorological clouds and of othersurfaces comprising the scene is also carried out. The neural network hasbeen trained with MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)daytime imagery collected during the 2010 Eyjafjallajokull eruption. Thesimilar acquisition channels of SLSTR and MODIS sensors and the comparablelatitudes of the eruptions permit an extension of the approach to SLSTR,thereby overcoming the lack in Sentinel-3 products collected in previousmid- to high-latitude eruptions. The results show that the neural network modelis able to detect volcanic ash with good accuracy if compared to RGBvisual inspection and BTD (brightness temperature difference) procedures.Moreover, the comparison between the ash cloud obtained by the neuralnetwork (NN) and a plume mask manually generated for the specific SLSTRimages considered shows significant agreement, with an F-measure of around0.7. Thus, the proposed approach allows for an automatic image classificationduring eruption events, and it is also considerably faster thantime-consuming manual algorithms. Furthermore, the whole image classification indicates the overall reliability of the algorithm, particularly for recognition and discrimination between volcanic clouds and other objects.

TI  - Rare earth elements as statistical sentinels of pollution and paleoenvironments?: Application to a highly polluted estuary in southwestern Spain
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Multivariate analyses have been applied to the REE contents of three cores collected in the Tinto estuary, SW Spain, an extremely polluted area. Results indicate an extremely correlation between all REE, which behave as a single variable. A slight natural pollution peak and three anthropogenic pollution peaks are identified, related with the first mining activities, the Roman period and a recent intensive mining accompanied by a heavy in-dustrial pollution. In all these peaks, the increase of Cu is parallel to that of MREE, which are configured as the best indicators of pollution among REE. Statistical analyses clearly differentiate four groups, each consisting of samples from different environments. Although grain size and this strong pollution alter the study of REE as environmental indicators, it is possible to recognise groups of samples with a common origin or to identify the surface extent of a given pollution peak.

TI  - Existential isolation and well-being in justice-involved populations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Much work in psychology has focused on feelings of social isolation and/or loneliness. Only recently have psychologists begun to explore the concept of existential isolation (EI). EI is the subjective sense that persons are alone in their experience and that others are unable to understand their perspective. EI thus occurs when people feel that they have a unique worldview unshared by others. Measured as either a state or trait, empirical studies have shown EI undermines life meaning and decreases well-being; people scoring high on EI report lower levels of need satisfaction, purpose in life, and meaningfulness and increased death-related concerns. There is also a positive correlation between EI and anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. The purpose of this perspective paper is to review literature on EI and discuss its relevance to people who have been involved with the justice system. Given their higher rates of substance use, mental health difficulties, and trauma, this traditionally underserved population is particularly susceptible to compromised well-being. We theorize that EI may impede the impact of therapeutic interventions in justice settings as more isolated individuals may feel disjointed from their counselors and peers, thereby decreasing levels of treatment engagement, participation, satisfaction, and perceived social support. Professionals may be able to mitigate issues related to EI by an enhanced focus on establishing authenticity within the therapist-client relationship (e.g., empathy, perspective taking, compassion), connecting with clients via I-sharing [i.e., matching on a shared experience(s)], and/or encouraging active participation in client's behavioral healthcare needs (e.g., self-reflection).

TI  - Predicting Smoking Prevalence in Japan Using Search Volumes in an Internet Search Engine: Infodemiology Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Tobacco smoking is an important public health issue and a core indicator of public health policy worldwide. However, global pandemics and natural disasters have prevented surveys from being conducted.Objective: The purpose of this study was to predict smoking prevalence by prefecture and sex in Japan using Internet search trends.Methods: This study used the infodemiology approach. The outcome variable was smoking prevalence by prefecture, obtained from national surveys. The predictor variables were the search volumes on Yahoo! Japan Search. We collected the search volumes for queries related to terms from the thesaurus of the Japanese medical article database Ichu-shi. Predictor variables were converted to per capita values and standardized as z scores. For smoking prevalence, the values for 2016 and 2019 were used, and for search volume, the values for the April 1 to March 31 fiscal year (FY) 1 year prior to the survey (ie, FY 2015 and FY 2018) were used. Partial correlation coefficients, adjusted for data year, were calculated between smoking prevalence and search volume, and a regression analysis using a generalized linear mixed model with random effects was conducted for each prefecture. Several models were tested, including a model that included all search queries, a variable reduction method, and one that excluded cigarette product names. The best model was selected with the Akaike information criterion corrected (AICC) for small sample size and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We compared the predicted and actual smoking prevalence in 2016 and 2019 based on the best model and predicted the smoking prevalence in 2022.Results: The partial correlation coefficients for men showed that 9 search queries had significant correlations with smoking prevalence, including cigarette (r=-0.417, P<.001), cigar in kanji (r=-0.412, P<.001), and cigar in katakana (r=-0.399, P<.001). For women, five search queries had significant correlations, including vape (r=0.335, P=.001), quitting smoking (r=0.288, P=.005), and cigar (r=0.286, P=.006). The models with all search queries were the best models for both AICC and BIC scores. Scatter plots of actual and estimated smoking prevalence in 2016 and 2019 confirmed a relatively high degree of agreement. The average estimated smoking prevalence in 2022 in the 47 prefectures for the total sample was 23.492% (95% CI 21.617%-25.367%), showing an increasing trend, with an average of 29.024% (95% CI 27.218%-30.830%) for men and 8.793% (95% CI 7.531%-10.054%) for women.Conclusions: This study suggests that the search volume of tobacco-related queries in internet search engines can predict smoking prevalence by prefecture and sex in Japan. These findings will enable the development of low-cost, timely, and crisis-resistant health indicators that will enable the evaluation of health measures and contribute to improved public health.

TI  - Characterization of the gut microbiome and resistome of Galapagos marine iguanas (<i>Amblyrhynchus cristatus</i>) from uninhabited islands
T2  - ANIMAL MICROBIOME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Understanding the natural microbiome and resistome of wildlife from remote places is necessary to monitor the human footprint on the environment including antimicrobial use (AU). Marine iguanas are endemic species from the Galapagos Islands where they are highly affected by anthropogenic factors that can alter their microbiota as well as their abundance and diversity of antimicrobial-resistant genes (ARGs). Thus, this study aims to apply culture-independent approaches to characterize the marine iguana's gut metagenomic composition of samples collected from the uninhabited islands Rabida (n = 8) and Fernandina (Cabo Douglas, n = 30; Punta Espinoza, n = 30). Fresh feces from marine iguanas were analyzed through SmartChip RT-PCR, 16S rRNA, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to identify their microbiome, microbial-metabolic pathways, resistome, mobilome, and virulome. Results: The marine iguana's gut microbiome composition was highly conserved despite differences in ecological niches, where 86% of taxa were shared in the three locations. However, site-specific differences were mainly identified in resistome, mobilome, virulorome, and metabolic pathway composition, highlighting the existence of factors that induce microbial adaptations in each location. Functional gut microbiome analyses revealed its role in the biosynthesis and degradation of vitamins, cofactors, proteinogenic amino acids, carbohydrates, nucleosides and nucleotides, fatty acids, lipids, and other compounds necessary for the marine iguanas. The overall bacterial ARG abundance was relatively low (0.006%); nevertheless, the presence of genes encoding resistance to 22 drug classes was identified in the iguana's gut metagenome. ARG-carrying contig and co-occurrence network analyses revealed that commensal bacteria are the main hosts of ARGs. Taxa of public health interest such as Salmonella, Vibrio, and Klebsiella also carried multidrug-resistance genes associated with MGEs which can influence the dissemination of ARGs through horizontal gene transfer. Conclusion: Marine iguanas depend on the gut microbiome for the biosynthesis and degradation of several compounds through a symbiotic relationship. Niche-specific adaptations were evidenced in the pool of microbial accessory genes (i.e., ARGs, MGEs, and virulence) and metabolic pathways, but not in the microbiome composition. Culture-independent approaches outlined the presence of a diverse resistome composition in the Galapagos marine iguanas from remote islands. The presence of AR pathogens in marine iguanas raises concerns about the dispersion of microbial-resistant threats in pristine areas, highlighting wildlife as sentinel species to identify the impact of AU.

TI  - A deep learning classification approach using high spatial satellite images for detection of built-up areas in rural zones: Case study of Souss-Massa region-Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The buildings in the rural areas of Morocco exist in various shapes and sizes. They are randomly distributed and are generally constructed of primary materials such as clay, wood, and tin. For these reasons, their detection is generally difficult and inaccurate with optical satellite imagery and traditional image processing techniques, particularly in rural settlements. New approaches, particularly those of Deep Learning, are called for testing their contribution to the detection of buildings and settlements in rural areas. This study aims to detect and map the settlements in rural areas in the Souss-Massa region using Sentinel-2 satellite images, based on deep Learning al-gorithms. First, we tested the result of the convolutional neural network architecture UNet. Then, to evaluate the impact of filters number on the performance of UNet, we increased the number of filters in the convolution layer. And third, we implement the deep Residual UNet (ResUNet). To evaluate the quality of tested models, special metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 -score, and the ROC curve are used. The obtained precision of 87% of precision and 54% of F1 -score for the UNet with an increased number of filters outperforms the other algorithms UNet and ResUNet, which have 86.2% of precision and 81.2% precision, respectively. We compared our perception to those of other related studies conducted to extract buildings or settlements in rural areas using high to very high-resolution images and machine learning and deep learning algo-rithms. Our results show that the performance of settlement detection in rural areas using deep learning is affected by the quality and quantity of the model training base images and the number of filters used in the convolution layer.

TI  - Comparison of survival outcomes between axillary conservation and axillary lymph node dissections in <i>N</i>1 early breast cancer: a propensity-matched SEER analysis
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is an alternative to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer surgery. But the criteria of SLND only for patients with limited disease in the sentinel node is disputed. Methods:From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, 2000-2015, we identified 97,296 early breast cancer females with 1-3 axillary lymph nodes macro-metastasis. Of them, 1-5 (axillary conservation group), 6-9, and >= 10 (ALND group) axillary lymph nodes were dissected in 28,639, 16,838, and 51,819 patients, respectively. According to the criteria of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, two historical cohort studies of patients who underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy were conducted and the survival outcomes between ALND and axillary conservation were compared. Results:Overall, dissection of 6-9 regional lymph nodes resulted in the worst prognosis. After propensity-matched analysis, it was found that patients in the axillary conservation group had worse survival than the ALND group in overall survival. No significant difference in prognosis between the group undergoing lumpectomy was found both in OS and BCSS. Subgroup analysis revealed that Grade 3, T2, two lymph nodes positive, or Her2 positive were the main causes of worse survival in the axillary conservation group. Conclusion:Not all patients with N1 early breast cancer suit axillary conservation. Axillary conservation was sufficient in patients who were treated with lumpectomy. ALND cannot be omitted in patients who were ineligible for the Z0011 and undergoing mastectomy with the following characteristics: T2, Grade 3, two positive lymph nodes, and Her2 positive, which may be better complemented to the Z0011 trial. Hence, under different surgical methods, the clinical precision treatment of ALND or axillary preservation is essential.

TI  - Spatiotemporal green water dynamics and their responses to variations of climatic and underlying surface factors: A case study in the Sanjiang Plain, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Sanjiang Plain (SJP), located at the confluence reaches of the Heilong, Songhua, and Wusuli Rivers in Northeast China. Study focus: This study aimed to quantify the effects of varying climate and land-use/land-cover (LULC) dynamics on green water (GW) over the SJP during two distinctive periods (i.e., pre-2000 and post-2000), when synergetic effects of increased precipitation and temperature and rapid development of agriculture occurred. This assessment used the distributed eco-hydrological model ESSI-3. Multivariable and multi-objective calibration approaches (i.e., discharge, evapotranspiration, and terrestrial water storage anomaly) were used to ensure the high accuracies of the model outputs. New hydrological insights for the region: This research concluded that GW flow and GW storage in the SJP evidently increased after 2000 compared with before. Across the SJP, GW flow and GW storage responded differently to climate changes and LULC dynamics during pre-2000 and post2000 period. Our results demonstrated that GW storage changes were predominately affected by climatic changes, especially variations in precipitation, whose contribution accounted for more than 56% after 2000. However, GW flow changes were mainly governed by LULC changes, especially the influence of cropland transformation, whose contribution increased over 20% in the post-2000 period. This study posed a deep insight regarding impacts of regional climatic and

TI  - Deep attentive fusion network for flood detection on uni-temporal Sentinel-1 data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are occurring across the globe, and due to climate change, flood events are expected to increase in the coming years. Current situations urge more focus on efficient monitoring of floods and detecting impacted areas. In this study, we propose two segmentation networks for flood detection on uni-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data. The first network is "Attentive U-Net". It takes VV, VH, and the ratio VV/VH as input. The network uses spatial and channel-wise attention to enhance feature maps which help in learning better segmentation. "Attentive U-Net" yields 67% Intersection Over Union (IoU) on the Sen1Floods11 dataset, which is 3% better than the benchmark IoU. The second proposed network is a dual-stream "Fusion network", where we fuse global low-resolution elevation data and permanent water masks with Sentinel-1 (VV, VH) data. Compared to the previous benchmark on the Sen1Floods11 dataset, our fusion network gave a 4.5% better IoU score. Quantitatively, the performance improvement of both proposed methods is considerable. The quantitative comparison with the benchmark method demonstrates the potential of our proposed flood detection networks. The results are further validated by qualitative analysis, in which we demonstrate that the addition of a low-resolution elevation and a permanent water mask enhances the flood detection results. Through ablation experiments and analysis we also demonstrate the effectiveness of various design choices in proposed networks. Our code is available on Github at https://github.com/RituYadav92/UNI_TEMP_FLOOD_DETECTION for reuse.

TI  - A new regional vegetation mapping method based on terrain-climate-remote sensing and its application on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impact of climate change on vegetation and its evolution trend requires long-term accurate data on regional vegetation types and their geographical distribution. Currently, land use and land cover types are mainly obtained based on remote sensing information. Little research has been conducted on remote sensing interpretation of vegetation types and their geographical distributions in terms of the comprehensive utilization of remote sensing, climate, and terrain. A new region vegetation mapping method based on terrain-climate-remote sensing was developed in this study, supported by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the random forest algorithm, which is a new generation of earth science data and analysis application platform, together with optimal vegetation mapping features obtained from the average impure reduction method and out-of-bag error value, using different information from remote sensing, climate, and terrain. This vegetation of Qinghai-Xizang Plateau with 10 m spatial resolution in 2020 was mapped, in terms of this new vegetation mapping method, Sentinel-2A/B remotely sensed images, climate, and terrain. The accuracy verification of vegetation mapping on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau showed an overall accuracy of 89.5% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.87. The results suggest that the regional vegetation mapping method based on terrain-climate-remote sensing proposed in this study can provide technical support for obtaining long-term accurate data on vegetation types and their geographical distributions on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau and the globe.

TI  - The impacts of land use and land cover change on biophysical processes in West Africa using a regional climate model experimental approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using 2001 and 2016 land use (LU) data and three developed deforestation LU scenarios, namely Deforest I, II and III, the possible impacts of the ongoing land use land cover change (LULCC) over West Africa (WA) and the uncertainty regarding the impacts on regional climate were assessed. Twelve Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations were configured with the default and integrated MODIS satellite dataset for two sets of 3 months (December-February DJF 2011-2012 and July-September JAS 2012) over WA. Between 2001 and 2016, changes that occurred in precipitation, temperature and dew point temperature due to LULCC are mostly not significant at the 95% level with a decrease of 0.8, 0.0 and 0.1%, respectively. Deforest I, II and III caused significant changes with an increase of 44.4, 44.7, 41.5%; 0.8, 0.9, 1.1%; and 0.3, 0.1, -0.2%, respectively, for precipitation, temperature and dew point temperature. Precipitation was lower in the simulation with 2016 LU than it was with 2001 LU, which may have also been influenced by the reforestation that occurred between the periods. However, Deforest III resulted in a widespread nonsignificant rise in precipitation, as the modified areas showed a significant decrease during JAS period. Areas where forests were converted into barren lands revealed severe increase in the surface albedo which is a strong factor that its alteration is capable of influencing precipitation and other variables over WA. LULCC also altered the atmospheric column by modifying the strength of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ), Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), wind speed, and monsoonal, vertical, meridional and zonal winds. Heat related fields, such as dew point and air temperature, and moisture fields such as relative humidity were also modified by LULCC. Therefore, as WA reacts strongly to LULCC, sustainable land management practices should be encouraged to control its adverse effects.

TI  - Integrated analysis of Hashtgerd plain deformation, using Sentinel-1 SAR, geological and hydrological data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its proximity to Tehran, the Hashtgerd catchment in Iran is an important region that has experienced alarming subsidence rates in recent years. This study estimated the ground surface deformation in the Hashtgerd plain between 2015 and 2020 using Sentinel-1 SAR data and InSAR technique. The average LOS displacement of the ascending and descending tracks was - 23 cm/ year and - 22 cm/year, respectively. The central area of the plain experienced the greatest vertical subsidence, with a more than - 100 cm cumulative displacement. The Karaj- Qazvin railway and highway that pass through this area have been damaged by subsidence, according to an analysis of profiles drawn along the transportation lines. The southern sections of Hashtgerd city have experienced a total displacement of - 30 cm/year over the course of about 6 years. The relationship between changes in groundwater level and subsidence rate in this region was examined using piezometer and precipitation data. Geoelectric sections and piezometric well logs were also utilized to investigate the geological characteristics of the Hashtgerd aquifer. According to the findings, the leading causes of subsidence were uncontrolled groundwater abstraction. This research highlights the need to comprehend the spatial distribution of confined aquifers and their effect on subsidence, which can aid in the development of a suitable management strategy to restore these aquifers.

T2  - HEAD AND NECK-JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENCES AND SPECIALTIES OF THE HEAD AND NECK
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundAn international survey was conducted to investigate the preferences for completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in head and neck melanomas. MethodsA questionnaire was sent through the American Society of Head & Neck Surgery (AHNS) and Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (CSO). ResultsHundred and forty-nine surgeons completed the survey. Response rate was 6.3% and 9.7% from AHNS and CSO members, respectively. When presented the scenario of a 47-year-old male with a clinical T3bN0 cheek melanoma, with 1/1 positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) with nodal deposit <2 mm, 72 of respondents (48.3%) would perform a CLND. Reasons for CLND included multiples positive SLN (64.1%), size of nodal deposits (54.2%), and perceived lack of compliance to follow-up (54.2%). Surgeons with access to immunotherapy treatment were less likely to recommend CLND (p = 0.025). ConclusionsFollowing SLN biopsy, nearly half of the surveyed head and neck surgeons would recommend CLND, which contrasts with the current melanoma practice patterns in other anatomic locations. However, compared with an earlier study in the literature it does seem that there has been a shift away from completion neck dissection. Further investigation into understanding practice variations is warranted.

AB  - We introduce and define a new concept, 'Spatial Finance', as the integration of geospatial data and analysis into financial theory and practice, and describe how developments in earth observation, particularly as the result of new satellite constellations, combined with new artificial intelligence methods and cloud computing, create a plethora of potential applications for Spatial Finance. We argue that Spatial Finance will become a core future competency for financial analysis, and this will have significant implications for information markets, risk modelling and management, valuation modelling, and the identification of investment opportunities. The paper reviews the characteristics of geospatial data and related technology developments, some current and future applications of Spatial Finance, and its potential impact on financial theory and practice.

TI  - Hierarchical Bayesian geostatistics for C stock prediction in disturbed plantation forest in Zimbabwe
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop and present a novel Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical model for the prediction of plantation forest carbon stock (C stock) in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe using multispectral Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 remotely sensed data. Specifically, we adopt a Bayesian hierarchical methodology encompassing a modelbased inferential framework making use of efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for assessing model input parameters. Our proposed hierarchical modelling framework evaluates the influence of two but related covariate information sources in C stock prediction in order to build sustainable capacity on carbon reporting and monitoring. The perceived improvements in the spectral and spatial properties of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data and their potential to predict C stock with shorter uncertainty bounds is tested in the developed hierarchical Bayesian models. We utilized the Mean Squared Shortest Distance (MSSD) as the objective function for optimization of sampling locations for equal area coverage. Specifically, we evaluated the models using four selected remotely sensed vegetation indices namely, the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and an additional distance to settlements anthropogenic variable that justifies from the history of the studied plantation forest in the eastern highlands of Zimbabwe. We evaluated two models making use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 derived predictors using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coverage (CVG) and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC). The Sentinel-2 based C stock model resulted in RMSE of 1.16 MgCha(-1), MAE of 1.11 MgCha(-1), CVG of 94.7% and a DIC of 554.7 whilst its Landsat-8 based C stock counterpart yielded a RMSE, MAE, CVG and DIC of 2.69 MgCha(-1), 1.77 MgCha(-1), 85.4% and 43.1 respectively. Although predictive models from both sensors show great improvement in predictive accuracy when modelling the spatial random effects, the Sentinel-2 based C stock predictive model substantially outperforms its Landsat-8 based C stock counterpart. The Sentinel-2 based C stock predictive hierarchical model therefore adequately addresses multiple sources of uncertainty inherent in the spatial prediction of C stock in disturbed plantation ecosystems. It is evident from the results of this study that carbon reporting and monitoring can always be improved by scouting for improved and easily accessible remote sensing data and allow forest practitioners to keep track of error across space in resource environments of interest.

TI  - Reconstruction of post-little ice age glacier recession in the Lahaul Himalaya, north-west India
T2  - GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Understanding past glaciation and deglaciation is vital for assessing present-day glacier dynamics and response to climate change. We focus on reconstructing past glacier fluctuations in Lahaul, north-west India, a region located between arid Ladakh and the humid the Pir-Panjal range. We focus specifically on six glaciers in the Miyar and Thirot catchments of varying size, aspect and debris cover. To reconstruct past terminus fluctuations of these glaciers, we used repeat terrestrial photography and historical archives as data sets and mapped the terminus positions and latero-terminal moraines in the field along with glacier terminus mapping from high to medium resolution satellite images (e.g. Corona, Hexagon, Landsat and LISS IV). Results show that since the little ice age, all the studied glaciers have experienced terminus retreat and area loss, with average values of 1.46 and 0.9 km(2), respectively. Precipitation data show a statistically significant decreasing trend during the last century with an increasing trend in annual average maximum (T-max) and minimum (T-min) temperature. This warming trend is more statistically significant for T-min. Although total ice loss at the six studied glaciers is considerable (5.48 km(2)), this varies both spatially (i.e. from glacier to glacier) and temporally. We attribute this variability to topographic controls such as glacier hypsometry and another non-climatic factor, i.e. varying degree of debris cover.

TI  - Salinity variation modulates cellular stress response to ZnO nanoparticles in a sentinel marine bivalve, the blue mussel<i> Mytilus</i><i> sp.</i>
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles are released into marine environments from industrial, medical and consumer uses sparking concerns about their potential ecotoxicological effects. Ecological hazard assessment of nZnO in marine ecosystems is hindered by the lack of understanding of the potential interactive effects of nZnO toxicity with other common abiotic stressors, such as salinity fluctuations, in marine organisms. To close this gap in our knowledge, we carried out a comprehensive biomarker-based assessment of the combined effects of salinity and nZnO in a sentinel marine bivalve, the blue mussels Mytilus edulis. The mussels were exposed for 21 days to clean seawater (control), an environmentally relevant concentration (100 mu g Zn l- 1) of nZnO or dissolved Zn (to identify the toxic effects attributable to Zn2+ toxicity) under the normal (15), low (5) and fluctuating (5-15) salinity regimes. The selected molecular and biochemical markers focused on the oxidative stress, apoptosis, detoxification system and inflammation in the gills and the digestive gland of the mussels. Biomarker analysis showed different effects of nZnO and dissolved Zn on biomarkers of oxidative stress, xenobiotic detoxification and apoptosis but similar effects of both pollutants on the levels of metallothioneins and inflammatory markers. Exposure to nZnO led to elevated levels of lipid peroxidation, upregulation of p53 and p38 stress kinases and apoptosis-related genes, most notably in the gills. Exposure to dissolved Zn led to accumulation of protein carbonyls and activated redox-sensitive detoxification enzymes (NADPH-P450 reductase and glutathione-S-transferase) in the mussels. The ambient salinity had significant effects the cellular adverse effects of nZnO in the mussels. The nZnO-induced cellular stress was detectable under the normal (15) and fluctuating (5-15) salinity conditions in the studied brackish water population of the mussels. At low salinity (5), nZnO toxicity signal was almost completely dampened. These findings indicate that chronic osmotic stress close to the toler-ance limits of M. edulis prevails over the effects of the environmentally relevant nZnO and dissolved Zn con-centrations in combined exposures. These stressor interactions might ameliorate the cellular toxicity of nZnO in the mussels but limit applicability of cellular stress biomarkers for detecting the toxic effects of nanopollutants in low salinity habitats.

AB  - Objective: Lung sentinel lymph node mapping, where peritumorally injected mate-rial is tracked through the lymphatics, aims to find the first potential sites of nodal metastasis. We sought to evaluate the preclinical feasibility of bronchoscopic fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node mapping.Methods: Healthy Yorkshire pigs were used; sentinel lymph node mapping was per-formed with indocyanine green. The primary fluorescence imaging method was an ultrathin composite fiberscope placed in the bronchoscope working channel. Secondary methods used a fluorescence thoracoscope placed in the trachea (rigid bronchoscopy) and pretracheal fascial plane (mediastinoscopy) to validate ultrathin composite fiberscope settings for sentinel lymph node detection. A tracheostomy was created, and the pig was placed in a lateral decubitus position. Transbronchial intraparenchymal indocyanine green injection was performed primarily in the right lower lobe. Ultrathin composite fiberscope and rigid bron-choscopy were performed with (n = 6) or without (n = 2) mediastinoscopy, with the former group guiding dose and ultrathin composite fiberscope optimization. Fluorescent targets were interrogated by endobronchial ultrasound before ultrathin composite fiberscope-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Specimen fluorescence was documented before creating cytological smears. Pigs were killed postprocedure for nodal dissection.Results: A total of 100 mL of 10 mg/mL indocyanine green generated strong transbronchial fluorescence with low risk of indocyanine green contamination. Fluorescence was detectable by 10 minutes postinjection. There was concordance among ultrathin composite fiberscope, rigid bronchoscopy, and mediastinoscopy. Except for 1 pig with airway contamination, ultrathin composite fiberscope- guided endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration obtained fluorescent material in all pigs. Specimen fluorescence was associated with specimen adequacy.Conclusions: Bronchoscopic fluorescence-guided sentinel lymph node mapping was feasible, with specimen fluorescence providing real-time feedback on sentinel lymph node biopsy success. If translated to clinical practice, attention must be paid to minimizing indocyanine green leakage. (J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2023;165:337-50)

M3  - Article
AB  - Many deep learning approaches make extensive use of backbone networks pretrained on large datasets like ImageNet, which are then fine-tuned. In remote sensing, the lack of comparable large annotated datasets and the diversity of sensing platforms impedes similar developments. In order to contribute towards the availability of pretrained backbone networks in remote sensing, we devise a self-supervised approach for pretraining deep neural networks. By exploiting the correspondence between co-located imagery and audio recordings, this is done completely label-free, without the need for manual annotation. For this purpose, we introduce the SoundingEarth dataset, which consists of co-located aerial imagery and crowd-sourced audio samples all around the world. Using this dataset, we then pretrain ResNet models to map samples from both modalities into a common embedding space, encouraging the models to understand key properties of a scene that influence both visual and auditory appearance. To validate the usefulness of the proposed approach, we evaluate the transfer learning performance of pretrained weights obtained against weights obtained through other means. By fine-tuning the models on a number of commonly used remote sensing datasets, we show that our approach outperforms existing pretraining strategies for remote sensing imagery. The dataset, code and pretrained model weights are available at https://github.com/khdlr/SoundingEarth.

TI  - Effect of land use change on carbon stocks in an agricultural region of southern Benin
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change is one of the most important determinants of carbon storage and dynamics in ecosystems. Areas in the proximity of metropoles undergo land use changes but are poorly studied for their soil and biomass carbon budget, especially in Africa. Close to Benin's economic capital, the Lama Territory located on the Allada Plateau and is subject to high demographic and urbanization pressures. Carbon (C) stocks in the region are likely to be rapidly changing. This research assessed the land use changes and quantified the spatial distribution and variation of C stocks between 2000 and 2018 on the Ferralsols of the study area. Random forest models using spectral bands of LANDSAT images and some spectral indices as predictors were calibrated to classify the land use. C stocks of four C pools (aboveground, belowground biomass, litter, and soil) were mapped with InVEST (integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs) model. Land use change occurred in 61% of the Ferralsol area between 2000 and 2018. The surface of forests and crop-plantation associations decreased in benefit of tree plantations, adult palm groves, and built-up areas. With the loss of forest surface and the increasing urbanization, C stocks of the region decreased by -218 Gg C with 4% uncertainty (-175 Gg C in soil pools, and - 125 Gg C in aboveground biomass with both 6% uncertainty) between 2000 and 2018. Results highlight: (i) the need for soil C stock accounting to avoid underestimation of C stocks evolution in a rural region; and (ii) the relevance of tree plantations and deforestation control to maintain the C stocks in tropical areas.

TI  - Long-term survival in patients with node-positive breast cancer who undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: meta-analysis
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that, in patients who are initially node-positive before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and achieve a clinical/radiological complete response, sentinel lymph node biopsy alone is oncologically safe with excellent 5-year disease-free and overall survival.Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in patients with breast cancer who are initially node-positive but convert to clinically/radiologically node-negative remains controversial. The primary aim was to assess pooled 5-year disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival for patients who are initially node-positive but have a negative SLNB after NACT, and do not proceed to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Methods The study was performed using PRISMA guidelines. A systematic literature search of relevant databases was conducted. The Der Simonian-Laird and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel methods were used to calculate weighted pooled estimates for OS and DFS for this group compared with patients who had NACT and proceeded to ALND after a negative or positive SLNB. Results Seven studies involving 915 patients who had a negative SLNB after NACT were included. Pooled estimates of 5-year DFS and OS in patients with a negative SLNB after NACT were 86 (95 per cent c.i. 82.1 to 90.3) and 93.1 (87.8 to 97.0) per cent respectively. Patients with a positive SLNB who underwent ALND had reduced 5-year DFS (OR 0.49, 95 per cent c.i. 0.35 to 0.69; P < 0.001) and OS (OR 0.41, 0.16 to 1.02; P = 0.06) compared with those who had a negative SLNB after NACT. There were no differences in DFS for patients who had a negative SLNB only compared with those undergoing ALND with a pCR (OR 1.65, 0.71 to 3.79; P = 0.24). Conclusion Patients who are initially node-positive and who achieve a complete clinical/radiological axillary response after NACT with a subsequent negative SLNB have high rates of DFS and OS after 5 years. Patients with residual disease have significantly reduced DFS and further axillary treatment may still be warranted.

TI  - Advances in multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing of mangrove species: A synthesis and study case on airborne and multisource spaceborne imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study summarizes the advances in mangrove species mapping based on multispectral and hyperspectral imagery achieved over the last decade. The influence of species diversity and sensor specifications on the per-formances of various classification approaches are discussed. Based on the limitations of previous approaches, we propose a novel framework to map mangrove species at medium, high, and very-high spatial resolution using multispectral and hyperspectral images. The framework relies on a multitask convolutional neural network to achieve accurate classification at pixel and object (i.e. individual tree crown) level. It was successfully applied to the most comprehensive dataset of optical imagery ever collected over a mangrove forest, achieving accurate mapping of species on airborne (OA = 95 %, Kappa = 0.93) and spaceborne imagery (OA and Kappa up to 97 % and 0.95, respectively), including the newly-operating hyperspectral DESIS and PRISMA instruments. This study brings new insights into the role of spatial and spectral resolutions in mangrove species classification, particu-larly the importance of short-wave infrared bands. Multispectral imagery performs well at very-high to high resolutions (up to 10-20 m) but suffers from the lack of spectral information at medium resolution (30 m). Hyperspectral imagery provided the best results at sub-metric resolution (0.5 m) and satisfactory results at 30-m resolution (OA >= 85), and could benefit from implementing spectral unmixing in the latter case. Given the increasing attention accorded to mangroves, remote sensing will undoubtedly become an essential tool to monitor the diversity of these endangered ecosystems in the future. In that respect, efforts should concentrate on evaluating the capabilities of new and upcoming instruments and multisource data combination to improve mangrove species mapping and, more broadly, to meet conservation goals.

AB  - Killer whales (Orcinus orca) have been deemed one of the most contaminated cetacean species in the world. However, concentrations and potential health implications of selected 'contaminants of emerging concern' (CECs) and new persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in endangered Southern Resident and threatened Bigg's (Transient) killer whales in the Northeastern Pacific (NEP) have not yet been documented. Here, we quantify CECs [alkylphenols (APs), triclosan, methyl triclosan, and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)] and new POPs [hexabromocyclododecane (HBCCD), PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS] in skeletal muscle and liver samples of these sentinel species and investigate in utero transfer of these contaminants. Samples were collected from necropsied individuals from 2006 to 2018 and analyzed by LC- MS/MS or HRBC/HRMS. AP and PFAS contaminants were the most prevalent compounds; 4-nonylphenol (4NP) was the predominant AP (median 40.84 ng/g ww), and interestingly, 7:3-fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (7:3 FTCA) was the primary PFAS (median 66.35 ng/g ww). Maternal transfer ratios indicated 4NP as the most transferred contaminant from the dam to the fetus, with maternal transfer rates as high as 95.1%. Although too few killer whales have been screened for CECs and new POPs to infer the magnitude of contamination impact, these results raise concerns regarding pathological implications and potential impacts on fetal development and production of a viable neonate. This study outlines CEC and new POP concentrations in killer whales of the NEP and provides scientifically derived evidence to support and inform regulation to mitigate pollutant sources and contamination of Southern Resident killer whale critical habitat and other marine ecosystems.

TI  - Mapping Plant Bioaccumulation Potentials of Pesticides from Soil Using Satellite-Based Canopy Transpiration Rates
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The transpiration rate is an important factor that determines the bioaccumulation potential of pesticides from soil and can present a spatiotemporal pattern. In the present study, we proposed a satellite-based approach to map the bioaccumulation potential of pesticides from soil using the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM). In the proposed model, the spatiotemporal variable (i.e., plant transpiration rate) was separately analyzed from the plant- and chemical-specific variables. The simulated bioaccumulation factors (BAFs; steady-state concentration ratios between plants and soil) of atrazine and lindane for the United States indicated that the proposed model can better predict the spatiotemporal pattern of bioaccumulation potentials of pesticides from soil than a previous weather-based model. The proposed approach using GLEAM's satellite data avoids the overestimation of plant transpiration rate in regions with a dry and warm climate. The comparison of BAFs between the proposed and weather-based models indicated that the satellite-based simulation was consistent with the weather-based simulation for most states and was more effective for the southwest region. Furthermore, plant- and chemical-specific variables were simulated for over 700 pesticides, which could be multiplied by satellite-based canopy transpiration rates to map the bioaccumulation potentials of chemicals from soil. Further evaluation of plant-specific variables, partitioning behaviors of ionizable compounds, and multiple uptake routes (e.g., airborne residue deposition) will aid in the evaluation of the spatiotemporal patterns of pesticide BAFs in plants in future research.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound after neoadjuvant therapy reduces the false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with cytologically node-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This study aimed to determine whether post-neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) axillary ultrasound (AUS) could reduce the false-negative rate (FNR) of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). We also performed subgroup analyses to identify the appropriate patient for SLNB.Methods A total of 220 patients with cytologically proven axillary node-positive breast cancer who underwent both SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after NAT were included. We calculated the FNR of SLNB. In the case of post-NAT AUS results available, AUS was classified as negative or positive. Then the FNR of post-NAT AUS combined with SLNB was evaluated. Subgroup analyses based on the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed, molecular subtypes, and the clinical N stage were also performed.Results The overall axillary lymph node pathological complete response rate was 45.5% (100/220). The FNR of SLNB alone was 15.8% (95%CI: 9.2 to 22.5%). Post-NAT AUS results were available for 181 patients. When combined negative post-NAT AUS results and SLNB, the FNR was reduced to 7.5% (95%CI: 2.4 to 12.7%). Subgroup analyses of the FNR for SLNB alone and negative post-NAT AUS combined with SLNB were shown as follows: in cases patients with less than three sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and at least three SLNs removed, the FNR was decreased from 24.5 to 13.2%, and 9.0 to 5.0%, respectively. The FNR was decreased from 20.8 to 10.5% in HR+/HER2+subgroup, 21.4 to 16.7% in HR-/HER2+subgroup, 15.9 to 7.0% in HR+/HER2- subgroup, and 0% in HR-/HER2- subgroup, respectively. For cN1 patients, the FNR was decreased from 18.1 to 12.1% while 17.1 to 3.6% for cN2 patients and 0% for cN3 patients.Conclusion Using negative post-NAT AUS may help to decrease the FNR and improve patient selection for SLNB.

TI  - Dynamical changes of land use/land cover and their impacts on ecological quality during China's reform periods: A case study of Quanzhou city, China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth of China's economy has greatly accelerated the process of urbanization during China's reform periods. Urbanization has significantly caused land use and land cover (LULC) changes and thus has impacts on the local climate and ecosystem. This study chooses Quanzhou, a fast-developing city of southeast China, as an example to detect and quantify the LULC and ecological changes from 1989 to 2018 by using the remotely sensed technique. The LULC of Quanzhou was derived from the four Landsat images taken in 1989, 1999, 2007 and 2018, and the land-use-degree ratio index and land-use-change method were used to estimate the change of land use. The remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) was used to detect the ecological changes of the city. The built-up land expansion intensity and annual built-up land expansion rate were carried out for seven districts of Quanzhou. The results show that the urban area of Quanzhou has drastically grown by 192.99 km(2) at the expense of forest, water, and cropland land during the 1989 similar to 2018 period. Moreover, the built-up land of seven districts had expanded at the average rate of 0.027 similar to 0.154 per year and the built-up expansion intensity was higher than 0.59. The average RSEI value of Quanzhou city dropped from 0.78 in 1989 to 0.34 in 2018, which suggested an overall decline in ecological quality. The proportion of areas with an RSEI rating good decreased from 30.84% to 11.52% while the proportion of areas with rating bad increased from 4.73% to 19.11% during the past 29 years. This study has shown the built-up land expansion intensity is negatively correlated with the ecological quality change, and the increase in built-up land can greatly accelerate the decline of the ecological quality. Government policies play a profound impact on land use changes, urbanization and eco-environment changes. Therefore, the policy decision-makers should take enough action and consider integrating the concept of ecology to enable the healthy and sustainable development of the city.

TI  - Design and rationale for the prospective treatment efficacy in IPF using genotype for NAC selection (PRECISIONS) clinical trial
T2  - BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive lung disease with few treatment options. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a well-tolerated, inexpensive treatment with antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)-sponsored PANTHER (Prednisone Azathioprine and NAC therapy in IPF) trial confirmed the harmful effects of immunosuppression in IPF, and did not show a benefit to treatment with NAC. However, a post hoc analysis revealed a potential beneficial effect of NAC in a subgroup of individuals carrying a specific genetic variant, TOLLIP rs3750920 TT genotype, present in about 25% of patients with IPF. Here, we present the design and rationale for the Phase III, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Prospective Treatment Efficacy in IPF Using Genotype for NAC Selection (PRECISIONS) clinical trial. Methods: The PRECISIONS trial will randomize 200 patients with IPF and the TOLLIP rs3750920 TT genotype 1:1 to oral N-acetylcysteine (600 mg tablets taken three times a day) or placebo for a 24-month duration. The primary endpoint is the composite of time to 10% relative decline in forced vital capacity (FVC), first respiratory hospitalization, lung transplantation, or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints include change in patient-reported outcome scores and proportion of participants with treatment-emergent adverse events. Biospecimens, including blood, buccal, and fecal will be collected longitudinally for future research purposes. Study participants will be offered enrollment in a home spirometry substudy, which explores time to 10% relative FVC decline measured at home, and its comparison with study visit FVC. Discussion: The sentinel observation of a potential pharmacogenetic interaction between NAC and TOLLIP polymorphism highlights the urgent, unmet need for better, molecularly focused, and precise therapeutic strategies in IPF. The PRECISIONS clinical trial is the first study to use molecularly-focused techniques to identify patients with IPF most likely to benefit from treatment. PRECISIONS has the potential to shift the paradigm in how trials in this condition are designed and executed, and is the first step toward personalized medicine for patients with IPF.

TI  - Measuring the orbit shrinkage rate of hot Jupiters due to tides
T2  - ASTRONOMY & ASTROPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. A tidal interaction between a star and a close-in exoplanet leads to shrinkage of the planetary orbit and eventual tidal dis- ruption of the planet. Measuring the shrinkage of the orbits will allow for the tidal quality parameter of the star (Q(?)(')) to be measured, which is an important parameter to obtain information about stellar interiors. Aims. We analyse data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) for two targets known to host close-in hot Jupiters, which have significant data available and are expected to have a fast decay: WASP-18 and WASP-19. We aim to measure the current limits on orbital period variation and provide new constrains on Q(?)(') for our targets. Methods. We modelled the transit shape using all the available TESS observations and fitted the individual transit times of each tran- sit. We used previously published transit times together with our results to fit two models, a constant period model, and a quadratic orbital decay model, using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Results. We obtain new constrains on Q(?)(') for both targets and improve the precision of the known planet parameters with the newest observations from TESS. We find period change rates of (-0.11 +/- 0.21) x 10(-10) for WASP-18b and (-0.35 +/- 0.22) x 10(-10) for WASP-19b and we do not find significant evidence of orbital decay in these targets. We obtain new lower limits for Q(?)(') of (1.42 +/- 0.34) x 10(7) in WASP-18 and (1.26 +/- 0.10) x 10(6) in WASP-19, corresponding to upper limits of the orbital decay rate of -0.45 x 10(-10) and -0.71 x 10(-10), respectively, with a 95% confidence level. We compare our results with other relevant targets for tidal decay studies. Conclusions. We find that the orbital decay rate in both WASP-18b and WASP-19b appears to be smaller than the measured orbital decay of WASP-12b. We show that the minimum value of Q(?)(') in WASP-18 is two orders of magnitude higher than that of WASP-12, while WASP-19 has a minimum value one order of magnitude higher, which is consistent with other similar targets. Further observations are required to constrain the orbital decay of WASP-18 and WASP-19.

TI  - Identification of crustal deformation in the Saurashtra region, western India: insights from PSI and GNSS derived investigation
T2  - ACTA GEODAETICA ET GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) techniques were used to identify the deformation rates in the Saurashtra region, western India. A sizable number of mild to severe earthquakes (with up to M5.1) have been observed in this part of the Indian plate. In order to calculate the crustal deformation, 241 Sentinel 1A images of path 107 with frame numbers 518 and 523, acquired between 2017 and 2020, were used. Similarly, processing of the GNSS dataset was done for four sites between 2009 and 2020. The foremost geodetic results from Saurashtra indicate the existence of a significant amount of deformation. PSI results show movements towards the satellite line of sight (LOS) of up to 5.0 & PLUSMN; 2.0 mm/year at several places and GNSS results indicate horizontal movements of less than 1.0 & PLUSMN; 0.4 mm/year and vertical movements of up to 2.3 & PLUSMN; 0.5 mm/year in the Saurashtra region. The projected LOS displacement of the GNSS is closely comparable with the PSI derived displacement. The results highlight isolated deformation pockets in various parts of the study area. Further, two loci with significant linear displacement were observed in south and east Saurashtra. Considering the seismic activity of the region, the inferred deformation rates may pose increased seismic risk for the region.

TI  - Pseudo global warming experiment of flood inundation in the upper White Volta River, Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study area: Upper White Volta RiverStudy focus: Hydro-meteorological inundation models were applied to simulate an extreme river flood that occurred in the upper White Volta River in September of 2020. The predicted inundation area was in good agreement with the flood area estimated by Sentinel-1A SAR. In addition, pseudo global warming (PGW) simulations using the SSP5-8.5 (Shared Socio-economic Pathway 5-8.5) scenario according to IPCC AR6 were conducted to evaluate the extreme rainfall and associated inundation area under warmer environmental conditions.New hydrological insights for the region: As a result of simulations, the average future rainfall intensity is likely to increase mainly due to higher relative humidity in the regional atmosphere. Associated with these changes, it is likely that the extent of the ensemble average future expected flooded area in the upper White Volta River could slightly increase by 1.04 times under the PGW conditions, compared with present climate conditions. The result of this study implies that floods in the upper White Volta River have the potential of becoming more severe under the most extreme future global warming scenarios.

TI  - A suitable method for alpine wetland delineation: An example for the headwater area of the yellow river, Tibetan Plateau
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine wetlands are one of the most important ecosystems in the Three Rivers Source Area, China, which plays an important role in regulating the regional hydrological cycle and carbon cycle. Accordingly, Wetland area and its distribution are of great significance for wetland management and scientific research. In our study, a new wetland classification model which based on geomorphological types and combine object-oriented and decision tree classification model (ODTC), and used a new wetland classification system to accurately extract the wetland distributed in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR) of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), China. The object-oriented method was first used to segment the image into several areas according to similarity in Pixels and Textures, and then the wetland was extracted through a decision tree constructed based on geomorphological types. The wetland extracted by the model was compared with that by other seven commonly methods, such as support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), and it proved the accuracy was improved by 10%-20%. The overall classification accuracy rate was 98.9%. According to our results, the HAYR's wetland area is 3142.3 km(2), accounting for 16.1% of the study area. Marsh wetlands and flood wetlands accounted for 37.7% and 16.7% respectively. A three-dimensional map of the area showed that alpine wetlands in the research region are distributed around lakes, piedmont groundwater overflow belts, and inter-mountain catchment basin. This phenomenon demonstrates that hydrogeological circumstances influence alpine wetlands' genesis and evolution. This work provides a new approach to investigating alpine wetlands.

TI  - Detecting and quantifying methane emissions from oil and gas production: algorithm development with ground-truth calibration based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 satellite imagery has been shown by studies to becapable of detecting and quantifying methane emissions from oil and gasproduction. However, current methods lack performance calibration withground-truth testing. This study developed a multi-band-multi-pass-multi-comparison-date methane retrieval algorithm that enhances Sentinel-2 sensitivity to methane plumes. The method was calibratedusing data from a large-scale controlled-release test in Ehrenberg, Arizona,in fall 2021, with three algorithm parameters tuned based on the trueemission rates. Tuned parameters are the pixel-level concentration upper-bound threshold during extreme value removal, the number of comparisondates, and the pixel-level methane concentration percentage threshold whendetermining the spatial extent of a plume. We found that a low value of theupper-bound threshold during extreme value removal can result in falsenegatives. A high number of comparison dates helps enhance the algorithmsensitivity to the plumes in the target date, but values in excess of12 d are neither necessary nor computationally efficient. A high percentagethreshold when determining the spatial extent of a plume helps enhance thequantification accuracy, but it may harm the yes/no detection accuracy. Wefound that there is a trade-off between quantification accuracy anddetection accuracy. In a scenario with the highest quantification accuracy,we achieved the lowest quantification error and had zero false-positivedetections; however, the algorithm missed three true plumes, which reduced theyes/no detection accuracy. In contrast, all of the true plumes weredetected in the highest detection accuracy scenario, but the emission ratequantification had higher errors. We illustrated a two-step method thatupdates the emission rate estimates in an interim step, which improvesquantification accuracy while keeping high yes/no detection accuracy. Wealso validated the algorithm's ability to detect true positives and truenegatives in two application studies.

TI  - Prediction of deep soil water content (0-5 m) with in-situ and remote sensing data
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely evaluation of soil water content (SWC) in water-limited arid and semiarid regions will provide an essential reference for scientifically based water management strategies and vegetation restoration practices. Theoretical and empirical models based on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer (1-5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013-2016), pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0-5 m profile were developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, soil surface temper-ature, total shortwave broadband albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For different combinations of input pa-rameters, the introduction of in-situ factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error symbolscript 0.039, R2 symbolscript 0.697, mean absolute percentage symbolscript 24.8) and is thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction.

TI  - Derivation and external validation of dendritic cell-related gene signatures for predicting prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in bladder urothelial carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn the regulation of tumor-related immunity, dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial sentinel cells; they are powerful to present antigens and initiate immune responses. Therefore, we concentrated on investigating the DC-related gene profile, prognosis, and gene mutations in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) patients to identify sensitivity to immunotherapy of patients. MethodsAccording to DC infiltration, BLCA patients were divided into two subgroups, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. Patients were classified by unsupervised clustering into new subgroups. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and Cox regression were used to develop a DC-related risk model. CIBERSORT, xCell, and GSEA were used to infer immune cells' relative abundance separately and enriched immune pathways. ResultsA total of 29 prognosis-related DEGs were identified from the unsupervised cluster. Among them, 22 genes were selected for constructing the DC-related risk model. The dendritic cell-related risk score (DCRS) can accurately distinguish patients with different sensitive responses to immunotherapy and overall survival outcomes. Furthermore, patients with ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2) mutation had a better prognosis. ConclusionsThe DCRS played an essential part in immunity pathway and formation of TME diversity.

TI  - Prevention of lymphoedema after axillary clearance by external compression sleeves PLACE randomised trial results. Effects of high BMI
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Around 25% of women undergoing Axillary Clearance (ANC) develop lymphedema (LE). Intervention with a compression garment is recommended to prevent LE but no randomised evidence exists to support this strategy. MethodsA randomised trial tested standard management versus application of graduated compression garments (20-24 mmHg) to affected arm, for 1 year. Women with node positive breast cancer (n = 1300) undergoing ANC consented to arm volume measurements and those developing a 4-9% relative arm volume increase (RAVI) (subclinical LE) within 9 months post-surgery were randomised. Primary outcome was proportion of patients developing LE (RAVI > 10%) by 24-months in each group. Secondary endpoints included Quality of life in each group. ResultsIn total 143 patients were randomised (74 no sleeve: 69 compression sleeve) between October 2010 and November 2015. The lymphoedema rate at 24 months in the 'no sleeve' group was at 41%, similar to the 'sleeve' group (30%: p = 0.32). Thirtytwo patients randomised to the 'no sleeve' group had a sleeve applied within 24 months. Body Mass Index (BMI) at randomisation predicted LE at any time point HR 1.04 (CI 1.01-1.08; p = 0.01). Patients with obesity (BMI > 30) had higher rates of LE in both groups (46%) compared to those with BMI < 30 (24%). No difference between patients was found in either group in changes in QoL. Compression sleeves applied after development of LE improved QoL scores (FACT-B p = 0.007:TOI p = 0.042). ConclusionEarly intervention with External Compression garments does not prevent clinical LE, particularly in women with a high BMI > 30. The use of prophylactic garments in subclinical LE (RAVI < 9%) is unwarranted.

TI  - Characterisation of deposited dust particles on Mars insight lander Instrument Context Camera (ICC) lens
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ubiquitous dust in the Martian environment plays a key role in its weather and climate: it must be taken into account in the interpretation of remote sensing data and observations, and could pose a potential risk to surface equipment and operations. In this study, we use observations retrieved by the Instrument Context Camera (ICC) onboard the InSight lander to evaluate the accumulation of dust on the camera lens and estimate the size of the deposited dust particles. Dust contamination is revealed as mottled pattern image artefacts on ICC observations. These were detected using a template matching blob detection algorithm and modelled with a first-order optical model to simulate their size and optical density as a function of the particle diameter. The results show a deep decay in the first 70 sols (LS = 295-337 degrees, MY34) during which dust particles deposited at landing were mostly removed. The subsequent gradual decrease and stable behaviour in the number of detected particles is only interrupted by accumulation and removal periods around sols 160 (LS similar to 23 degrees, MY35) and 800-1100 (LS = 9-150 degrees, MY36). The estimated particle sizes follow a similar trend, with deposited particles due to wind-driven forces (average diameter < 50 mu m) being smaller than the ones deposited by other forces during landing, with particles of up to 220 mu m of diameter. The results of this study provide an additional source of information for evaluating aeolian dust processes in Mars, with quantitative results on dust accumulation and removal activity, and may contribute to a better determination of dust entrainment threshold models by constraining susceptible dust particle sizes.

TI  - Intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics for predicting the sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer based on preoperative mammography and MRI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aims to investigate values of intra- and peri-tumoral regions in the mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image for prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in invasive breast cancer (BC). MethodsThis study included 208 patients with invasive BC between Spe. 2017 and Apr. 2021. All patients underwent preoperative digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) scans. Radiomics features were extracted from manually outlined intratumoral regions, and automatically dilated peritumoral tumor regions in each modality. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select key features from each region to develop radiomics signatures (RSs). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to evaluate performance of the RSs. ResultsIntra- and peri-tumoral regions of BC can provide complementary information on the SLN status. In each modality, the Com-RSs derived from combined intra- and peri-tumoral regions always yielded higher AUCs than the Intra-RSs or Peri-RSs. A total of 10 and 11 features were identified as the most important predictors from mammography (DM plus DBT) and MRI (DCE-MRI plus DWI), respectively. The DCE-MRI plus DWI generated higher AUCs compared with DM plus DBT in the training (AUCs, DCE-MRI plus DWI vs. DM plus DBT, 0.897 vs. 0.846) and validation (AUCs, DCE-MRI plus DWI vs. DM plus DBT, 0.826 vs. 0.786) cohort. ConclusionsRadiomics features from intra- and peri-tumoral regions can provide complementary information to identify the SLNM in both mammography and MRI. The DCE-MRI plus DWI generated lower specificity, but higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity and negative predictive value compared with DM plus DBT.

TI  - Spatial simulations of soil content, storage, and quality indices in an archipelago off the Yangtze River Estuary, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Comprehensively revealing the spatial pattern of soil condition is vital for exploring the evolution mechanism of island ecosystem and providing reference for ecological maintenance. However, it is difficult to meet the de-mands of comprehensiveness and accuracy in mapping the soil condition in an archipelago that contains remote islands. Such an archipelago, namely, Shengsi Archipelago off the Yangtze River Estuary, China, was selected as the study area. Field survey was conducted on part of islands that have relatively high accessibility in the ar-chipelago, and remote sensing data that cover the entire study area was adopted. An island soil index system, including soil content, storage, and quality indices, was proposed to represent the island soil integrated condi-tion. Soil content indices are original soil measured data, and soil storage and quality indices are composite indices that are determined based on soil content indices. Then, a predictor system based on remote sensing and the 10-fold cross-validation were used to conduct the spatial simulations of soil indices. The results validated that the combination of soil measured data sourced by field survey could respond more sensitively to remote sensing data and integrate with it better than the original soil measured data, thereby increasing the simulation accu-racies of soil storage and quality indices to higher levels than the corresponding soil content indices and achieving the spatial exhibition of soil integrated condition. The spatial pattern of soil indices in Shengsi Ar-chipelago indicated that islands or areas with good vegetation condition but low soil salinity, land surface aridity, and human interference generally had good soil integrated condition. Then, suggestions to improve the island soil integrated condition were proposed from perspectives of different essential components of the island ecosystem. The study has provided a practical method for comprehensively mapping the soil condition in areas with low accessibility.

TI  - The impact of Hyssop (<i>Hyssopus officinalis</i>) extract on activation of endosomal toll like receptors and their downstream signaling pathways
T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: From the ancient, medicinal benefits of Hyssop (Hyssopus officinalis L.) have been implicated for respiratory and digestive diseases despite the effects of Hyssop on viral infections have not been mechanistically investigated. In this study, we examined whether the Hyssop extract activated anti-viral innate immunity, as a sentinel for immune system, through activation of endosomal TLRs recognizing nucleic acids and their downstream signaling. The Hyssop herb extracts was prepared and co-cultured with healthy individual's peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). After viability assay, gene expression levels of TLR3,7,8,9, as well as MyD88 and NF-kappa B, were evaluated in treated PBMCs using Real-time PCR. Next, the secretion level of immune related cytokines was quantified via ELISA. Results: Post 24 h, 40 mu g/ml of the extract significantly inhibited the viability of less than 50% of cells compared to the control and had a maximum effect on cellular function. The Hyssop-treated PBMCs demonstrated an elevated expression of endosomal TLRs genes, as well as MyD88 and NF-kappa B. Moreover, the release of INF-alpha and beta notably enhanced in cell culture supernatant, while the content of inflammatory cytokines remarkably diminished (P < 0.05). The Hyssop extract was capable of inducing antiviral innate immune responses so can be promising in antiviral drug strategies.

TI  - Recent increase in the detection of human parainfluenza virus during the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic in the Republic of Korea
T2  - VIROLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since the onset of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the prevalence of respiratory infectious diseases, particularly, the flu epidemic, has considerably decreased. The low detection rate and decreased number of specimens have hindered the implementation of the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Viruses Surveillance System (KINRESS), a sentinel surveillance system. Most patients with influenza-like illness visit the COVID-19 screening clinic; therefore, the number of samples collected in sentinel surveillance has decreased by more than 50%. Thus, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency supplemented sentinel surveillance with non-sentinel surveillance by private medical diagnostic centers. We report here a delayed and unprecedented high detection of human parainfluenza virus (hPIV) in the Republic of Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic through sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance. We also examined the causes and implications of the changes in prevalence of hPIV.l Methods: We collected data for 56,984 and 257,217 samples obtained through sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance, respectively. Eight viruses were confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR. Some specimens from the sentinel surveillance were used for genetic characterization of hPIV type 3. Results: In 2020, hPIV was rarely detected; however, it was detected in August 2021. The detection rate continued to increase considerably in September and reached over 70% in October, 2021. The detection rate of hPIV3 was significantly higher in infants and preschoolers aged 0-6 years in both sentinel and non-sentinel surveillance. Detection of hPIV was delayed in metropolitan areas compared to that in suburban regions. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase sequences of hPIV3 generated in 2021 were not distinct from those detected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The operation of non-sentinel and sentinel surveillance to monitor respiratory viruses could sensitively detect an unprecedented revival of hPIV in the Republic of Korea during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Neonatal outcome of infants with umbilical cord arterial pH less than 7
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionUmbilical arterial pH of less than 7 is often used as the threshold below which the risks of neonatal death and adverse long-term neurological outcomes are considered to be higher. Yet within the group with pH <7, the risks have not been further stratified. Here, we aimed to investigate the predictors of adverse long-term outcomes of this group of infants. Material and methodsThis was a retrospective study of 248 infants born after 34 weeks of gestation in a tertiary obstetric unit, between 2003 and 2017, with cord arterial pH <7 or base excess <=-12 mmol/L at birth. The infants were categorized into two groups: (1) intact survivors, or (2) neonatal/infant deaths or cerebral palsy or developmental delay. The umbilical arterial pH and base excess levels, Apgar scores, mode of delivery, gestational age, small for gestational age, birth in the era before the implementation of neonatal hypothermic therapy, and the presence of a known sentinel event, were compared between the groups using univariate analysis followed by multivariate analysis. ResultsAmong the 248 infants, there were 222 intact survivors (89.5%) and 26 infants with poor outcomes (10.5%), including eight deaths (3.2%) and 18 (7.3%) with cerebral palsy and/or developmental delay. Univariate analysis showed that infants with adverse outcomes had significantly lower cord arterial pH (6.85 vs. 6.95, with p < 0.001), lower cord arterial base excess (-19.95 vs. -15.90 mmol/L, p < 0.001), a higher proportion of having AS at 5 min <7 (65.4% vs. 13.1%, p < 0.001), and a higher proportion of having a sentinel event (34.6% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis confirmed cord arterial pH of <6.9 and an Apgar score at 5 min <7 as independent prognostic factors (the adjusted odds ratios were 4.64 and 6.62, respectively). The risk of adverse outcome increased from 4.3% when the arterial pH was between 6.9 and <7, to 30% when the pH was <6.9. ConclusionsInfants born with umbilical artery pH <7 still have a high chance of 89.5% to become intact survivors. A cord arterial pH of <6.9 and an Apgar score at 5 min <7 are independent prognostic factors for neonatal/infant death or adverse long-term neurological outcomes.

TI  - Effect of landscape pattern changes and environmental indices on land surface temperature in a fragile ecosystem in southeastern Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and urbanization along with uncontrolled development in less developed countries have led to an increased ecosystems' thermal environment. Some factors such as environmental indices and landscape pattern changes can alter Land Surface Temperature (LST). Thus, the accurate evaluation of the relationship between these factors and LST is considered important for managing ecosystems, especially fragile ones under high stress. The southeast of Iran has witnessed many destructions in the environmental dimension in the past years. Moreover, this region has a low socio-economic situation, which increases the need to study in this region. In the present study, we used Landsat TM5 satellite images (1989), Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS ones (2019), and Google Earth Engine (GEE) system to prepare the maps of temporal-spatial LST changes, Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), and selected environmental indices including Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI), Built-up (NDBI), Water Indices (NDWI), Land Surface Moisture (LSM) and albedo. Then, the correlation levels of LST with the aforementioned indices were assessed by using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), as well as assessing LST variation following LULC change. In addition, the Moran index was used to analyze global and local spatial autocorrelation. The results represented an 8.67-degree increase in the mean LST during 1989-2019. Urban and built-up areas had a significant effect on increasing the temperature of the region. Additionally, water bodies and vegetation cover in the region were the most crucial parameters in LST reduction. All of the applied indices were strongly related to LST (>0.70), while some exhibited more correlation in each year. Further, the highest correlation of LST was observed with LSM and NDBI in 1989, as well as with NDVI and NDWI during 2019. In addition, the Moran index value reduced from 1989 to 2019 (from 0.93 to 0.89). Finally, the region rehabilitation based on sustainable development principles played an important role in the direct and indirect decrease in LST.

TI  - Real-world outcomes using PD-1 antibodies and BRAF plus MEK inhibitors for adjuvant melanoma treatment from 39 skin cancer centers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundProgrammed death-1 (PD-1) antibodies and BRAF + MEK inhibitors are widely used for adjuvant therapy of fully resected high-risk melanoma. Little is known about treatment efficacy outside of phase III trials. This real-world study reports on clinical outcomes of modern adjuvant melanoma treatment in specialized skin cancer centers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. MethodsMulticenter, retrospective study investigating stage III-IV melanoma patients receiving adjuvant nivolumab (NIV), pembrolizumab (PEM) or dabrafenib + trametinib (D + T) between 1/2017 and 10/2021. The primary endpoint was 12-month recurrence-free survival (RFS). Further analyses included descriptive and correlative statistics, and a multivariate linear-regression machine learning model to assess the risk of early melanoma recurrence. ResultsIn total, 1198 patients from 39 skin cancer centers from Germany, Austria and Switzerland were analysed. The vast majority received anti PD-1 therapies (n = 1003). Twelve-month RFS for anti PD-1 and BRAF + MEK inhibitor-treated patients were 78.1% and 86.5%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 1.998 [95% CI 1.335-2.991]; p = 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) in anti PD-1 (95.8%) and BRAF + MEK inhibitor (96.9%) treated patients (p > 0.05) during the median follow-up of 17 months. Data indicates that anti PD-1 treated patients who develop immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have lower recurrence rates compared to patients with no irAEs (HR 0.578 [95% CI 0.443-0.754], p = 0.001). BRAF mutation status did not affect overall efficacy of anti PD-1 treatment (p > 0.05). In both, anti PD-1 and BRAF + MEK inhibitor treated cohorts, data did not show any difference in 12-month RFS and 12-month OS comparing patients receiving total lymph node dissection (TLND) versus sentinel lymph node biopsy only (p > 0.05). The recurrence prediction model reached high specificity but only low sensitivity with an AUC = 0.65. No new safety signals were detected. Overall, recorded numbers and severity of adverse events were lower than reported in pivotal phase III trials. ConclusionsDespite recent advances in adjuvant melanoma treatment, early recurrence remains a significant clinical challenge. This study shows that TLND does not reduce the risk of early melanoma recurrence and should only be considered in selected patients. Data further highlight that variables collected during clinical routine are unlikely to allow for a clinically relevant prediction of individual recurrence risk.

TI  - Aggressive strains of the late wilt fungus of corn exist in Israel in mixed populations and can specialize in disrupting growth or plant health
T2  - FUNGAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize late wilt disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthiopsis maydis significantly damages crops in Israel and in other countries. Resistant maize cultivars are the preferred method for disease restraining. However, the pathogen populations of Spain and Egypt have varying aggressiveness, and virulent strains can overcome host resistance. In 2001 and from 2016 to-2019,17 M. maydis strains were isolated from infected maize fields in Israel. The isolates' effects on seed germination, plant development, and disease symptoms severity were evaluated. The isolates from Israel display a diverse degree of aggressiveness that is not linked to their geographic distribution. The virulent strains are found in mixed populations, whereas less virulent M. maydis isolates exist. Aggressive strains harmed the development of plants and ears and caused severe wilting and death. In contrast, plants inoculated with less virulent strains exhibited only mild dehydration signs, and crop yield was similar to that of the non-infected control. Interestingly, different host cultivars can evoke specific virulence of M. maydis strains. Moreover, some pathogen strains significantly repress plant development, while the impact of other strains was evi-denced by wilting symptoms. The current research further increases our understanding of the pathogen and our ability to control it.(c) 2022 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A super-ensemble approach to map land cover types with high resolution over data-sparse African savanna landscapes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely land cover products are critical inputs for landscape planning, and provide key information for biodiversity conservation and food security. However, poor mapping quality and low resolution are considerable issues in existing land cover maps over the African savanna, where land use is complex and changing rapidly, and necessary ground-truth data are sparse and hard to obtain. To overcome this problem, to make optimal use of existing maps, and to minimize manual training data collection, we developed a three-stage ensemble method to make land cover maps. In the first stage, we extracted the consensus of multiple existing land cover products to generate fragmented pixel-wise training labels. In the second stage, we translated pixel -wise training labels to image-wise labels using Random Forest (RF) as a "gap-filling model", with temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 time series, raw bands, and vegetation indices derived from PlanetScope basemaps. These image-wise labels were scored and edited by humans and the quality information was used in the next stage. For stage three, we trained a U-Net network based upon these image-wise labels, using Sentinel-1 time series and raw bands of PlanetScope basemaps as image features. Using the information on label quality, a quality-weighted loss function was used in the network to reduce the impact of noise in the training labels. Using Northern Tanzania as a case study, the results demonstrate that ensembles of existing land cover maps provide a useful source of data for developing improved land cover maps over hard-to-classify, data-sparse landscapes. The Random Forest "gap-filling model" had an overall accuracy of 80.26% on our independent test dataset with 7 classes. The final U-Net model had an overall accuracy of 83.57%. This approach can be readily applied to other regions and extents (e.g., regional, global) and other data sources (e.g., Sentinel-2).

TI  - Sentinel Node Identification with Hybrid Tracer-guided and Conventional Dynamic Sentinel Node Biopsy in Penile Cancer: A Prospective Study in 130 Patients from the Two National Referral Centres in Sweden
T2  - EUROPEAN UROLOGY ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies suggest that a hybrid indocyanine green (ICG)-99mTc-nanocolloid tracer improves sentinel node (SN) identification compared to conventional dynamic sentinel node biopsy (DSNB).Objective: To investigate hybrid tracer-guided SN identification in a multicentre setting and determine false-negative (FN) and complication rates.Design, setting, and participants: A total of 130 patients with penile cancer scheduled for DSNB were prospectively included between February 2016 and December 2017 at two national Swedish referral centres. ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid hybrid tracer was used in the standard DSNB protocol. Intervention: SNs were identified intraoperatively using radioguidance, fluorescence imaging, and blue dye.Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The number of SNs identified by each tracer and the rates of complications and nodal recurrence during median follow-up of 34 mo were recorded. Differences in proportions between groups were compared using v2 and McNemar's tests.Results and limitations: Overall, 453 SNs were identified preoperatively via singlephoton emission computed tomography/computed tomography. Among the 425 SNs excised, radioguidance, fluorescence, and blue dye identified 414 (97%), 363 (85%), and 349 (82%), respectively. Fluorescence imaging helped to detect six SNs that were negative using the other tracers, two of which were from the same patient and contained metastases. Histopathological examination detected 33 metastatic SNs in 20/130 patients (15%). The FN rate was 12% per groin (95% confidence interval 8-16%).

TI  - The sensitivity of maize evapotranspiration to vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture with lagged effects under extreme drought in Southwest China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is regulated by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and soil moisture (SM) which are expected to change in global climate change. Understanding the impacts of VPD and SM on maize ET is essential for global food security and water cycle. Here, we estimate the actual maize ET in Southwest China during 2001-2011 based on Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model using remote-sensing data and reanalysis data. Then, we define the extreme drought events in 2009-2011 using the smoothed standardized anomaly of the three-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) to investigate the responses of maize ET to VPD and SM during extreme drought events in Southwest China. We detected the lag times of maize ET responses to VPD and SM, and then analyzed the sensitivity of maize ET to VPD and SM with lagged effects. We found pervasive lagged responses of maize ET with a shorter lag time of VPD (1.12 +/- 0.006 months, P < 0.05) than SM (1.28 +/- 0.006 months, P < 0.05). We analyzed the lag times of maize ET in relation to elevation, temperature, and precipitation to investigate the abiotic impacts on the lagged responses and found the lagged responses were more prevalent in areas at higher altitudes with lower temperatures but there was less variation across precipitation gradients. Maize ET was more sensitive to VPD than SM with lagged effects. High VPD enhanced maize ET under sufficient SM but during an extreme drought event, maize ET might be dramatically reduced due to SM depletion in spite of high VPD. The study highlights the significance of at-mospheric water demand for crop water consumption under extreme climate events.

TI  - Comparison of the capability of the Meteorological and Remote Sensing Drought Indices
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the importance of selecting the appropriate index for assessing drought, in this study, the performance of ten drought indices including six meteorological and four remote sensing drought indices for assessing drought conditions in 1, 3, 6, and 12-month time scales at the Fars province was compared. In this research, the climatic data series of ten synoptic stations, actual data series of annual rain-fed winter wheat yield (AWWY) in 25 counties, and data of Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2000 to 2020 were used. First, the zoning map of drought indices and AWWY (for each year) was prepared. Then, the 1000 random points over the study area were selected, and based on the data series of these points, the correlation coefficient (CC) between drought indices and AWWY, based on the XI correlation method (XICOR), was estimated for each year. Eventually, the clustering analysis method was used to cluster drought indices (based on estimated correlations). The results indicated that the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) had the lowest CC with the AWWY in all years. Among remote sensing drought indices, the overall level of the estimated CC between the Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) with the AWWY was more than other indices. Also, among meteorological drought indices, the overall level of the estimated CC between the Modified Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (MSPEI), Modified Reconnaissance Drought Index (MRDI), and Modified Standardized Precipitation Index (MSPI) with the AWWY was more than other indices. According to the results, on average, the MSPEI, MRDI, and MSPI indices with the highest CC with the AWWY were the best drought indices, respectively.

TI  - Earthquake-induced risk assessment of cultural heritage based on InSAR and seismic intensity: A case study of Zhalang temple affected by the 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo (China) earthquake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes have been acknowledged as threats to heritages for a long time in the past decades. Many scientific publications and international guidelines have addressed this issue. However, the related reports are still lacking particularly for the 2021 Mw 7.4 Maduo earthquake and its sur-rounding heritage sites, even though this event was the largest earthquake in China after 2008 with 13 National Key Protected Cultural Relic Units (NKPCRUs) of China located in the surround-ing areas within 200 km from the epicenter. On May 21, 2021, an Mw 7.4 earthquake struck Maduo County in Qinghai Province, China. The earthquake was large in magnitude and caused-150 km of surface rupture. The integrity and authenticity of cultural heritages near the epicen-ter are under severe threat, making it critically important to quantify the potential damages and vulnerability of these sites affected by the Mw 7.4 earthquake. Nevertheless, many geological and geophysical studies related to this earthquake have been conducted, but none of them consider the seismic damage to the heritage sites. To fulfill this gap, the Zhalang temple (also known as "Golok Peaceful Liberation Memorial") which was a Tibetan Buddhist monastery located-140 km away from the Mw 7.4 epicenter of the 2021 Maduo earthquake was taken as an exam-ple to investigate whether and how the strong earthquake could affect a cultural heritage in such a distance. Collaborative monitoring based on InSAR and seismic intensity was conducted to measure the earthquake-induced deformation and characterize the risks and damages to cultural heritages by earthquakes. First, fast responses within 30 min based on the seismic method were performed. The PGV-vS30 intensity, that was the peak ground velocities (PGV) further site -corrected by the site conditions of the time-averaged shear-wave velocity to 30 m depth (vS30) seismic intensity map was obtained, which provided a general and fast guidance to preliminary determinations of the severe disaster area and the scope of the disaster area. Initial decisions could be made about whether or where a certain location should be taken into further on-site inspection. Then, the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing of Sentinel-1 images was performed to define two-dimensional (2D) East-West (E-W) and vertical co-seismic deformation maps near the Zhalang temple. Finally, the measurements obtained by seismic and InSAR methods were validated by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and field surveying. The results showed that: the maximum E-W striking deformation was similar to 2.54 cm toward the east and the vertical subsidence was similar to 0.01 cm centered on the Zhalang temple, suggesting that the E -W striking deformation significantly affected the surrounding region. Moreover, the spatial het-erogeneity indicator of the InSAR deformation maps revealed the locations of underground faults with surface expressions. Further field survey detected surface fractures at Zhalang temple due to secondary effects of the Mw 7.4 earthquake. The genetic process of faulting and fracturing is cru-cial in terms of hazard assessment and mitigation strategies. In countries with strong environ-mental and seismic risks, the presented work contributes to the disaster risk reduction (DRR) of heritages in natural-hazard-prone areas and also takes on a social value because it provided sup-plements for the protection of a heritage that represents the very identity nationwide.

TI  - The main inherent uncertainty sources in trend estimation based on satellite remote sensing data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data have been extensively used to characterize the trends in environmental and ecological parameters in response to climate change and anthropogenic activities due to the long-term and continuous data record from a global perspective. Nevertheless, trends estimated from different satellite data can be different and even contradict to each other, resulting in inconsistent scientific conclusions about Earth system dynamics. Previous studies were mainly focused on detecting trends or their spatial distribution characteristics, with much less attention to the factors leading up to uncertainties in the results. To address this problem, this review provides a comprehensive analysis of the main factors leading up to the uncertainty of results. The spatial-scale, temporal-scale, platform/sensor-related characteristics, and trend detection algorithms were considered. Their effects as well as the causes of such effects were discussed. And the way to minimize these effects was also suggested. Based upon above, the future development direction was pointed out to obtain more reliable trend estimates from satellite observations. This paper aims to deepen the consciousness and understanding of the detected trends which are not related to actual changes of the Earth surface but caused by perspectives taken for data selection and analysis. Although our discussion on these factors is very preliminary, efforts made here shall provide a first-step guideline that future work can be built up on, with the overarching aim of capturing the real trend of environmental changes using satellite remote sensing.

TI  - Breast cancer radiation therapy: A bibliometric analysis of the scientific literature
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and radiation therapy (RT) is crucial in its multimodality management. Since bibliometrics is a powerful tool to reveal the scientific literature, we decided to perform a bibliometric analysis of the literature on breast cancer radiotherapy. We explored emerging trends and common patterns in research, tracking collaboration and networks, and foreseeing future directions in this clinical setting.Material and methods: The electronic Scopus database was searched using the keywords "breast cancer" and "radiotherapy" to include manuscripts published in English, between 2000 and 2021. Data analysis was performed using R-Studio 0.98.1091 software with a machine-learning bibliometric method, based on the bibliometrix R package. The most relevant authors were quantified per number and fractionalized number of authored documents. Author productivity was analysed through Lotka's law. Bradford's law was applied to identify the nucleus of journals focused on the addressed topic. Mainstream themes area included isolated topics (niche themes), new topics (emerging themes), hot topics (motor themes) and essential topics (basic themes).Results: A total of 27 184 documents was found, mainly original articles (76 %). The annual growth rate was 6.98 %, with an increase in scientific production from 485 to 2000 documents between 2000 and 2021. Overall, 2 544 journals published >= 1 documents. The most relevant authors were affiliated in the United States. Surgical procedures, cancer type and treatment strategies represented basic themes, while primary systemic therapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were emerging themes. Health-related quality of life was a niche theme, while RT techniques had high centrality.Conclusion: The primary interests of breast cancer radiation oncologists have evolved over time, adding safety, health related quality of life, sustainability of treatments and combination to systemic therapies to radiotherapy efficacy and effectiveness and treatment outcomes.

TI  - Developing an integrated approach based on geographic object-based image analysis and convolutional neural network for volcanic and glacial landforms mapping
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid detection and mapping of landforms are crucially important to improve our understanding of past and presently active processes across the earth, especially, in complex and dynamic volcanoes. Traditional landform modeling approaches are labor-intensive and time-consuming. In recent years, landform mapping has increasingly been digitized. This study conducted an in-depth analysis of convolutional neural networks (CNN) in combination with geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), for mapping volcanic and glacial landforms. Sentinel-2 image, as well as predisposing variables (DEM and its derivatives, e.g., slope, aspect, curvature and flow accumulation), were segmented using a multi-resolution segmentation algorithm, and relevant features were selected to define segmentation scales for each landform category. A set of object-based features was developed based on spectral (e.g., brightness), geometrical (e.g., shape index), and textural (grey level co-occurrence matrix) information. The landform modelling networks were then trained and tested based on labelled objects generated using GEOBIA and ground control points. Our results show that an integrated approach of GEOBIA and CNN achieved an ACC of 0.9685, 0.9780, 0.9614, 0.9767, 0.9675, 0.9718, 0.9600, and 0.9778 for dacite lava, caldera, andesite lava, volcanic cone, volcanic tuff, glacial circus, glacial valley, and suspended valley, respectively. The quantitative evaluation shows the highest performance (Accuracy > 0.9600 and cross-validation accuracy > 0.9400) for volcanic and glacial landforms and; therefore, is recommended for regional and large-scale landform mapping. Our results and the provided automatic workflow emphasize the potential of integrated GEOBIA and CNN for fast and efficient landform mapping as a first step in the earth's surface management.

TI  - The role of forest status in households' fuel choice in Uganda
T2  - ENERGY POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigate how households' choice of energy source is influenced by the status of the local forest resource. We assume that households choose between clean fuels (e.g., kerosene, LPG, solar, and elec-tricity), dirty biobased fuels (e.g., firewood, animal dung, crop residues, and charcoal), and mixed fuels. We integrate socioeconomic data with high-resolution satellite data on forest conditions from the Uganda National Panel Survey. The findings from a random-effects multinomial logit model indicate that households in vegetated areas are 6-7% less likely to rely solely on dirty biobased fuels, and 6-8% more likely to use mixed fuels, compared to those in non-vegetated areas. A larger forest stock is more strongly associated with lower use of firewood than charcoal. A possible explanation for the findings is the presence of policies for forest conservation and enhanced forest property rights, which improve forest conditions and limit opportunities to collect firewood. Given households' dependence on forest-based fuels, such policies could need to be modified to secure house-holds' access to these fuels.

TI  - High-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC): Challenges and emerging therapies
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is a common type of skin malignancy that affects people who have been exposed to sunlight for a long time. It has been associated to a high mutational load, making treatment problematic, especially for individuals with high-risk CSCC characteristics. Patients with high -risk CSCC are difficult to define since definitions are still imprecise. Firstly, we review the evidence to see how relevant locoregional involvement is in terms of patient survival and recurrence risk. Second, we go through the difficulties and obstacles that come with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and their importance in the management of locally progressed CSCC. Methods and findings from a variety of lymph node investigations are described. There is yet no empirical evidence for the involvement of SLNB in CSCC. Finally, we discussed the most recent developments in the treatment of CSCC. The mainstays of treatment are surgery and radiation. To slow the disease progression, cancer medicines have switched to disrupting particular signaling pathways. Advanced nations have more easily accessible drugs like Cetuximab (epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor) and Cemiplimab (anti-programme receptor-1 antibodies), which are utilized in advanced CSCC. The response rate varies based on the patient, although there is still a lack of proof. This article discusses the misconception that CSCC is a tumor with a favorable prognosis, as well as the difficulties in treating high-risk CSCC.(c) 2022 Asian Surgical Association and Taiwan Robotic Surgery Association.

TI  - Clinical significance of discordances in sentinel lymph node reactivity between radioisotope and indocyanine green fluorescence in patients with cN0 breast cancer
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: /Objective: To evaluate the usefulness of combining radioisotopes (RI) and indocyanine green (ICG) and investigate discordances in sentinel lymph node (SN) reactivity using each tracer in cN0 breast cancer patients.Methods: In total, 338 cN0 primary breast cancer patients who underwent SN biopsy with RI and ICG and axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection were included. SN positivity with RI, ICG, and a combination of RI and ICG was denoted as SN(RI), SN(ICG), and SN(RI thorn ICG), respectively. We retrospectively estimated metastatic SN detection rates, each method's discordance rate, and the correlation of discordances in SN reactivity with postoperative N staging.Results: The combination of RI and ICG had higher metastatic SN detection rates (99.7%) than RI or ICG alone (91.7% and 96.4%, respectively; p < 0.01). The discordance rate between SN(RI) and SN(ICG) in detecting metastatic SNs was 11.3% (38/337 cases). The absence of SN(RI), cT stage (cT2-3), higher his-tological grade (G3), and histological type (special type) were identified as risk factors of pN2-3 disease (odds ratios: 8.64, 2.56, 1.92, and 3.28, respectively; p < 0.01).Conclusion: Discordances in SN reactivity between RI and ICG helps in identifying SN metastasis. Although the absence of SN(RI) is rare, it is a significant sign of advanced ALN metastases. The findings of our study indicate that ALN dissection should be considered for accurate nodal staging in such cases.(c) 2022 Asian Surgical Association and Taiwan Robotic Surgery Association.

TI  - Predicting Lymph Node Metastases in Patients with Biopsy-Proven Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast: Development and Validation of the DCIS-met Model
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeIn patients with a biopsy-proven ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), axillary staging is frequently performed, but in hindsight often turns out to be superfluous. The aim of this observational study was to develop a prediction model for risk of lymph node metastasis in patients with a biopsy-proven DCIS. MethodsData were received from the Dutch Pathology Databank and the Netherlands Cancer Registry. The population-based cohort consisted of all biopsy-proven DCIS patients diagnosed in the Netherlands in 2011 and 2012. The prediction model was evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, and a calibration plot and a decision curve analysis and was validated in a Dutch cohort of patients diagnosed in the period 2016-2019. ResultsOf 2892 biopsy-proven DCIS patients, 127 had metastasis (4.4%). Risk factors were younger age (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.95-0.99), DCIS not detected by screening (OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.01-2.38), suspected invasive component at biopsy (OR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.01-3.41), palpable tumour (OR = 2.06, 95% CI 1.34-3.18), BI-RADS score 5 (OR = 2.41, 95% CI 1.53-3.78), intermediate-grade DCIS (OR = 3.01, 95% CI 1.27-7.15) and high-grade DCIS (OR = 3.20, 95% CI 1.36-7.54). For 24% (n = 708) of the patients, the predicted risk of lymph node metastasis was above 5%. Based on the decision curve analysis, the model had a net benefit for a predicted risk below 25%. The AUC was 0.745. Of the 2269 patients in the validation cohort, 53 (2.2%) had metastasis and the AUC was 0.741. ConclusionsThis DCIS-met model can support clinical decisions on axillary staging in patients with biopsy-proven DCIS.

T2  - STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the seismic performance of exposed RCFST column--base joints, in which the high--strength steel bars (USD 685) are set through the column and reinforced concrete foundation without any base plate and anchor bolts. Three specimens with different axial force ratios (n = 0, 0.25, and 0.5) were tested under cyclic loadings. Finite element analysis (FEA) models were validated in the basic indexes and failure mode. The hysteresis behavior of the exposed RCFST column-base joints was studied by the parametrical analysis including six parameters: width of column (D), width--thickness ratio (D/t), axial force ratio (n), shear--span ratio (L/D), steel tube strength (fy) and concrete strength (fc). The bending moment of the exposed RCFST column--base joint increased with D, fy and fc. But the D/t and L/D play a little effect on the bending capacity of the new column--base joint. Finally, the calculation formula is proposed to assess the bending moment capacities, and the accuracy and stability of the formula are verified.

TI  - Integrated remote sensing data and field investigations for geological mapping and structural analysis. The case of SW Tichoukt ridge (Middle Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Boulemane area is one of the important key sectors to understand the evolution of the central Middle Atlas of Morocco. It is a junction area of three Cretaceous/Paleogene unconformable sedimentary basins on the Triassic -Jurassic deposits. This work is a combination of remote sensing results (optical and radar data) supported by field observations to accurate a high-precision geological map of the study area. For this purpose, we used two types of images that are the radar image (Sentinel-1 data) and the optical multispectral images: Landsat 8 OLI (Optical Land Imager) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The two multispectral images have been spatially enhanced using the panchromatic band of the HRG-2 (High Geometric Resolution) sensor of SPOT 5, allowing the production of high spatial resolution images (5m).The colored compositions that were chosen using OIF (Optimum Index Factor), and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) allowed good discrimination of the main rock. Moreover, ASTER thermal bands have allowed the delimitation of large outcrops of yellow sandstone, conglomerate, phosphate and gypsum based on their thermal emissivity.Structural lineaments are manually extracted from Sentinel-1 radar images after applying directional filters, analyzing Landsat 8 OLI, ASTER high-resolution multispectral images, and interpreting the spatial juxtaposition of lithological features after digitizing the final lithological map.The extracted structural lineaments are grouped into major systems mainly oriented NE-SW, and NW-SE. The NE-SW system is constituted by faults inherited from the Paleozoic basement. The NW-SE transverse system is constituted by faults newly developed during the Middle Liassic.

TI  - Effects of human activity intensity on habitat quality based on nighttime light remote sensing: A case study of Northern Shaanxi, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat quality is a crucial expression of the value of ecosystem services. Habitat quality issues caused by human activities are troubling dilemmas worldwide, and there is an urgent need to assess the impact of the large-scale human activity intensity on habitat quality. In this study, Northern Shaanxi, China, is used as an example to demonstrate how the impact on habitat quality can be explored by simulating the intensity of human activities using nighttime light remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020. Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite-Day-Night Band (VIIRS-DNB) data, and Integrated Valuation of EcosystemServices and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model were used in this study. The results showed that from 2000 to 2020, human activity intensity in Northern Shaanxi increased by 361.4 %, and the habitat quality decreased by 2.3 %. Habitat quality was more spatially clustered and spatially dependent than habitat degradation. Human activity intensity and habitat quality were significantly correlated. Habitat quality in Yulin city decreased significantly compared with that in Yan'an city. The differences in human activity types and economic structures of Yulin and Yan'an were an important factor for this phenomenon. The assessment of the impact of human activity intensity on habitat quality using nighttime light data is feasible and can be applied in other larger regions worldwide.

TI  - Exploring and forecasting spatial and temporal patterns of fire hazard risk in Nepal's tiger conservation zones
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are the leading cause of deforestation. In March, April, and May, which are the three driest months of the year, 89% of all forest fires in Nepal are caused by humans. Due to its diverse topography, climate, and sociodemographic interactions, the region is extremely vulnerable. The study aimed to investigate and forecast the spatiotemporal pattern of forest fires using space-time cube forecasting models and develop a tiger habitat suitability model based on space-time hotspots, trends, environmental, geomorphological, and human compo-nents. MODIS fire hazards data in vector point format from NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites between the years 2000 and 2020 were utilized as the primary dataset for this investigation. Fire hazards from 2000 to 2013 were utilized to analyze the spatiotemporal hot-cold spots trend, hotspot zone in 2D and 3D. Then fire hazards from 2014 to 2020 were forecasted and validated with raw datasets using the space-time exponential-smoothing and forest-based forecasting models. Results indicate that almost 52.77% and 69.05% of the total tiger habitat area were respectively in hotspot and uptrend zones. Only 0.3% of the entire tiger habitat area was identified in a cold-spot zone. Multi-Criteria Evaluation (MCE) suitability analysis estimated that the areas of Mahakal and Seti in the west and the top of Mechi in the east were found to be moderately suitable for tiger habitat. When compared to the exponential smoothing method (8.40%), the forest-based method produced a lower average inaccuracy of 8.29%, with mean RMSEs of 0.43 and 0.31, respectively. Overall, the study revealed a new era of technological spatiotemporal data utilization for fire hazard incidents, which could be used to identify suitable or vulnerable locations through space-time analysis and forecasting techniques.

TI  - Association of hospital-level factors with utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To evaluate utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for early-stage vulvar cancer at minority-serving hospitals and low-volume facilities.Methods. Between 2012-2018, individuals with T1b vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were identified using the National Cancer Database. Patient, facility, and disease characteristics were compared between patients undergo-ing SLNB or inguinofemoral lymph node dissection (IFLD). Multivariable logistic regression, adjusted for patient, facility, and disease characteristics, was used to evaluate factors associated with SLNB. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis using log rank test and Cox regression was performed.Results. Of the 3,532 patients, 2,406 (68.1%) underwent lymph node evaluation, with 1,704 (48.2%) undergo-ing IFLD and 702 (19.8%) SLNB. In a multivariable analysis, treatment at minority-serving hospitals (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19-0.78) and low-volume hospitals (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.28-0.70) were associated with significantly lower odds of undergoing SLNB compared to receiving care at non-minority-serving and high-volume hospitals, respectively. While SLNB utilization increased over time for the entire cohort and stratified subgroups, use of the procedure did not increase at minority-serving hospitals. After controlling for patient and tumor characteristics, SLNB was not associated with worse OS compared to IFLD in patients with positive (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.63-1.66) or negative (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.70-1.21) nodal pathology.Conclusions. For patients with early-stage vulvar cancer, treatment at minority-serving or low-volume hospitals was associated with significantly decreased odds of undergoing SLNB. Future efforts should be concentrated toward ensuring that all patients have access to advanced surgical techniques regardless of where they receive their care.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Horizontal small-scale variability of water vapor in the atmosphere: implications for intercomparison of data from different measuring systems
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor concentration structures in the atmosphere are well approximated horizontally by Gaussian random fields at small scales (& LSIM;6 km). These Gaussian random fields have a spatial correlation in accordance with a structure function with a two-thirds slope, following the corresponding law from Kolmogorov's theory of turbulence. This is proven by showing that the horizontal structure functions measured by several satellite instruments and radiosonde measurements do indeed follow the two-thirds law. High-spatial-resolution retrievals of total column water vapor (TCWV) obtained from the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on board the Sentinel-3 series of satellites also qualitatively show a Gaussian random field structure.As a consequence, the atmosphere has an inherently stochastic component associated with the horizontal small-scale water vapor features, which, in turn, can make deterministic forecasting or nowcasting difficult. These results can be useful in areas where high-resolution modeling of water vapor is required, such as the estimation of the water vapor variance within a region or when searching for consistency between different water vapor measurements in neighboring locations. In terms of weather forecasting or nowcasting, the water vapor horizontal variability could be important in estimating the uncertainty of the atmospheric processes driving convection.

TI  - What is Nonclassical about Uncertainty Relations? br
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty relations express limits on the extent to which the outcomes of distinct measurements on asingle state can be made jointly predictable. The existence of nontrivial uncertainty relations in quantumtheory is generally considered to be a way in which it entails a departure from the classical worldview.However, this perspective is undermined by the fact that there exist operational theories which exhibitnontrivial uncertainty relations but which are consistent with the classical worldview insofar as they admitof a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. This prompts the question of what aspects of uncertaintyrelations, if any,cannotbe realized in this way and so constitute evidence of genuine nonclassicality. Wehere consider uncertainty relations describing the tradeoff between the predictability of a pair of binary-outcome measurements (e.g., measurements of PauliXand PauliZobservables in quantum theory). Weshow that, for a class of theories satisfying a particular symmetry property, the functional form of thispredictability tradeoff is constrained by noncontextuality to be below a linear curve. Because qubitquantum theory has the relevant symmetry property, the fact that its predictability tradeoff describes asection of a circle is a violation of this noncontextual bound, and therefore constitutes an example ofhow the functional form of an uncertainty relation can witness contextuality. We also deduce theimplications for a selected group of operational foils to quantum theory and consider the generalization tothree measurements.

TI  - Intra-urban land use maps for a global sample of cities from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and computer vision
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intra-urban land use maps provide important information to urban planners and policymakers, but these maps are costly, time consuming to generate and are often unavailable in developing countries where most urban growth is now occurring. This paper reports on machine learning methods to automate the production of land use maps from cloud-free mosaics of Sentinel-2 imagery. We have trained a novel neural network architecture to produced 5 meter resolution land use maps for a global stratified sample of 200 cities. The sample includes all world regions, 78 countries, and a range of population sizes. The model architecture is roughly 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than similar architectures such as UNet (Ronneberger, Fischer, & Brox, 2015) and Deep-labV3+ (Chen, Zhu, Papandreou, Schroff, & Adam, 2018), significantly lowering the cost and computational requirements to produce maps. We are in the process of generating land use maps for all 4,000 + cities and metropolitan areas in the world with populations exceeding 100,000. The resulting product will be the first, regularly updated, freely available, global intra-urban land use maps at 5 meter resolution.We present a 4-tier land use taxonomy which at its root distinguishes open-space from built-up area. At the second tier, it subdivides the built-up category into nonresidential and residential areas. The third tier distin-guishes formal from informal residential land use, and the fourth tier further subdivides formal and informal residential land uses into more detailed categories. Accuracy scores at tier-1 and tier-2 were 86% and 79% respectively. Tiers 3 and 4 had an accuracy scores of 75% and 71% respectively. Additionally, we train a roads -only model and compare its output to the Atlas of Urban Expansion's Arterial Roads dataset and Open Street Map. As an example use case, we train an Informal Settlement Classifier, correctly classifying 87% of the settlements.

TI  - Monitoring and classifying cropland productivity degradation to support implementing land degradation neutrality: The case of China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mainstreaming the land degradation neutrality (LDN) framework in national and local policy systems is critical to addressing global land degradation. However, existing land productivity assessment limits the generalization of LDN in regions with complex geographical backgrounds. To support integrating productivity balance measures into the "Requisition-Compensation Balance of Cropland" policy in China, we applied a novel cropland productivity monitoring and classification system in a case area, Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) in China, including four agricultural zones (i.e., large-scale, smallholder, hilly, and suburban agricultural zones), based the most active days (MAD) assessment method and the quadratic regression model. The results show that although the average productivity of YREB cropland increased from 2001 to 2017, similar to 20% of the croplands are in the significant degradation hotspot areas; There is clear spatial variation in the productivity degradation in different cropping systems (i.e., single- and double-crops) and "watershed gradient" and "urban-rural gradient" are two main degradation spatial patterns; Eight major degrading types (e.g., "no degradation," "degradation reversed," and "continuous degradation") are identified and the "early stage of degradation" accounts for the highest proportion. Meanwhile, the "long-term" and "accelerated degradation" of productivity in the second season of double-crops are also threats hard to ignore. These findings suggest that YREB's cropland productivity degradation process is multidimensional and complex, especially when linked to natural and human drivers. Nevertheless, this paper can support China's LDN decision-making by helping answer the key questions (i.e., where is the degradation, what is the degeneration type, and how to neutralize the degradation?) and recommending targeted neutralization strategies for the agricultural zones under various geographical backgrounds. These findings can also inform LDN policy development in the wider global region.

TI  - Satellite greenness and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence reveal reverse desertification in Gurbantunggut Desert
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The desertification reversal is a process of revegetation and natural restoration in fragile dryland areas due to human activities and climate change mediation. Understanding the impact of desertification reversion on terrestrial ecosystems, including vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, is crucial for land policy-making and carbon-cycle model improvement. However, the phenomenon of desertification reversal is rarely mentioned in previous studies, which dramatically limits the understanding of vegetation dynamics in the arid area. Therefore, it is of great necessity to investigate the status of desertification reversal on the ecosystem in arid areas. In this study, we first reported the phenomenon of desertification reversion over the southern edge of the Gurbantunggut Desert through the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer classification map year by year. We discussed the consequences, ways, and causes of desertification reversion. Our results showed that the desertification reversal significantly increased vegetation greenness and photosynthetic capacity, which largely offset the negative impact of desertification on the ecosystem productivity; cropland expansion and grassland's natural restoration were the two main ways of desertification reversal; the improvement of soil-water condition was an essential environmental factor leading to the phenomenon of reverse desertification. This finding highlights the importance of desertification reversal in the carbon cycle of dryland ecosystems and prove that desertification reversal is an integral part of global and dryland vegetation greening.

TI  - Assessment of the spatiotemporal prediction capabilities of machine learning algorithms on Sea Surface Temperature data: A comprehensive study
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal time series prediction plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. However, in most of the studies, spatial information was ignored and predictions were carried out either on a few points or on average values. In this study, 37 different configurations of 4 traditional ML models and 3 Neural Network (NN) based models were utilized to provide a comprehensive comparison and evaluate the spatiotemporal data prediction capabilities of the ML models. Additionally, to reveal the importance of spatial data for the time series prediction process, the best configuration of each ML model was evaluated with and without using spatial information. The utilized models were: (i) Linear Regression (LR), (ii) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), (iii) Decision-Trees (DT), (iv) Support Vector Machine (SVM), (v) Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), (vi) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and (vii) Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The study was performed on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data collected by satellite radiometers via infrared measurements. The models were evaluated according to their one-month ahead spatiotemporal SST prediction performance over the southern coasts of Turkey, and the effects of spatial information on model performance were presented. Results reveal that the spatial information increased the prediction performance by approximately 25%, in terms of RMSE. Additionally, acquired results show that the LSTM model outperforms all other ML models and gives the smallest prediction errors in all metrics.

TI  - Outcomes in patients with non-invasive breast carcinoma
T2  - CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and AimNon-invasive breast carcinoma is considered to be localized disease and is distinguished from invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas. The local recurrence of non-invasive carcinoma after surgery may lead to development of invasive carcinoma and promote distant metastasis, which worsens the prognosis for breast cancer mortality. The distant metastasis of non-invasive carcinoma may involve the ductal microvasculature without invasion. The outcomes of non-invasive breast carcinoma were examined in this retrospective cohort study. Methods and ResultsOf 872 primary breast cancers diagnosed at a single center between May 2008 and March 2022, 93 (10.6%) were found to be non-invasive carcinomas and were examined in this study. The breast cancer recurrence and survival rates of patients with non-invasive carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. The median follow-up period was 1891 (range, 5-4804) days. All patients underwent surgical treatment [mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and partial mastectomy with or without SLNB, tumorectomy, and microdochectomy]. Postoperatively, radiation therapy was administered to 73 (78.4%) of the patients and endocrine therapy was administered to 64 (81.0%) of 79 patients with hormone-receptor positivity. Of 26 patients who underwent partial mastectomy with SLNB, 24 (92.3%) showed isolated tumor cells in the SLNs on one-step nucleic acid amplification. Local recurrence was observed in three (0.3%) patients; no distant metastasis was observed. One patient died of a noncancerous disease. The overall survival rate was 98.0% and the breast cancer-specific survival rate was 100.0%. ConclusionsNon-invasive breast carcinoma, like invasive breast carcinoma, causes local recurrence, but has a good prognosis without distant metastasis. The clinical significance of isolated tumor cells in the SLNs as a systemic component of non-invasive breast carcinoma remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Japanese cancer screening programs during the COVID-19 pandemic: Changes in participation between 2017-2020
T2  - CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on cancer screening participation is a global concern. A national database of screening performance is available in Japan for population-based cancer screening, estimated to cover approximately half of all cancer screenings.Methods: Utilizing the fiscal year (FY) 2017-2020 national database, the number of participants in screenings for gastric cancer (upper gastrointestinal [UGI] series or endoscopy), colorectal cancer (fecal occult blood test), lung cancer (chest X-ray), breast cancer (mammography), and cervical cancer (Pap smear) were identified. The percent change in the number of participants was calculated. Results: Compared with the pre-pandemic period (FY 2017-2019), in percentage terms FY 2020 recorded the largest decline in gastric cancer UGI series (2.82 million to 1.91 million, percent change was -32.2 %), followed by screening for breast cancer (3.10 million to 2.57 million, percent change was -17.2 %), lung cancer (7.92 million to 6.59 million, percent change was -16.7 %), colorectal cancer (8.42 million to 7.30 million, percent change was -13.4 %), cervical cancer (4.26 million to 3.77 million, percent change was -11.6 %), and gastric cancer via endoscopy (1.02 million to 0.93 million, percent change was -9.0 %).Conclusion: The number of participants in population-based screenings in Japan decreased by approximately 10-30 % during the pandemic. The impact of these declines on cancer detection or mortality should be carefully monitored.

TI  - Lymphoscintigraphy in patients with breast cancer-related lymphedema after sentinel lymph node dissection and axillary radiation therapy
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate lymphoscintigraphy pattern according to the presence or absence of axillary site radiation therapy (aRTx) in breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) patients who underwent sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND). The participants were patients who visited our facility from July 2014 to June 2021 due to upper extremity edema. Among them, patients who underwent SLND after the diagnosis of breast cancer were included. The participants were divided into a group without aRTx (group A) and a group with aRTx (group B). In each patient's lymphoscintigraphy, axillary lymph node uptake (ALNU), lymphatic flow delay, dermal back flow, and the presence of any collateral pathway were checked. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. In all, 27 patients were classified in Group A, and 6 patients were classified in Group B. Between the 2 groups, we found a significant difference (P value < .05) between groups at ALNU and lymphatic flow delay. However, there was no significant difference between groups at the dermal backflow and the presence of a collateral pathway (P value > .05). And 24.2% of patients who developed lymphedema after SLND showed normal lymphoscintigraphy. In this study we suggest that SLND and aRTx affects the activity of the axillary lymph node and ultimately adversely affects lymphatic flow, becoming a risk factor for lymphedema. In addition, regardless of SLND or aRTx, lymphedema may eventually occur in the patient with normal lymphoscintigraphy.

TI  - Accurate intercensal estimates of energy access to track Sustainable Development Goal 7
T2  - EPJ DATA SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercensal estimates of access to electricity and clean cooking fuels at policy planning microregions in a country are essential for understanding their evolution and tracking progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 7. Surveys are prohibitively expensive to get such intercensal microestimates. Existing works, mainly, focus on electrification rates, make predictions at the coarse spatial granularity, and generalize poorly to intercensal periods. Limited works focus on estimating clean cooking fuel access, which is one of the crucial indicators for measuring progress towards SDG 7. We propose a novel spatio-temporal multi-target Bayesian regression model that provides accurate intercensal microestimates for household electrification and clean cooking fuel access by combining multiple types of earth-observation data, census, and surveys. Our model's estimates are produced for Senegal for 2020 at policy planning microregions, and they explain 77% and 86% of variation in regional aggregates for electrification and clean fuels, respectively, when validated against the most recent survey. The diagnostic nature of our microestimates reveals a slow evolution and significant lack of clean cooking fuel access in both urban and rural areas in Senegal. It underscores the challenge of expanding energy access even in urban areas owing to their rapid population growth. Owing to the timeliness and accuracy of our microestimates, they can help plan interventions by local governments or track the attainment of SDGs when no ground-truth data are available.

TI  - Examining the spatially varying effects of climatic and environmental pollution factors on the NDVI based on their spatially heterogeneous relationships in Bohai Rim, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in vegetation patterns can provide a scientific basis for assessing environmental quality and monitoring ecosystem dynamics under environmental pollution and global warming conditions. To evaluate the ecological environment of the Bohai Rim, Theil-Sen trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test and the Hurst exponent were applied to analyze the patterns of variation in the vegetation coverage, climate factors (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity) and particulate matter and to assess sustainability in the near future. Fine particulate matter, also known as PM2.5 (PM2.5, mu g/m3), refers to atmospheric particles with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 mu m, also known as respirable particles. These not only lead to a decline in atmospheric visibility but also increase human mortality and respiratory disease rates. Given the spatiotemporal nonstationarity of climate factors and PM2.5, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was applied to confirm the spatially heterogeneous relationship among the vegetation coverage, climate factors and PM2.5. The vegetation coverage in the Bohai Rim was mostly comprised of slightly degraded areas, followed by unchanged areas, improved areas, and severely degraded areas from 2002 to 2017. The slightly degraded area accounted for 30.9 %, while 15.8 % of the area remained at the same level during the period, and 16.8 % improved. Slight degradation was mainly observed on agricultural lands and forests, whereas severely degraded areas were distributed among grasslands and wetlands. Approximately 20.9 % of the improved area, most of which was agricultural lands, forests and grasslands, continued to improve. Seasonal trends indicated that a large proportion of the areas remained unchanged or were slightly degraded from autumn to spring, whereas areas improved from spring to autumn. During the winter, slightly and severely degraded areas continuously expanded. GWR indicated that temperature, PM2.5, and precipitation displayed a significant heterogeneous spatial relationship with the vegetation coverage and had an obvious influence on the medium, high and low vegetation cover areas. When considering the joint influence of climate factors and PM2.5 on the vegetation coverage, the model accuracy was not high for the high and medium vegetation cover areas. In the Bohai region, human activities significantly affect coastal areas. These results can support sustainable coastal ecosystem management, relevant management measures and ecological development plans.

TI  - Review: Monitoring of land cover changes and plant phenology by remote-sensing in East Asia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - To achieve a sustainable society and solve the problems caused by climate change and socioeconomic activities, it is necessary to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity at both regional and global scales. During the last decade, we have seen rapid and significant improvement in satellite and near-surface remote-sensing technologies. In this review, we describe how remote-sensing observations are being used to effectively evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of land use and cover types and of plant phenology in East Asia. We discuss the current status, uncertainties, problems, and future perspectives for terrestrial ecosystem and biodiversity monitoring, and we address the multidisciplinary research by incorporating in situ and satellite observations for East Asia. Recent satellites with advanced optical sensors, such as MultiSpectral Instrument/Sentinel-2A/2B, Advanced Himawari Imager/Himawari-8, and PlanetScope, and satellites with synthetic aperture radar, such as Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2, allow detailed monitoring of land use and cover type changes and plant phenology. These satellite sensors can provide images with high spatial (3-10 m) and high temporal (10 min to 5 days) resolution, at both large (>= 1 km(2)) and small (<1 km(2)) scales. In particular, researchers are expected to develop discrimination techniques that will enable these advanced satellite technologies to detect evergreen broadleaf trees and ways to estimate the geographic distribution of leaf traits. We encourage more collaborations among ecologists, engineers, and remote-sensing scientists to share their abundant knowledge and experience and thereby improve the monitoring capabilities.

TI  - Assimilation of Clear-sky FY-4A AGRI radiances within the WRFDA system for the prediction of a landfalling Typhoon Hagupit (2020)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of assimilating Advanced Geostationary Radiance Imager (AGRI) radiances of FengYun-4A (FY-4A) satellite is realized in the framework of the Weather Research and Forecasting model's Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system. Two experiments are carried out based on a landfalling Typhoon Hagupit to discuss the added values of assimilating the clear-sky radiances on typhoon's analysis and prediction. One experiment assimilates both the AGRI radiances and the Global Telecommunications System (GTS) conventional data, while another experiment only applies GTS conventional data. The results show that the errors of the analysis fields are reduced after the assimilation of AGRI radiances, which can be reflected by the vertical root mean square error (RMSE) profile of both dynamic and thermodynamic variables against the radiosonde observations. Besides, the final improvement of the track and rainfall prediction can possibly be accredited to the analyzed 500 hPa geopotential height increment and the vertically averaged horizontal water vapor flux to some degree. The area is enlarged with relative humidity exceeding 95% by the assimilation of AGRI radiances in the typhoon core, leading to the refinement of both the rainfall distribution and intensity in the prediction. With the improved dynamic and thermodynamic fields, the track of the AGRI experiment is more accurate with a mean error 37 km in the whole 36 h.

TI  - Characterizing primary care patients with posttraumatic stress disorder using electronic medical records: a retrospective cross-sectional study
T2  - FAMILY PRACTICE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has significant morbidity and economic costs. This study describes the prevalence and characteristics of patients with PTSD using primary care electronic medical record (EMR) data. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study used EMR data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). This study included 1,574 primary care providers located in 7 Canadian provinces. There were 689,301 patients that visited a CPCSSN provider between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2019. We describe associations between PTSD and patient characteristics using descriptive statistics, chi-square, and multiple logistic regression models. Results Among the 689,301 patients included, 8,817 (1.3%, 95% CI 1.2-1.3) had a diagnosis of PTSD. On multiple logistic regression analysis, patients with depression (OR 4.4, 95% CI 4.2-4.7, P < 0.001), alcohol abuse/dependence (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.6-1.9, P < 0.001), and/or drug abuse/dependence (OR 2.6, 95% CI 2.5-2.8, P < 0.001) had significantly higher odds of PTSD compared with patients without those conditions. Patients residing in community areas considered the most material deprived (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-2.1, P < 0.001) or the most socially deprived (OR 2.8, 95% CI 2.7-5.3, P < 0.001) had higher odds of being diagnosed with PTSD compared with patients in the least deprived areas. Conclusions The prevalence of PTSD in Canadian primary care is 1.3% (95% CI 1.25-1.31). Using EMR records we confirmed the co-occurrence of PTSD with other mental health conditions within primary care settings suggesting benefit for improved screening and evidence-based resources to manage PTSD.Lay Summary Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder with symptoms presenting after having experienced or witnessed a traumatic event. PTSD symptoms continue for more than 1 month after the event and negatively impact the health and social wellbeing of an individual. Primary care, including family doctors, nurse practitioners, and community paediatricians, are often the first point of healthcare for an individual. This study found that PTSD is diagnosed and managed in primary care. Patients with PTSD had comorbidities, substance use, and visited their primary care provider more frequently. Additionally, patients with PTSD often live in a community area that is experiencing high material and social deprivation. The presence of PTSD in primary care suggests the need for new and additional evidence-based resources to assist in managing this complex condition.

TI  - Novel intraoperative near-infrared imaging strategy to identify abnormalities in the anterior mediastinum
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thoracic surgeons are frequently asked to biopsy suspicious tissues in the anterior mediastinum to discriminate between a reactive versus malignant pathology such as lymph nodes. The most common benign cause of a mediastinal lymph node is a reactive lymph node from a prior infection or inflammatory process such as post-COVID or granulomatous disease. The most common malignant cause is a lymphoproliferative disorder but also metastatic disease from neck, breast and other regional cancers. Biopsies in this location are challenging because they are far from the trachea and the sternum is a barrier to most diagnostic procedures. Thus, a surgical biopsy is frequently required and a common procedure for Thoracic surgeons. Technically, identifying these lesions can be challenging, particularly for small lesions or those in patients with high body mass index. In order to improve contrast between diseased tissue in the anterior mediastinum and surrounding adipose tissue, we have been studying near-infrared imaging during surgery using indocyanine green (ICG) to give contrast to the abnormal tissues and to avoid an unnecessary extended resection. We developed a modified technique to give ICG to a patient during a biopsy in the anterior mediastinum to specifically highlight abnormal tissues. As a proof-of-principle, we present a case of a young woman with a suspicious 2 cm mediastinal lymph node that required surgical biopsy.

TI  - Estimating snow cover from high-resolution satellite imagery by thresholding blue wavelengths
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent and duration of snow cover, a critical component of the hydrologic cycle and the global climate system, is expected to shift dramatically under climate change. Therefore, developing high-resolution assessments of snow cover change is crucial for estimating the impact of changing snow cover on watershed and ecosystems processes in cold regions. Remote sensing tools provide a powerful method for mapping snowcovered area (SCA) across a landscape. The most common method for estimating SCA utilizes the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), which relies on spectral measurements in the shortwave-infrared wavelengths (SWIR). NDSI can effectively estimate catchment- to regional-scale SCA, but it cannot be used to assess fine-scale SCA because of current limitations on the spatial resolution of satellite-derived SWIR measurements. Here, we map SCA using a threshold of blue wavelengths and high-resolution satellite imagery. The thresholding method, which we call the Blue Snow Threshold algorithm (BST), has previously been used with digital camera imagery. We refine and automate the algorithm for use with cloud-free high-resolution satellite imagery and find that the BST can be used to assess fine-scale SCA. For validation, we compared BST-derived estimates of SCA to a) airborne lidar surveys, b) Landsat fractional SCA, and c) snow disappearance dates from Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. When compared to airborne lidar surveys of SCA, the BST predicted SCA had a range of Fscores between 0.81 and 0.94 in four study areas in California and Colorado. We also found general agreement between SCA and snow disappearance at multiple SNOTEL sites across the western United States. Given the relatively recent availability of high-resolution satellite imagery with spectral measurements in the visible wavelengths but lacking in SWIR, the BST offers a reliable and easy-to-apply tool for examining fine-scale snowrelated processes.

TI  - A dynamic and evidence-based approach to mapping burn potential
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Fire management is a crucial part of managing ecosystems. The years since last burn (YSLB) metric is commonly used in fire planning to predict when an area might be suitable to burn; however, this metric fails to account for variable recovery due to climate variability. Aim. The aim of this study was to develop a predictor of when an area may be able to 'carry' fire based on observed patterns of vegetation recovery and fire occurrence that is responsive to climate variability. Methods. Fire history maps and Landsat satellite imagery within the Great Victoria Desert of Australia were used to map vegetation recovery following fire. Burn potential models were then created by calculating the distributions of YSLB and vegetation recovery values for areas that subsequently burnt. Key result. A burn potential model based on vegetation recovery is a better predictor of when an area is likely to burn than a model based on YSLB. Conclusions. A burn potential model based on vegetation recovery provides an evidence-based and dynamic assessment of whether an area is likely to burn. Implications. This approach provides a model that is responsive to climate variability that can assist fire managers in burn planning and assessing fire risk.

TI  - Dynamics of forest net primary productivity based on tree ring reconstruction in the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of long-term high-resolution data makes it difficult to determine historical and future trends in net primary productivity (NPP). This study used tree rings as a proxy to investigate the dynamics of NPP in Tianshan forests where coniferous forests are the major species and the other species are deficient. All trees and some tree cores from five sample plots in different geographic locations in the western Tianshan Mountains were selected to reconstruct forest NPP data from 1950 to 2020. Multiple historical events that resulted in large-scale terrestrial carbon fluxes were identified and the existence of 28a and 17a time-scale cycles of historical forest NPP was observed. We discovered that the reconstructed forest NPP in the western Tianshan Mountains did not significantly correlate with satellite-based products (e.g., MODIS NPP, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence data). This result was attributed to the lag of forest growth for climate, the accuracy of the satellite-based products and statistical errors due to the short overlap time. We analysed the uncertainties in reconstructing historical forest NPP using tree ring widths and proposed corresponding solutions. We concluded that the reconstructed data remain the ideal proxy for regions lacking long-term empirical data and exhibit a high degree of confidence for expressing trends in forest productivity change over long time series.

AB  - The pre ven tion of cen tral ner vous sys tem (CNS) relapse in dif fuse large B -cell lym phoma (DLBCL) con tin ues to be one of the most con ten tious areas of lym phoma man age ment. Outcomes for patients with sec ond ary CNS lym phoma (SCNSL) have his tor i cally been very poor. However, in recent years improved responses have been reported with inten sive immu-nochemotherapy approaches, and there is a grow ing inter est in poten tial novel / cel lu lar ther a pies. Traditional meth ods for selecting patients for CNS pro phy laxis, includ ing the CNS International Prognostic Index, are ham pered by a lack of specificity, and there is accumulating evidence to question the efficacy of widely employed prophylactic interventions, including intrathecal and high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX). Given the potential toxicity of HD-MTX in particular and the ongo ing need to pri or i tize sys temic dis ease con trol in high -risk patients, there is an urgent need to develop more robust meth ods for iden ti fy ing patients at highest risk of CNS relapse, as well as inves ti gat ing pro phy lac tic inter ven tions with greater effi cacy. Here we review new evi dence in this fi eld from the last 5 years, focus ing on the poten tial use of molec u lar diag nos tics to improve the iden ti fi ca tion of high -risk patients, recent large data sets questioning the effi cacy of HD - MTX, and the cur rent approach to man age ment of patients with SCNSL. We pro vide a suggested algo rithm for approaching this very challenging clinical scenario.

TI  - Effects of fine ambient particulate matters on de novo hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and blood pressure before 20 weeks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of fine particulate matter (PM) on de novo hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) were incon-sistent during the first and second trimesters. This study aimed to assess the trimester-specific effects of PM2.5 and PM1 prior to diagnosis of de novo HDP. The exposure of fine PM was predicted by satellite remote sensing data according to maternal residential addresses. De novo HDP was defined as gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia during the current pregnancy. A logistic regression model was performed to assess the association of PM2.5 and PM1 with HDP during the first and early second trimesters (0-13 weeks and 14-20 weeks). The generalized estimating equation model was conducted to assess the effect of PM2.5 and PM1 on blood pressure. The present study included 22,821 pregnant women (mean age, 29.1 years) from 2013 to 2017. PM2.5 and PM1 were significantly associated with an increased risk of de novo HDP during the first trimester (OR = 1.070, 95% CI: 1.013-1.130; OR = 1.264, 95% CI: 1.058-1.511 for per 10 mu g/m3) and early second trimester (OR = 1.045, 95% CI: 1.003-1.088; OR = 1.170, 95% CI: 1.002-1.366 for per 10 mu g/m3). Significant trends of increased de novo HDP risk was also observed with the increment of PM (all P for trend <0.05). The stratified analyses demonstrated that the associations between exposure to fine PM and the risk of HDP were more pronounced among the pregnant women with maternal age above 35 and low maternal education level (all OR >1.047). Each 10 mu g/m3 increase of PM1 and PM2.5 before diagnosis of de novo HDP elevated 0.204 (95% CI: 0.098-0.310) and 0.058 (95%CI: 0.033-0.083) mmHg of systolic blood pressure. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM1 during the first and early second trimester were positively associated with the risk of de novo HDP. The fine PM before diagnosis of de novo HDP elevated the systolic blood pressure.

TI  - Contribution of the Tibetan Plateau Snow Cover to the Record-breaking Rainfall Over the Yangtze River Valley in June 2020
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN
M3  - Article
AB  - In June 2020, the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) experienced the most severe and long-persisting rainfall in past decades, causing hundreds of people's death and huge property loss. Based on the high-resolution MODIS/Terra snow cover data for the 2000-2021 period and the linear baroclinic model (LBM), this study investigates the dynamic influence and the potentially predictable source from the Tibetan Plateau (TP) snow cover (TPSC) on this record-breaking YRV rainfall. The TPSC anomalies in the critical area (76 degrees-83 degrees E, 28 degrees-35 degrees N) can persist for more than six months and induce a Rossby wave train propagating northeastward. For the excessive TPSC, barotropic negative geopotential height anomalies prevail over northern East Asia and positive geopotential height anomalies over the northwestern Pacific. Such a circulation configuration favours a deepened cold vortex over Northeast China and the westward-developing western Pacific subtropical high, which leads to an intensified Meiyu-Baiu-Changma front and rich Meiyu rainfall. The LBM sensitive experiments can reproduce the above physical processes associated with the TPSC anomalies, realistically. Moreover, the quantitative contributions of the indices representing the TPSC and the three oceans (Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Atlantic) to the record-breaking Meiyu rainfall are examined, and the TPSC index explains most of the total variance of the rainfall anomaly among the indices, reaching 42.75%. This highlights the importance of the TP thermal forcing to the extreme climate conditions in June 2020.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes influence the land surface temperature and vegetation in Penang Island, Peninsular Malaysia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological changes in vegetation and land of an area can be monitored and managed through the assessment of its past and present land use and land cover (LULC). In this study, we assessed the changes in the LULC of Penang Island between 2010 and 2021. We also determined the corresponding impacts on the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index in the form of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 were selected for the study. The LULC types were classified using both supervised and unsupervised multivariate maximum likelihood techniques. The LULC change analysis revealed a considerable increase in the urbanized areas (45.71%), a slight increase in the forests (1.57%) and a sizeable reduction in the agricultural/herbaceous areas (- 33.49) of the city within the stipulated period. The urbanized areas were observed to have the highest LST in 2010 and 2021 (28.75-34.0 degrees C) followed by the bare land (29.76-29 degrees C). The increase in temperature could have been driven by the reduction in the greenness of the city coupled with the openness of vegetation cover. Similarly, strong positive correlations were observed between the LST and NDVI in the urbanized areas (R-2 = 0.92), and bare lands (R-2 = 0.86). We, therefore, hypothesize that urbanization is the main driver of the LULC changes on Penang Island.

TI  - A coupled ground heat flux-surface energy balance model of evaporation using thermal remote sensing observations
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major undetermined problems in evaporation (ET) retrieval using thermal infrared remote sensing is the lack of a physically based ground heat flux (G) model and its integration within the surface energy balance (SEB) equation. Here, we present a novel approach based on coupling a thermal inertia (TI)-based mechanistic G model with an analytical surface energy balance model, Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC, version STIC1.2). The coupled model is named STIC-TI. The model is driven by noon-night (13:30 and 01:30 local time) land surface temperature, surface albedo, and a vegetation index from MODIS Aqua in conjunction with a clear-sky net radiation sub-model and ancillary meteorological information. SEB flux estimates from STIC-TI were evaluated with respect to the in situ fluxes from eddy covariance measurements in diverse ecosystems of contrasting aridity in both the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere. Sensitivity analysis revealed substantial sensitivity of STIC-TI-derived fluxes due to the land surface temperature uncertainty. An evaluation of noontime G (Gi) estimates showed 12 %-21 % error across six flux tower sites, and a comparison between STIC-TI versus empirical G models also revealed the substantially better performance of the former. While the instantaneous noontime net radiation (RNi) and latent heat flux (LEi) were overestimated (15 % and 25 %), sensible heat flux (Hi) was underestimated (22 %). Overestimation (underestimation) of LEi (Hi) was associated with the overestimation of net available energy (RNi-Gi) and use of unclosed surface energy balance flux measurements in LEi (Hi) validation. The mean percent deviations in Gi and Hi estimates were found to be strongly correlated with satellite day-night view angle difference in parabolic and linear pattern, and a relatively weak correlation was found between day-night view angle difference versus LEi deviation. Findings from this parameter-sparse coupled G-ET model can make a valuable contribution to mapping and monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of ecosystem water stress and evaporation using noon-night thermal infrared observations from future Earth observation satellite missions such as TRISHNA, LSTM, and SBG.

TI  - Climatology and interannual variability of type-dependent aerosol optical depth and vertical distribution over southwest China and northern India from multiple satellite and aerosol reanalysis datasets
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol loading and properties have an important influence on the radiative effect of aerosols and regional climate change. Based on the long-term datasets of aerosol optical products retrieved from multiple satellite observations (MODIS/Terra, MODIS/Aqua, MISR, and CALIOP/CALIPSO) and a reanalysis product (CAMS) from 2007 to 2019, the climatology and interannual variability in total aerosol optical depth (AOD) and type-dependent AODs related to aerosol particle properties and components over southwest China (SWC) and northern India (NI) are investigated, and the vertical distribution of type-dependent aerosol extinctions are also examined. Overall, consistent spatial distribution characteristics of the AOD climatology are captured across the different datasets, albeit with slight differences in magnitude. Multi-year mean high AODs are mainly concentrated in areas such as the Sichuan Basin (SCB) (similar to 0.5) and NI (similar to 0.6), dominated by anthropogenic aerosols, and the Tarim Basin (similar to 0.5), dominated by mineral dust aerosols. In contrast, the central Tibetan Plateau (CTP) area, with a relatively clean background, has a lower AOD (similar to 0.1) on a multi-year average basis. When the total AOD is separated by chemical components, the CAMS reanalysis demonstrates that sulfate and carbonaceous aerosols (CAs) contribute nearly equally to AOD in SCB, while CAs is the largest contributor to the high aerosol loading in NI. An enhanced vertical aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) is mainly located below 1 km in both SCB and NI, reaching 0.35 km(-1) and 0.55 km(-1). In CTP, the AEC has two peaks (similar to 0.02 km(-1)) at 2.5 km and 3.5 km. By partitioning the column AOD by different altitude ranges, we find that about 73.8% (80.6%) of the AOD in SCB (NI) is located in the lower troposphere (0-2 km). The resulting trend analyses show that a significant decreasing (increasing) trend (P < 0.05) in AOD in SCB (NI) is accurately captured by both the satellite products and the CAMS reanalysis. In contrast, a significant decline (P < 0.1) in the CTP region is observed in CAMS only, while a non-significant decline is detected in the satellite products. The results of this study have potential implications for understanding the vertical distribution and interannual variability of regional aerosol loading.

TI  - Microbubble contrast agent SonoVue: An efficient medium for the preoperative lymphatic mapping of thyroid carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the value of microbubble contrast agent SonoVue in the thorough preoperative lymphatic mapping of patients with thyroid carcinoma, including the lymphatic drainage region, the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN), and the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis (LNM).Materials and methods: 55 patients with 62 thyroid malignancies proved by surgical pathology (59 papillary thyroid carcinomas and three medullary thyroid carcinomas) who underwent preoperative lymphatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (LCEUS) with microbubble contrast agent SonoVue were enrolled. All LNM were confirmed by pathology. The location of thyroid lesions, ultrasonic features of lymph nodes, lymphatic drainage region, and detection of SLN were assessed. The diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy) of different parameters for the LNM diagnosis was calculated.Results: SonoVue effectively demonstrated the lymphatic drainage region for all enrolled thyroid carcinomas. The most common lymphatic drainage region for thyroid carcinomas was region VI (93.55%), followed by region III (62.90%), region IV (48.39%) and region II (4.84%). When divided by the lesion location, the most common lymphatic drainage regions for the nodule in isthmus, superior lobe and inferior lobe of the thyroid were region VI, region III, and region VI respectively. SLN was detected in 96.77% (60/62) of cases. The two cases without SLN demonstration had pathologically proven LNM. The most common sonographic sign of LNM was perfusion defect (54.17%). The diagnostic accuracy of SonoVue in central and lateral compartment LNM was 86.67% and 91.67%, respectively.Conclusion: Microbubble contrast agent SonoVue is a valuable imaging contrast medium for thorough preoperative lymphatic mapping in patients with thyroid carcinoma, including the lymphatic drainage region, the detection of SLN, and the diagnosis of LNM. LCEUS with SonoVue alone has limitations of false negatives when there is lymphatic vessel obstruction and may need to be combined with other ultrasound modalities.

TI  - Incidence of endometrial carcinoma in patients with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia versus atypical endometrial polyp
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveOur study's primary aim was to compare the incidence of endometrial carcinoma in patients with a presurgical diagnosis of endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia confined to the endometrium (EIN-E) versus endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia confined to a polyp (EIN-P). Our secondary aim was to examine the difference in pathological features, prognostic risk groups and sentinel lymph node involvement between the two groups. MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study between January 2014 and December 2020 in a tertiary university-affiliated medical center. The study considered the characteristics of women who underwent hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection for endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia (EIN). We compared EIN-E diagnosed by endometrial sampling via dilatation curettage or hysteroscopic curettage vs EIN-P. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for endometrial cancer. ResultsEighty-eight women were included in the study, of those, 50 were women with EIN-P (EIN-P group) and 38 were women with EIN following an endometrial biopsy (EIN-E group).The median age was 57.5 years (range; 52-68) in the EIN-P group as compared with 63 years (range; 53-71) in the EIN-E group (p=0.47). Eighty-nine percent of the women in the EIN-E group presented with abnormal uterine bleeding whereas 46% of the women in the EIN-P group were asymptomatic (p=0.001). Pathology results following hysterectomy revealed concurrent endometrial carcinoma in 26% of women in the EIN-P group compared with 47% of women in the EIN-E group (p=0.038). Multivariate analysis showed that endometrial cancer was significantly less common in the EIN-P group (overall response (OR)=0.3 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.1-0.9, p=0.03). Eighty-four percent of cancers were grade one in the EIN-P group compared with 50% in the EIN-E group (p=0.048). ConclusionsConcurrent endometrial cancer is less frequent with EIN-P than with EIN-E. The high incidence of endometrial carcinoma in both groups supports the current advice to perform hysterectomy for post-menopausal women. Our data does not support performing sentinel lymph node dissection for EIN-P that was completely resected. The benefit of sentinel lymph node dissection for women with pre-operative EIN-E is yet to be determined.

TI  - Local identification of groundwater dependent vegetation using high-resolution Sentinel-2 data - A Mediterranean case study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDEs) are biodiversity hotspots and provide important ecosystem services. This study presents a novel multi-instrument concept for the local identification of groundwater dependent vegetation (GDV) in the Mediterranean. The concept integrates high-resolution Sentinel-2 remote sensing data with available geodata and requires in situ vegetation data for validation and calibration. The approach com-bines five criteria to identify GDV: 1) high vitality, and wetness during dry period, 2) low seasonal changes in vitality and leaf area, 3) low interannual changes in vitality, 4) high topographic potential of water accumulation and low water table depth, 5) high potential inflow dependency. Iso Cluster Unsupervised Classification (ICUC) was applied to identify GDV in the study area (Campania, Italy). Botanical field mapping was utilized for vali-dating the remote sensing approach, as it exhibited significant differences between GDV and Non-GDV in terms of ecohydrological indicator values, leaf anatomy and phreatophyte coverage. According to a new simple eco-hydrological rule set that considers phreatophyte cover and mean moisture value of non-phreatophyte species, 9% of vegetation plots are considered GDV and 33% likely GDV. 80% of all GDV derived from classification occur in hydrostratigraphic units (HSU) that are characterized by surficial groundwater circulation and low perme-ability. The overall accuracy of classifying likelihoods is 62.7%. For 14.6% of the plots, non-GDVs were classified as GDVs (false positives), and only one GDV plot has been classified falsely as non-GDV (false negative). Local results on GDV locations can be overlayed with aquifer use or aquifer reaction to climate change in order to identify GDV under threat and implement sustainable managements of groundwater resources.

TI  - Gross primary productivity by remote sensing in the Serra das
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in anthropogenic CO2 emissions has raised the Earth's surface temperature in an anomalous and unprecedented way. Among the activities that contribute most to these increased emissions is the burning of fossil fuels and the change in land use. Part of these emissions are absorbed by terrestrial ecosystems, potentially productive and important carbon sinks (C) among them, we can mention the seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTF), which are found mainly in the Caatinga biome. Although little explored, the role they play in the global carbon (C) cycle is not negligible. Therefore, this research aimed to evaluate the seasonal behavior of biophysical vari-ables and their effect on gross primary productivity (GPP) in a Conservation Unit in the Caatinga biome. The study area is located in the Conservation Unit (UC) of the Serra das Confuso similar to es Na-tional Park, located in the southwest region of the state of Piaui. Data for the years 2010-2020 were obtained from the MODIS sensor, which is inserted in the Terra satellite. Data on air tem-perature, precipitation, relative humidity and global solar radiation were obtained from the National Institute of Meteorology. According to the results obtained, the dynamics of GPP is modulated by the seasonal distribution of precipitation, presenting an average value of 5.53 gC m- 2 day-1 in the months of higher precipitation and 1.43 gC m- 2 day-1 in the period of lower precipitation. Additionally, precipitation also exerts a strong influence on vegetation status, as observed from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) the maximum values observed during the rainy season, reflecting directly on the radiative and water components. However, even subjected to adverse environ-mental conditions, the potential of the area as a sink for C. Thus, in a future scenario of projected climate changes, and considering the vulnerability of these ecosystems, studies that evaluate the seasonal behavior of its structure and functioning is of fundamental importance for the knowledge of its resilience mechanisms and also as a contribution to the implementation of public policies that promote the conservation of the ecosystem.

TI  - Towards reliable retrievals of cloud droplet number for non-precipitating planetary boundary layer clouds and their susceptibility to aerosol
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been a key resource for developing extensive and detailed datasets for studying and constraining aerosol-cloud-climate interactions. However, aerosol-cloud collocation challenges, algorithm limitations, as well as difficulties in unraveling dynamic from aerosol-related effects on cloud microphysics, have long challenged precise retrievals of cloud droplet number concentrations. By combining a series of remote sensing techniques and in situ measurements at ground level, we developed a semi-automated approach that can address several retrieval issues for a robust estimation of cloud droplet number for non-precipitating Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) clouds. The approach is based on satellite retrievals of the PBL cloud droplet number (Ndsat) using the geostationary meteorological satellite data of the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) product, which is obtained by the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) of the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The parameters of the retrieval are optimized through closure with droplet number obtained from a combination of ground-based remote sensing data and in situ observations at ground level. More specifically, the remote sensing data are used to retrieve cloud-scale vertical velocity, and the in situ aerosol measurements at ground level were used constrain as input to a state-of-the-art droplet activation parameterization to predict the respective Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) spectra, cloud maximum supersaturation and droplet number concentration (Nd), accounting for the effects of vertical velocity distribution and lateral entrainment. Closure studies between collocated Nd and Ndsat are then used to evaluate exising droplet spectral width parameters used for the retrieval of droplet number, and determine the optimal values for retrieval. This methodology, used to study aerosol-cloud interactions for non-precipitating clouds formed over the Athens Metropolitan Area (AMA), Greece from March to May 2020, shows that droplet closure can be achieved to within 30%, comparable to the level of closure obtained in many in situ studies. Given this, the ease of applying this approach with satellite data obtained from SEVIRI with high temporal (15 min) and spatial resolution (3.6 km x 4.6 km), opens the possibility of continuous and reliable Ndsat, giving rise to high value datasets for aerosol-cloud-climate interaction studies.

TI  - Long-term multi source analysis for asphalt binder PG selection using deep learning high air temperature modelling
T2  - ROAD MATERIALS AND PAVEMENT DESIGN
M3  - Article
AB  - As asphalt binder is a temperature-dependent viscoelastic material, the asphalt pavement performance is affected by the temperature during its service life. Traditionally, selecting the asphalt binder performance grade (PG) is based on long-term meteorological data analysis, but this study used MODIS and ASTER remotely-sensed (RS), reanalysis ERA5-Land, and in-situ meteorological datasets to select the PG. The multiple linear regression (MLR), genetic algorithm (GA), and deep-learning (DL) techniques were used to create models to estimate the maximum air and road pavement surface temperatures, considering the Superpave specifications. Model parameters involved the land surface temperature, vegetation index, elevation, ERA5-Land air temperature, soil moisture, wind speed, thermal radiation, evapotranspiration, latitude, and climate type. Comparative analyses revealed that the DL model yielded the most reliable PG results and the proposed RS-based method was more accurate than conventional approaches and could determine the PG accurately with 1 km resolution independent of distance to meteorological stations.

TI  - Changing patterns of opioid initiation for pain management in Ontario, Canada: A population-based cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The recent publication of a national guideline and quality standards in Canada have provided clinicians with new, evidence-based recommendations on safe, appropriate opioid use. We sought to characterize how well opioid initiation practices aligned with these recommendations before and following their release.Methods We conducted a population-based study among people initiating opioids prior to the release of national guidelines (April 2015-March 2016; fiscal year [FY] 2015) and in the most recent year available (January-December 2019) in Ontario, Canada. We used linked administrative claims data to ascertain the apparent indication for opioid therapy, and characterized the initial daily dose (milligrams morphine or equivalent; MME) and prescription duration for each indication.Results In FY2015, 653,885 individuals commenced opioids, compared to 571,652 in 2019. Over time, there were small overall reductions in the prevalence of initial daily doses exceeding 50MME (23.9% vs. 20.1%) and durations exceeding 7 days (17.4% vs. 14.8%); but the magnitude of the reductions varied widely by indication. The prevalence of high dose (>50MME) initial prescriptions reduced significantly across all indications, with the exception of dentist-prescribed opioids (13.6% vs. 12.1% above 50MME). In contrast, there was little change in initial durations exceeding 7 days across most indications, with the exception of some surgical indications (e.g. common excision; 9.3% vs. 6.2%) and among those in palliative care (35.2% vs. 29.2%).Conclusion Despite some modest reductions in initiation of high dose and long duration prescription opioids between 2015 and 2019, clinical practice is highly variable, with opioid prescribing practices influenced by clinical indication. These findings may help identify medical specialties well-suited to targeted interventions to promote safer opioid prescribing.

TI  - Automatic extraction of highly risky coastal retreat zones using Google earth engine (GEE)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coasts have been used for settlement, agriculture, transportation, recreation, defense and trade as areas that have attracted human beings for thousands of years. The importance of coasts for humanity is more than many other natural resources. For this reason, it has been an important research topic to know how these areas, which are of ecological, economic and anthropological importance, have changed with appropriate methods. Therefore, approximately 1435 km of coastline changes stretching between the provinces of Artvin and Kirklareli, which is the Black Sea coast of Turkiye, were investigated on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform using temporal Landsat multispectral satellite data. In this study, an approach that can automatically detect coastline changes using the GEE platform is proposed. With the proposed approach, coastline changes for different temporal periods between 1985 and 2021 were analyzed using automatically generated transects. All automatic operations such as image selection, masking, enhancement, coastline extraction and transect creation were coded in GEE cloud environment using Python script language. The results obtained revealed ten hotspots of maximum coastal retreat which are three erosion and seven accretion areas, in the southern Black Sea coastal zone. While the maximum amount of change in the erosion zones is about - 634 m, it has reached up to 1204 m for accretion zones. This study is an automatic GEE-based coastline extraction procedure which uses novel techniques for fast evaluation of coastal retreat, and it is expected to contribute decision-makers as a rapid coastline change evaluation tool for accurate and reliable decisions on coastal management and planning. This work will also serve as a basis for the future activities to be carried out in this field.

TI  - Basin-scale gyres and mesoscale eddies in large lakes: a novel procedure fortheir detection and characterization, assessed in Lake Geneva
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In large lakes subject to the Coriolis force, basin-scale gyres and mesoscale eddies, i.e. rotating coherent water masses, play a key role in spreading biochemical materials and energy throughout the lake. In order to assess the spatial and temporal extent of gyres and eddies, their dynamics and vertical structure, as well as to validate their prediction in numerical simulation results, detailed transect field observations are needed. However, at present it is difficult to forecast when and where such transect field observations should be taken. To overcome this problem, a novel procedure combining 3D numerical simulations, statistical analyses, and remote sensing data was developed that permits determination of the spatial and temporal patterns of basin-scale gyres during different seasons. The proposed gyre identification procedure consists of four steps: (i) data pre-processing, (ii) extracting dominant patterns using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of Okubo-Weiss parameter fields, (iii) defining the 3D structure of the gyre, and (iv) finding the correlation between the dominant gyre pattern and environmental forcing. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed procedure was validated in Lake Geneva. For the first time in a lake, detailed field evidence of the existence of basin-scale gyres and (sub)mesoscale eddies was provided by data collected along transects whose locations were predetermined by the proposed procedure. The close correspondence between field observations and detailed numerical results further confirmed the validity of the model for capturing large-scale current circulations as well as (sub)mesoscale eddies. The results also indicated that the horizontal gyre motion is mainly determined by wind stress, whereas the vertical current structure, which is influenced by the gyre flow field, primarily depends on thermocline depth and strength. The procedure can be applied to other large lakes and can be extended to the interaction of biological-chemical-physical processes.

TI  - Global methyl halide emissions from biomass burning during 2003-2021
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Methyl halides (CH3Cl, CH3Br, and CH3I) are ozone-depleting substances. Biomass burning (BB) is an important source of methyl halides. The temporal variations and global spatial distribution of BB methyl halide emissions are unclear. Thus, global methyl halide emissions from BB during 2003-2021 were estimated based on satellite data. A significant decreasing trend (p < 0.01) in global methyl halide emissions from BB was found between 2003 and 2021, with CH3Cl emissions decreasing from 302 to 220 Gg yr1, CH3Br emissions decreasing from 16.5 to 11.7 Gg yr1, and CH3I emissions decreasing from 8.9 to 6.1 Gg yr1. From a latitudinal perspective, the northern high-latitude region (60-90 degrees N) was the only latitude zone with significant increases in BB methyl halide emissions (p < 0.01). Based on an analysis of the drivers of BB methyl halide emissions, emissions from cropland, grassland, and shrubland fires were more correlated with the burned area, while BB emissions from forest fires were more correlated with the emissions per unit burned area. The non-BB emissions of CH3Cl increased from 4749 Gg yr1 in 2003 to 4882 Gg yr1 in 2020, while those of CH3Br decreased from 136 Gg yr1 in 2003 to 118 Gg yr1 in 2020 (global total CH3I emissions are not available). The finding indicates that global CH3Cl and CH3Br emissions from sources besides BB increased and decreased during 2003-2020. Based on our findings, not only searching for unknown sources is important, but also re-evaluating known sources is necessary for addressing methyl halide emissions. (c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Effects of brown seaweed extract, silicon, and selenium on fruit quality and yield of tomato under different substrates
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomatoes (Lycopersicun esculentum L.) are an important group of vegetable crops that have high economical and nutritional value. The use of fertilizers and appropriate substrates is one of the important strategies that can assist in increasing the yield and quality of fruits. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous seaweed extract (Nizamuddinia zanardinii), silicon (Na2SiO3), and selenium (Na2SeO3) on quality attributes and fruit yield (FY) of tomato under palm peat + perlite and coco peat + perlite substrates. Seaweed extract significantly improved several of the fruit quality attributes such as total carbohydrate content, total soluble solids (TSS), and pH as well as the FY. The results showed that silicon (Si) (75 mg) was the best foliar spray treatment to enhance the fruit firmness (30.46 N), fruit volume (196.8 cm(3)), and FY (3320.5 g). The highest amount of plant yield (3429.33 g) was obtained by the interaction effects of silicon (75 mg L-1) under the effect of palm peat. The use of selenium (Se) led to improvements in flavor index (TSS/TA). Also, the application of palm peat + perlite substrate caused an increase in vitamin C (16.62 mg/100g FW), compared to other substrates (14.27 mg/100g FW). The present study suggested that foliar spray with seaweed extract and Si had beneficial effects on the quality and FY of tomatoes. Also, the palm peat substrate can be used as a good alternative to the coco peat substrate in the hydroponic system.

TI  - Unravelling global future scenarios in the perspective of bioeconomy planning
T2  - BIOMASS & BIOENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The transition to bioeconomy and the broader low-fossil carbon economy requires long-term investments, whose environmental and economic performance will be affected by various future conditions. When assessing the consequences of such future investments, considering multiple background future scenarios instead of one single projection could greatly enhance the robustness of the decision support. Here, we systematically reviewed six internationally well-recognized global envi-ronmental scenario studies and one intelligence report, selected as highly relevant in terms of bioeconomy implications. The aim was to uncover the key variables and cause-effect relationships at play in these scenario studies. Through constructing causal loop diagrams for each reviewed study, we identified the variables with the greatest number of causal connections, the "cause " and "effect " variables, and the most reported cause-effect relationships across all studies. Our main findings are: (1) the top 5 causal variables are mitigation policies, technological progress, consumers' awareness, economic growth and education level, while (2) the top 5 affected variables are climate change, materials use, food security, natural ecosystems, and social justice. Amongst the top 10 causal and affected variables (3), 68 connected pairs were identified with no disagreement in their causal relationship direction. The three most reported pairs were (4) mitigation policy-* climate change, healthy and sustainable diet-* land use, and population-* materials use. Finally, (5) we highlighted that all the reviewed studies share a limited worldview where economy and cost-competitiveness is the dominant consideration defining the future sustainability.

TI  - Spatial variation in groundwater depletion across China under multiple stresses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater, an essential component of the hydrological cycle, has been subject to intense pressure worldwide over recent decades, such that reserves have changed appreciably, challenging our ability to deliver on water resource protection goals. While the changes in storage can be quantified, there is little information about what drives the changes in groundwater storage (GWS) and how the impacts of those drivers vary spatially and temporally. In this study, the spatial and temporal variations in GWS across China from 2002 to 2016 are studied, and how GWS was influenced by natural and anthropogenic drivers at multiple scales is examined using Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data. The national-scale GWS declined continuously at a rate of -0.27 cm/a over the study period. Interesingly, the difference in the GWS change between the south (increasing) and the north (decreasing) was decreasing, while the gap between the east (increasing) and the west (decreasing) was becoming wider. The main drivers of GWS changes at the national and regional scales were precipitation, agricultural water consumption, and the total population, while industrial water consumption, domestic water consumption, and evapotranspiration were important at the regional and provincial scales. Policies recently implemented to protect GWS have been effective. Given the potential for GWS changes to have impacts at multiple scales, policies and goals should address the drivers of GWS changes at different scales.

TI  - Mind the gap: theories in Islamic accounting and finance, Islamic economics and business management studies
T2  - ISRA INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC FINANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to analyse whether theories and views of classical Islamic scholars are widely adopted as references in Islamic accounting and finance (IAF), Islamic economics (IE) and Islamic business management (IBM) research studies as part of their contribution to solving current economic and financial problems. Design/methodology/approach - The research adopts a qualitative meta-analysis methodology using NVivo 12 with selected data from 474 international journal articles published between 1981 and 2021. The study considers 172 IAF articles, 111 IE articles and 191 IBM articles.Findings - The results of the study show that the use of theories and views of classical Islamic scholars is not widespread among the examined research papers. The findings show that 90% of researchers tend to acquire modern economics, management, psychological and sociological theories instead of classical theories. Both modern and classical theories have been discussed in the studied articles namely agency theory, stakeholders' theory, h_isbah (accountability), maqas_id al-Shari?ah (objectives of Islamic law) and wa?d (unilateral promise). The gaps prevail not only in the taxonomy of terms but also in the choice of paradigm references. It is found that 66% of the 474 journal articles adopt a positivist paradigm, followed by interpretivism (19%), post structuralism (9%) and critical orientation (6%).Research limitations/implications - This paper considers only ABS ranking journal articles. Future research may consider other journal articles from different ranking groups such as Scopus or Thomson & Reuters.Practical implications - The paper sheds light on how Islamic educational institutions can develop strategies for the Integration of Knowledge (IOK) in their curriculum. Social implications - This paper helps to shape the Muslims' way of thinking within an Islamic worldview which will lead to an Islamic way of expressing knowledge, skill and behaviour.Originality/value - This paper contributes to the model of IOK that has been deliberated among Islamic universities, especially those that develop IAF, IE and IBM studies.

TI  - Genomic epidemiology of <i>Escherichia coli</i>: antimicrobial resistance through a One Health lens in sympatric humans, livestock and peri-domestic wildlife in Nairobi, Kenya
T2  - BMC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Livestock systems have been proposed as a reservoir for antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria and AMR genetic determinants that may infect or colonise humans, yet quantitative evidence regarding their epidemiological role remains lacking. Here, we used a combination of genomics, epidemiology and ecology to investigate patterns of AMR gene carriage in Escherichia coli, regarded as a sentinel organism. Methods: We conducted a structured epidemiological survey of 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya, and whole genome sequenced E. coli isolates from 311 human, 606 livestock and 399 wildlife faecal samples. We used statistical models to investigate the prevalence of AMR carriage and characterise AMR gene diversity and structure of AMR genes in different host populations across the city. We also investigated household-level risk factors for the exchange of AMR genes between sympatric humans and livestock. Results: We detected 56 unique acquired genes along with 13 point mutations present in variable proportions in human and animal isolates, known to confer resistance to nine antibiotic classes. We find that AMR gene community composition is not associated with host species, but AMR genes were frequently co-located, potentially enabling the acquisition and dispersal of multi-drug resistance in a single step. We find that whilst keeping livestock had no influence on human AMR gene carriage, the potential for AMR transmission across human-livestock interfaces is greatest when manure is poorly disposed of and in larger households. Conclusions: Findings of widespread carriage of AMR bacteria in human and animal populations, including in long-distance wildlife species, in community settings highlight the value of evidence-based surveillance to address antimicrobial resistance on a global scale. Our genomic analysis provided an in-depth understanding of AMR determinants at the interfaces of One Health sectors that will inform AMR prevention and control.

TI  - Estimation of sound speed profiles based on remote sensing parameters using a scalable end-to-end tree boosting model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn underwater acoustic applications, the three-dimensional sound speed distribution has a significant impact on signal propagation. However, the traditional sound speed profile (SSP) measurement method requires a lot of manpower and time, and it is difficult to popularize. Satellite remote sensing can collect information on a large ocean surface area, from which the underwater information can be derived. MethodIn this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing the SSP based on an extensible end-to-end tree boosting (XGBoost) model. Combined with satellite remote sensing data and Argo profile data, it extracts the characteristic matrix of the SSP and analyzes the contribution rate of each order matrix to reduce the introduction of noise. The model inverts the SSP above 1000 m in the South China Sea by using the root mean square error (RMSE) as the precision evaluation index. ResultThe results showed that the XGBoost model could better reconstruct the SSP above 1000 m, with a RMSE of 1.75 m/s. Compared with the single empirical orthogonal function regression (sEOF-r) model of the linear regression method, the RMSE of the XGBoost model was reduced by 0.59 m/s. DiscussionFor this model, the RMSE of the inversion results was smaller, the robustness was better, and the regression performance was superior to that of the sEOF-r model at different depths. This study provided an efficient tree boosting model for SSP reconstruction, which could reliably and instantaneously monitor the 3D sound speed distribution.

TI  - Sentinel surveillance and epidemiology of<i> Clostridioides</i><i> difficile</i> in Denmark, 2016 to 2019
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since 2008, Danish national surveillance of Clostridioides difficile has focused on binary toxin -positive strains in order to monitor epidemic types such as PCR ribotype (RT) 027 and 078. Additional sur-veillance is needed to provide a more unbiased repre-sentation of all strains from the clinical reservoir.Aim: Setting up a new sentinel surveillance scheme for an improved understanding of type distribution relative to time, geography and epidemiology, here presenting data from 2016 to 2019. Methods: For 24 weeks in spring and autumn each year between 2016 and 2019, all 10 Danish Departments of Clinical Microbiology collected faecal samples containing toxigenic C. dif-ficile. Isolates were typed at the national reference laboratory at Statens Serum Institut. The typing method in 2016-17 used tandem-repeat-sequence typing, while the typing method in 2018-19 was whole genome sequencing.Results: During the study period, the sentinel surveillance scheme included ca 14-15% of all Danish cases of C. difficile infections. Binary toxin-negative strains accounted for 75% and 16 of the 20 most prevalent types. The most common sequence types (ST) were ST2/13 (RT014/020) (19.5%), ST1 (RT027) (10.8%), ST11 (RT078) (6.7%), ST8 (RT002) (6.6%) and ST6 (RT005/117) (5.1%). The data also highlighted geographical differences, mostly related to ST1 and temporal decline of ST1 (p = 0.0008) and the increase of ST103 (p = 0.002), ST17 (p = 0.004) and ST37 (p = 0.003), the latter three binary toxin-negative.Conclusion: Sentinel surveillance allowed nationwide monitoring of geographical differences and temporal changes in C. difficile infections in Denmark, including emerging types, regardless of binary toxin status.

TI  - Mapping dead understorey Buxus hyrcana Pojark using Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hyrcanian Forests comprise a continuous 800-km belt of mostly deciduous broadleaf forests and are considered as Iran's most important vegetation region in terms of density, canopy cover and species diversity. One of the few evergreen species of the Hyrcanian Forests is the box tree (Buxus), which is seriously threatened by box blight disease and box tree moth outbreaks. Therefore, information on the spatial distribution of intact and infested box trees is essential for recovery monitoring, control treatment and management. To address this critical knowledge gap, we integrated a genetic algorithm (GA) with a support vector machine (SVM) ensemble classification based on the combination of leaf-off optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 data to map the spatial distribution of box tree mortality. We additionally considered the overstorey species composition to account for a potential impact of overstory stand composition on the spectral signature of understorey defoliation. We consequently defined target classes based on the combination of dominant overstorey trees (using two measures including the relative frequency and the diameter at breast height) and two defoliation levels of box trees (including dead and healthy box trees). Our classification workflow applied a GA to simultaneously derive optimal vegetation indices (VIs) and tuning parameters of the SVM. Then the distribution of box tree defoliation was mapped by an SVM ensemble with bagging using GA-optimized VIs and radar data. The GA results revealed that normalized difference vegetation index, red edge normalized difference vegetation index and green normalized difference vegetation index were appropriate for box tree defoliation mapping. An additional comparison of GA-SVM (using GA-optimized VIs and tuning parameters) with a simple SVM (using all VIs and user-based tuning parameters) showed that our suggested workflow performs notably better than the simple SVM (overall accuracy of 0.79 vs 0.74). Incorporating Sentinel-1 data to GA-SVM, marginally improved the performance of the model (overall accuracy: 0.80). The SVM ensemble model using Sentinel-2 and -1 data yielded high accuracies and low uncertainties in mapping of box tree defoliation. The results showed that infested box trees were mostly located at low elevations, low slope and facing north. We conclude that mortality of evergreen understorey tree species can be mapped with good accuracies using freely available satellite data if a suitable work-flow is applied.

TI  - Toward consistent change detection across irregular remote sensing time series observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing in time series analysis enables wall-to-wall monitoring of the land surface and is critical for assessing and understanding land cover and land use change and for understanding the Earth system as a whole. However, variability in remote sensing observation frequency through time and across space presents challenges for producing consistent change detection results throughout the available satellite record using approaches such as the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) change detection methodology. Here we investigate new modifications to this methodology with the goal of improving accuracy and consistency in results and increasing flexibility for operational usage and future development. The modified method (Band-First Probability, or CCD-BFP) change detection procedure works by calculating a test for each band through time before summarizing between bands. We evaluate the CCD-BFP method compared to an existing implementation of CCDC using a variety of approaches, including a validation dataset of human -interpreted locations, comparison with data from fire events, use of simulated remote sensing data, and qualitative inspection of areas of interest. We find CCD-BFP improves consistency across time and space compared to the existing implementation of CCDC, with more similarity in rates of change across Landsat swath boundaries and before and after the launch of Landsat 7. Also, we find that CCD-BFP detects more of the change events in the validation dataset while reducing the overall number of change detections, indicating that it is able to more accurately capture the most notable land surface change events.

TI  - Litho-structural mapping and structural evolution of the Bocaranga pluton, northwest Adamawa-Yad acute accent e domain, Central African Republic
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bocaranga pluton, in the northern domain of the Central African Orogenic Belt (CAOB) in the Central African Republic (CAR), is located in the Adamawa-Yade acute accent domain, near the Mbe acute accent re acute accent Shear Zone (MBSZ). This study pro-vides new results of the satellite image processing, the detailed structural and petrographic studies of Bocaranga pluton which helps to understand the emplacement mechanism of this pluton. Image processing of the satellite data and field showed the occurrence and spatial distribution of (1) amphibole-pyroxenites, (2) garnet-biotite rich amphibolite, (3) migmatite, (4) hornblende-biotite and hornblende-garnet gneiss, (5) hornblende-biotite granite (HBG), (6) two micas granite (TMG), (7) fine-grained biotite granite (FBG), and (8) coarse-grained biotite granite (CBG) rock types. The mapping of regional lineaments was carried out by automatic and manual lineament extraction methods. NE-SW direction corresponds to the direction of S2 and S3 foliations, faults, mineral lineation, quartz vein, dyke (aplitic granitic or pegmatitic). NW-SE direction also corresponds to the direction of S1 foliation, F1 folds, faults, quartz veins, dykes (aplitic granitic or pegmatitic). In the absence of absolute geochronological data in study area, it has been possible to propose a polyphase structural evolution, deduced from the relative chronology of the Bocaranga granitoid. Three phases of deformation can be defined in this study. D1 phase is represented by early NW-SE trending foliation (S1) that has been progressively rotated parallel to S2 overprinting foliation occurring in gneiss, amphibolites and hornblende-biotite granite (HBG) intrusion as well. D2 phase of ductile sinistral sense from NE-SW to ENE-WSW is responsible for an emplacement of Bocaranga granitic pluton. The scarcity of structure orientation in the TMG and FBG (except the contact zones), would imply that these granites would have been crystallized in the absence of any stress. D3 is a phase of brittle deformation with three main directions corresponding to the main direction of the shear zones in the Northern domain of the CAR Pan-African fold belt.The mylonitic deformation observed in study area illustrates the intensity of the deformation. The dominance of ellipsoidal structures observed in Bocaranga area suggests that the shear mechanism is the main controlling structure of Bocaranga granite emplacement, which can be correlated with the emplacement of Tamkoro-Bossangoa granitoid in CAR and the Adamawa-Yade acute accent domain in Cameroon, Chad and NE Brazil.These results imply a syntectonic emplacement of Bocaranga pluton during sinistral simple shear regime related to deformation along the Central Cameroon Shear Zone (CCSZ).

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes in soil organic carbon and soil inorganic carbon stocks in the semi-arid area of northeast China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil inorganic carbon (SIC) has important effects on soil physical, chemical and biological properties. They play an important role in coordinating the relationship between soil water and air, increasing soil water holding capacity and improving plant productivity. In this study, a boosted regression trees (BRT) model was developed to map the spatial distribution carbon stocks in the semi-arid region of Northeast China in 1990 and 2015. During the two periods, 10-fold cross-validation technology was used to test the performance and uncertainty of BRT model. In order to construct the model, 9 environmental variables (derived from climate, topography and biology) and 173 (1990) and 223 (2015) topsoil (0-30 cm) samples were used. The comparison between estimated and observed data shows that the RMSE of SOC and SIC stocks were 0.53 kgm(-2) and 0.19 kgm(-2) in 1990, and 0.65 kgm(-2) and 0.20 kgm(-2) in 2015, respectively. Elevation, normalized difference vegetation index, mean annual precipitation and Landsat band 3 were identifies as critical environmental factors for simulating the spatial distribution of SOC, accounting for 76.6 % and 70.3 % of the total relative importance in 1990 and 2015, respectively. Mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature and topographic wetness index were the critical environmental factors for simulating the spatial variation of SIC during the two periods. Land use change also played an important role in the spatial variability of SOC and SIC stocks. In the past 25 years, soil carbon stocks decreased from 6.2 kg m(-2) in 1990 to 5.9 kg m(-2) in 2015. The spatial distribution pattern of SOC was high in northeastern area and low in southwestern area during the two periods, while the spatial distribution pattern of SIC was opposite to that of SOC stocks. The mapped soil carbon stock distribution is fundamental to future study of soil carbon cycle and regional carbon balance in semi-arid regions.

TI  - Social and ritual practices behind the construction of stele monuments in Gedeo Zone, south Ethiopia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Stele monuments, whether constructed for burial or other ritual purposes, are products of human actions that leave material traces that can be investigated from past action places. The Gedeo stele monuments, as material manifestations in the landscape, has the potential to answer some of the past social practices, and social relations that created and transformed the stelae monuments in the region. By shaping and erecting thousands of stelae, past societies materialized and imprinted their cosmology, worldview, and history; in the process changed the natural landscape permanently. The wider distribution of the stelae traditions in south Ethiopia manifests its important role in society. Many of the stele sites in the region were (and are) places for ritual and ceremonial practices. Stelae in the region vary in construction time, size, function, engraved signs, and arrangement in the landscape. Existing archaeological evidence suggests that the Gedeo stele landscapes represent one of the earliest megalithic stele traditions in Ethiopia. Archaeological dates have placed the earliest date for stele construction in south Ethiopia between the first centuries BC and AD.

TI  - Learning Coefficient Heterogeneity over Networks: A Distributed Spanning-Tree-Based Fused-Lasso Regression
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Identifying the latent cluster structure based on model heterogeneity is a fundamental but challenging task arises in many machine learning applications. In this article, we study the clustered coefficient regression problem in the distributed network systems, where the data are locally collected and held by nodes. Our work aims to improve the regression estimation efficiency by aggregating the neighbors' information while also identifying the cluster membership for nodes. To achieve efficient estimation and clustering, we develop a distributed spanning-tree-based fused-lasso regression (DTFLR) approach. In particular, we propose an adaptive spanning-tree-based fusion penalty for the low-complexity clustered coefficient regression. We show that our proposed estimator satisfies statistical oracle properties. Additionally, to solve the problem parallelly, we design a distributed generalized alternating direction method of multiplier algorithm, which has a simple node-based implementation scheme and enjoys a linear convergence rate. Collectively, our results in this article contribute to the theories of low-complexity clustered coefficient regression and distributed optimization over networks. Thorough numerical experiments and real-world data analysis are conducted to verify our theoretical results, which show that our approach outperforms existing works in terms of estimation accuracy, computation speed, and communication costs. for this article are available online.

TI  - Seasonal peak photosynthesis is hindered by late canopy development in northern ecosystems
T2  - NATURE PLANTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal dynamics of the vegetation canopy strongly regulate the surface energy balance and terrestrial carbon fluxes, providing feedbacks to climate change. Whether the seasonal timing of maximum canopy structure was optimized to achieve a maximum photosynthetic carbon uptake is still not clear due to the complex interactions between abiotic and biotic factors. We used two solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence datasets as proxies for photosynthesis and the normalized difference vegetation index and leaf area index products derived from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer as proxies for canopy structure, to characterize the connection between their seasonal peak timings from 2000 to 2018. We found that the seasonal peak was earlier for photosynthesis than for canopy structure in > 87.5% of the northern vegetated area, probably leading to a suboptimal maximum seasonal photosynthesis. This mismatch in peak timing significantly increased during the study period, mainly due to the increasing atmospheric CO2, and its spatial variation was mainly explained by climatic variables (43.7%) and nutrient limitations (29.6%). State-of-the-art ecosystem models overestimated this mismatch in peak timing by simulating a delayed seasonal peak of canopy development. These results highlight the importance of incorporating the mechanisms of vegetation canopy dynamics to accurately predict the maximum potential terrestrial uptake of carbon under global environmental change.

TI  - Integrating eco-evolutionary optimality principle and land processes for evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays an important role in land surface processes and global climate. ET cannot be observed directly at a large scale, and its spatial distribution is mainly obtained by ET models at present. However, the application of existing ET models is greatly hampered by a number of plant functional type (PFT)-specific empirical parameters and the difficulty in partitioning the contribution of ET from the canopy and soil. To this end, an eco-evolutionary optimality-based evapotranspiration model (EEOET) was developed in this study with some schemes used in the Noah-MP land surface model. The principle of eco-evolutionary optimality expresses the underlying acclimation/adaption of plants to diverse environments and thus greatly reduces the number of PFT-specific parameters. The Noah-MP provides schemes to partition the energy between the canopy and soil and to calculate photosynthetic and ET resistances. Owing to the above, the EEOET model, which has enhanced mechanisms and fewer PFT-specific parameters, requires inputs of daily land surface temperature, vegetation-related data (leaf area index and fractional vegetation), and soil information (soil texture and soil water content) in addition to routine meteorological data. The model output is daily ET. Global evaluation across 74 FLUXNET sites indicates that the model is capable of reasonably estimating ET for all PFTs and is also comparable to existing models that require more tunable parameters. In addition, the EEOET model is less sensitive to uncertainties in the input data than other models, making it a more robust solution for estimating ET under various conditions.

TI  - Geo environmental green growth towards sustainable development in semi-arid regions using physicochemical and geospatial approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The process of determining whether a specific portion of land is suitable for a specific purpose is known as land suitability analysis (LSA). In order to promote sustainable development in semi-arid regions, the objective of this study is to analyse, evaluate, and identify the land for green growth based on topography, climate, and soil characteristics. Twelve thematic maps are prepared by using remote sensing satellite data. The Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS is used for the preparation of the thematic maps like land use land cover (LULC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), top soil grain size index (TGSI), and geomorphology (GM), and DEM data is used for the preparation slope, and drainage density (DD). The collateral data is used to prepare geology and soil thematic maps. From the field work, we have collected soil samples for the compulsory physicochemical parameters such as soil EC and soil N-P-K which were taken into consideration and prepared thematic maps. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to generate the LSA of the research region, by assigning the appropriate weights to each criterion and sub-criterion for the thematic maps. Geographic information systems (GIS) and the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach were used in the study's methodology. The LSA of the study area has been categories in to four types, i.e., highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and not suitable. The results revealed that 421.31 sq.km (40.09%) is not suitable for agriculture green growth in the study region, whereas 89.58 sq.km (8.52%) is moderately suitable, 267.66 sq.km (25.47%) is marginally suitable, and 266.54 sq.km (25.36%) is highly suitable. Accuracy assessment has validated the LSA map's accuracy (AA). The AA of LSA is 84.22%, which demonstrates a strong connection with the actual data. The research's results could be helpful in locating productive agricultural areas in various parts of the world. The decision-making AHP tool paired with GIS provides a novel method.

TI  - Country-wide retrieval of forest structure from optical and SAR satellite with ensembles
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and managing Earth's forests in an informed manner is an important requirement for addressing challenges like biodiversity loss and climate change. While traditional in situ or aerial campaigns for forest assessments provide accurate data for analysis at regional level, scaling them to entire countries and beyond with high temporal resolution is hardly possible. In this work, we propose a method based on deep ensembles that densely estimates forest structure variables at country-scale with 10-m resolution, using freely available satellite imagery as input. Our method jointly transforms Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 synthetic -aperture radar images into maps of five different forest structure variables: 95th height percentile, mean height, density, Gini coefficient, and fractional cover. We train and test our model on reference data from 41 airborne laser scanning missions across Norway and demonstrate that it is able to generalize to unseen test regions, achieving normalized mean absolute errors between 11% and 15%, depending on the variable. Our work is also the first to propose a variant of so-called Bayesian deep learning to densely predict multiple forest structure variables with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates from satellite imagery. The uncertainty information increases the trustworthiness of the model and its suitability for downstream tasks that require reliable confidence estimates as a basis for decision making. We present an extensive set of experiments to validate the accuracy of the predicted maps as well as the quality of the predicted uncertainties. To demonstrate scalability, we provide Norway-wide maps for the five forest structure variables.

TI  - Self-Other Balance in Context: A Quiet Ego May Be Meaningful and Adaptive in Latinx/Hispanic Cultures and Work Settings
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL REPORTS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Quiet ego is a relatively novel, increasingly studied, multi-dimensional concept characterized by a compassionate, interdependent worldview and an adaptive balance between self-interest and concern for others. Quiet ego has been associated with a range of characteristics that can promote relationship quality, responding effectively in the face of challenges, and greater well-being. However, it is currently unknown to what extent quiet ego translates across cultures and settings. The present research leverages cultural and organizational theories to evaluate the conceptual and structural validity of quiet ego for Latinx/Hispanic individuals in the U.S. and to examine relationships among quiet ego, work supervisor relationship quality, and goals in the workplace. Employed college student participants (n = 831; n(Latinx/Hispanic) = 305) completed an online survey, and collected data were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis. Findings confirmed the overall structural model of quiet ego with four primary dimensions (perspective taking, inclusive identity, detached awareness, and growth-mindedness) and indicated that this structure did not differ between Latinx/Hispanic and non-Latinx/Hispanic subsamples. Further, results cohered with the proposed model suggesting that quiet ego might facilitate relationship quality with a workplace supervisor, which, in turn could foster balanced, intrinsically motivating perceptions that one's work goals benefit both oneself and others (mutual gain motivation). The study suggests that quiet ego may be a construct with meaning and utility in Latinx/Hispanic populations and in employment settings. However, further research is needed, and specific suggestions for future study are discussed.

TI  - Synergistic effects of climate and salinity on radial growth of<i> Excoecaria</i><i> agallocha</i> L. in the Sundarbans world heritage mangrove ecosystem
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sundarbans World Heritage ecosystem provides valuable ecosystem goods and services to >7.5 million coastal people in South Asia. This sentinel mangrove ecosystem is threatened by historical anthropogenic dis-turbances, salinity intrusion and long-term environmental changes including sea level rise. Understanding which factors regulate mangroves' growth is crucial for taking effective management decisions under global changes. However, a paucity of long-term mangrove tree growth data has limited our ability to quantify and predict the impacts of global changes on mangrove ecosystems. Using long-term growth data archived from the stem discs, this study, therefore, aims to understand how climatic and habitat variables influence radial growth dynamics in Excoecaria agallocha, a hyperdominant mangrove species in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. We find E. agallocha forms a distinct tree-ring boundary characterized by a narrow (2-4 cells wide) band of radially flattened fibres. The crossdatable tree-rings enabled us to develop two ecological zone-specific (low and high saline zone) chronologies (1972-2020) covering the entire salinity stress gradient present in the Sundarbans. Our analyses show: (I) radial growth rate in E. agallocha is significantly lower in the high saline zone, (II) monsoonal pre-cipitation enhances radial growth, (III) large-scale climate drivers, such as sea surface temperature (SST) of the equatorial Pacific and the Indian Ocean, and the El Nin similar to o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influence tree growth through modifying the local precipitation in varying seasons, and (IV) local habitat variables, such as soil salinity and siltation have combined effects on radial growth of trees although soil salinity exhibits stronger negative effect. Our results highlight the importance of integrating both climate and local habitat variables with tree-ring data for a better understanding of tree growth dynamics under changing environment.

TI  - Axillary reverse mapping using near-infrared fluorescence imaging in invasive breast cancer (ARMONIC study)
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with breast cancer has potential side effects, including upper-limb lymphedema. Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) is a technique that enables discrimination of the lymphatic drainage of the upper limb in the axillary lymph node basin from that of the breast. We aimed to evaluate ARM node identification by near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging during total mastectomy with ALND and then to analyze potential predictive factors of ARM node involvement.Methods: The study enrolled 119 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer with an indication for ALND. NIR imaging using indocyanine green dye was performed in 109 patients during standard ALND to identify ARM nodes and their corresponding lymphatic ducts.Results: 94.5% of patients had ARM nodes identified (95%CI 1/4 [88.4-98.0]). The ARM nodes were localized in zone D in 63.4% of cases. Metastatic axillary lymph nodes were found in 55% in the whole cohort, and 19.4% also had metastasis in ARM nodes. Two patients had metastatic ARM nodes but not in the remaining axillary lymph nodes. No serious adverse events were observed. Only the amount of mitosis was significantly associated with ARM node metastasis. Conclusions: ARM by NIR fluorescence imaging could be a reliable technique to identify ARM nodes in real-time when ALND is performed. The clinical data compared with ARM node histological diagnosis showed only the amount of mitosis in the diagnostic biopsy is a potential predictive factor of ARM node involvement.

TI  - Intellectual humility and religious convictions: when does virtue become vice?
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ballantyne's call for 'reality-orientedness' as a core concept of intellectual humility (IH), though laudable, is too general to unify the field. Rather than pursuing an unlikely consensus, what will likely be more successful in moving the field forward will be greater clarity about how our culturally-based ideologies - discussed as 'worldviews' - shape the understanding, experience, and manifestation of IH. Failing to account for these differences, which has heretofore characterized much IH research, leads to problematic results in the existing IH empirical literature. The focus here is on religious worldviews, where the disregard of worldview is surprising given that humility, including intellectual humility, is consistently valued in major world religions. A worldview approach as a way forward for empirical research is illustrated by discussing how two religious/philosophical traditions - a theistic Christian tradition, and a Buddhist tradition - might conceptualize IH. Implications for measurement are discussed through an example of a theistic IH measure.

TI  - L-Band Analysis of the Effects of Oil Slicks on Sea Wave Characteristics
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of sea surface waves as they pass through oil slicks. The parameterized first-guess spectrum method (PFSM) theory-based wave retrieval algorithm was applied to 20 images of horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization obtained using the phased-array L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (PALSAR) on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1). The images were collocated with simulations from the WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) model in a 0.1 & DEG; grid using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA-5) winds data as the forcing field. The validation of the model-simulated significant wave height (SWH) against the measurements from the Jason-2 altimeter produced a 0.66 m root mean square error (RMSE) for the SWH, with a coefficient (COR) 0.74. In this sense, the WW3-simulated waves were reliable for our work. A comparison between the SAR retrieval results and the WW3 simulations was performed using the dataset for the regions without oil slicks, which produced a 0.34 m RMSE for the SWH, with a COR of 0.79, which is less than a the RMSE of 0.52 m and the COR of 0.70 for the regions with oil slicks. Moreover, it was found that the SAR-derived SWHs were significantly underestimated by about 0.2 m in the areas with oil slicks. This difference is probably due to the underestimation of the SAR-derived wind speeds at moderate wind speeds (i.e., at wind speeds of greater than 5 m s(-1)). An additional analysis compared the SAR-derived wave spectra with those from the WW3 model as waves passed through the oil slicks. The interesting finding is that the wave energy at short wave lengths (about 30 m) is reduced by the oil slicks, causing the movement of the dominant wave spectrum to shift to longer wave lengths (about 80 m).

TI  - The roles and impacts of worldviews in the context of meditation-related challenges
T2  - TRANSCULTURAL PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has shown that worldviews can serve as a coping response to periods of difficulty or struggle, and worldviews can also change on account of difficulty. This paper investigates the impacts worldviews have on the nature and trajectory of meditation-related challenges, as well as how worldviews change or are impacted by such challenges. The context of meditation-related challenges provided by data from the Varieties of Contemplative Experience research project offers a unique insight into the dynamics between worldviews and meditation. Buddhist meditation practitioners and meditation experts interviewed for the study report how, for some, worldviews can serve as a risk factor impacting the onset and trajectory of meditation-related challenges, while, for others, worldviews (e.g., being given a worldview, applying a worldview, or changing a worldview) were reported as a remedy for mitigating challenging experiences and/or their associated distress. Buddhist meditation practitioners and teachers in the contemporary West are also situated in a cultural context in which religious and scientific worldviews and explanatory frameworks are dually available. Furthermore, the context of "Buddhist modernism" has also promoted a unique configuration in which the theory and practice of Buddhism is presented as being closely compatible with science. We identify and discuss the various impacts that religious and scientific worldviews have on meditation practitioners and meditation teachers who navigate periods of challenge associated with the practice.

TI  - Preventing the Perfect Storm of Forest Mortality in the United States Caused by Invasive Species
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Invasive species are a growing global threat to forest ecosystems. In North America, previous invasions have functionally eliminated the American chestnut (Castanea dentata), a keystone and commercially important species in eastern North American forests, and currently threaten to eliminate other important species, such as ash (Fraxinus spp.), redbay (Persea borbonia), and eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis). Invasive species, particularly invasive insects, pathogens, and plants, threaten forest ecosystem integrity and put commercial forestry at risk. However, as the threat from invasive species grows due to expanding international trade, the scientific workforce with specialized expertise and training to mitigate current threats and, more importantly, avoid future threats, has been declining over the past 40 years. Research funding and administrative capacity to respond have also not kept pace with increased frequency and risk of species introductions. Herein, we review the nature of this ongoing challenge by examining contributing factors, including documenting trends in expertise and funding. In addition, we make recommendations for resources needed and information gaps that should be addressed and justify the need for increased support for basic biological research and further exploration of techniques to identify and treat potential threats (e.g., sentinel studies).Study Implications: The US faces an invasive species crisis. Major tree species are already being decimated. The forest products industry relies primarily on a hand full of species. A new insect or disease could thus decimate the industry. We show that the pace of introductions has accelerated due to greater and faster shipping volume. Port screening and sanitation need considerable improvement, especially for live plants, which harbor insects and pathogens. Interior monitoring and overseas sentinal studies need enhancement for better detection of threats. More research and control staff are needed at government and university posts, especially to enable rapid response. Finally, research is needed on new detection and control technologies.

TI  - Global land surface 250 m 8 d fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) product from 2000 to 2021
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical land surface variable for carbon cycle modeling and ecological monitoring. Several global FAPAR products have been released and have become widely used; however, spatiotemporal inconsistency remains a large issue for the current products, and their spatial resolutions and accuracies can hardly meet the user requirements. An effective solution to improve the spatiotemporal continuity and accuracy of FAPAR products is to take better advantage of the temporal information in the satellite data using deep learning approaches. In this study, the latest version (V6) of the FAPAR product with a 250 m resolution was generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surface reflectance data and other information, as part of the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite. In addition, it was aggregated to multiple coarser resolutions (up to 0.25 & LCIRC; and monthly). Three existing global FAPAR products (MODIS Collection 6; GLASS V5; and PRoject for On-Board Autonomy-Vegetation, PROBA-V, V1) were used to generate the time-series training samples, which were used to develop a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model. Direct validation using high-resolution FAPAR maps from the Validation of Land European Remote sensing Instrument (VALERI) and ImagineS networks revealed that the GLASS V6 FAPAR product has a higher accuracy than PROBA-V, MODIS, and GLASS V5, with an R2 value of 0.80 and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 0.10-0.11 at the 250 m, 500 m, and 3 km scales, and a higher percentage (72 %) of retrievals for meeting the accuracy requirement of 0.1. Global spatial evaluation and temporal comparison at the AmeriFlux and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites revealed that the GLASS V6 FAPAR has a greater spatiotemporal continuity and reflects the variations in the vegetation better than the GLASS V5 FAPAR. The higher quality of the GLASS V6 FAPAR is attributed to the ability of the Bi-LSTM model, which involves high-quality training samples and combines the strengths of the existing FAPAR products, as well as the temporal and spectral information from the MODIS surface reflectance data and other information. The 250 m 8 d GLASS V6 FAPAR product for 2020 is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6405564 and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6430925 (Ma, 2022a, b) as well as at the University of Maryland for 2000-2021 (http://glass.umd.edu/FAPAR/MODIS/250m, last access 1 November 2022).

TI  - Spatial distribution and temporal variation of biomass burning and surface black carbon concentrations during summer (2015-2021) in India
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical biomass burning in summer season (April-June, during 2015-2021) was assessed by studying active fire spot data recorded by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aboard NASA/NOAA Suomi NPP satellite and mapping the same over Indian landmass. The fire spots often formed regional clusters and most profusely covered the states of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Manipur, Nagaland, and Mizoram during April but their number decreased conspicuously in May and further in June. Forward movements of air masses potentially carrying fire-induced air pollutants from five principal fire cluster regions (northern, south eastern, western, north-eastern, and central) of India during April and May in 2021 were traced by 6-day forward airtrajectory modelling. It was observed that many parts of India were the recipients of air coming from the above principal fire clusters. In each year, the surface mass concentration of black carbon (BC), one of the most prominent markers of biomass burning, was higher in April over May and June in the affected regions, commensurate with the most active period of fire. The BC surface mass concentrations progressively declined thereafter in May and June with decreasing number of active fire spots along with declining average monthly height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), indicating integral connection of surface BC levels with biomass burning. The study suggests that in spite of more favourable meteorological conditions in summer, extensive biomass burning may have had a crucial role to play in perturbing local and regional air quality over India by generating BC and other air pollutants.

TI  - An assessment of high temporal frequency satellite data for historic environment applications. A case study from Scotland
T2  - ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSPECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses the value of high temporal frequency satellite data with various spatial sampling resolutions for multi-scalar historic environment survey and management use cases in Scotland, specifically for broad-brush landscape characterisation, for monitoring the condition of monuments and for the discovery of otherwise unknown sites. Dealing with a part of the world where applications of satellite imagery are almost entirely unexplored, this study takes a real-world approach, which foregrounds the purpose at hand rather than presenting a case study from an optimal setting. The study highlights the importance of detailed imagery to support interpretation in some instances, and the challenges of obtaining time-critical optical imagery in a part of the world that experiences significant periods of cloud cover. The real-world availability of data in such settings is assessed, highlighting that even with daily revisits, useable imagery cannot be guaranteed. The implications of current and past tasking patterns for availability of high-resolution data now and in the future are discussed. The study identifies the complementary roles that satellite imagery can fulfil, while identifying the limitations that remain to fuller applications of such data, in a study that will be relevant to many parts of Europe and beyond.

TI  - Jihadi Kitsch: The<i> Promesse de Bonheur</i> of Islamist Terrorism
T2  - STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Elaborating on conceptualizations of kitsch in the realm of art and sociology in the context of ISIS propaganda and culture, this article introduces the concept of jihadi kitsch. Kitsch is characterized by a compulsion to escape from the banality of daily reality and lack of coherent meaning in modern society through, in the words of the philosopher and sociologist Theodor Adorno, a self-made and futile promesse de bonheur, i.e. promise of happiness. The article explicates and illustrates seven distinct aspects of jihadi kitsch: (1) escape from daily life, (2) eroticization of power and "pornokitsch, " (3) "kitsch of death ": romanticized and trivialized violence and death, (4) purity and filth, (5) moral collapse, (6) simplism: an easily accessible worldview, (7) nostalgia: looking back with longing to an authentic past. Capturing the kitsch aspect of jihadi propaganda and culture, the article contributes a new theoretical approach to the existing literature discussing the attractions of jihadism, and ends with a discussion on how the concept of jihadi kitsch can potentially contribute to combating Islamist terrorism through humor.

TI  - Benchmarking and scaling of deep learning models for land cover image classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of the sheer volume of Copernicus Sentinel-2 imagery has created new opportunities for exploiting deep learning methods for land use land cover (LULC) image classification at large scales. However, an extensive set of benchmark experiments is currently lacking, i.e. deep learning models tested on the same dataset, with a common and consistent set of metrics, and in the same hardware. In this work, we use the BigEarthNet Sentinel-2 multispectral dataset to benchmark for the first time different state-of-the-art deep learning models for the multi-label, multi-class LULC image classification problem, contributing with an exhaustive zoo of 62 trained models. Our benchmark includes standard Convolution Neural Network architectures, as well as non-convolutional methods, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons and Vision Transformers. We put to the test EfficientNets and Wide Residual Networks (WRN) architectures, and leverage classification accuracy, training time and inference rate. Furthermore, we propose to use the EfficientNet framework for the compound scaling of a lightweight WRN, by varying network depth, width, and input data resolution. Enhanced with an Efficient Channel Attention mechanism, our scaled lightweight model emerged as the new state-of-the-art. It achieves 4.5% higher averaged F-Score classification accuracy for all 19 LULC classes compared to a standard ResNet50 baseline model, with an order of magnitude less trainable parameters. We provide access to all trained models, along with our code for distributed training on multiple GPU nodes. This model zoo of pre-trained encoders can be used for transfer learning and rapid prototyping in different remote sensing tasks that use Sentinel-2 data, instead of exploiting backbone models trained with data from a different domain, e.g., from ImageNet. We validate their suitability for transfer learning in different datasets of diverse volumes. Our top-performing WRN achieves state-of-the-art performance (71.1% F-Score) on the SEN12MS dataset while being exposed to only a small fraction of the training dataset.

T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-infrared (NIR) imaging with Indocyanine green (ICG) has been recently proposed for the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and lymphatic out-flow detection in several tumors. Nowadays its application in primary and secondary liver (LCs) and biliary cancers (BTCs) remains uninvestigated. A proof-of-concept prospective observational study including 18 patients underwent surgery for LCs and BTCs from September 2021 to November 2021 was carried out. The intraoperative NIR imaging with ICG was detected at predefined temporary intervals in order to identify the main lymphatic out-flow and the SLN. In 14 patients (77.8%) the lymphatic outflow pathway was visualized with a median time of 3 min after ICG injection (IQR 3-10). The SLN was detected and confirmed at the histological exami-nation in 12 patients (66.7%). Intraoperative NIR imaging with ICG is a safe and feasible method to identify the lymphatic out-flow and SLN in LCs and BTCs.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd, BASO -The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - Personalized loading conditions for homogenized finite element analysis of the distal sections of the radius
T2  - BIOMECHANICS AND MODELING IN MECHANOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The microstructure of trabecular bone is known to adapt its morphology in response to mechanical loads for achieving a biomechanical homeostasis. Based on this form-function relationship, previous investigators either simulated the remodeling of bone to predict the resulting density and architecture for a specific loading or retraced physiological loading conditions from local density and architecture. The latter inverse approach includes quantifying bone morphology using computed tomography and calculating the relative importance of selected load cases by minimizing the fluctuation of a tissue loading level metric. Along this concept, the present study aims at identifying an optimal, personalized, multiaxial load case at the distal section of the human radius using in vivo HR-pQCT-based isotropic, homogenized finite element (hFE) analysis. The dataset consisted of HR-pQCT reconstructions of the 20 mm most distal section of 21 human fresh-frozen radii. We simulated six different unit canonical load cases (FX palmar-dorsal force, FY ulnar-radial force, FZ distal-proximal force, MX moment about palmar-dorsal, MY moment about ulnar-radial, MZ moment about distal-proximal) using a simplified and efficient hFE method based on a single isotropic bone phase. Once we used a homogeneous mean density (shape model) and once the original heterogeneous density distribution (shape + density model). Using an analytical formulation, we minimized the deviation of the resulting strain tensors epsilon(x) to a hydrostatic compressive reference strain epsilon(0), once for the 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) optimal (OPT) load case and for all individual 1 DOF load cases (FX, FY, FZ, MX, MY, MZ). All seven load cases were then extended in the nonlinear regime using the scaled displacements of the linear load cases as loading boundary conditions (MAX). We then compared the load cases and models for their objective function (OF) values, the stored energies and their ultimate strength using a specific torsor norm. Both shape and shape + density linear-optimized OPT models were dominated by a positive force in the z-direction (FZ). Transversal force DOFs were close to zero and mean moment DOFs were different depending on the model type. The inclusion of density distribution increased the influence and changed direction of MX and MY, while MZ was small in both models. The OPT load case had 12-15% lower objective function (OF) values than the FZ load case, depending on the model. Stored energies at the optimum were consistently 142-178% higher for the OPT load case than for the FZ load case. Differences in the nonlinear response maximum torsor norm ||t|| were heterogeneous, but consistently higher for OPT_MAX than FZ_MAX. We presented the proof of concept of an optimization procedure to estimate patient-specific loading conditions for hFE methods. In contrast to similar models, we included canonical load cases in all six DOFs and used a strain metric that favors hydrostatic compression. Based on a biomechanical analysis of the distal joint surfaces at the radius, the estimated load directions are plausible. For our dataset, the resulting OPT load case is close to the standard axial compression boundary conditions, usually used in HR-pQCT-based FE analysis today. But even using the present simplified hFE model, the optimized linear six DOF load case achieves a more homogeneous tissue loading and can absorb more than twice the energy than the standard uniaxial load case.

TI  - Assessment of spatiotemporal changes of ecological environment quality of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration in China based on MRSEI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ecological Environment Quality (EEQ) is an important foundation for the sustainable development of society and economy. To assess the spatiotemporal changes of the EEQ in the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA), we selected MODIS images of 2001, 2006, 2011, 2016 and 2021 to construct the Modified Remote Sensing Ecological Index (MRSEI) based on Googte Earth Engine (GEE) platform and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then, we evaluated the spatiotemporal changes and spatial autocorrelation of the EEQ in the YRDUA. The results showed that: the EEQ of the YRDUA was improved from 2001 to 2011, deteriorated from 2011 to 2016, and improved from 2016 to 2021 The overall EEQ of the YRDUA was at moderate or excellent level and the EEQ in the south was better than that in the north. The EEQ of the southern cities in the study area was better and more stable, while that of the northern cities was relatively poor and changes relatively drastic. The EEQ of the YRDUA was mainly unchanged and improved from 2001 to 2021 The regions with improved EEQ were mainly distributed in the north and west, while those with deteriorated EEQ were mainly distributed in the east and south. The EEQ of the YRDUA was improved gradually from 2001 to 2006, and relatively stable from 2006 to 2011. From 2011 to 2016, the changes were drastic and the EEQ deteriorated greatly; white from 2016 to 2021, the EEQ of the YRDUA was improved, and the area of ecological deterioration was significantly reduced. From 2001 to 2021, the Gtobalnnoran's I value ranged from 0.838 similar to 0.918. In the past 20 years, NS area in the YRDUA accounted for the highest proportion, white the HH aggregation was mainly distributed in the southern part of the YRDUA, white LL aggregation was mainly distributed in the northern part, indicated that the EEQ in the southern part was better than that in the northern part. This study provides a promising approach to assess the spatiotemporal changes of EEQ in urban areas, which is crucial to formulate the ecosystem protection policies and sustainable development strategies of YRDUA.

TI  - Ground-based vegetation descriptions and remote sensing as complementary methods describing habitat requirements of a frugivorous primate in northern Madagascar: implications for forest restoration
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-human primate species are threatened worldwide. Their population declines go along with the loss of ecological functions such as seed dispersal that plays a crucial role in plant regeneration. Restoring essential habitat structures could thus not only protect primates, but also facilitate forest regeneration. We used classical vegetation description on the ground and a remote sensing analysis to describe habitat use of crowned lemurs (Eulemur coronatus), a seed-dispersing primate endemic to northern Madagascar. Our aim was to find vegetation characteristics important for lemurs that might be targeted in a restoration approach. For this, we applied both methods in differently degraded forest types. Both classical vegetation description and remote sensing analysis were able to distinguish these forest types. The habitat use of our two study groups was associated consistently with vegetation structures measured on a small scale such as tree height and density of thick trees. In contrast, vegetation productivity and water content derived from satellite imagery on a larger scale could not consistently explain habitat use of lemurs. Thus, measurements on the ground can identify suitable microhabitats that do not show on the satellite imagery scale. These microhabitats might be very important conservation elements to create buffer zones and corridors. Further, they might attract seed-dispersing species into degraded areas targeted for forest restoration, acting as natural regeneration nuclei. The potential of these microhabitats for conservation would not be recognized when analyses were based solely on landscape analyses on large scales.

TI  - LLNet: Lightweight network with a channel and spatial attention mechanism for local climate zone classification from Sentinel-2 image
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) system is a landscape framework defining a universal understanding of urban microclimate and urban environment and is important for the research of urban thermal environment, regional planning and carbon cycle. Currently, most existing approaches are difficult to deal with the features of built-up area classes which are mainly related to three-dimensional structures, resulting in poor accuracy of these classes. The convolutional block attention module (CBAM) can get meaningful context to better represent features by re-weighting the features spatially and channel-wise. This study proposed a Lightweight-LCZ-Network (LLNet) based on CBAM and depthwise separable convolution for LCZ classification from Sentinel-2 image. The current largest LCZ classification data set So2Sat LCZ42 was employed to train and test the proposed model. Results indicated that the accuracy of the LLNet model achieved overall accuracy (OA) of 71.6% and Kappa coefficient of 0.688, realized an accuracy improvement by about 2%. In LLNet model, 65% of ordinary convolutions were displaced with depthwise separable convolutions, which decreased the amount of model parameters by 2/3 and maintained alike classification accuracy. In addition, the proposed model was applied for LCZ classification of Wuhan and Hefei cities to assess its generalization ability. The OA (Kappa coefficient) of the proposed model is 74.6% (0.72) for Wuhan and 77.5% (0.75) for Hefei, respectively. We concluded that the proposed LLNet model with strong robustness for LCZ classification from Sentinel-2 data has an effective trade-off between size and accuracy.

TI  - Using object-oriented coupled deep learning approach for typical object inspection of transmission channel
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional methods to inspect transmission line passage are mostly through UAV/helicopters and manual inspection, which are limited in no man's area and large-scale inspection. Satellite remote sensing technology breaks through such limitations and makes it more possible to inspect transmission line passage on a large scale in the power industry. Therefore, adopting the WorldView-3 satellite image with high resolution as the data source, we propose a typical ground object inspection method based on the object-oriented method coupled with the deep learning method. Firstly, in view of the traditional object-oriented multicategory extraction phenomenon, we use multiscale segmentation technology to construct the typical feature classification rule set and optimize the segmentation threshold. Through prior knowledge and experiments, we explore the best inspection sequence of multicategory typical features. Secondly, we use a fully convolutional neural network to perform end-to-end inspections of typical features. Finally, we propose the combination of the two methods to make it act on an image by comparing the inspection results of each typical ground object category and analyzing the advantages and disadvantages of the above two methods. Based on the principle of optimal inspection sequence, the user flexibly selects target extraction methods and finally the typical ground object inspection results are output end-to-end. The research shows that the coupled method has the highest inspection accuracy. The overall inspection accuracy reaches 93.01%, which is 10.32% and 8.07% higher than that of the object-oriented method and the deep learning method. The Macro-F1 score is 0.8363, which is 0.124 and 0.1532 higher than that of the object-oriented method and the deep learning method. We also choose Lingwu City for a verification experiment. The result shows that the overall inspection accuracy for the new experimental area is 91.25%, and the Macro-F1 score is 0.8948, indicating that the algorithm has versatility.

TI  - Bridging optical and SAR satellite image time series via contrastive feature extraction for crop classification
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise crop mapping is crucial for guiding agricultural production, forecasting crop yield, and ensuring food security. Integrating optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite image time series (SITS) for crop clas-sification is an essential and challenging task in remote sensing. Previously published studies generally employ a dual-branch network to learn optical and SAR features independently, while ignoring the complementarity and correlation between the two modalities. In this article, we propose a novel method to learn optical and SAR features for crop classification through cross-modal contrastive learning. Specifically, we develop an updated dual-branch network with partial weight-sharing of the two branches to reduce model complexity. Furthermore, we enforce the network to map features of different modalities from the same class to nearby locations in a latent space, while samples from distinct classes are far apart, thereby learning discriminative and modality-invariant features. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method on a large-scale crop classification dataset. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional supervised learning approaches, no matter the training samples are adequate or not. Our findings demonstrate that unifying the representations of optical and SAR image time series enables the network to learn more competitive features and suppress inference noise.

TI  - Lost in the woods: Forest vegetation, and not topography, most affects the connectivity of mesh radio networks for public safety
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time data- and location-sharing using mesh networking radios paired with smartphones may improve situational awareness and safety in remote environments lacking communications infrastructure. Despite being increasingly used for wildland fire and public safety applications, there has been little formal evaluation of the network connectivity of these devices. The objectives of this study were to 1) characterize the connectivity of mesh networks in variable forest and topographic conditions; 2) evaluate the abilities of lidar and satellite remote sensing data to predict connectivity; and 3) assess the relative importance of the predictive metrics. A large field experiment was conducted to test the connectivity of a network of one mobile and five stationary goTenna Pro mesh radios on 24 Public Land Survey System sections approximately 260 ha in area in northern Idaho. Dirichlet regression was used to predict connectivity using 1) both lidar- and satellite-derived metrics (LIDSAT); 2) lidar-derived metrics only (LID); and 3) satellite-derived metrics only (SAT). On average the full network was connected only 32.6% of the time (range: 0% to 90.5%) and the mobile goTenna was disconnected from all other devices 18.2% of the time (range: 0% to 44.5%). RMSE for the six connectivity levels ranged from 0.101 to 0.314 for the LIDSAT model, from 0.103 to 0.310 for the LID model, and from 0.121 to 0.313 for the SAT model. Vegetation-related metrics affected connectivity more than topography. Developed models may be used to predict the connectivity of real-time mesh networks over large spatial extents using remote sensing data in order to forecast how well similar networks are expected to perform for wildland firefighting, forestry, and public safety applications. However, safety professionals should be aware of the impacts of vegetation on connectivity.

TI  - Modelling land use/land cover (LULC) change dynamics, future prospects, and its environmental impacts based on geospatial data models and remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic change in land use/land cover (LULC) caused by rapid urbanization has become a major concern in Lahore, causing a variety of socioeconomic and environmental issues relating to air quality. As a result, it is important to monitor existing LULC change detection, future projection, and the increase in atmospheric pollutants in Lahore. This research work makes use of Landsat, GIOVANNI, SRTM DEM, and vector data. The four key steps of the research approach are as follows: (i) LULC classification from 2000 to 2020 using Lansat data and semi-automatic classification plugin (SCP); (ii) simulation of future prediction using Modules of Land Use Change Evaluation (MOLUSCE) prediction model; (iii) assessment of effects of land use change on air quality using GIOVANNI-NASA product; and (iv) monitoring, change detection, and result interpretation. According to the research findings, there was an increase in metropolitan areas and a decrease in vegetation, barren land, and water bodies for both historical and future projections. The findings also indicated that from 2000 to 2020, about 27.41% of the urban area expanded, with a decline of 42.13% in vegetation, 2.3% in the barren land, and 6.51% in water bodies, respectively. Between 2020 and 2040, the urban area is predicted to increase by 23.15%, while vegetation, barren land, and water bodies are expected to decrease by 28.05%, 1.8%, and 12.31%, respectively. Also, the atmospheric pollutants have been increased including NO2 (1.60%), SO2 (1.02%), CO2 (0.71%), CO (1.56%), O3 (0.15%), and CH4 (0.20%), respectively. And it is projected that by 2040, the average annual atmospheric concentration of NO2, SO2, CO2, CO, O-3, and CH4 will be increased by 28.80%, 18.36%, 12.78%, 28.08%, 2.70%, and 3.60%, respectively. In addition, it was also observed that the majority of the city's urban area expansion was found in the city's eastern and southern regions. Therefore, government should focus on natural resource conservation especially vegetation cover to reduce air pollutants concentration and the LULC effect.

TI  - Same-day dismissal for endometrial cancer robotic surgery: feasibility factors
T2  - UPDATES IN SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the factors in feasibility and safety of same-day dismissal (SDD) of endometrial cancer patients undergoing robotic hysterectomy and staging. A single-institution retrospective chart review of endometrial cancer patients who underwent robotic hysterectomy and staging between 2012 and 2021 was performed. Patient demographics, medical and surgical history, intra- and postoperative events were examined as possible factors related to non-SDD. These factors were analyzed using univariate (chi-square test) and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 292 patients, 117 (40%) had SDD, and 175 (60%) had non-SDD. The SDD rate increased from 13.8% to 88% over the 10-year study period. The factors significantly associated with non-SDD (p < 0.05) were surgery in the first 5 years after the introduction of the SDD and ERAS protocols (2012-2016), age > 75 years, and comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, anemia (Hb < 11 g/dl), and anticoagulant therapy. Extensive adhesiolysis, the performance of complete pelvic and/or aortic lymphadenectomy, operating time > 180 min, and PACU discharge after 2:00 p.m. were significant factors for non-SDD. Sentinel lymph node sampling was significantly associated with SDD (OR 0.050; CI 0.273-0.934, p = 0.029). We reported no significant difference in the number, setting and timing of any unscheduled postoperative contacts, complications, and readmissions between SDD and non-SDD groups. SDD after robotic hysterectomy and staging for endometrial cancer is feasible and safe. There are patient and surgery factors for the failure of SDD. The sentinel lymph node sampling was significantly associated with achieving SDD. Trial registration: Institutional Review Board approved the study protocol (#: 1764-05).

TI  - Bisphenol A alternatives continuously contribute to the endocrine disruption in cetaceans
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The bans on bisphenol A (BPA) have facilitated the widespread use of BPA alternatives and shifted environmental contamination profiles of bisphenols (BPs). However, the continued reports of toxicities of emerging BPA al-ternatives have raised questions about whether the shifting profiles are contributed to mitigate BPs-mediated endocrine-disruption effects (EDEs). Cetaceans are commonly used as the ideal sentinel species for monitoring marine pollutants of concern and determining potential health effects, but far less is known about BP loads and BPs-mediated EDEs in cetaceans. Here we measured the hepatic concentrations of six BPs in eight stranded cetacean species (n = 41) in the South China Sea, between 2007 and 2020. The large-bodied whales generally showed higher n-ary sumation BPs concentrations than the small-bodied dolphins. In Indo-Pacific finless porpoises (Neo-phocaena phocaenoides) (n = 33), BPA concentrations first increased (2007-2014) and then decreased (2014-2020), while n-ary sumation BPAlternatives concentrations increased from 2007 to 2020. It appears that the alternatives gradually replaced BPA, probably due to the BPA-related bans in China. In order to examine the hormone disruption of BPA and its alternatives in finless porpoises, five blubber hormones (cortisol, progesterone, testosterone, triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine), which are proven to be validated endocrine biomarkers, were measured in 21 samples. Tetraiodothyronine, testosterone, and cortisol were significantly and positively correlated with BPA and its alternatives, suggesting that the interference of endocrine hormone homeostasis may continue to occur despite the changes of BP profiles in finless porpoises. This is the first investigation of the relationship between hormone and BP concentrations in cetaceans and represents a substantial advance in un-derstanding BPs-mediated endocrine effects on cetaceans.

TI  - Mangrove health assessment using spatial metrics and multi-temporal remote sensing data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest plays a very important role for both ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation. In Vietnam, mangrove is mainly distributed in the Mekong delta. Recently, mangrove areas in this region decreased rapidly in both quality and quantity. The forest became bare, divided and scattered into many small patches, which was a major driver of ecosystem degradation. Without a quantitative method for effectively assessing mangrove health in the regional scale, the sustainably conserving mangrove is the challenge for the local governments. Remote sensing data has been widely used for monitoring mangrove distributions, while the characterization of spatial metrics is important to understand the underlying processes of mangrove change. The objectives of this study were to develop an approach to monitor mangrove health in Mui Ca Mau, Ca Mau province of Vietnam by utilizing satellite image textures to assess the mangrove patterns. The research result showed that mangrove areas increased double by 2015, but the forest had become more fragmented. We can be seen those changes in land use mainly come from land conversion from forest to shrimp farms, settlements areas and public constructions. The conserving existing mangrove forest in Mui Ca Mau should consider the relations between mangrove health and influencing factors indicated in the manuscript.

TI  - An improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model for estimating ecological carbon sequestration in mountain vegetation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation in mountainous areas is abundant, and its ecological carbon sequestration ability is of great significance to maintain the sustainable and healthy development of the ecological environment. However, when estimating the carbon sequestration of mountain vegetation, the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model assigns a uniform value to the maximum light energy utilization (epsilon(max) = 0.389 gC/MJ), ignoring the influence of vegetation types and topographic factors on epsilon(max), resulting in the low accuracy of the CASA model in estimating the carbon sequestration of mountain vegetation. In this paper, the improved CASA model was combined with Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) remote sensing image data to improve the estimation accuracy of carbon sequestration of mountain vegetation. The first was the establishment of a linear link between the terrain characteristics (slope and aspect), vegetation types, and epsilon(max) in mountainous locations. The second was the improvement of the CASA model's calculation method for key parameters. The different distributions of the estimation results from the two techniques in 2015 and 2016 are then compared using Landsat 8 data as the data source, and the impact of the terrain factors in the improved CASA model on the estimation results is confirmed. Finally, the improved CASA model and the CASA model are used to estimate the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of the study area from 2000 to 2020, and the estimated results of the two models are compared with the computation results of the MODIS data NPP product. The findings indicate that the improved CASA model's estimation results have a higher degree of fit and a better correlation. The improved CASA model aids in precisely understanding the ecological carbon sequestration potential of mountain areas and increases the estimation accuracy of vegetation carbon sequestration in mountainous areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations and drought of spring maize in Northeast China between 2002 and 2020
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A lot of spring maize is grown in Northeast China (Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang), an area that is highly susceptible to drought. Here, remote sensing indexes from 2002 to 2020 were studied using the 8-day surface reflectance and land surface temperature of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. Spring maize distribution was extracted using a decision tree classification, and the results were compared to the known distribution based on field investigation data and published statistics. The results showed that mixed pixels of spring maize and soybeans had limited influence on the study of spatio-temporal variations of spring maize, and the error was acceptable. The overall accuracy of verifying the spring maize distribution from 2018 to 2020 was above 85%. The stable, fluctuating, and low-frequency planting areas of spring maize accounted for 11.86%, 17.41%, and 34.86% of the study area, respectively. In 2015, the government directed a reduction of the planting area of spring maize in the "Liandaowan" region of Northeast China. The planting area of spring maize was characterized by a continuous increase before this change (2002-2014), exhibited changes and reductions in response to the change (2015-2017), and exhibited optimization and recovery after this change (2018-2020). Compared with the fluctuating and low-frequency planting areas, moderate and severe droughts were higher in stable planting areas. From 2002 to 2020, the most severe droughts occurred in the expanded planting areas. This rapid and large-scale monitoring of spatio-temporal variations and drought of spring maize provides a foundation for improving grain yield. This method could be easily applied to the study of other regions and combined with high-resolution and hyperspectral satellite data to improve monitoring accuracy.

TI  - Implications of Watershed Management Programs for Sustainable Development in Rural Scenario-A Case Study from Foothills of Punjab State, India
T2  - WATER CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed management programs (WMP) are widely adopted across the globe for judicious use of natural resources. It can help us to achieve UN sustainable goals by 2030 also in a sytematic way. These programs help in preserving environmental and ecological balance by maintaining the natural and anthropogenic pressures in the watershed. WMPs have enabled sustainable management in typical rural scenarios where land degradation is predominant at an alarming rate due to intensive agricultural cum anthropogenic activities. A huge amount of central and state government funds have been utilized for construction of check dams, silt detention structures, gabion structures, afforestation schemes, capacity building programs for rural lively hoods, etc. to elevate the region from the poverty line. This necessitates for monitoring of these activities; and the present study demonstrates use of geospatial technology in monitoring effects of WMPs in the rural landscape of Punjab, India. High-resolution satellite images were used for monitoring the conservation measures at grass root level and analyzing the implications in the region. Field investigation and growth in net productivity of the region also clearly indicated that there is significant improvement in the selected watershed due to augmentation of the conservation measures, infrastructure facilities, and socio-economic conditions.

TI  - Establishing a citywide street tree inventory with street view images and computer vision techniques
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trees in urban areas have diverse ecological, social, and health benefits. The establishment of up-to-date and accurate street-tree inventories that list the species and locations of individual street trees is critical to urban tree management and tree-planting campaigns. However, street-tree inventories are incomplete or lacking altogether in most cities. This is partly because conventional field assessment is laborious or expensive. In this study, we developed and validated a novel and cost-effective method to establish a city-wide tree inventory based on computer vision and freely available street view images (SVIs). Tree information such as species, height, crown diameter, and geographical coordinates at the individual tree level can be assessed. Based on an object detection model, we adopted a species-based loss function to address the challenges of long-tailed class distribution of species, which is caused by imbalance among sample size of different tree species and can lead to poor per-formance of the model. Compared with other research in urban tree species recognition, the modified model shows a higher accuracy. In order to calculate quantitative features of street trees, we employed a deep learning algorithm, which is pretrained on stereo dataset and validated on Google Street View images, to estimate the depth of each pixel in SVIs. Furthermore, as a demonstration, we established the citywide tree inventory and conducted tree diversity analysis for Jinan, China. Compared with new developed area, the old town has more street trees and more diverse tree species which can improve biodiversity and walkability. We also found that plane trees, which can cause allergic reactions, are dominant in northern new developed urban area.

TI  - Mapping fine-scale building heights in urban agglomeration with spaceborne lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing availability of 3-D urban data yields new insights into urban developments and their implications for population density, energy consumption, and the carbon budget. However, existing products of urban building heights at a regional or global scale are mostly subject to coarse grid size or long-time lags. Fineresolution building height maps remain unavailable for most regions to present recent vertical information. Also, the lack of sampled building heights with spatial and temporal consistency at larger scales makes it difficult to update building height maps. The newly available spaceborne lidar data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) are expected to overcome these critical barriers. Here we propose a generalizable approach to mapping large-scale distributions of building heights by fusing GEDI-derived relative height metrics, optical data (i.e., Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), and radar data (Sentinel-1). We applied our approach to the Yangtze River Delta region (YRD), one of China's largest urban agglomerations. We investigated the availability of building height samples generated from GEDI-based relative height metrics and the optimal grid size of building height mapping into 30-m (about footprint level) and 150-m (regional level) grid sizes. We finally developed a random forest model using active and passive sensors to extrapolate GEDI-derived samples discretely to the continuous building height map at the 150-m grid size in 2019. We revealed the spatial distribution patterns of building heights and the urbanization effect on the city's mean building heights in the YRD region. We found that: (1) GEDI-derived building height samples were highly consistent with the reference building height data at the footprint (i.e., Pearson's r = 0.86, RMSE = 9.25 m, n = 237) and regional (i.e., Pearson's r = 0.76, RMSE = 6.36 m, n = 69) levels. (2) The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the final spatially continuous and up-to-date building height map were 0.85 and 5.03 m, respectively. (3) The resulting map showed a strong positive correlation between the city's mean building height and urbanization level. Our work makes it possible to use remotely sensed data to make global maps of building heights at a 150-m scale.

TI  - The prevention and treatment of breast cancer- related lymphedema: A review
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer- related lymphedema (BCRL) affects about 3 to 5 million patients worldwide, with about 20,000 per year in the United States. As breast cancer mortality is declining due to improved diagnostics and treatments, the long-term effects of treatment for BCRL need to be addressed. MethodsThe American Society of Breast Surgeons Lymphatic Surgery Working Group conducted a large review of the literature in order to develop guidelines on BCRL prevention and treatment. This was a comprehensive but not systematic review of the literature. This was inclusive of recent randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and reviews evaluating the prevention and treatment of BCRL. There were 25 randomized clinical trials, 13 systemic reviews and meta-analyses, and 87 observational studies included. ResultsThe findings of our review are detailed in the paper, with each guideline being analyzed with the most recent data that the group found evidence of to suggest these recommendations. ConclusionsPrevention and treatment of BCRL involve a multidisciplinary team. Early detection, before clinically apparent, is crucial to prevent irreversible lymphedema. Awareness of risk factors and appropriate practice adjustments to reduce the risk aids are crucial to decrease the progression of lymphedema. The treatment can be costly, time- consuming, and not always effective, and therefore, the overall goal should be prevention.

AB  - The magnetic structure of GdFeO3-type orthorhombically distorted PrMn0.6Fe0.4O3 compound was determined using the neutron powder diffraction experiment. The compound orders into the (Gx, 0, 0) antiferromagnetic structure and with magnetic propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0) in the temperature range TN (similar to 170 K) > T > 35 K. Below 35 K the magnetic structure changes to canted antiferromagnetic, with k = (0, 0, 0) and with magnetic moments aligned into (0, Fy, Gz) pattern. Around 35 K there is a possibility of existence of short range magnetic correlations which are connected with rotation of magnetic moment from Gx to Gz and with appearing of ferromagnetic component along the b-axis.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat image compositing algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We proposed a new image compositing algorithm (MAX-RNB) based on the maximum ratio of Near Infrared (NIR) to Blue band (RNB), and evaluated it together with nine other compositing algorithms: MAX-NDVI (maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MED-NIR (median NIR band), WELD (conterminous United States Web-Enabled Landsat Data), BAP (Best Available Pixel), PAC (Phenology Adaptive Composite), WPS (Weighted Parametric Scoring), MEDOID (medoid measurement), COSSIM (cosine similarity), and NLCD (National Land Cover Database). Each algorithm was applied to time series of Landsat observations collected within two separate years at six locations around the world, to produce monthly (July 1 +/- 15 days), seasonal (July 1 +/- 45 days), and annual (July 1 +/- 180 days) composite images free of cloud, cloud shadow, and snow/ice. By comparing the composite images to reference Landsat images acquired in the growing season (closest to July 1 within +/- 15 days) for each year, we evaluated the performance of the algorithms in preserving the spectral and spatial fidelity (hereafter referred to as spectral and spatial evaluation, respectively), as well as land cover classification and land change detection (hereafter referred to as application evaluation). The results demon-strated that no single algorithm outperformed all other algorithms in all the evaluations, but that performance depended on compositing intervals and cloud cover. For monthly composites, the MAX-RNB algorithm generally produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For seasonal composites, the NLCD algo-rithm produced the best results in the spectral and application evaluations. For annual composites, the PAC algorithm produced the best results in the spectral evaluation and change detection, whereas BAP produced the best results in land cover classification. The BAP algorithm also produced the best results in the spatial evaluation for all the compositing periods. This study provides a comprehensive guidance for selecting the most appropriate image compositing algorithm for different Landsat-based applications.

TI  - Just a "Mouthpiece of Biased Elites?" Populist Party Sympathizers and Trust in Czech Public Service Media
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Existing research indicates that people with populist attitudes express lower trust in media, especially in Public Service Media. It is assumed that these people are alienated because of their values: populist ideology stems from anti-pluralism whereas Public Service Media promotes pluralism. This study tests this assumption by comparing the predictors of trust in Public Service Media between the populist party sympathizers and the sympathizers of other political parties in the Czech Republic. Two main expectations were included as predictors for trust in Public Service Media, specifically that media should conform to one's worldview (i.e., the cohesive dimension of trust in media) and that media should adhere to the normative standards of journalism (i.e., the normative dimension of trust in media). Using multigroup structural equation modeling, the study analyzes data from a 2019-2020 representative survey of the adult Czech population (N = 3,251). The results suggest that, for the populist party sympathizers, trust in Public Service Media links only to their expectation that media should conform to their worldview, while the sympathizers of other political parties expect normative standards to be maintained. This is interpreted and discussed as support for the assumption that this value-based mismatch links to the populist audience members' lower trust in Public Service Media.

TI  - Impact of assimilating atmospheric motion vectors from Himawari-8 and clear-sky radiance from FY-4A GIIRS on binary typhoons
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Binary typhoons (Maysak and Haishen) uncommonly hit northeastern China in 2020, which brought historical extreme precipitation to this region within less than a week. The impact of high-frequency (15-min) assimilating atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) from Himawari-8 and clear-sky radiance from Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on this rare case has been investigated based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) data assimilation system. The study indicates that the dynamic adjustment is obvious from assimilated hourly AMVs information, but it still needs to be combined with the 15-min FY-4A thermal field adjustment, which is essential for better forecast simulations of minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) and landfall precipitation. A detailed typhoon structure is accurately reproduced for Maysak (Haishen) with fewer (more) anomalies of upper-level warm temperatures and lower-level negative geopotential heights in the decay (intensification) phase. Meanwhile, the performance of three hourly landfall precipitation by Maysak is evaluated with better spatial distribution and higher equitable threat scores (ETS) for the large threshold (20 mm), resulting from wet bias reduction by much drier water vapor conditions in the analysis and more precise forecasts of relative humidity, water vapor transportation, and its divergence. However, it achieves neutral to negative impacts on track forecasts for Maysak and wind simulations at different levels. This research may provide guidance for monitoring and forecasting typhoons of assimilation from different satellite information in mid-to-high latitude regions in East Asia.

TI  - Tracking the dynamics of a local-scale lake using GRACE from a hydrogeological perspective
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard principles of satellite-based gravity measurement have encouraged researchers to apply vertical Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data to water-related issues, but this has ignored the link between large-scale terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSA) and local-scale surface hydrologic elements. This study evaluated GRACE's ability to explain the shrinkage of a 30-km(2) lake in Angulinao Basin (northern China), which is a terminal lake within a closed basin (TLCB). A monthly lake-area series was derived from Landsat imagery using the normalized difference water index (NDWI), and the relationship between the lake area and the basin's TWSA was determined by linear and polynomial fitting. The developed statistical model was then used to estimate the water storage deficit when the lake dries up or the inundated area when the lake recovers. The results show that change in the lake area sensitively responded to change in the basin's TWSA. The GRACE-derived and Landsat-derived lake areas possessed identical amplitudes and minimal time lag. Following the drying up of Lake Angulinao, the TWSA was utilized to successfully forecast several short-term recovery events; however, the TLCB shape, serving as the bridge between large-scale TWSA and small-scale lake dynamics, has the limitation of requiring the evaluated lake to be a terminal lake, which cannot be guaranteed under extreme human activities. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating GRACE and optical remote-sensing to address the issue of lake shrinkage and it changes the mindset that GRACE can only be used vertically to understand hydrologic phenomena in subtle domains.

TI  - Automatic acquisition method for evaluating the on-orbit modulation transfer function based on lunar targets
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the existing method having a great subjectivity for the lunar edge selection, we propose an automatic knife-edge detection method based on the Hough transform to evaluate the on-orbit modulation transfer function (MTF) of the satellite remote sensor. This novel method avoids the dependence of the on-orbit MTF measurement on the edge selection location, overcoming the limitation of the traditional method needing to identify the lunar shape and fix its edge area. On basis of two different edge detection algorithms (Sobel operator and Prewitt operator), the binary edge images of the moon are acquired, thus obtaining a series of edges satisfying the determination requirement by the Hough transform, and the MTFs corresponding to each knife-edge are calculated to obtain the optimal MTF. The automatic knife-edge detection method greatly improves the accuracy of the lunar edge selection, and the MTF obtained by the novel method is obviously better than that of the traditional method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the novel method, the long time series of the on-orbit MTFs for the FY-2G and FY-2E satellite measurements are given, indicating that the FY-2E observation has higher stability and better performance compared with that of the FY-2G satellite. This study has an important practical significance for evaluating the on-orbit stability of the satellite its optical imaging quality.(c) 2022 Optica Publishing Group under the terms of the Optica Open Access Publishing Agreement

AB  - Heavy metals are known to modulate the life history traits of spider species. This study aimed to explore the divergence in life-history traits, including survival, growth, development, and reproduction, in Pardosa birmanica and Lycosa terrestris housed on artificial soil or fed artificial food containing10mM of CuSO4 and10mM of PbCl2 either separately or in a binary mixture(i.e., 10 mM CuSO4 + 10 mM PbCl2) from 4thto 8th instars under lab-oratory conditions. The results revealed that all metals treatments caused developmental delays, and reduced growth rate. Metals treated females laid lower number of eggs with high hatching success but prolonged hatching time. The co-exposure of metals had great potential to affect the life-history traits of spiders than did Cu or Pb alone, specially by dietary uptake. This study demonstrated that the lifehistory traits of spider's species provided sensitive endpoints and biomarkers for ecotoxicological risk assessments. Spiders are beneficial sentinel species and bioindicators because they help us monitor the risk to the organisms themselves and the ecosystem.

TI  - Structural analysis of fracture networks controlling geothermal activity in the northern part of the Malawi Rifted Zone from aeromagnetic and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the relationship between the geothermal activity and fracture networks that control storage and fluid pathways of geothermal systems in the northern part of the Malawi Rifted Zone (MRZ). It is suggested that low to medium temperature geothermal systems in the MRZ are mainly non-magmatic and structurally controlled. However, structural controls and favorable settings of geothermal activity are poorly understood in this region. We used an approach of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data analysis to 1) identify and characterize fracture networks to better understand the structural controls of geothermal activity in the northern part of the rift, 2) quantify and identify permeable areas using topological analysis of fracture intensity and connectivity frequency proxies, 3) understand the role that inherited structures play in the geothermal systems of the northern part of the rift, and 4) build preliminary geothermal conceptual models of selected geothermal systems. Our findings show that fracture networks in the Karonga and Nkhata regions comprise a varying degree of complexity along strike. This structural complexity occurs mainly in favorable structural settings such as 1) two fault segments coalescing to form hard and soft-linked relays, 2) two different oriented fracture segments intersecting each other, and 3) on the tips of major normal faults. The hot springs are located where one or more of these favorable settings occur. The remote sensing analysis shows that Quaternary normal faults are the primary controlling structures of thermal waters at shallow depths in the Karonga (NW-SE to N-S strike) and Nkhata (N-S strike) regions. The aeromagnetic data revealed that permeable NW-striking foliation planes of the Precambrian Mugesse Shear Zone and WNW to ENE-striking foliation planes of the Mwembeshi Shear Zone are important structural controls of geothermal fluids at greater depths in the Karonga and Nkhata region, respectively. The Mwankeja-Mwesia and Chiweta geothermal systems in the Karonga region show favorable structural settings for geothermal fluids related to NNW and NW-striking normal faults segments that coalesce to form hard and softlinked relay ramps and NW, and NNE -striking faults intersecting each other and NW-striking foliation planes. The Mtondolo geothermal area in the Nkhata region shows that the intersection of N-striking normal faults and ENE-striking foliation planes is the favorable structural setting that controls the emergence of hot springs through the surface. We conclude that high fracture intensity and connectivity are related to the location of the hot springs at the surface and can be used to determine permeable zones and hidden geothermal fluids together with other methodologies. The aeromagnetic data analysis suggested that buried faults and inherited structures (e.g., foliation planes) are controlling the geothermal fluids at depth. Additionally, our aeromagnetic analysis of magnetic basement depth estimation suggests that some of the geothermal reservoirs in the northern part of the MRZ could have an estimated depth of similar to 500 to 1000 m.b.g.l. Finally, the low-cost methodology applied in this study can reduce the risk of drilling non-productive wells in the early exploration stages and become an exploration strategy for similar geothermal systems in countries of the Western Branch of the East African Rift System.

AB  - There is evidence that the ozone layer has begun to recover owing to the ban on the production of halogenated ozone-depleting substances (hODS) accomplished by the Montreal Protocol and its amendments and adjustments (MPA). However, recent studies, while reporting an increase in tropospheric ozone from the anthropogenic NOx and CH4 and confirming the ozone recovery in the upper stratosphere from the effects of hODS, also indicate a continuing decline in the lower tropical and mid-latitudinal stratospheric ozone. While these are indications derived from observations, they are not reproduced by current global chemistry-climate models (CCMs), which show positive or near-zero trends for ozone in the lower stratosphere. This makes it difficult to robustly establish ozone evolution and has sparked debate about the ability of contemporary CCMs to simulate future ozone trends. We applied the new Earth system model (ESM) SOCOLv4 (SOlar Climate Ozone Links, version 4) to calculate long-term ozone trends between 1985-2018 and compare them with trends derived from the BAyeSian Integrated and Consolidated (BASIC) ozone composite and MERRA-2, ERA-5, and MSRv2 reanalyses. We designed the model experiment with a six-member ensemble to account for the uncertainty of the natural variability. The trend analysis is performed separately for the ozone depletion (1985-1997) and ozone recovery (1998-2018) phases of the ozone evolution. Within the 1998-2018 period, SOCOLv4 shows statistically significant positive ozone trends in the mesosphere, upper and middle stratosphere, and a steady increase in the tropospheric ozone. The SOCOLv4 results also suggest slightly negative trends in the extra-polar lower stratosphere, yet they barely agree with the BASIC ozone composite in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. However, in some realizations of the SOCOLv4 experiment, the pattern of ozone trends in the lower stratosphere resembles much of what is observed, suggesting that SOCOLv4 may be able to reproduce the observed trends in this region. Thus, the model results reveal marginally significant negative ozone changes in parts of the low-latitude lower stratosphere, which agrees in general with the negative tendencies extracted from the satellite data composite. Despite the slightly smaller significance and magnitude of the simulated ensemble mean, we confirm that modern CCMs such as SOCOLv4 are generally capable of simulating the observed ozone changes, justifying their use to project the future evolution of the ozone layer.

TI  - An assessment of aerosol optical depth over three AERONET sites in South Africa during the year 2020
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important to notice that the world health organization (WHO) on the 11th of March 2020, declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and in response governments around the world introduced lockdowns that restricted human and traffic movements including South Africa. This pandemic resulted in a total lockdown from 26 March until 16 April 2020 in South Africa with expected decrease in atmospheric aerosols. In this present study, the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over Southern Africa based on ground-based remotely sensed data derived from three AERONET sites (Durban, Skukuza and Upington) during 2020 were used to detrermine the restriction resopnse on atmospheric aerosol pollution The study used data from 2019, 2018 and 2017 as base years. The AERONET derived data was com-plemented with the HYSPLIT Model and NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data. The study findings show that peak increase of AOD corresponds to Angstrom exponent (AE) enhancement for two sites Durban and Skukuza during winter (JJA) while the Upington site showed a dif-ferent trend where peak AOD were observed in spring (SON). The study also observed the influence of long transport airmasses particularly those originating from the Atlantic and Indian ocean moreso for the Durban and Skukuza sites (summer and autumn) thus these sites received fresh marine aerosols however this was not the case for Upington which fell under the influence of short-range inland airmasses and was likely to receive anthro-pogenic and dust aerosols. The major results suggest that the lockdowns did not translate into a significant decrease in AOD levels compared to previous immediate years. The re-sults has presented restriction response of AOD over South Africa but additional analysis is required using more locations to compare results.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - Glycolytic flux-signaling controls mouse embryo mesoderm development
T2  - ELIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - How cellular metabolic state impacts cellular programs is a fundamental, unresolved question. Here, we investigated how glycolytic flux impacts embryonic development, using presomitic mesoderm (PSM) patterning as the experimental model. First, we identified fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) as an in vivo sentinel metabolite that mirrors glycolytic flux within PSM cells of post-implantation mouse embryos. We found that medium-supplementation with FBP, but not with other glycolytic metabolites, such as fructose 6-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate, impaired mesoderm segmentation. To genetically manipulate glycolytic flux and FBP levels, we generated a mouse model enabling the conditional overexpression of dominant active, cytoplasmic PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3). Overexpression of cytoPFKFB3 indeed led to increased glycolytic flux/FBP levels and caused an impairment of mesoderm segmentation, paralleled by the downregulation of Wnt-signaling, reminiscent of the effects seen upon FBP-supplementation. To probe for mechanisms underlying glycolytic flux-signaling, we performed subcellular proteome analysis and revealed that cytoPFKFB3 overexpression altered subcellular localization of certain proteins, including glycolytic enzymes, in PSM cells. Specifically, we revealed that FBP supplementation caused depletion of Pfkl and Aldoa from the nuclear-soluble fraction. Combined, we propose that FBP functions as a flux-signaling metabolite connecting glycolysis and PSM patterning, potentially through modulating subcellular protein localization.

TI  - Erosion-accretion pattern in the tidal-rivers of Indian Sundarban in relation to estuarine hydrodynamics
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the changes in the deltaic-coastal zone under changing hydrodynamic conditions is crucial for devel-oping a concise picture of coastal vulnerability. The present study provides a comprehensive idea of changing scenario of rivers in the world's largest delta-Sundarban, using a variety of remotely sensed data and mea-surements, and relating these changes to hydrodynamic conditions. Bathymetric changes have also been esti-mated using Landsat imageries, calibrated with bathymetric chart data. We document a substantial dynamic variation between western and eastern sections of the Sundarban tidal rivers, as well as between the northern and southern parts. As such, banks adjoining the Saptamukhi and Thakuran rivers in the west have accreted by +43.48 km2 and +6.13 km2 respectively, while the net change in the eastern rivers like Matla, Gosaba, and Hariabhanga river systems shows a loss of-51.54 km2, -13.92 km2, and -13.82 km2, respectively, over the last century. Erosion rates have decreased from the southern seafront zone to the northern interior parts due to the low wave exposure, and high tidal range. The accretion rate has increased on the same ground. The depth of these rivers has also changed significantly. For instance, the depth of most sections along the Thakuran river has increased from 5 to 7 m to about 7-10 m during the period 1987-2016. The findings of this study will help researchers all around the world in understanding the centurial dynamics of tidal rivers, and by comparing these to other deltas, it will be possible to emphasize the relative vulnerability of major deltas to current sea level rise.

TI  - TURION: A physiological crop model for yield prediction of asparagus using sentinel-1 data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Peru, asparagus is an important crop for the export market. Forecasting the yields is key in planning ahead sales to exporters. Farmers currently apply an empirical method by counting the number of mature buds per crown per metre and making linear regressions with the previous harvests. There was no simulation model so far for a continuous cycling crop grown in Peru. Therefore, this research describes TURION, a mechanistic crop model coded in Python which includes 27 physiological parameters, some crop variables based on literature and field data. Growth rate, thermal time per phenological stages, biomass partition, stem diameter variations, spear volume and leaf area index (LAI) across the crop cycle were determined for model parameterisation. TURION includes three sub-models: (1) spears production and its root carbohydrates (CHO) depletion, (2) stems estab-lishment and its root CHO depletion and (3) replenish CHO storage in roots by photosynthesis, LAI and CHO translocation. This model predicted: yield, numbers of spears, biomass of spears/stems, and root CHO changes brix% values. Predictions provided outputs at plant level. This model was validated on crops ranging from 3 to 12 years post-establishment, for 75 commercial harvests reported between July 2018 and May 2020 over 38 different plots. Results showed a relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of 16.72 % for final yield, 13.46 % for CHO at the end of harvest and 9.79 % CHO at the end of the crop cycle.

TI  - Application of machine learning models in the behavioral study of forest fires in the Brazilian Federal District region
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems, settlements, and human lives are put at risk by forest fires every year. Several models proposed for the prediction of their occurrence and behavior have aimed at identifying their conditioning factors, risks, and post-effects. However, their application in other regions is impracticable or very difficult, due to the distinct geographic characteristics of the areas and the unavailability of data. This research is devoted to the prediction of both spread and behavior of wildfires at a specific time and/or in specific regions for helping fire management agencies minimize the damages caused. The Brazilian Federal District, inserted in the Cerrado biome, is the focus of the analyses, due to its large number of fire occurrences and reduced number of studies conducted on the region. A dataset was compiled from Brazilian governmental open data for the prediction of the wildfire behavior and used for the training of several Machine Learning models that consider the fire point of ignition to predict the areas that will be impacted. It includes observations on climate features from 5 monitoring stations and satellite data on fires that occurred over the past two decades and was enriched with other topographic, hydrographic, and anthropogenic features, such as urbanization index, distance to rivers/roads, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). According to the results, AdaBoost model predicted the area affected by the wildfire with 91% accuracy, showing better performance than Random Forest (RF) 88%, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 86%, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 81%.

TI  - Assessment of suitable habitat of mangrove species for prioritizing restoration in coastal ecosystem of Sundarban Biosphere Reserve, India
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests being the abode of diverse fauna and flora are vital for healthy coastal ecosystems. These forests act as a carbon sequester and protection shield against floods, storms, and cyclones. The mangroves of the Sundarban Biosphere Reserve (SBR), being one of the most dynamic and productive ecosystems in the world are in constant degradation. Hence, habitat suitability assessment of mangrove species is of paramount significance for its restoration and ecological benefits. The study aims to assess and prioritize restoration targets for 18 true mangrove species using 10 machine-learning algorithm-based habitat suitability models in the SBR. We identified the degraded mangrove areas between 1975 and 2020 by using Landsat images and field verification. The reserve was divided into 5609 grids using 1 km gird size for understanding the nature of mangrove degradation and collection of species occurrence data. A total of 36 parameters covering physical, environmental, soil, water, bio-climatic and disturbance aspects were chosen for habitat suitability assessment. Niche overlay function and grid-based habitat suitability classes were used to identify the species-based restoration prioritize grids. Habitat suitability analysis revealed that nearly half of the grids are highly suitable for mangrove habitat in the Reserve. Restoration within highly suitable mangrove grids could be achieved in the areas covered with less than 75 percent mangroves and lesser anthropogenic disturbance. The study calls for devising effective management strategies for monitoring and conserving the degraded mangrove cover. Monitoring and effective management strategies can help in maintaining and conserving the degraded mangrove cover. The model proves to be useful for assessing site suitability for restoring mangroves. The other geographical regions interested in assessing habitat suitability and prioritizing the restoration of mangroves may find the methodology adopted in this study effective.

TI  - Improvement of wave predictions in marginal seas around Korea through correction of simulated sea winds
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main error sources in predicting ocean surface waves is the uncertainty of numerical sea wind products used as input to wave prediction models. In particular, the complexity of atmospheric physics and limitations of numerical computation in time and space increase the uncertainty of numerical sea winds in the area of marginal seas. So, a process is proposed to improve wave prediction in marginal seas by correcting numerical sea-wind products (i.e., herein, ERA5 wind reanalysis data produced around the Korean Peninsula). To evaluate and correct the ERA5 data, Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) buoy and MetOp-B (ASCAT) satellite data were used. In the procedure, firstly, the ASCAT winds in space were calibrated using the buoy data, and secondly the calibrated satellite winds were used to evaluate and correct the ERA5 wind data. Finally, the corrected ERA5 wind data were used as input to a numerical wave model (i.e., WAVEWATCH-III). When the corrected wind data were applied to the wave numerical model, the resulted predictions showed a better match to the in situ wave measurements. In the results, the bias error was reduced from (0.21 to 0.04) m, and the best fit slope was improved from (0.84 to 0.93) on average, compared to the predictions by the original sea winds. This procedure can be applied to other marginal seas in which sea winds are strongly influenced by neighbouring continents, and not well reproduced by numerical approaches.

TI  - Xenobiotic-induced ribosomal stress compromises dysbiotic gut barrier aging: A one health perspective
T2  - REDOX BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Upon exposure to internal or environmental insults, ribosomes stand sentinel. In particular, stress-driven dys-regulation of ribosomal homeostasis is a potent trigger of adverse outcomes in mammalians. The present study assessed whether the ribosomal insult affects the aging process via the regulation of sentinel organs such as the gut. Analyses of the human aging dataset demonstrated that elevated features of ribosomal stress are inversely linked to barrier maintenance biomarkers during the aging process. Ribosome-insulted worms displayed reduced lifespan, which was associated with the disruption of gut barriers. Mechanistically, ribosomal stress-activated Sek-1/p38 signaling, a central platform of ribosomal stress responses, counteracted the gut barrier deteriora-tion through the maintenance of the gut barrier, which was consistent with the results in a murine insult model. However, since the gut-protective p38 signaling was attenuated with aging, the ribosomal stress-induced distress was exacerbated in the gut epithelia and mucosa of the aged animals, subsequently leading to increased bacterial exposure. Moreover, the bacterial community-based evaluation predicted concomitant increases in the abun-dance of mucosal sugar utilizers and mucin metabolic enzymes in response to ribosomal insult in the aged host. All of the present evidence on ribosomal insulting against the gut barrier integrity from worms to mammals provides new insights into organelle-associated translational modulation of biological longevity in a one health perspective.

TI  - Retrieving soil moisture from grape growing areas using multi-feature and stacking-based ensemble learning modeling
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is an essential parameter for crop growth and development, and temporal and spatial vari-ation in SM in agricultural fields varies by crop type due to corresponding crop growing characteristics and cultivating patterns. Few studies have performed SM retrieval in grape growing areas, and SM estimation using only spectral reflectance (SR) or derived drought indices may not be wholly accurate. In this study, seven fea-tures based on evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and SR were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (8-day temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution) and integrated with topography feature to determine SM during the main growth stages of grape in the eastern foothills of the Helan Mountains from 2009 to 2018. A total of 25-period models covering April-October (8-day temporal resolution) were constructed. Finally, the models were achieved to retrieve SM, and the spatiotemporal distribution pattern was analyzed. The stacking ensemble algorithm can integrate multiple models for better retrieval accuracy and overcome the limitations of individual machine learning models. We also compared the SM estimation accuracy of three single machine learning models (Category boosting, random forest, and gradient boosting decision tree) with the ensemble model using the stacking algorithm. The results indicated that the stacking-based ensemble model could retrieve SM more accurately and stably than any individual machine learning algorithm, and the stacking-based ensemble model showed good applicability during the main growth stages of grape. The average coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the 25 -period multi-feature stacking-based models were 0.7504 and 0.0245 m3/m3. Overall, the application results showed that spring and summer droughts were more severe than autumn droughts in the study area during the main growth stages of grape. Our findings indicate that using multiple features and the stacking-based ensemble model could improve SM estimation accuracy in grape growing areas.

TI  - Prophylactic Lymphaticovenous Anastomosis Performed with Lymphadenectomy is Oncologically Safe for Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background. A major concern of lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA), which has not been studied, is increased risk of metastasis. Melanoma patients with macrometastatic lymph node disease represent a high-risk group for recurrence and metastasis. On the basis of a literature review, this present study is the first to evaluate the impact of prophylactic LVA on cancer survival and recurrence. Methods. This was a comparison study of patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent therapeutic lymphadenectomy alone (comparison group) or combined with prophylactic LVA (LVA group) between 2014 and 2020. A single surgeon performed all cancer resections, therapeutic lymphadenectomies, and LVA. Exclusion criteria included non-melanoma skin cancers, stage IV cancers before lymphadenectomy, microscopic lymphatic disease (i.e., positive sentinel node biopsy was the sole indication for lymph node dissection), or follow-up time less than 12 months unless the patient died earlier owing to melanoma-related complications. Results. This study included 23 patients in the LVA group and 22 consecutive patients in the comparison group. The two groups were similar in age, sex, and cancer stages. The comparison group had longer follow-up times (median 67.62 versus 29.73 months in the LVA group; p < 0.01). Average size of largest metastatic lymph node was 45.91 & PLUSMN; 35.03 mm and 44.54 & PLUSMN; 23.32 mm in the LVA and comparison groups, respectively (p = 0.99). There were no differences in OS, DMFS, and RFS times after more than 2 years of follow-up since the index surgery. Conclusion. Prophylactic LVA performed for macrometastatic melanoma is not a strong risk factor for relapse and metastasis.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatio-temporal variations of thermal patterns of Shiraz city by satellite images and GIS processing
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, climate change has caused an increase in the air temperature and consequently the tem-perature of the earth's surface. The temperature of the earth's surface has had various effects on urban life and has caused the formation of thermal islands in cities. Thermal islands are one of the important cri-teria in regional planning. The city of Shiraz is considered to be a large population center in the southwest of Iran on the one hand and one of the important tourism centers of Iran on the other hand, so the pur-pose of this research is to monitor the spatial form of thermal islands in this city. The satellite images of Shiraz city were first collected and extracted in the hot periods of the year from 1985-to 2020 using the data of Landsat's 4 and 5 (TM), 7 (ETM+), and 8 (OLI/TIRS). After required preprocessing, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and the urban heat dispersion index were determined by the Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI). The regions with UHI, the variation of the temperature in the city, and the rela-tionship between the LST and surface vegetation were evaluated based on the results of image processing to determine the UHIs of Shiraz. The temporal variations of the temperature pattern of Shiraz city indi-cated that about 12.76 km2 was added to the area of the fourth temperature class from 1985 to 2020. Results of NDVI evaluation in the studied period showed a decline in the vegetation from 22.28 km2 in 1985 to 17.54 km2 in 2020 due to alteration of the land use which can explain the formation and increase of the UHIs in the mentioned regions. At the beginning of the investigated period (1985), the temperature of the earth's surface was 17 degrees Celsius and reached 21 degrees Celsius at the end of the period (2020). The moni-toring of the spatial form of the surface temperature of the earth shows that heat islands are moving from the outskirts of the city towards the city center. UTFVI also revealed that the awful regions (very hot tem-peratures) are mainly concentrated in the west and north-west to the south west of Shiraz (including some parts of districts 9 and 10), south east of district 7, and north of district 1.(c) 2022 National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Three-dimensional visual technique based on CT lymphography data combined with methylene blue in endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The combined application of blue dye and radioisotopes is currently the primary mapping technique used for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients. However, radiocolloid techniques have not been widely adopted, especially in developing countries, given the strict restrictions on radioactive materials. Consequently, we carried out a retrospective study to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of three-dimensional visualization technique (3DVT) based on computed tomography-lymphography (CT-LG) in endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy (ESLNB) for breast cancer. Methods: From September 2018 to June 2020, 389 patients who underwent surgical treatment of breast cancer in our department were included in this study. The CT-LG data of these patients were reconstructed into digital 3D models and imported into Smart Vision Works V1.0 to locate the sentinel lymph node (SLN) and for visual simulation surgery. ESLNB and endoscopic axillary lymph node dissection were carried out based on this new technique; the accuracy and clinical value of 3DVT in ESLNB were analyzed. Results: The reconstructed 3D models clearly displayed all the structures of breast and axilla, which favors the intraoperative detection of SLNs. The identification rate of biopsied SLNs was 100% (389/389). The accuracy, sensitivity, and false-negative rate were 93.83% (365/389), 93.43% (128/137), and 6.57% (9/137), respectively. Upper limb lymphedema occurred in one patient 3 months after surgery during the 12-month follow-up period. Conclusions: Our 3DVT based on CT-LG data combined with methylene blue in ESLNB ensures a high identification rate of SLNs with low false-negative rates. It, therefore, has the potential to serve as a new method for SLN biopsy in breast cancer cases.

TI  - An enhanced spatiotemporal fusion model with degraded fine-resolution images via relativistic generative adversarial networks
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Limited by the sensor technology and budget, spatiotemporal fusion (STF) of remote sensing images (RSIs) is an effective strategy to obtain products with dense time and high spatial resolution. The STF methods generally require at least three observed images, and the predicted results depend on the reference date. The lack of high-quality fine-resolution images in practice makes the STF model difficult to apply, and few models consider the bias caused by different sensors. To solve the above problems, an enhanced STF model with degraded fine-resolution images via relativistic generative adversarial networks is proposed, called EDRGAN-STF, which is an end-to-end network with all bands trained simultaneously. To reduce the bias caused by different sensors, a degraded resolution version of the Landsat image with an arbitrary date is introduced into the STF model. The inputs of EDRGAN-STF only contain a MODIS image of the predicted date, a reference Landsat image and degraded version with an arbitrary date. EDRGAN-STF consists of a generator and a relativistic average least squares discriminator (RaLSD). A dual-stream residual dense block is designed to fully obtain the local and global spatial details and low-frequency information in the generator. A multihierarchical feature fusion block is designed to fuse global information. A spectral-spatial attention mechanism is employed in the generator, which focuses on important spectral bands and spatial features and enhances the reconstruction of critical regions. A new composite loss function is introduced to better optimize the designed STF model. To verify the capability of the EDRGAN-STF, extensive experiments are conducted on two typical Landsat-MODIS datasets, and results illustrate that EDRGAN-STF improves the STF accuracy and has great prospects for practical applications.

TI  - Detecting geothermal anomalies using Landsat 8 thermal infrared remote sensing data in the Ruili Basin, Southwest China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With the recent increase in global focus on green energy, the application of thermal infrared remote sensing data for the detection of geothermal anomalies has attracted wide attention as it can overcome the difficulty of using only ground surveying. This study aimed to highlight areas of geothermal anomalies with land surface temperature (LST) time series data in winter derived from thermal infrared remote sensing. To extract LST anomaly areas in the Ruili Basin for geothermal prospecting, nine types of data on the study area in winter during 2014 similar to 2021 from Landsat 8 were analyzed. Landsat 8 LST inversion data based on the mono-window algorithm (MWA) can be used to identify hot springs, volcanoes, and other heat-related phenomena. Superimposing LST anomalies for each cycle through drilling data, excluding the heat island effect, geothermal anomaly regions could be plotted. The results show that the accuracy of MWA LST varied within 2 K, which is acceptable for geothermal energy and higher than those of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) algorithm and MODIS LST products. Three high-LST regions in the southeast of the study area were identified as geothermal anomaly areas (A, B, and C), and region B was further verified through a comprehensive field investigation of geothermal wells, supplemented by the temperature gradient (TG) method. The findings reveal that the distribution of geothermal anomaly areas and high-LST areas are highly consistent with the northeast trending fault structure; faults act as thermal channels and help in accurately detecting local LST anomalies. Overall, the infrared remote sensing method proved to be a valid technique for detecting LST anomalies. Considering the synergy between thermal infrared surface detection and subsurface exploration methods, the identification of known geothermal fields (B) and other possible areas (A and C) has significance in the upscaling of local geologic information to regional prospecting, thus providing a direction for future geothermal research.

TI  - Culture, church, and collective: a qualitative study about gambling harm prevention and reduction in Aotearoa/New Zealand-a Tongan male perspective
T2  - HARM REDUCTION JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In New Zealand, Pacific people continue to be more at risk of gambling harm than the general population, despite increasing public health efforts and treatment service provisions introduced to address this social and health issue. In looking at why this is so, our first concern was to ask why the delivery of the prevailing gambling-focussed programmes was not influencing Pacific gambling behaviours. In seeking to answer this question, it was important to explore ethnic-Pacific-specific factors of gambling harm prevention and reduction. Methods: The research design was interpretivist/constructivist and phenomenological, applied through the lens of a Tongan worldview. Participants comprised Tongan male elders and youth. Recruitment of participants was through snowball sampling from churches and kava-drinking circles. A total of 28 elders and 18 youth participated through focus group talanoa and individual talanoa. This study employed descriptive thematic analysis. Results: Participants were not aware of any policy document or problem-gambling preventative programmes. Four key themes were raised, which include raising the awareness of existing gambling harm treatment providers, the church influence in addressing gambling harm, community-based strategies, and cultural-based approaches. Conclusions: This study proposes several recommendations such as more awareness of gambling harm providers in community, increasing cultural spaces and church engagements, and calls for further research in addressing the prevention and reduction of gambling harm amongst the Tongan community in New Zealand.

TI  - Synergistic retrievals of leaf area index and soil moisture from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Joint retrieval of vegetation status from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data holds much promise due to the complimentary of the information in the two wavelength domains. SAR penetrates the canopy and includes information about the water status of the soil and vegetation, whereas optical data contains information about the amount and health of leaves. However, due to inherent complexities of combining these data sources there has been relatively little progress in joint retrieval of information over vegetation canopies. In this study, data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 were used to invert coupled radiative transfer models to provide synergistic retrievals of leaf area index and soil moisture. Results for leaf area are excellent and enhanced by the use of both data sources (RSME is always less than 0.5 and has a correlation of better than 0.95 when using both together), but results for soil moisture are mixed with joint retrievals generally showing the lowest RMSE but underestimating the variability of the field data. Examples of such synergistic retrieval of plant properties from optical and SAR data using physically based radiative transfer models are uncommon in the literature, but these results highlight the potential for this approach.

TI  - Prognostic Significance and Management of Sentinel Nodes in the Triangular Intermuscular Space of Patients with Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundThe clinical significance of sentinel nodes (SNs) in the triangular intermuscular space (TIS) of patients with melanoma is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine their incidence and positivity rate, and to report their management and patient outcomes. MethodsThis was a single-institution retrospective cohort study of patients with unilateral or bilateral TIS SNs on lymphoscintigraphy treated between 1992 and 2017. Recurrence-free survival was analyzed. ResultsLymphoscintigraphy identified TIS SNs in 266 patients. They were bilateral in 17 patients. Of the 2296 patients with a melanoma on the upper back, 259 (11%) had TIS SNs. Procurement of SNs was not attempted in 122 (43%) of the 283 cases and failed in 11 cases (7%). An SN was successfully retrieved from the TIS in 145 patients (53%) and contained metastasis in 18 of 150 TIS SNs. This was the only positive SN in 12 patients (8%), upstaging all of them. Of the 18 patients with a positive SN in the TIS, 9 (50%) underwent completion axillary lymph node dissection, but no additional involved nodes were found in any of these patients. Recurrence in the TIS was observed in six patients (5%), none of whom had their TIS SN surgically pursued previously. ConclusionsLymphoscintigraphy showed TIS SNs in 11% of patients with melanomas on their upper back. In such cases, retrieval of TIS SNs is required for accurate staging and to minimize the risk of TIS recurrence.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Urban lakes provide important ecological services to local communities, such as flood mitigation, biodiversity, and recreation. With rapid urbanization, urban lakes are significantly affected by socio-economic development and urgently need attention. Yet there is still a lack of datasets that include tiny urban lakes on a global or national scale. This study aims to produce a high-resolution circa-2020 map of urban lakes (>= 0.001 km(2)) in China. The 10-m-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and a simple but robust water extraction method was used to generate waterbodies. The accuracy of this national-scale dataset was evaluated by comparing it with manually sampled urban units, with the average accuracy of 81.85% in area and 93.35% in count. The database totally inventories 1.11 x 10(6) urban lakes in China, with a net area of similar to 2.13 x 10(3) km(2). Overall, the spatial distribution of urban lakes in China showed strongly heterogeneous characteristics. This dataset will enhance our understanding of the distribution pattern of China's urban lakes and contribute to better ecological and environmental management as well as sustainable urban development planning.

TI  - Why Naturalism cannot (Merely) be an Attitude
T2  - TOPOI-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Varying forms of ontological and methodological naturalism are among the most popular theses in contemporary philosophy. However, each of these theses faces a different dilemma: ontological naturalism is famously challenged by Hempel's dilemma, while methodological naturalism faces issues regarding its coherence. Some prominent naturalists (Elpidorou and Dove 2018, Ney 2009, Rea 2002) have suggested to circumvent these respective dilemmas by reconceiving naturalism as an attitude (rather than a thesis). This paper argues that such attitude accounts are unsuccessful: naturalism as an attitude either collapses into a thesis again or is rationally unjustifiable. This paper closes by suggesting two options a naturalist has remaining. Either a naturalist can reasonably choose to revert to defending naturalism as a thesis; given that naturalism receives substantial support, it is not unlikely that a solution to the problems encountered by naturalism qua thesis is forthcoming. Or a naturalist might simply want to embrace an a-rational form of naturalism as a worldview, as suggested by Kim (2003) and Stoljar (2010) (and earlier by thinkers like Dilthey 1960 and Jaspers1925).

TI  - Music, Spirits and Healing in the Twelve Apostles Church: A Ghanaian Christological Paradigm
T2  - CRITICAL ARTS-SOUTH-NORTH CULTURAL AND MEDIA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I discuss the connection between music and spirits in the healing rituals of the Twelve Apostles Church (TAC), the first of the African Indigenous Churches (AICs) in Ghana. After the failure of missionary Christians in addressing the spiritual needs of their converts, the AICs began practicing Christianity in a way that resonated with the Ghanaian worldview and understanding that illnesses and misfortunes are caused by "evil" spirits. How do spirits manifest themselves in the healing ritual of the TAC? Drawing on a Christological framework, and using participant observations, interviews and focus group discussions, I explore the role of music in the soteriology of the TAC. For the TAC, to be saved is to be free from the attack of "evil" spirits. The findings reveal that it is through sacred musical performances that spirits are made to coexist for healing to be affected in a Christ-mediated context. I conclude, therefore, that music in the healing rituals of the TAC holds the entire ritual together and that the prophet-healer is a vessel used by Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit to heal.

TI  - Segment-based fusion of multi-sensor multi-scale satellite soil moisture retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synergetic use of sensors for soil moisture retrieval is attracting considerable interest due to the different advantages of different sensors. Active, passive, and optic data integration could be a comprehensive solution for exploiting the advantages of different sensors aimed at preparing soil moisture maps. Typically, pixel-based methods are used for multi-sensor fusion. Since, different applications need different scales of soil moisture maps, pixel-based approaches are limited for this purpose. Object-based image analysis employing an image object instead of a pixel could help us to meet this need. This paper proposes a segment-based image fusion framework to evaluate the possibility of preparing a multi-scale soil moisture map through integrated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology was able to improve soil moisture estimation in different scales up to 20% better compared to pixel-based fusion approach.

TI  - Preoperative predictive factors affecting sentinel lymph node positivity in breast cancer and comparison of their effectiveness with existing nomograms
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to establish a strong regression model by revealing the preoperative predictive factors for sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in patients with early stage breast cancer (ESBC). In total, 445 patients who underwent SLN dissection for ESBC were included. All data that may be potential predictors of SLN positivity were retrospectively analyzed. Tumor size >2 cm, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) + status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), palpable tumor, microcalcifications, multifocality or multicentricity, and axillary ultrasonographic findings were defined as independent predictors of SLN involvement. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) values were 0.797, 0.808, and 0.870 for the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram, MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) nomogram, and our regression model, respectively (P < .001). The recent model for predicting SLN status in ESBC was found to be stronger than existing nomograms. Parameters not included in current nomograms, such as palpable tumors, microcalcifications, and axillary ultrasonographic findings, are likely to make this model more meaningful.

TI  - Urban river water quality monitoring based on self-optimizing machine learning method using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban rivers are complex ecosystems that directly determine the living environment of human beings. Moni-toring the urban river water quality indexes is a challenge in water quality evaluation. The purpose of this study was to propose a multi-source remote sensing water quality inversion method based on a small number of samples to solve the problem of scale inconsistency among multi-source remote sensing data, so as to achieve large-scale and efficient inversion of urban river water quality. Since there is a very important problem that the complex nonlinear relationships must be solved between simple ground point data and remote sensing data in water quality inversion, a novel self-optimizing machine learning monitoring method is proposed, which can automatically find the optimal parameters of the model from a small number of samples, and reduce the training time. Meanwhile, in order to strengthen the correlation between water quality parameters and remote sensing data, the feature enhancement method was used for generating the input data. Moreover, to solve the problem of the multi-source data quantity and quality, the spatial mapping method was used to achieve consistency in the water quality information since these data have different nonlinear characteristics. The experimental results show that for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, the R2 of chlorophyll a (Chla), turbidity (TUB), and ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) can reached 0.917, 0.877 and 0.846, respectively. Using a satellite image, the R2 of Chla, TUB, and NH3-N can reach 0.827, 0.679 and 0.779, respectively. This method provides a new way to realize the integration of air-space-ground monitoring of urban inland rivers in the future.

TI  - Probabilistic SAR-based water segmentation with adapted Bayesian convolutional neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Geospatial resources, including satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical data, have been instrumental in providing time-sensitive information about the extent and impact of natural hazard events, such as floods, to support emergency response and hazard management efforts. In effect, finite resources can be better optimized to support the needs of often extensively affected areas. However, the derivation of SAR-based flood information is not without its challenges and inaccurate flood detection can result in poor decision-making and non-trivial, adverse consequences. Reliable uncertainty quantification of flood extent estimates addresses this risk. In this context, our study presents the results of two probabilistic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) adapted for SAR-based water segmentation with freely available Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) swath ground range detected (GRD) data. In particular, the performance of a variational inference-based Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) is evaluated against that of a Monte Carlo dropout network (MCDN). In previous studies where uncertainty information has been generated along with segmentation results, MCDN has been more commonly applied as an approximation of Bayesian deep learning. Differences between the two approaches are highlighted with the application of a set of extended performance metrics. Both segmentation and uncertainty outputs are evaluated at data-, model-, tile-and scene-levels. The methods are demonstrated on the binary segmentation of a reference water dataset. We show that while different probabilistic techniques return comparable segmentation accuracies, they are differentiated based on their performance in assigning reliable probabilities. In particular, MCDNs characterized by more restrictive architectures generally lead to over-confident prediction intervals, whereas BCNNs have greater flexibility to learn the mean and the spread of the parameter posterior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that examining the (inaccurate, certain) metric is a better indicator of reliable uncertainty quantification and the BCNN is recommended to quantify uncertainties asso-ciated with SAR-based segmentation outputs. This information is especially valuable where the cost of inaccurate detections (false-positive and false-negative) is high. These preliminary findings highlight how the manner in which probabilities are properly assigned and their inclusion are instrumental and complementary to the pro-duction of flood masks and should be considered as a standard in the natural hazards domain.

TI  - Who has a Pro-Ecological Worldview among educated Indian adults with internet access, and what are the influencing factors?
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Exploring public perception and attitude about environmental issues is essential to promote ecological sustainability. The ecological worldview, as tapped by New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) Scale, depicts an individual's sensitivity toward the environment and further informs their consumption behavior. There is a paucity of research exploring the ecological worldview of Indian consumer segments and their socio-demographic characteristics. In this study, an online cross-sectional survey was conducted on a sample of 1858 Indian adults, and ecological worldview was assessed using NEP Scale. A combination approach of clustering was employed to find consumer segments distinguishable in terms of ecological attitude following dimensional analysis of the NEP Scale using principal component analysis. Socio-demographic predictors of ecological worldview were identified using multiple linear regression. Indian adults endorsed a pro-ecological worldview with a mean NEP score of 3.45. NEP Scale tapped three dimensions of ecological worldview among the Indian sub-sample instead of five, which were "Environmental concern," "Humans over nature," and "Limits of earth." "Ecologically conscious," "Conscious anthropocentric," and "Ecologically sensitive" were three identified segments endorsing facets of ecological worldview to a varying degree. Education, occupation, religion, caste, number of children or adolescents in a family, family type, house location, and residential zone were significant predictors of pro-ecological worldview among Indian adults. Thus, the worldview of Indian adults was inspired by the New Ecological Paradigm. Environmental sustainability must be emphasized from earlier years of education with women in policymaking. Policy framework to promote environmental awareness and ecological sensitivity must consider the socio-demographic characteristics of various population segments.

TI  - Impacts of the spatial configuration of built-up areas and urban vegetation on land surface temperature using spectral and local spatial autocorrelation indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how the spatial configuration of land cover patterns of built-up areas and urban vegetation affect urban surface temperatures is crucial for improving the sustainability of cities as well as optimizing urban design and landscape planning. Because of their capability to detect distinct surface thermal features, satellite data have proved useful in exploring the impacts of spatial configuration of land cover on land surface temperature (LST). In this study, we examine how the spatial configuration of built-up and urban vegetation affects the LST in the Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe. In order to achieve this objective, we combined the LST, local spatial statistics of Getis-Ord Gi* and local Moran's I statistic, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Built-Up Index (NDBI) derived from multi-date Landsat satellite data (1994, 2001 and 2017). The results of local Moran's I statistic showed moderate and negative correlations between LST and Landsat derived NDVI. Overall, these results of local Moran's I statistic demonstrate that clustered vegetation tend to lower LST, providing thermal comfort conditions. In contrast, clustered spatial arrangements of NDBI based on the Getis-Ord Gi* elevate LST, implying that continued clustered built-up expansion has the potential to increase urban surface temperatures.

TI  - Super-resolution of Sentinel-2 images using Wasserstein GAN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 satellites deliver 13 band multi-spectral imagery with bands having 10 m, 20 m or 60 m spatial resolution. The low-resolution bands can be upsampled to match the high resolution bands to extract valuable information at higher spatial resolution. This paper presents a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) based approach named as DSen2-WGAN to super-resolve the low-resolution (i.e., 20 m and 60 m) bands of Sentinel-2 images to a spatial resolution of 10 m. A proposed generator is trained in an adversarial manner using the min-max game to super-resolve the low-resolution bands with the guidance of available high-resolution bands in an image. The performance evaluated using metrics such as Signal Reconstruction Error (SRE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art method, DSen2 as the DSen2-WGAN reduced RMSE by 14.68% and 7%, while SRE improved by almost 4% and 1.6% for 6 x and 2 x super-resolution. Lastly, for further evaluation, we have used trained DSen2-WGAN model to super-resolve the bands of EuroSAT dataset, a satellite image classification dataset based on Sentinel-2 images. The per band classification accuracy of low-resolution bands shows significant improvement after super-resolution using our proposed approach.

TI  - Progressive fusion learning: A multimodal joint segmentation framework for building extraction from optical and SAR images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic and high-precision extraction of buildings from remote sensing images has a wide range of application and importance. Optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are typical types of multimodal remote sensing data with different imaging methods. To bridge the huge gap between them and achieve high-precision joint semantic segmentation, this study proposes a progressive fusion learning framework. The framework explicitly extracts the shared features (that is, modal invariants) of multimodal images as the information medium and realizes information fusion through multistage learning. Based on this framework, we design a network called the multistage multimodal fusion network (MMFNet), which uses phase as a modal invariant to joint optical and SAR images to achieve high-precision building extraction. We conducted experiments with the Multi-Sensor All-Weather Mapping aerial dataset and the WHU-OPT-SAR_WuHan satellite dataset. This study shows MMFNet has a significant extraction effect and yields more optimized extraction of the edge details of buildings, which is improved by 0.2% to 9.5% compared to other multimodal joint segmentation methods.

TI  - Tropical cyclone Wind Pump induced chlorophyll-a enhancement in the South China Sea: A comparison of the open sea and continental shelf
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The continental shelf and open sea region have different ocean physical and environmental responses to tropical cyclones (TC). The present study firstly compared the grid-based maximum response (GMR) of sea surface chlorophyll a (Chl-a) to TCs Wind Pump between the continental shelf (depths 50-200m) and open sea (depths>200 m) region in the South China Sea (SCS) during 1998-2020, using multiple-satellite data. For all TC events, the average Chl-a increases by 0.13 mg/m(3). The comparisons between the pre- and post-TC periods show that Chl-a increases by 0.18 mg/m(3) (115%) in the continental shelf and 0.07 mg/m(3) (57%) in the open sea region, respectively. In both areas, TC-induced Chl-a enhancement (Chl_en) strongly depends on TC maximum wind speed and translation speed. The strong and fast-moving TCs and weak and slow-moving TCs both induce the maximum Chl_en in the continental shelf region. While in the open sea, the maximum Chl_en was induced by the strong and slow-moving TCs. Overall, our results reveal that the TC wind pump's effects on Chl-a enhancement are stronger in the continental shelf region than in the open sea.

TI  - Near real-time yield forecasting of winter wheat using Sentinel-2 imagery at the early stages
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the main crops in Canada. Near real-time forecasting of within-field variability of yield in winter wheat at the early stages is essential for precision farming. However, the crop yield modelling based on high spatial resolution satellite data is generally affected by the lack of continuous satellite observations, resulting in reducing the generalization ability of the models and increasing the difficulty of near real-time crop yield forecasting at the early stages. In this study, the correlations between Sentinel-2 data (vegetation indices and reflectance) and yield data collected by combine harvester were investigated and a generalized multivariate linear regression (MLR) model was built and tested with data acquired in different years. In addition, three simple unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) methods were adopted for improving the generalization ability of yield prediction. The winter wheat yield prediction using multiple vegetation indices showed higher accuracy than using single vegetation index. The optimum stage for winter wheat yield forecasting varied with different fields when using vegetation indices, while it was consistent when using multispectral reflectance and the optimum stage for winter wheat yield prediction was at the end of flowering stage. This study demonstrated that the simple mean matching (MM) performed better than other DA methods and it was found that "DA then MLR at the optimum stage " performed better than "MLR directly at the early stages " for winter wheat yield forecasting at the early stages. The results indicated that the DA had a great potential in near real-time crop yield forecasting at the early stages.

TI  - Estimates of broadband upwelling irradiance from GOES-16 ABI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived estimates of the Earth's radiation budget are crucial for understanding and predicting the weather and climate. However, existing satellite products measuring broadband outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave radiation (RSR) have spatio-temporal resolutions that are too coarse to evaluate important radiative forcers like aircraft condensation trails. We present a neural network which estimates OLR and RSR based on narrowband radiances, using collocated Cloud and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) data. The resulting estimates feature strong agreement with the CERES data products (R2 = 0.977 for OLR and 0.974 for RSR on CERES Level 2 footprints), and we provide open access to the collocated satellite data and model outputs on all available GOES-16 ABI data for the 4 years from 2018-2021.

TI  - Effect of vegetation and land surface temperature on NO<sub>2</sub> concentration: A Google Earth Engine-based remote sensing approach
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing tension on the global sustainable environment in the urban areas, it is essential to monitor the airborne pollutants and understand the underlying factors that can trigger the situation in a worst-case scenario. Because of its cramped living conditions, excessive coal and fuel usage, and rapid deforestation, the southeast Asian region has historically had worse air quality than the rest of the world. The economic hubs of India and Bangladesh, in particular, have drawn so much attention away from rural regions that unrestrained urbanization is becoming controversial for planners, engineers, and stakeholders in sustainable development. This research combines the two main Asian capital regions, Delhi and Dhaka. It analyzes the change in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration, land surface temperature (LST), and vegetation dynamics across three years (2019-2021) for summer and winter. The NO2 concentration data from Sentinel-5P has been extracted using Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Landsat-8 imagery was utilized for LST, Normalizer Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI). The statistical analysis has been carried out by dividing the research regions into one sq. km grid (1512 grids for Delhi and 1485 grids for Dhaka). According to descriptive research, Dhaka's condition is worse than Delhi's, with significant vegetation loss with LST and NO2 concentrations rising. In both research regions, the NO2 concentration is high throughout the winter. The Pearson correlation value demonstrates a negative association between total NO2 concentration and mean NDVI and EVI values and a positive relationship between total NO2 concentration and mean LST. The data have been further assessed using linear regression, which overlaps the correlation result with a maximum R-squared value of 0.2998 for NO2 and EVI in winter 2019.

TI  - Legacy land use predicts occupancy patterns of prairie-associated herpetofauna in Western Arkansas
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Prairies historically covered much of inland North America, and many species have adapted to the unique conditions found in prairie ecosystems. Less than 1% of prairies remain in Arkansas, with much historic prairie having been converted for urban and agricultural development, resulting in steep population declines for many prairie-associated species.Objectives Because many reptile and amphibian species are difficult to detect, the current distributions and habitat requirements of prairie-associated herpetofauna in fragmented landscapes are poorly understood. Thus, we assessed the state of prairie-associated herpetofauna communities in intact prairie, as well in degraded and developed historic prairie throughout Western Arkansas.Methods Using repeated field surveys, remote sensing data, and hierarchical community occupancy models, we examined the influence of vegetation conditions, land use, and landscape characteristics on an assemblage of nine species of prairie-associated herpetofauna.Results Prairie mound density, representing prairie that has not been subject to intense anthropogenic disturbance, was the strongest positive predictor of occupancy by prairie-associated species. Historic prairie area also exhibited a positive relationship with occupancy for several species but not at the assemblage level. Current vegetation conditions did not strongly influence occupancy patterns.Conclusions Our results suggest that long-term land use filters, rather than present site-level conditions, are the driving forces dictating current distributions of prairie-associate herpetofauna in Western Arkansas. Our findings provide insight into the present state of understudied populations in an increasingly fragmented region and present accessible tools for directing exploratory conservation and research efforts.

TI  - Quantifying groundwater storage dynamics in the Chesapeake Bay watershed (USA) using a large-scale integrated hydrologic model with detailed three-dimensional subsurface representation
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Expanding on current efforts to evaluate the role of groundwater dynamics in managing and restoring Chesapeake Bay (USA), the integrated hydrologic model ParFlow-CLM was applied to a 374,976-km(2) area encompassing the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The model included a representation of surface water, groundwater and land-surface energy fluxes with spatially variable atmospheric forcing at an hourly time step. The study tackled issues of data availability, access, assembly, and synthesis for estimating hydrogeologic properties in the context of the development of a large-scale model. Hydrogeologic properties from literature and other sources were assembled, processed, and synthesized to derive a conceptual hydrogeologic model consisting of 29 hydrofacies and a three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity field. Evaluation of the ParFlow-CLM model output showed that the constructed model captured seasonal and spatial variability in subsurface storage, surface storage and surface runoff, and produced water-table depths consistent with the topography, meteorological forcing, and hydrogeology. Comparison with well data from the US Geological Survey showed good agreement of model output with observed hydraulic heads for most of the data. Modeled terrestrial water storage changes compared well with GRACE satellite data with a root mean square error of 2.3 cm. Model results showed the dominant contribution of subsurface storage changes (90%) to terrestrial water storage changes in the region.

TI  - Deep neural network-based spatial gap-filling of MODIS ice surface temperatures over the Arctic using satellite and reanalysis data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Because ice surface temperature (IST) controls snow melt, sea ice growth and air-ocean heat exchange, it is a key parameter in analyses of the Arctic climate system. However, optical satellite-based IST data often have missing values due to the satellite orbit, clouds and polar night. In this study, we estimated IST using a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm based on meteorological, sea ice and geometric variables that are strongly correlated with IST. Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra IST data were used, and the input data were 2 m air temperature (Ta), 30-year averaged Ta (Ta climatology), total column water vapour (TCWV), solar zenith angle (SZA), local solar noon angle (LSN) and latitude. The data were classified into six cases according to sea ice age (SIA) and Ta to create an efficient DNN model that supplemented the IST data missing from the existing dataset. Model validation based on the MODIS IST data revealed a correlation coefficient of 0.94, root mean square error of 3.54 K and relative root mean square error of 1.35%, showing high accuracy.

TI  - Prediction of pine mistletoe infection using remote sensing imaging: A comparison of the artificial neural network model and logistic regression model
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the prediction of pine mistletoe distribution in Scots pine ecosystems was explored using remote sensing variables to compare the multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) model performances. For this purpose, 109 sample plots were distinguished in pure Scots pine forests (natural) in the Eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey. Distinguishing mistletoe-infected stands (69) and uninfected stands (40) was performed with field observations. The variables acquired from Landsat 8 (Level 1) images were used as independent variables for independent-sample t-test, MLP ANN and LR models. Remote sensing variables indicated that mistletoe-infected stands were in drier areas with a lower vegetation-leaf area index. Based on the performance results of both models, the sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of the MLP ANN model were superior to those of the LR model. The prediction percentages (SEN, SPE, PPV and NPV) of mistletoe-infected stands were better than the prediction percentages of uninfected stands. The prediction accuracies of LR and MLP ANN models were 74.3% and 89.6%, respectively. However, all remote sensing variables were included in the prediction equation of the MLP ANN model, while the thermal infrared 1 (TIRS1) variable was included in the LR model. In the MLP ANN model, the TIRS1 variable also had the highest normalized importance (100%). The area under the curve (AUC) value for identifying the mistletoe-infected stands of Scots pine forests used by the MLP ANN model (0.892 +/- 0.034) was higher than in the LR model (0.838 +/- 0.039), explaining the more accurate predictions obtained from the MLP ANN model. The MLP ANN model showed much better performance than the LR model. The results of this study are expected to make important contributions to the identification of potential mistletoe-infected areas.

TI  - Risk Factors for Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected and -Uninfected Individuals in South Africa, April 2020-March 2022: Data From Sentinel Surveillance
T2  - OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Data on risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-associated hospitalization and mortality in high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence settings are limited.Methods. Using existing syndromic surveillance programs for influenza-like-illness and severe respiratory illness at sentinel sites in South Africa, we identified factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and mortality.Results. From April 2020 through March 2022, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was detected in 24.0% (660 of 2746) of outpatient and 32.5% (2282 of 7025) of inpatient cases. Factors associated with COVID-19-associated hospitalization included the following: older age (25-44 [adjusted odds ratio {aOR}= 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-2.9], 45-64 [aOR = 6.8, 95% CI = 4.2-11.0] and >= 65 years [aOR = 26.6, 95% CI = 14.4-49.1] vs 15-24 years); black race (aOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.2-5.0); obesity (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.9); asthma (aOR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.4-8.9); diabetes mellitus (aOR, 5.3; 95% CI, 3.1-9.3); HIV with CD4 >= 200/mm(3) (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2) and CD4 < 200/mm(3) (aOR, 10.5; 95% CI, 5.1-21.6) or tuberculosis (aOR, 12.8; 95% CI, 2.8-58.5). Infection with Beta (aOR, 0.5; 95% CI, .3-.7) vs Delta variant and being fully vaccinated (aOR, 0.1; 95% CI, .1-.3) were less associated with COVID-19 hospitalization. In-hospital mortality was increased in older age (45-64 years [aOR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.6-3.2] and >= 65 years [aOR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.8-5.8] vs 25-44 years) and male sex (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.6) and was lower in Omicron-infected (aOR, 0.3; 95% CI, .2-.6) vs Delta-infected individuals.Conclusions. Active syndromic surveillance encompassing clinical, laboratory, and genomic data identified setting-specific risk factors associated with COVID-19 severity that will inform prioritization of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Elderly people with tuberculosis or people with HIV, especially severely immunosuppressed, should be prioritized for vaccination.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - "Whiting" events in the Bahama Banks, due to high concentrations of carbonate-rich particles suspended in the water, have been reported and discussed widely in the past 80 years. However, little is known about their distributions and particularly about their long-term changes. Here, using a deep learning (DL) model, we objectively delineate and quantify whiting features from Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite images (250-m resolution) and establish an 18-year data record (2003-2020) of whiting occurrences in the Bahama Banks. Both the Great Bahama Bank (GBB) and the Little Bahama Bank (LBB) show clear seasonality in whiting areas, where a primary peak in spring and a secondary peak in winter are found in the GBB but only one peak in winter is found in the LBB. Such a seasonality may be explained using a hydrodynamic hypothesis on calcium carbonate precipitation. The mean size of individual whiting patches in the GBB is about 2.4 +/- 6.1 km2 (-0.1 to 226 km2), while in the LBB is 1.4 +/- 2.7 km2 (-0.1 to 95 km2). The total whiting coverage in a typical cloud-free image is 87.1 km2 in the GBB and 32.0 km2 in the LBB, representing 0.14% and 0.76% of the entire GBB and LBB, respectively. Significant increases in the mean coverage have been found in the GBB since 2011, with peak coverage (-200 km2) in 2013-2015 being at least 4 times higher than before (20-70 km2). Although the whiting area started to decrease after 2015, it did not reach the pre-2011 level until 2020. On the other hand, correlation analysis and principal component analysis of several environmental factors (pH, light, salinity, carbonate, aragonite, winds, currents) provided some hints on which factors may have contributed. From these, we infer a potential 'Goldilocks' scenario, whereby decreases in pH and carbonate concentration, concomitant with increases in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and current speeds, created conditions increasingly favorable for whitings from 2011 to 2015. Continuation of these environmental trends after 2015, however, resulted in conditions increasingly unfavorable for whiting formation, yet without field-based measurements it is difficult to conclude the potential reasons for increases and decreases of whiting formation in the GBB.

TI  - Response of ecosystem gross primary productivity to drought in northern China based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has become one of the main reasons for the loss of terrestrial ecosystems gross primary productivity (GPP) because of its more frequent occurrence under the background of global warming. Aiming to explore the response mechanism of vegetation under drought conditions, the sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were used to monitor vegetation drought and quantify the drought-induced GPP variabilities. MODIS GPP were used for analysis, which was verified by close-path eddy covariance flux (R2 = 0.69, p < 0.01). According to the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil moisture (SM), the drought periods of 2010 and 2014 in the eastern piedmont of Taihang Mountains were selected to analyze drought impacts on GPP. We found that SIF had the ability to reflect the effects of drought prolonged action on vegetation and respond to GPP persistent changes during drought. SIF successfully described GPP loss during droughts in 2010 (20.91 gCm-2month-1) and 2014 (9.52 gCm- 2month-1). SIF was more significantly linearly correlated with GPP (R2 = 0.89) than NDVI (R2 = 0.69) and EVI (R2 = 0.84), suggesting that SIF was more sensitive to physiological changes in vegetation. SIF correlated significantly higher to SM than SPEI, and there was a two-month lag to SM, which may be related to the adaptation mechanism of vegetation physiological recovery under drought conditions. Results showed that SIF is more accurate and sensitive than NDVI and EVI in regional vegetation drought monitoring and droughtinduced GPP variations. SIF is an effective physiological index for timely detection and regional drought, and an effective tool for ecosystem management and disaster warning.

TI  - Fusion of Remote Sensing, Magnetometric, and Geological Data to Identify Polymetallic Mineral Potential Zones in Chakchak Region, Yazd, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploration geologists are urged to develop new, robust, and low-cost approaches to identify high potential zones related to underground/unexplored mineral deposits because of increased depletion of ore deposits and high consumption of basic metal production industries. Fusing remote sensing, geophysical and geological data has great capability to provide a complete range of prerequisite data to accomplish this purpose. This investigation fuses remote sensing data, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat 7, aerial magnetic geophysical data, and geological data for identifying polymetallic mineralization potential zones in the Chakchak region, Yazd province, Iran. Hydrothermal alteration mineral zones and surface and deep intrusive masses, hidden faults and lineaments, and lithological units were detected using remote sensing, aerial magnetic, and geological data, respectively. The exploratory/information layers were fused using fuzzy logic modeling and the multi-class index overlap method. Subsequently, mineral potential maps were generated for the study area. Some high potential zones of polymetallic mineralization were identified and verified through a detailed field campaign and drilling programs in the Chakchak region. In conclusion, the fusion of remote sensing, geophysical, and geological data using fuzzy logic modeling and the multi-class index overlap method is a robust, reliable, and low-cost approach for mining companies to explore the frontier areas with identical geologic conditions that are alleged to indicate polymetallic mineralization potential.

TI  - Investigation of Two Severe Shamal Dust Storms and the Highest Dust Frequencies in the South and Southwest of Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms create some of the most critical air quality problems in the world; the Middle East, located in the dust belt, suffers substantially from dust storms. Iran, as a country in the Middle East, is affected by dust storms from multiple internal and external sources that mostly originate from deserts in Iraq and Syria (especially the Mesopotamia region). To determine the highest dust loadings in the south and west of Iran, dust frequencies were investigated in the eight most polluted stations in the west, southwest, and southern Iran for a period of 21 years from 2000 to 2021. During the study's duration, the dust frequency was much higher from 2008 to 2012, which coincided with severe droughts reported in Iraq and Syria; from which, we investigated two severe dust storms (as well as the dust sources and weather condition effects) that took place on 15-17 September 2008 and 1-3 June 2012; we used secondary data from ground measurement stations, and satellite and modeling products. In both cases, horizontal visibility was reduced to less than 1 km at most weather stations in Iran. The measured PM10 in the first case reached 834 mu g m(-3) at Ilam station in west Iran and the Iran-Iraq borders while the measured PM10 in the second case reached 4947 mu g m(-3) at Bushehr station in the northern shore of the Persian Gulf. The MODIS true color images and MODIS AOD detected the dust mass over Iraq, southern Iran, and Saudi Arabia in both cases; the AOD value reached 4 in the first case and 1.8 in the second case over the Persian Gulf. During these two severe dust storms, low-level jets were observed at 930 hPa atmospheric levels in north Iraq (2008 case) and south Iraq (2012 case). The output of the NAPPS model and CALIPSO satellite images show that the dust rose to higher than 5 km in these dust storm cases, confirming the influence of Shamal wind on the dust storm occurrences.

TI  - Past and Future Changes of Land Use/Land Cover and the Potential Impact on Ecosystem Services Value of Damietta Governorate, Egypt
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This investigation aims to assess the changes of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) and its impact on ecosystem services value in Damietta Governorate, Egypt. To fulfill this aim, Landsat data of TM5 in 2001, ETM in 2011 and OLI in 2021 were used. The Maximum Likelihood Classifier was employed to track the changes in LULC of the study area. Cellular automata (CA) and Markov model adopted from IDRISI software were used for accurate prediction of the LULC in 2031. The VALIDATE model in TerrSet was used to compare the predicted 2031 LULC with actual 2021 LULC to assess the accuracy of the model. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment was utilized to assess the value per unit area of land types. The results indicated that there was a noticeable change in different land cover classes during the duration 2001-2021. Results showed that there are decreases in the cultivated area and the bare area, meanwhile the urban area was increased. The cultivated area was remarkably decreased recording 548.2 km(2) (62.15%) at 2001, 548.2 km(2) (55.79%) at 2011 and 468.96 km(2) (53.16%) at 2021 of the total study area. However, the percentage of urban area increased; reporting 65.69 km(2) (7.45%), 124.57 km(2) (14.12%), and 176.67 km(2) (20.03%) at 2001, 2011, and 2021, respectively. LULC analyses in 2031 showed an increase in the urban area by 2.8% and a decrease in the cultivated area by 7.2%. The kappa index values are greater than 0.80, which shows a strong agreement between simulated and predicted LULC maps. The comprehensive index of Damietta Governorate ranges from 100 to 400. The ES that experienced positive ESV changes during the study period gives strength indicator for achieving the sustainable development of Damietta Governorate. To prevent further ecosystem degradation and to ensure the best possible delivery of ES, it is necessary to reduce the current drivers of LULC changes within the buildup in agricultural land. The study helps the local authorities to better understand the land use system and to develop an improved land use management strategies that manage the urban expansion and guarantee the ecological conservation.

TI  - A NOVEL SATELLITE-BASED METHODOLOGY FOR RETRIEVING SPECIFIC LEAF AREA OF RICE (HASHEMI CULTIVAR) AT FIELD SCALE
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific leaf area (SLA), determines the physiological cost of producing leaf area. Specific leaf area (SLA) is an important parameter for plant growth modelers because it determines how much new leaf area to deploy for each unit of biomass produced. Since direct measurement of SLA in the field is time-consuming and costly, this study introduces a novel satellited-based methodology for estimation of rice SLA from Sentinel 2A satellite images. To estimate the SLA, an experiment was conducted in a paddy field located in the Rice Research Institute of Iran. Detailed data on soil, water atmosphere and plant were collected under growth period of 2018. Sentinel 2A satellite images for the dates closed to the field sampling were downloaded and SLA data over the paddy field were derived using localized and general multi-variables regression equations based on biophysical vegetation indices. The evaluation of results at different growth stages showed that, in the vegetative stage, the NDVI (R2 = 0.98) had a better linear relationship with the LAI, but in the later growth stages, SAVI with determination coefficients of 0.99 and 0.93 provided a better linear relationship with the LAI at reproductive and ripening stages, respectively. Moreover, the results showed that SLA can be estimated for the entire rice growth period with high accuracy (R2 = 0.70), using exponential localized equations based on leaf dry matter and LAI. The results confirmed significant increase in the accuracy of SWAP yield output in case of data assimilation using satellite-based SLA.

TI  - Anomalous Lithospheric Magnetic Field over the Indo-Asian Collision Territory According to CHAMP Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of the lithospheric magnetic anomalies over the territory of the Tibetan Himalayan highlands, the Western and Eastern Himalayan syntaxes, and part of the Hindustan Peninsula, obtained from measurements on the German Earth satellite CHAMP (Challenging Minisatellite Payload) in different years of its mission, is studied. The lithospheric magnetic anomalies maps for the modulus of the full vector T-a and for the horizontal component X-a at different satellite flight levels are presented. The accordance of lithospheric magnetic anomalies maps to the regional geological and tectonic data and regional geophysics is considered. The anomalous magnetic field sign inversion over the northern part of the Indian Plate is explained as a possible effect of mantle heating, the rise of the Curie isotherm, and the loss of the initial magnetization of the earth's lower crust. A series of split-level maps of magnetic anomalies are compared with each other, and the degree of their similarity is estimated. To illustrate the expediency of separation lithospheric magnetic anomalies directly from satellite measurements and to demonstrate the difference between maps of regional lithospheric and near-surface anomalies, a T-a map was constructed based on the data from the EMAG2 database of the WDMAM model at a 4 km level. The results of the work show that the identified magnetic anomalies over the Indo-Asian collision region are adequately consistent with the existing regional geological, tectonic, and geophysical conditions.

TI  - Lithospheric Magnetic Anomalies over Large Igneous Province Territories
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution of the satellite lithospheric magnetic field is analyzed as a parameter associated with plume magmatism processes that occurred on the territories of large igneous magmatic provinces (LIPs). We consider the lithospheric geomagnetic field at an altitude of similar to 250-300 km derived from the CHAMP satellite data for three LIPs of different ages: Central European, North Atlantic, and Siberian. The results are evidence that the parameters of the lithospheric geomagnetic field are controlled by complex magmatic processes. Ancient mantle plumes are reflected in the lithospheric magnetic field as conformal positive anomalies of large magnitudes, while the lithospheric magnetic field on the territory of the young North Atlantic province is significantly reduced. Therefore, the data from geomagnetic satellite surveys add valuable information to the available geological and geophysical data and should be used holistically for studying the crustal heterogeneity of LIPs.

TI  - Short-term analysis of coastal erosion among human intervention and sea level rise
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers short-term coastal erosion in the Gaza Strip and its relationship to the local sea level change and human interventions on the shoreline. There is a proven relationship between increased coastal erosion and global mean sea level rise, especially in the long-term; however, the impact of human interventions on the shoreline could be more than on sea level in the short-term. Recently, cliff and coastal erosion have been widely noticed along the shoreline, mainly where human interventions occur. Therefore, remote sensing and GIS were used to derive the rate of coastal erosion in these regions while local sea level data were collected from the available Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) in order to investigate sea level changes. The local sea level trends from adjacent stations to the Gaza Strip were derived. The goal is to investigate whether an upward sea level trend explains the occurring erosion of the shores. The results revealed that several regions along the Gaza Strip shoreline undergo a landward erosional process, with an average rate ranging between - 0.2 and - 0.8 m/year. Furthermore, monthly and annual mean sea level trends demonstrated a negative trend between -1.42 and -5.25 mm/year. In particular, as there is no clue of a significant upward trend in local sea level during the last eight years which is accompanied by an acceleration in the coastal erosion, informal human intervention could be considered a primary catalyst for accelerating coastal erosion in the short-term.

TI  - An ST131 clade and a phylogroup A clade bearing an O101-like O-antigen cluster predominate among bloodstream <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> isolates from South-West Nigeria hospitals
T2  - MICROBIAL GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Escherichia coli bloodstream infections are typically attributed to a limited number of lineages that carry virulence factors associated with invasiveness. In Nigeria, the identity of circulating clones is largely unknown and surveillance of their antimicrobial resistance has been limited. We verified and whole-genome sequenced 68 2016-2018 bloodstream E. coli isolates from three sentinel sites in South-Western Nigeria and susceptibility tested 67 of them. Resistance to antimicrobials commonly used in Nigeria was high, with 67 (100 %), 62 (92.5%), 53 (79.1%) and 37 (55.2 %) showing resistance to trimethoprim, ampicillin, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides, respectively. Thirty-five (51 %) isolates carried extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes and 32 (91%) of these were multidrug resistant. All the isolates were susceptible to carbapenems and colistin. The strain set included globally disseminated high-risk clones from sequence type (ST)12 (2), ST131 (12) and ST648 (4). Twenty-three (33.8%) of the isolates clustered within two clades. The first of these consisted of ST131 strains, comprising O16:H5 and O25:H4 sub-lineages. The second was an ST10-ST167 complex clade comprising strains carrying O-antigen and capsular genes of likely Klebsiella origin, identical to those of avian pathogenic E. coli Sanji, and serotyped in silico as O89, O101 or ONovel32, depending on the tool used. Four temporally associated ST90 strains from one sentinel were closely related enough to suggest that at least some of them represented a retrospectively detected outbreak cluster. Our data implicate a broad repertoire of E. coli isolates associated with bloodstream infections in South-West Nigeria. Continued genomic surveillance is valuable for tracking clones of importance and for outbreak identification.

TI  - The Simulation and Prediction of Land Surface Temperature Based on SCP and CA-ANN Models Using Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Lahore
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, urban growth has become a major issue in Lahore, accelerating land surface temperature (LST) rise. The present study focused on estimating the current situation and simulating the future LST patterns in Lahore using remote sensing data and machine learning models. The semi-automated classification model was applied for the estimation of LST from 2000 to 2020. Then, the cellular ed to predict future LST patterns for 2030 and 2040, respectively. Our research findings revealed that an average of 2.8 degrees C of land surface temperature has increased, with a mean LST value from 37.25 degrees C to 40.10 degrees C in Lahore during the last two decades from 2000 to 2020. Moreover, keeping CA-ANN simulations for land surface temperature, an increase of 2.2 degrees C is projected through 2040, and mean LST values will be increased from 40.1 degrees C to 42.31 degrees C by 2040. The CA-ANN model was validated for future LST simulation with an overall Kappa value of 0.82 and 86.2% of correctness for the years 2030 and 2040 using modules for land-use change evaluation. The study also indicates that land surface temperature is an important factor in environmental changes. Therefore, it is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban rooftop plantations and vegetation conservation to minimize land surface temperature increases in Lahore.

TI  - Flash Drought Onset and Development Mechanisms Captured With Soil Moisture and Vegetation Data Assimilation
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash droughts evolve and intensify rapidly under the influence of anomalous atmospheric conditions. In this study, we investigate the role of assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) and vegetation properties in capturing the evolution and impacts of two flash droughts in the Northern Great Plains. We find that during 2016 drought triggered by anomalously high temperatures and excessive evaporative demands, multivariate data assimilation (DA) of MODIS-derived leaf area index (LAI) and Soil Moisture Active Passive SM within Noah-Multiparameterization model helps capture elevated transpiration at onset. Assimilation of LAI particularly helped model the resulting rapid decline in SM during onset with as high as 10.0% steeper rate of decline compared to the simulation without any assimilation. Modeled-SM anomalies exhibit a 7.5% and 11.7% increase in similarity with Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) data and U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) maps, respectively. In contrast, during 2017 flash drought driven by record-low precipitation during summers, SM assimilation resulted in largest rates of decline in rootzone SM, as large as 48.4% compared to results from no assimilation. Multivariate DA of SM and LAI results in 6.7% and 14.3% higher spatial similarity with ESI and USDM, respectively, and is necessary to model rapid intensification caused by anomalous precipitation deficits. This study elucidates the need to incorporate multiple observational constraints from remote sensing to effectively capture rapid onset rates, intensification, and severity of flash drought following different propagation mechanisms. This is fundamental for drought early detection to provide a wider window of response and implement efficient mitigation strategies.

TI  - Flood Susceptibility Mapping Using Watershed Geomorphic Data in the Onkaparinga Basin, South Australia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the near future, natural disasters and associated risks are expected to increase, mainly because of the impact of climate change. Australia is considered one of the most vulnerable areas for natural disasters, including flooding. Therefore, an evaluation of the morphometric characteristics of the Onkaparinga basin in South Australia was undertaken using the integration of remote sensing and geospatial techniques to identify its impact on flash floods. The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Landsat images with other available geologic, topographic, and secondary data were analysed in geographic information system (GIS) to outline the drainage basins, estimate the morphometric parameters, and rank the parameters to demarcate the flash flood susceptibility zones of the basin. The main goal was to develop a flash flood susceptibility map showing the different hazard zones within the study areas. The results showed that 10.87%, 24.27%, and 64.85% are classified as low, moderate, and highly susceptible for flooding, respectively. These findings were then verified against secondary data relating to the historic flood events of the area. About 30.77% of the historical floods are found located within the high to extremely susceptible zones. Moreover, a significant correlation has been found between the high precipitation concentration index (PCI) and the irregular rainfall and high potential for flooding. Finally, the social and economic vulnerability was applied to determine the impact of the flood hazards. The result indicates a widespread threat to the economy, environment, and community in the study area. This study can be utilized to support and assist decision makers with planning and the devotion of alleviation measures to reducing and avoiding catastrophic flooding events, especially in highly susceptible areas in the world, such as South Australian basins.

TI  - Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Hazard and Risk Assessment of Gangabal Lake in the Upper Jhelum Basin of Kashmir Himalaya Using Geospatial Technology and Hydrodynamic Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming-induced glacier recession has resulted in the development and rapid expansion of glacial lakes in the Himalayan region. The increased melting has enhanced the susceptibility for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in the region. The catastrophic failure of potentially dangerous glacial lakes could be detrimental to human life and infrastructure in the adjacent low-lying areas. This study attempts to assess the GLOF hazard of Gangabal lake, located in the Upper Jhelum basin of Kashmir Himalaya, using the combined approaches of remote sensing, GIS, and dam break modeling. The parameters, such as area change, ice thickness, mass balance, and surface velocity of the Harmukh glacier, which feeds Gangabal lake, were also assessed using multitemporal satellite data, GlabTop-2, and the Cosi-Corr model. In the worst-case scenario, 100% volume (73 x 10(6) m(3)) of water was considered to be released from the lake with a breach formation time (bf) of 40 min, breach width (bw) of 60 m, and producing peak discharge of 16,601.03 m(3)/s. Our results reveal that the lake area has increased from 1.42 km(2) in 1972 to 1.46 km(2) in 1981, 1.58 km(2) in 1992, 1.61 km(2) in 2001, 1.64 km(2) in 2010, and 1.66 km(2) in 2020. The lake area experienced 17 +/- 2% growth from 1972 to 2020 at an annual rate of 0.005 km(2). The feeding glacier (Harmukh) contrarily indicated a significant area loss of 0.7 +/- 0.03 km(2) from 1990 (3.36 km(2)) to 2020 (2.9 km(2)). The glacier has a maximum, minimum, and average depth of 85, 7.3, and 23.46 m, respectively. In contrast, the average velocity was estimated to be 3.2 m/yr with a maximum of 7 m/yr. The results obtained from DEM differencing show an average ice thickness loss of 11.04 +/- 4.8 m for Harmukh glacier at the rate of 0.92 +/- 0.40 m/yr between 2000 and 2012. Assessment of GLOF propagation in the worst-case scenario (scenario-1) revealed that the maximum flood depth varies between 3.87 and 68 m, the maximum flow velocity between 4 and 75 m/s, and the maximum water surface elevation varies between 1548 and 3536 m. The resultant flood wave in the worst-case scenario will reach the nearest location (Naranaag temple) within 90 min after breach initiation with a maximum discharge of 12,896.52 m(3) s(-1) and maximum flood depth and velocity of 10.54 m and 10.05 m/s, respectively. After evaluation of GLOF impacts on surrounding areas, the area under each inundated landuse class was estimated through the LULC map generated for both scenarios 1 and 2. In scenario 1, the total potentially inundated area was estimated as 5.3 km(2), which is somewhat larger than 3.46 km(2) in scenario 2. We suggest a location-specific comprehensive investigation of Gangbal lake and Harmukh glacier by applying the advanced hazard and risk assessment models/methods for better predicting a probable future GLOF event.

TI  - War Related Building Damage Assessment in Kyiv, Ukraine, Using Sentinel-1 Radar and Sentinel-2 Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic disasters can cause significant damage to urban infrastructure, landscape, and loss of human life. Satellite based remote sensing plays a key role in rapid damage assessment, post-disaster reconnaissance and recovery. In this study, we aim to assess the performance of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for building damage assessment in Kyiv, the capital city of Ukraine, due to the ongoing war with Russia. For damage assessment, we employ a simple and robust SAR log ratio of intensity for the Sentinel-1, and a texture analysis for the Sentinel-2. To suppress changes from other features and landcover types not related to urban areas, we construct a mask of the built-up area using the OpenStreetMap building footprints and World Settlement Footprint (WSF), respectively. As it is difficult to get ground truth data in the ongoing war zone, a qualitative accuracy assessment with the very high-resolution optical images and a quantitative assessment with the United Nations Satellite Center (UNOSAT) damage assessment map was conducted. The results indicated that the damaged buildings are mainly concentrated in the northwestern part of the study area, wherein Irpin, and the neighboring towns of Bucha and Hostomel are located. The detected building damages show a good match with the reference WorldView images. Compared with the damage assessment map by UNOSAT, 58% of the damaged buildings were correctly classified. The results of this study highlight the potential offered by publicly available medium resolution satellite imagery for rapid mapping damage to provide initial reference data immediately after a disaster.

TI  - Quantifying Mangrove Extent Using a Combination of Optical and Radar Images in a Wetland Complex, Western Region, Ghana
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of mangrove forests in tropical coastal zones, based only on passive remote sensing methods, is hampered by mangrove complexities, topographical considerations, and cloud cover effects, among others. This paper reports on a study that combines optical and radar data to address the challenges of distinguishing mangrove stands in cloud-prone regions. The Google Earth Engine geospatial processing platform was used to extract multiple scenes of Landsat surface reflectance Tier 1 and synthetic aperture radar (C-band and L-band). The images were enhanced by creating a feature that removes clouds from the optical data and using speckle filters to remove noise from the radar data. The random forest algorithm proved to be a robust and accurate machine learning approach for mangrove classification and assessment. Classification was evaluated using three scenarios: classification of optical data only, classification of radar data only, and combination of optical and radar data. Our results revealed that the scenario that combines optical and radar data performed better. Further analysis showed that about 16.9% and 21% of mangrove and other vegetation/wetland cover were lost between 2009 and 2019. Whereas water body and bare land/built-up areas increased by 7% and 45%, respectively. Accuracy was evaluated based on the three scenarios. The overall accuracy of the 2019 classification was 98.9% (kappa coefficient = 0.979), 84.6% (kappa coefficient = 0.718), and 99.1% (kappa coefficient = 0.984), for classification of optical data only, classification of radar data only, and combination of optical and radar data, respectively. This study has revealed the potential to map mangroves correctly, enabling on-site conservation practices in the climate change environment.

TI  - Landscape Ecological Evaluation of Cultural Patterns for the Istanbul Urban Landscape
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the widespread population growth in cities, anthropogenic influences inevitably lead to natural disturbances. The metropolitan area of Istanbul, with its rapid urbanization rate, has faced intense pressure regarding the sustainability of urban habitats. In this context, landscapes comprising patches affected by various disturbances and undergoing temporal changes must be analyzed, in order to assess city-related disturbances. In this study, the main objective was to understand how urbanization changed the function of the spatial distribution of the urban mosaic and, more specifically, its relationship with the size, shape, and connection among land-use classes. For this purpose, we took Besiktas, a district of Istanbul, as the study area. We evaluated the landscape pattern of the urban environment in two stages. First, we used medium-resolution satellite imagery to reveal the general interactions in the urbanization process. Landscape- and class-level landscape metrics were selected to quantify the landscape connectivity, and the distances between classes (green areas and artificial surfaces), patterns, and processes, using five satellite images representing a time span of 51 years (1963, 1984, 1997, 2005, and 2014). The general landscape structure was examined by looking at the temporal-spatial processes of artificial surface and green areas obtained from these medium-resolution satellite images. The trends in selected landscape-level metrics were specified and discussed through the use of a moving window analysis. We then used Pleiades high-resolution satellite imagery (2015) to analyze the landscape structure in more detail. This high-resolution base image allows us to recognize the possibility of classifying basic cultural landscape classes. The findings regarding the spatial arrangement of each class in the areas allocated to 14 cultural landscape classes were interpreted by associating them with the landscape functions. Finally, particulate matter (PM10) concentration data were collected and evaluated as an ecological indicator, in order to reveal the relationships between landscape structure and landscape function. In short, we first evaluated the whole landscape structure using medium-resolution data, followed by the classification of cultural landscapes using high-resolution satellite imagery, providing a time-effective-and, therefore, essential-auxiliary method for landscape evaluation. This two-stage evaluation method enables inferences to be made that can shed light on the landscape functions in an urban environment based on the landscape structure.

TI  - TURBIDITY FRONT DETECTION USING SENTINEL-2 SATELLITE IMAGE RELATIONSHIP WITH OCEANOGRAPHY IN BENGAWAN SOLO ESTUARY
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The estuary is a mixing area between the mass of fresh water and seawater, which causes substances in the bottom waters to rise to the surface so that nutrient concentrations become high. Research on estuary water mass confluence still needs to be carried out, especially regarding the turbidity front estuary. So far, this research is limited to in situ data. Therefore remote sensing technology is trying to be applied to detect turbidity front estuary. This study aims to develop local TSS algorithms and detect turbidity fronts based on Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. This research method uses Sentinel-2 imagery to determine the turbidity front boundary based on TSS compared to in situ salinity data and TSS as data validation. The results of this study show that the empirical algorithm obtained from the band ratio (red/(blue+green+red)) on Sentinel-2 has the best results with a correlation coefficient (r) = 0.86. The results of satellite imagery show that the turbidity front estuary occurs at a distance of 1.6 - 2.8 km, while the in situ data occurs at a distance of 2 - 4 km at the Bengawan Solo estuary. There is a difference in the TSS value of 1.9182 mg/L between the in situ data and satellite imagery in the turbidity front estuary area. Seasonal conditions, rainfall and tides affect the concentration and distance of the turbidity front from the river mouth.

TI  - Satellite-Based Determination of the Water Footprint of Carrots and Onions Grown in the Arid Climate of Saudi Arabia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demand for food, climate change, and other human interventions are leading to significant increases in water consumption by the agricultural sector. This requires rationalizing the water used for the production of agricultural crops through improved irrigation management practices. Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the water footprint (WF) of onion (Allium cepa L.) and carrot (Daucus carota) crops using the CROPWAT model and the SSEB (Simplified Surface Energy Balance) algorithm. Experiments were carried out at two center-pivot irrigated fields belonging to Tawdeehiya Commercial Farms in the southeastern region of the Riyadh governorate, Saudi Arabia. Individual bands and vegetation indices (VIs) were retrieved from Sentinel-2 satellite data, including the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and the land surface temperatures (LST) extracted from Landsat-8 data were used to estimate crop productivity (CP), crop water use (CWU) (i.e., evapotranspiration-ETa), and crop WF. Crop growth/phenology stages and georeferenced biophysical parameters were recorded during the growth period, and crop yield samples were collected randomly from predetermined sampling locations. It was found that the NIR band was appropriate for predicting onion yield (R-2 = 0.68; p > F = 0.02) and carrot yield (R-2 = 0.77; p > F = 0.02). The results also showed the feasibility of using the RDVI and EVI to estimate the yields of onion and carrot crops, with bias values of 15% and -17%, respectively. The CWU has also been successfully estimated using the SSEB algorithm, with an overall accuracy of 89%. The SSEB-estimated CWU was relatively high compared to the applied amounts by 10.6% (onions) and 12.6% (carrots). Finally, the crop WF was successfully estimated at 312 m(3) t(-1) and 230 m(3) t(-1) for carrots and onions, respectively, with an overall accuracy of 71.11%. The outcomes of this study can serve as a reference for crop irrigation management practices in the study region and areas with similar environmental conditions.

TI  - Fusion of Multispectral Remote-Sensing Data through GIS-Based Overlay Method for Revealing Potential Areas of Hydrothermal Mineral Resources
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Revealing prospective locations of hydrothermal alteration zones (HAZs) is an important technique for mineral prospecting. In this study, we used multiple criteria inferred from Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-2, and ASTER data using a GIS-based weighted overlay multi-criteria decision analysis approach to build a model for the delineating of hydrothermal mineral deposits in the Khnaiguiyah district, Saudi Arabia. The utilized algorithms revealed argillic, phyllic, and propylitic alteration characteristics. The HAZs map resulted in the identification of six zones based on their mineralization potential, providing a basis for potential hydrothermal mineral deposit assessment exploration, which was created by the fusion of mineral bands indicators designated very low, low, moderate, good, very good, and excellent and covers 31.36, 28.22, 20.49, 10.99, 6.35, and 2.59%. Based on their potential for hydrothermal mineral potentiality, the discovered zones match gossans related to sulfide mineral alteration zones, as demonstrated by previous studies.

TI  - Detection of Surface Water and Floods with Multispectral Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of multispectral satellite imagery for water monitoring is a fast and cost-effective method that can benefit from the growing availability of medium-high-resolution and free remote sensing data. Since the 1970s, multispectral satellite imagery has been exploited by adopting different techniques and spectral indices. The high number of available sensors and their differences in spectral and spatial characteristics led to a proliferation of outcomes that depicts a nice picture of the potential and limitations of each. This paper provides a review of satellite remote sensing applications for water extent delineation and flood monitoring, highlighting trends in research studies that adopted freely available optical imagery. The performances of the most common spectral indices for water segmentation are qualitatively analyzed and assessed according to different land cover types to provide guidance for targeted applications in specific contexts. The comparison is carried out by collecting evidence obtained from several applications identifying the overall accuracy (OA) obtained with each specific configuration. In addition, common issues faced when dealing with optical imagery are discussed, together with opportunities offered by new-generation passive satellites.

TI  - Pushkin as a monument in the poetic worldview of Bulat Okudzhava
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The poems of Bulat Okudzhava, "Aleksandr Sergeich" and "Tourist family is photographed at the Pushkin Monument," are analyzed through the system of contexts. These are traditional poems in the "ekphrasis" genre, reflecting the cult status of the monument by Opekushin, various debates with the tradition of poems "to the monument" by Mayakovsky and Brodsky, and Pushkin's works united in the reception of the modem poet by the ideas of benevolence and gratitude. Okudzhava's interpretation of the "bronze Pushkin" was inspired by the idea of a poetry monument. The theme of mercy from Pushkin's poem "Exegi monumentum" is realized in "Aleksandr Sergeich" by the connection between the title, the dedication, and the content. The dedication of the poem "Tourist family is photographed at the Pushkin Monument" to a friend of his youth is considered through the author's creative task: the poet and photoartist Tsybulevskiy becomes a judge in a dispute with Samoylov ("Amateur photographer"). Finally, the disagreements between the distant interlocutors become imaginary, as is the conflict between the "little man" and eternity "in front of Pushkin." After substantiating the meaning of the allusion to Pushkin's "Birdie" in the poem's refrain, a conclusion is made: the metaphor of the soaring souls of "little people" develops the idea of "Aleksandr Sergeich", with a monument symbolizing a hierarchy of values. Okudzhava's interpretation of Pushkin's monument was not influenced by prejudice against the "deadening" (Mayakovsky) or "ice-cold" (Brodsky) bronze form. For Okudzhava, the spirituality of the "bronze Pushkin" signifies his harmonizing role in modern life.

TI  - Modelling Species Richness and Functional Diversity in Tropical Dry Forests Using Multispectral Remotely Sensed and Topographic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts to assess and understand changes in plant diversity and ecosystem functioning focus on the analysis of taxonomic diversity. However, the resilience of ecosystems depends not only on species richness but also on the functions (responses and effects) of species within communities and ecosystems. Therefore, a functional approach is required to estimate functional diversity through functional traits and to model its changes in space and time. This study aims to: (i) assess the accuracy of estimates of species richness and tree functional richness obtained from field data and Sentinel-2 imagery in tropical dry forests of the Yucatan Peninsula; (ii) map and analyze the relationships between these two variables. We calculated species richness and functional richness (from six functional traits) of trees from 87 plots of the National Forest Inventory in a semi-deciduous tropical forest and 107 in a semi-evergreen tropical forest. Species richness and functional richness were mapped using reflectance values, vegetation indices, and texture measurements from Sentinel-2 imagery as explanatory variables. Validation of the models to map these two variables yielded a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.43 and 0.50, and a mean squared relative error of 25.4% and 48.8%, for tree species richness and functional richness, respectively. For both response variables, the most important explanatory variables were Sentinel-2 texture measurements and spectral bands. Tree species richness and functional richness were positively correlated in both forest types. Bivariate maps showed that 44.9% and 26.5% of the forests studied had high species richness and functional richness values. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating field data and remotely sensed variables for estimating tree species richness and functional richness. In addition, the combination of species richness and functional richness maps presented here is potentially valuable for planning, conservation, and restoration strategies by identifying areas that maximize ecosystem service provisioning, carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation.

TI  - Changes in temporal pattern and spatial distribution of environmental pollutants in 8 Asian countries owing to COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the changes in air pollutant's concentration, spatio-temporal distribution and sensitivity of changes in air pollutant's concentration during pre and post COVID-19 outbreak. We employed Google Earth Engine Platform to access remote sensing datasets of air pollutants across Asian continent. Air pollution and cumulative confirmed-COVID cases data of Asian countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, China, India, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia) have been collected and analyzed for 2019 and 2020. The results indicate that aerosol index (AI) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is significantly reduced during COVID outbreak i.e. in year 2020. In addition, we found significantly positive (P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval, two-tailed) correlation between changes in AI and NO2 concentration for net active-COVID case increment in almost each country. For other atmospheric gases i.e. carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), ozone (O-3), and Sulfur dioxide (SO2), insignificant and/or significant negative correlation is also observed. These results suggest that the atmospheric concentration of AI and NO2 are good indicators of human activities. Furthermore, the changes in O-3 shows significantly negative correlation for net active-COVID case increment. In conclusion, we observed significant positive environmental impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia. This study would help and assist environmen-talist and policy makers in restraining air pollution by implementing efficient restrictions on human activities with minimal economic loss.

TI  - Remote sensing strategies to monitoring land use maps with AVHRR and MODIS data over the South Asia regions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In South Asia, annual land use and land cover (LULC) is a severe issue in the field of earth science because it affects regional climate, global warming, and human activities. Therefore, it is vitally essential to obtain correct information on the LULC in the South Asia regions. LULC annual map covering the entire period is the primary dataset for climatological research. Although the LULC annual global map was produced from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset in 2001, this limited the perspective of the climatological analysis. This study used AVHRR GIMMS NDVI3g data from 2001 to 2015 to randomly forests classify and produced a time series of the annual LULC map of South Asia. The MODIS land cover products (MCD12Q1) are used as data from reference for trained classifiers. The results were verified using the annual map of the LULC time series, and the space- time dynamics of the LULC map were shown in the last 15 years, from 2001 to 2015. The overall precision of our 15-year land cover map simplifies 16 classes, which is 1.23% and 86.70% significantly maximum as compared to the precision of the MODIS data map. Findings of the past 15 years show the changing detection that forest land, savanna, farmland, urban and established land, arid land, and cultivated land have increased; by contrast, woody prairie, open shrublands, permanent ice and snow, mixed forests, grasslands, evergreen broadleaf forests, permanent wetlands, and water bodies have been significantly reduced over South Asia regions.

TI  - Use of Landsat 8 and UAV Images to Assess Changes in Temperature and Evapotranspiration by Economic Trees following Foliar Spraying with Light-Reflecting Compounds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pistachio is an important economic crop in arid and semi-arid regions of Iran. A major problem leading to a reduction in crop quality and reduced marketability is extreme air temperature in summer, which causes sunburn of pistachio leaves and fruit. A solution proposed to deal with the negative effects of high temperatures and increase water consumption efficiency in pistachio orchards is use of light-reflecting compounds. This study investigated the effect of foliar application of gypsum, sulfur, and NAX-95 (calcium-based suspension coating) to trees in a pistachio orchard (150 ha) in central Iran. The effect of these foliar products is assessed at plot scale, using control plots sprayed with calcium sulfate, based on temperature and evapotranspiration changes analyzed through remote sensing. Landsat 8 sensor images and RGB images collected by UAVs (spatial resolution of 30 m and 20 cm, respectively), on the same dates, before and after foliar spray application, were merged using the PCA method and bilinear interpolation re-sampling. Land surface temperature (LST) was then estimated using the split-window algorithm, and daily evapotranspiration using the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) algorithm. A land use map was prepared and used to isolate pistachio trees in the field and assess weed cover, whose effect was not accounted. The results showed that temperature remained constant in the control plot between the spraying dates, indicating no environmental changes. In the main plots, gypsum had the greatest effect in reducing the temperature of pistachio trees. The plots with foliar spraying with gypsum displayed a mean tree temperature (47-48 degrees C) decrease of 3.3 degrees C in comparison with the control plots (>49 degrees C), leading to an average decline in evapotranspiration of 0.18 mm/day. NAX-95 and sulfur reduced tree temperature by on average 1.3 degrees C and 0.6 degrees C, respectively. Thus, gypsum is the most suitable foliar-spraying compound to lower the temperature of pistachio trees, reduce the water requirement, and increase crop productivity.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Zone Mapping: Integration of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) and GIS Techniques for the Al-Qalamoun Region in Syria
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most critical processes for the long-term management of groundwater resources is Groundwater Potential Zonation (GWPZ). Despite their importance, traditional groundwater studies are costly, difficult, complex, and time-consuming. This study aims to investigate GWPZ mapping for the Al-Qalamoun region, in the Western part of Syria. We combined the Multi-Influence Factor (MIF) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods with the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to estimate the GWPZ. The weight and score factors of eight factors were used to develop the GWPZ including drainage density, lithology, slope, lineament density, geomorphology, land use/land cover, rainfall, and soil. According to the findings, about 46% and 50.6% of the total area of the Al-Qalamoun region was classified as suitable for groundwater recharge by the AHP and MIF methods, respectively. However, 54% and 49.4% of the area was classified as having poor suitability for groundwater recharge by the AHP and MIF methods, respectively. These areas with poor suitability can be utilized for gathering surface water. The validation of the results showed that the AHP and MIF methods have similar accuracy for the GWPZ; however, the accuracy and results depend on influencing factors and their weights assigned by experts.

TI  - Assessment of Carbon Productivity Trends and Their Resilience to Drought Disturbances in the Middle East Based on Multi-Decadal Space-Based Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) is a key component in assessing the global change in carbon uptake and in evaluating the impacts of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. A decrease in the photosynthetic rate due to stomata closing by vegetation could have an impact on GPP. Nonetheless, the uncertainty in long-term GPP patterns and their resilience to drought disturbances has not yet been examined thoroughly. In this study, four state-of-the-art GPP datasets, including the revised EC-LUE algorithm-driven GPP (GLASS-GPP), the EC flux tower upscaling-based GPP (FluxCom-GPP), the MODIS algorithm-driven GPP model (GIMMS-GPP), and the vegetation photosynthesis model-GPP (VPM-GPP), were used to assess GPP characteristics in the Middle East region for 36 years spanning the period of 1982 to 2016. All investigated datasets revealed an increasing trend over the study period, albeit with a more pronounced upward trend for the VPM-GPP dataset in the most recent decades (2000-2016). On the other hand, FluxCom-GPP exhibited less variability than the other datasets. In addition, while GLASS-GPP presented a significant increasing trend in some parts of the region, significant negative trends dominated the other parts. This study defined six significant drought episodes that occurred in the Middle East region between 1982 and 2017. The most severe drought events were recorded in 1985, 1989-1990, 1994, 1999-2001, 2008, and 2015, spreading over more than 15% of the total area of the region. The extreme droughts accounted for a high decline in GPP in the north of Iraq, the northeast of Syria, and the southwest of Iran, where 20.2 and 40.8% of the ecosystem's GPP were severely non-resilient to drought according to the GLASS and VPM-based GPP responses, respectively. The spatial distribution patterns of the correlations between the SEDI and GPP products were somewhat similar and coherent. The highest positive correlations were detected in the central and western parts of Turkey, the western and northeastern parts of Iran, and north Iraq, which showed anomalous r values (r = 0.7), especially for the SEDI-VPM and SEDI-FluxCom GPP associations. The findings of this study can provide a solid base for identifying at-risk regions in the Middle East in terms of climate change impacts, which will allow for better management of ecosystems and proper implementation of climate policies.

TI  - Improved surface displacement estimation through stacking cross-correlation spectra from multi-channel imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying sporadic and complex geophysical surface flows, like earthquakes or sea surface circulation, are challenging cases. If a satellite is able to image an event, it becomes essential to pull out as much information as possible. In this contribution we demonstrate a method to increase the coverage and signal-to-noise ratio for displacement estimation, making such surface flow estimates more complete. We leverage upon the redundant offset information acquired by multi-channel push-broom imagery. The individual cross-correlation spectra (cross power spectral density; Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function) of different spectral bands are averaged in the frequency domain before sub-pixel offset-estimation by phase-plane fitting. The method is demonstrated near Kaiko?ura, where in 2016 a surface rupture occurred. RapidEye data from two different dates were used to reconstruct the displacement. In addition, the circulation along the coast is estimated from data from a single date where multiple spectral bands were acquired within seconds which made stacking of cross correlation spectra possible. The demonstrated methodology is applied to data from the already decommissioned RapidEye constellation, but can be adopted to other pushbroom systems, such as the Landsat legacy or Sentinel-2.

TI  - Hadith In The Mamluk Period According To Badr Al-Din al-'Ayni's 'Iqd al-juman (Second Half of The 7th Century - Beginning of The 8th Century)
T2  - CUMHURIYET ILAHIYAT DERGISI-CUMHURIYET THEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - History works written in the style of chronicles are used not only for the purpose for which they were written. Chronicles may also contain reflections on the position of the wulema ('ulama.) at the time of their writing and their worldview regarding the period they lived. This study is based on the book 'Iqd al-juman fi ta'rikh ahl al-zaman written by the celebrated Hanafi jurist (faqih) and muhaddith Badr al-Din al-'Ayni as a public history book. This article focuses on the state of Hadith science and scholars during the Mamluk period between the years 648-707 (1250-1307) and al-'Ayni's approaches to these issues based on his 'Iqd al-juman. For this purpose, the work has been examined in terms of certain keywords that allude to the history of Hadith through electronic sources. In addition, the work has been completely reviewed with the traditional method in terms of allusions and information about the hadith studies of the Mamluks period. Eventually, the elements of Hadith scholarship and history, different groups of transmitters, different narration methods, and various works written about hadith have been identified. In addition, the professional, sectarian and political trends of the hadith scholars of the period in question were focused on. Chronicles can provide the reader with information of varying layers. In the first layer, biographical information about people such as the dates and places of birth and death of individuals, their students and teachers, the institutions from which they received their education, the cities they traveled to and received knowledge from, the sects they belonged to and their relations with the political figures of the period can be obtained from these books. In the second layer, it is possible to see more extensive data on subjects such as the scholars of the period and scholarly life, based on the particular information obtained from the biographies in the first layer. Information such as important scholarly centers, institutions, teacher-student relations, important muhaddiths and their sectarian tendencies can be inferred from the first layer. In the third layer, it is possible to get an idea about the perspective of the author on certain issues, based on the data in these two layers. Information that can be relegated to the first layer is plentiful in al-Ayni's work'Iqd al-juman. The data in the second and third layers depend on both the presence/density and the interpretation of these materials. For this reason, in this study, revealing the second and third layer information will be possible to the extent that the first layer information allows. 'Iqd al-juman includes information about the scholarly life of the period in which it was written. al-'Ayni gives detailed information about the educational institutions, founders of these institutions, their establishment times, and functioning. He also gives details about the foundations, founders and functioning of waqfs, which played a significant role in the operation of the educational institutions. An important aspect that draws attention in 'Iqd al-juman is that women and their influence on both the establishment and operation of educational institutions and the execution of waqfs are not visible. This is related to the fact that 'Iqd al-juman is a history book and contains mostly information about a'yan (grandees), and that women are not generally visible among a'yan. Names of people engaged in the science of hadith are also recorded in 'Iqd al-juman. In this context, the work mentions 170 names interested in the science of hadith.While some of these names only listened to hadith, some of them gave lectures, grant permission to the narrators (al-Ijazah) and wrote books about hadith. Among these names, there are also those who are interested not only in hadith but also in fiqh or mysticism (tasawwuf). al-'Ayni also gives information about the phrases used in hadith narrations. He mentions some methods of narration such as al-sama, al-ijazah and al-qira'a in 'Iqd al-juman. He occasionally provides specific details on who the narrators heard the hadith from. He also emphasizes the names of the narrators who made the last narration (from a certain sheikh), and the narrators who heard a narration alone (tafarrud) from a certain sheikh. If the narrators are the last people who have narrated from well-known names, their status is emphasized. This condition might be understood to mean that having high isnads is considered beneficial and has an impact on hadith transmission methods. In addition, al-'Ayni also includes important elements in terms of hadith history, such as ulama families and journeys. In 'Iqd al-juman, it is possible to see detailed information about the cities where the narrators were born, stayed, visited, settled and died. Cities where the narrators were born, settled and died are significant in that it allows for comments on key centers for hadith and scholars. When the birthplaces of the muhaddiths are examined, it can be seen that most of the muhaddiths lived and died in Damascus and Cairo. This study is an example of how to make use of the wafayat sections in chronicle works. Examining a single book that was not written directly in the field of hadith - even if it contains important information - is not enough to find elements about the history of hadith and to make constructions regarding it. This necessitates the formation of a team that will examine a large number of books using the same criteria.

TI  - Wildfires Temperature Estimation by Complementary Use of Hyperspectral PRISMA and Thermal (ECOSTRESS & L8)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with detection and temperature analysis and of wildfires using PRISMA imagery. Precursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (Hyperspectral Precursor of the Application Mission, PRISMA) is a new hyperspectral mission by ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, Italian Space Agency) launched in 2019. This mission provides hyperspectral images with a spectral range of 400-2,500 nm and an average spectral resolution less than 12 nm and a spatial resolution of 30 m/pixel. This study focuses on the wildfire temperature estimation over the Bootleg Fire, US 2021. The analysis starts by considering the Hyperspectral Fire Detection Index (HFDI) which is used to analyze the informative content of the images, along with the analysis of some specific visible, near-infrared and shortwave-infrared bands. This first analysis is used as input to perform a temperature estimation of the areas with active wildfire. Surface temperature is retrieved using PRISMA radiance and a linear mixing model based on two background components (vegetation and burn scar) and two active fire components. PRISMA temperatures are compared with LST (Land Surface Temperature) products from NASA's ECOSTRESS and Landsat 8 which imaged the Bootleg Fire before and after PRISMA. A critical discussion of the results obtained with PRISMA is presented, followed by the advantages and limitation of the proposed approach.Plain Language Summary This work explores new opportunities for wildfire mapping and monitoring basing on recent technological achievements in the field of remote sensing and data analysis. The input data of this research study are provided by the new satellite PRISMA (Precursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa, Hyperspectral Precursor of the Application Mission) from ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana, Italian Space Agency). This spacecraft represents an innovative remote sensing mission for the observation of the Earth, as it provides images with a revolutionary quantity of spectral information which go far beyond the visible spectrum. Using PRISMA data, we study the Bootleg Fire during 2021 in the US, providing a descriptive analysis of the wildfire and a quantitative estimation of the temperatures achieved during the event. To confirm the results of our approach, we also compare the outcomes to the data provided by two other satellite missions: ECOSTRESS (ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment) and Landsat 8. Hence, a critical discussion of the results obtained with PRISMA is presented in order to report advantages and limitation of the proposed approach.

TI  - Semi-real time systems for subsidence monitoring in areas affected by underground mining: the example of the Nuraxi-Figus coal district (Sardinia, Italy)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining can produce subsidence, which can be coincident with mining activities or delayed in response to the time-dependent deformation of the rocks. Therefore, in these cases, it is essential to effectively monitor the soil deformations at different times during and after mining activity. In the present work, an integrated approach based on geotechnical numerical modeling and Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) method has been applied to detect, study and monitor the subsidence related to mining activity in the Nuraxi Figus coal district (Sardinia, Italy). Two datasets of high-resolution COSMO-Skymed images were acquired, respectively in two covering periods: from 2011 and 2014, and from 2013 to 2020. The A-DInSAR results show that the predominant displacement rates are located in correspondence with the panels. The cumulated satellite-based LoS displacements vary in the first period between - 130 and + 28 mm and - 293 and + 28.4 mm, while, during the second period between - 6.9 and + 1.6 mm and - 8.72 and + 4.33 mm in ascending and descending geometries, respectively. The geotechnical numerical model allowed to obtain a value for the maximum expected. By using the vertical and horizontal components it was possible to reconstruct the kinematics of the deformation considering three phases: pre-mining, syn-mining, and post-mining activity. The temporal evolution of displacements started during the mining extraction in 2011, achieved the major values in correspondence of post-mining operations, during the period from 2013 to 2014 and continued slowly until 2020. The near real-time monitoring system applied in this study proved to be very useful for detecting subsidence during the mining activity and the post-mining period.

T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful surveillance and control of mosquito arbovirus vectors requires effective and sensitive trapping methods for adult insects. The Biogents Sentinel (BGS) trap is widely used for mosquito trapping but has low capture efficiency for both female and male Aedes aegypti under semi-field conditions. Efficiency refers to the proportion of mosquitoes that are trapped of those encountering the trap. We verified the efficiency of the BGS under field conditions in suburban Riverside, California, U.S.A., following our previous work determining the efficiency under semi-field conditions in Cairns, Northern Australia. The efficiency of the BGS with CO2 and a human skin odor mimic (BG-Lure) for both Ae. aegypti sexes in the field was 9%. This closely aligns with the results of our previous study, the efficiency for females being 5% and males being 9%. In the present study microclimatic conditions were monitored and capture occurred during periods of significantly lower mean temperature. There were no discernible changes in wind directionality or strength in the 60 s leading up to mosquito capture by the BGS. Our results support our previous findings that capture efficiency of the BGS for Ae. aegypti is low

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Seven Ongoing Satellite Altimetry Missions for Measuring Inland Water Levels of the Great Lakes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry can provide long-term water level time series for water bodies lacking hydrological stations. Few studies have evaluated the performance of HY-2C and Sentinel-6 satellites in inland water bodies, as they have operated for less than 1 and 2 years, respectively. This study evaluated the measured water level accuracy of CryoSat-2, HY-2B, HY-2C, ICESat-2, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A, and Sentinel-6 in the Great Lakes by in-situ data of 12 hydrological stations from 1 January 2021 to 1 April 2022. Jason-3 and Sentinel-6 have the lowest mean root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of measured water level, which is 0.07 m. The measured water level of Sentinel-6 satellite shows a high correlation at all passing stations, and the average value of all correlation coefficients (R) is also the highest among all satellites, reaching 0.94. The mean RMSE of ICESat-2 satellite is slightly lower than Jason-3 and Sentinel-6, which is 0.09 m. The stability of the average deviation (bias) of the ICESat-2 is the best, with the maximum bias only 0.07 m larger than the minimum bias. ICESat-2 satellite has an exceptionally high spatial resolution. It is the only satellite among the seven satellites that has retrieved water levels around twelve stations. HY-2C satellite has the highest temporal resolution, with a temporal resolution of 7.5 days at station 9075014 in Huron Lake and an average of 10 days in the Great Lakes region. The results show that the seven altimetry satellites currently in operation have their own advantages and disadvantages, Jason-3 and Sentinel-6 have the highest accuracy, ICESat-2 has higher accuracy and the highest spatial resolution, and HY-2C has the highest temporal resolution, although it is less accurate. In summary, with full consideration of accuracy and space-time resolution, the ICESat-2 satellite can be used as the benchmark to achieve the unification of multi-source data and establish water level time series.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soya Current is formed from the transformed subtropical waters of the Tsushima Current, which flows from the Sea of Japan through the La Perouse Strait, spreads along the northern coast of Hokkaido, and enters the Pacific Ocean through the Yekaterina and Kunashir straits. An analysis of satellite data (1993-2019) on sea level, geostrophic current velocity, surface water temperature, and chlorophyll concentration in the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk, in the zone of the La Perouse Strait (Sea of Japan), and in the southern Kuril region of the Pacific Ocean has been carried out. It has been established that an increase in the sea level difference between the Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean leads to the intensification of the Soya current. The main contribution to the change in the level difference between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Japan in autumn belongs to anticyclonic eddies and meanders of the Subarctic Front in the Pacific Ocean. An increase (decrease) in the penetration of transformed subtropical waters through the La Perouse Strait is accompanied by an increase (decrease) in the temperature of the surface water layer in the southern part of the Sea of Okhotsk (r = 0.67 in 2000-2019) and a decrease (increase) in the chlorophyll concentration in the Kuril region of the Pacific Ocean (r = -0.70 in 1998-2019) in September-October.

TI  - Variations in Sea Level and Geostrophic Currents in the East Siberian Sea and Laptev Sea under the Influence of Wind and Runoff of the Lena River
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of fresh water in the East Siberian Sea (ESS) and Laptev Sea (LS) in the period of the least ice coverage (August-October) has been analyzed using satellite data on sea level and CTD data from ship observations. It is shown that there is a good agreement between the salinity/density distribution in the surface water layer and the sea level in the study area. An increase (decrease) in the runoff of the Lena River during the summer flood leads to an increase (decrease) in the sea level in the eastern part of the LS and in the western and southwestern parts of the ESS in September and October (r = 0.52-0.59 in 1993-2019). The intensification of the western winds is accompanied by a decrease in salinity and a rise in sea level in the coastal areas of the LS and ESS. Eastern winds cause a decrease in sea level in the southern regions of the LS and ESS and the flow of waters with low salinity from the coastal to the open part of the sea. Western/eastern winds are accompanied by eastern/western directed geostrophic currents in the region of the Sannikov Strait and in the southwestern part of the ESS.

TI  - PROGRESS AND CHALLENGES FOR THE RECOGNITION, PROTECTION AND PROMOTION OF INDIGENOUS WOMEN'S HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE INTER-AMERICAN SYSTEM
T2  - AGE OF HUMAN RIGHTS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we begin by analysing the guiding legal principles and international standards that States must consider when developing laws, programs, and policies to protect indigenous women's human rights as members of their communities. Besides, we try to find out what priority issues States are trying to address. Once we establish the theoretical framework, we will review how, in practice, the InterAmerican Commission and Court have examined some of the leading cases concerning the protection of the economic, social, and cultural rights of indigenous women. All this will lead us to understand the bases of indigenous women's worldview. Therefore, we attempt to understand the role what role indigenous, tribal or autochthonous women has played in society to date. Thus, this will allow us to analyze strategies developed to guarantee their right to life and their integral protection in order to evaluate how the phenomenon of their empowerment, conquest of public spaces, political participation and personal development is being assisted.

TI  - Observed and Predicted Geographic Distribution of <i>Acer monspessulanum</i> L. Using the MaxEnt Model in the Context of Climate Change
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Acer monspessulanum (Montpellier Maple) is an important deciduous tree species native to the Mediterranean region. It is largely distributed in the southern part of western Europe; however, it is geographically less present in north Africa and western Asia. The effects of the most significant environmental variables for its habitat suitability, and climate change, are unclear in terms of the future changes to its distribution. The objective of the present study was to model the current and future geographical potential distribution of the Montpellier Maple in the Mediterranean basin and West Asia using maximum entropy modeling software (MaxEnt). The value of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of MaxEnt was used to analyze the model's performance. More than 5800 well-distributed presence points, elevation, slope, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), natural vegetation characteristics from MODIS products, and 19 bioclimatic variables were used to conduct the study. Regarding the projections of the species distribution under climate change, 17 global climatic models were used under two RCP scenarios (4.5 and 8.5) for the 2040-2060 and the 2060-2080 time periods. The results show that temperature seasonality (40% contribution to the model), elevation (33.5%), mean annual temperature (6.9%), mean annual precipitation (6.2%), and max temperature of the warmest month (4.5%) were identified as the primary factors that accounted for the current distribution of the Montpellier Maple. Under the climate change scenarios, MaxEnt predicts a large decrease in the species suitability area, with a shift towards the southwestern regions of the species distribution, especially to the mountainous zones of the Moroccan Atlas. Our results show that climate largely limits the distribution of the Montpellier Maple in the Mediterranean basin, as its change in the future is expected to significantly reduce the suitable area by more than 99% from the historical climate conditions, to reach only 16,166.9 and 9874.7 km(2) under the moderate RCP4.5 and extreme RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. Our study can provide a good view of the future changes in the distribution of Montpellier Maple for its protection and sustainable management.

TI  - A Review of Artificial Intelligence and Remote Sensing for Archaeological Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The documentation and protection of archaeological and cultural heritage (ACH) using remote sensing, a non-destructive tool, is increasingly popular for experts around the world, as it allows rapid searching and mapping at multiple scales, rapid analysis of multi-source data sets, and dynamic monitoring of ACH sites and their environments. The exploitation of remote sensing data and their products have seen an increased use in recent years in the fields of archaeological science and cultural heritage. Different spatial and spectral analysis datasets have been applied to distinguish archaeological remains and detect changes in the landscape over time, and, in the last decade, archaeologists have adopted more thoroughly automated object detection approaches for potential sites. These approaches included, among others, object detection methods, such as those of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and deep learning (DL) models using aerial and satellite images, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing (ASRS), multispectral, hyperspectral images, and active methods (synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and light detection and ranging radar (LiDAR)). Researchers also refer to the potential for archaeologists to explore such artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in various ways, such as identifying archaeological features and classifying them. Here, we present a review study related to the contributions of remote sensing (RS) and artificial intelligence in archaeology. However, a main question remains open in the field of research: the rate of positive contribution of remote sensing and artificial intelligence techniques in archaeological research. The scope of this study is to summarize the state of the art related to AI and RS for archaeological research and provide some further insights into the existing literature.

TI  - Flash flooding hazard assessment, modeling, and management in the coastal zone of Ras Ghareb City, Gulf of Suez, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of flash flood hazards in the coastal zone of Ras Ghareb City (RGC), Red Sea, Egypt, was accomplished through the use of GIS tools and the spatial multi-criteria approach. The presented work aims to assess, integrate, and generate potential flash flood hazard maps. The analytic hierarchy process was utilized to calculate weights of hazard and vulnerability of flash flood controlling factors and their parameters such as topographical, geological, and hydrological factors. In addition, the risk degree of each specific basin and its sub-basins is estimated by combining standardized parameter values. Despite its location in an arid region, the basin may receive a large amount of rainwater, which can cause flash floods at the basin's outlet. Recently, flash flooding took place in the coastal region of RGC in October 2016 and September 2020, resulting in the loss of many human lives and catastrophic effects on local infrastructure and surrounding environments. According to reports from Hurghada, Red Sea Governorate, the RGC experienced exceptional flooding that exceeded 120 million cubic meters as a result of 51 mm of rainfall. Based on the remote sensing satellite data such as Aster Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and the GIS tools, the basin and sub-basin drainage patterns were delineated and compared with reference topographical map sheets of a scale of 1: 50,000. The sub-basins have been isolated and morphometrically studied to determine vulnerability to flash flooding. In addition, the flash flood threat model was developed using geoprocessing tools provided by ArcGIS software to incorporate all contributing factors spatially. The flash flood risk in the Ras Ghareb (RG) basins and their sub-basins has been identified and classified into three classes (high, medium, and low hazard degree). High and moderate flood-risk basins require comprehensive studies to introduce measures to protect certain areas from flood danger. Finally, the GIS and the spatial multi-criteria analyses were effective ways to carry out a flash flood management system in order to support the decision-makers by recommendations to conserve and mitigate the possible flash flood hazards in the study areas.

TI  - TAXES, HEAD LICE AND GODS: CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS AND PREVALENCE OF PEDICULOSIS IN INDIVIDUALS FROM THE CAMARONES 9 INCA SITE, NORTHERN CHILE
T2  - CHUNGARA-REVISTA DE ANTROPOLOGIA CHILENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we studied the prevalence of pediculosis in the Inca site, Camarones 9 (northern Chile), to contrast with descriptions contained in the chronicles and what has been observed in the bioarchaeological record. The head lice is a frequent ectoparasitosis, but the cultural responses and its control vary according to the affected populations. To delve into this topic, we studied 25 mummies with abundant hair, quantifying the presence, absence, and density of pediculosis in an area of hair measuring 2 x 2 cm. About 88% (22/25) of the mummies were found positive for head lice, with an average density of 4.4 nits per 2 x 2 cm. It should be noted that one of the individuals analyzed had a density of 30 nits in the same 2 x 2 cm area, presenting the highest amount from the total number of individuals studied. In the light of this evidence, the cultural practices associated with pediculosis are discussed, as well as whether the considerable number of specimens observed would have been used as tribute during the Inca period when there was no other way to contribute to the state. It is concluded that pediculosis was endemic and that its cultural tolerance and worldview contributed to its prevalence during the Late period.

TI  - The Innate Defense in the Zika-Infected Placenta
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Review
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family, genus Flavivirus and was first isolated 1947 in Uganda, Africa, from the serum of a sentinel Rhesus monkey. Since its discovery, the virus was responsible for major outbreaks in several different countries, being linked to severe complications in pregnant women, neonatal birth defects and the congenital zika syndrome. Maternal-fetal transmission of ZIKV can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy, and the role of the placenta and its cells in these cases is yet to be fully understood. The decidua basalis and chorionic villi, maternal-fetal components of the placenta, contain a rich immunological infiltrate composed by Hofbauer cells, mastocytes, dendritic cells and macrophages, primary cells of the innate immune response that have a role that still needs to be better investigated in ZIKV infection. Recent studies have already described several histopathological features and the susceptibility and permissiveness of placenta cells to infection by the Zika virus. In this review, we address some of the current knowledge on the innate immune responses against ZIKV, especially in the placenta.

TI  - Urban Sprawl Simulation Mapping of Urmia (Iran) by Comparison of Cellular Automata-Markov Chain and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Modeling Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering urbanization can lead to irreversible land transformations, it is crucial to provide city managers, environmental resources managers, and even people with accurate predicting land use/land cover (LULC) to accomplish sustainable development goals. Although many methods have been used to predict land use/land cover (LULC), few studies have compared them. Therefore, by analyzing the results of various prediction models and, consequently, recognizing the most accurate and reliable ones, we can assist city managers, environmental resources managers, and researchers.. In this regard, this research compares Cellular Automata-Markov Chain and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as frequently used models to overcome this gap and help those concerned about sustainable development to predict urban sprawl with the most reliable accuracy. In the first step, Landsat satellite images acquired in 2000, 2010, and 2020 were classified with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), and LULC maps were prepared for each year. In the second step, to investigate the LULC prediction, validation of the CA-Markov and ANN methods was performed. In this way, the LULC simulation map of 2020 was prepared based on the LULC map of 2000 and 2010; next, the predicted LULC map of 2020 and the actual LULC map for 2020 were compared using correctness, completeness, and quality indices. Finally, the LULC map for 2030 was generated using both algorithms, and the corresponding change map was extracted, showing a reduction in soil and vegetation areas (respectively, 39% and 12%) and an expansion (58%) in built-up regions. Moreover, the validation test of the methods showed that the two algorithms were closer to each other; however, ANN had the highest completeness (96.21%) and quality (93.8%), while CA-Markov had the most correctness (96.47%). This study showed that the CA-Markov algorithm is more accurate in predicting the future of larger areas with higher allocations (urban and vegetation cover) while the ANN algorithm is more accurate in predicting the future of small areas with fewer allocations (soil and rock).

TI  - Satellite and sUAS Multispectral Remote Sensing Analysis of Vegetation Response to Beaver Mimicry Restoration on Blacktail Creek, Southwest Montana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Beaver dam analogs (BDAs) are being installed on streams where restoration goals include reconnecting the stream to its floodplain, increasing water storage in the stream corridor, and improving the extent and vigor of riparian vegetation. This study evaluated the effects on vegetation vigor of a BDA treatment on Blacktail Creek in southwest Montana, USA, using data from Sentinel-2 satellites and a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS; a.k.a. drone). The goal of this research was to determine if BDA installation increased the health of riparian vegetation. Sentinel-2 remote sensing data from 2016 to 2021 were used to compare the pre- and post-treatment periods, and to evaluate effects in the treated area relative to control areas. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values were calculated to quantify vegetation response from the addition of BDAs. These data suggest that installing BDAs at this site has not led to an apparent increase in late-summer vegetation vigor relative to the controls. One potential explanation for these results is that the vegetation was not water limited prior to treatment in this study reach. This is an important consideration for water resource managers prior to installation of BDAs if the main restoration goal is the improvement of riparian vegetation health. Two high spatial resolution sUAS multispectral datasets were collected to evaluate the bias introduced by using the relatively course resolution (10 m) satellite imagery to assess these changes. High-resolution sUAS data allow fine-scale differences in vegetation and inundated area to be distinguished; however, historical sUAS datasets are rarely available. Satellite-based remote sensing has much lower resolution; however, Sentinel-2 satellite data have been available for the entire earth since 2016. This study demonstrates that the combination of sUAS and satellite based remote sensing data provides a method to compare high-resolution datasets for spatial analysis while gaining insight into relatively low-resolution historical data for temporal analysis.

TI  - Soil salinity prediction models constructed by different remote sensors
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a significant environmental problem, soil salinity should be timely and accurately mapped and monitored. In recent years, remote sensing data and techniques have been widely used for soil salinity estimation. However, with the difference in the sensors' characteristics, satellite-based prediction of soil salinity remains highly uncertain. This study investigates and compares soil salinity models from remote sensing sensors with different spectral, and most importantly, spatial resolution. Thus, data from two middle (Landsat - 8 and Sentinel - 2) and one high spatial resolution (PlanetScope) sensors have been used for salinity indices have been used for developing salinity prediction models from in-situ data. For this purpose, data from random points in different agricultural fields have been collected in the study area. The developed statistical models were validated using 20% of the dataset using accuracy indices. The results showed that the higher spatial resolution tent to give a better model prediction. However, it also means that the higher the spatial resolution of the imagery, the more complex the prediction model will be developed. The results also showed that simpler models give a higher correlation between the observed and the predicted values. For future studies, we recommend a similar investigation using different sensors and more in-situ data over similar agricultural fields.

TI  - Assessment of drought impact on phenological development of selected sunflower hybrids based on vegetation indices and orthogonalization of multispectral satellite data
T2  - BULGARIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Agriculture is one of the leading sectors, directly affected by the negative impacts of climate change and in particular of drought. Water stress is amongst the key growth limiting factors in crop production. It is expected that in the next decades Bulgaria will be affected by warming of air temperatures and reduction of precipitation sum that will significantly increase the risk of droughts. Although, sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) is known to be a drought tolerant crop, sufficient and optimized agrotechnical activities are needed to achieve yield increase under changing environmental conditions and depletion of natural resources. The proper irrigation scheduling, for example, requires determination of biologically optimal health and water status for different sunflower varieties, at different stages of ontogeny. The research suggests a remote sensing methodology, integrating vegetation indices and orthogonalization of multispectral satellite data for studying phenological development of selected sunflower hybrids under drought conditions. Two indices - Normalized Differential Greenness Index (NDGI), and Normalized Differential Wetness Index (NDWNI), based on Tasseled Cap Transformation are introduced for agricultural assessments. The results show the dynamics of water and health status of the studied agroecosystems in the different growth stages, defined ac-cording to BBCH scale. NDGI and NDWNI appear to be especially suitable for determination of timing and duration of growth stages and for monitoring of the status of the studied crops during these stages. The methodology possesses a great potential for better understanding of drought impact on crop dynamics and functioning.

TI  - Post-Fire Forest Vegetation State Monitoring through Satellite Remote Sensing and In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have significant environmental and socio-economic impacts, affecting ecosystems and people worldwide. Over the coming decades, it is expected that the intensity and impact of wildfires will grow depending on the variability of climate parameters. Although Bulgaria is not situated within the geographical borders of the Mediterranean region, which is one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of temperature extremes, the climate is strongly influenced by it. Forests are amongst the most vulnerable ecosystems affected by wildfires. They are insufficiently adapted to fire, and the monitoring of fire impacts and post-fire recovery processes is of utmost importance for suggesting actions to mitigate the risk and impact of that catastrophic event. This paper investigated the forest vegetation recovery process after a wildfire in the Ardino region, southeast Bulgaria from the period between 2016 and 2021. The study aimed to present a monitoring approach for the estimation of the post-fire vegetation state with an emphasis on fire-affected territory mapping, evaluation of vegetation damage, fire and burn severity estimation, and assessment of their influence on vegetation recovery. The study used satellite remotely sensed imagery and respective indices of greenness, moisture, and fire severity from Sentinel-2. It utilized the potential of the landscape approach in monitoring processes occurring in fire-affected forest ecosystems. Ancillary data about pre-fire vegetation state and slope inclinations were used to supplement our analysis for a better understanding of the fire regime and post-fire vegetation damages. Slope aspects were used to estimate and compare their impact on the ecosystems' post-fire recovery capacity. Soil data were involved in the interpretation of the results.

TI  - Determining UHI Effect by Remote Sensing Method in Bolu City Centre, Turkey
T2  - ICONARP INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURE AND PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) has been described by authors as the UHI effect is among the most common forms of human origin (anthropogenic) local climate change. The increasing UHI effect with the differences in land use and landscape pattern varies depending on surface soil, watery field presence and vegetation. In this study, using Landsat 5 TM of 1994 and Landsat 7 ETM+ images of 2019, the ArcGIS 10.6.1 program and the remote sensing methods have identified surface temperature and vegetation distribution. Surface temperature values of the land -use in Bolu province of 2019, 1/5000 Urban Development Plan land uses and average temperature values were determined. The study revealed the change between urban development and the effect of land surface temperature over the course of 25 years, and discussed the UHI effect in the Bolu province. The effects of the historical process in Bolu city center on land surface temperature (with LST differences) and vegetation distribution (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; NDVI) have been surveyed. The constraints of this study are that the spatial resolution in orthophotos of 1994 is low, and the type of land-use temperature data cannot be compared to 2019. For this reason, LST and NDVI analyzes were conducted in 1994 orthophotos, classifying all parcels with structure and related area in the form of manually constructed areas (built Environment). One of the findings of this study are surface temperatures of areas used as farmland in the year 1994 data reached higher values after they quickly began to urbanize in Bolu. The main reason for the high surface temperature in the Bolu province over the 25-year period is that agricultural areas are impurized and increasing population density and the albedo effect. It has been concluded that the lack of green space and lack of vegetation in the continuous urban area has increased the UHI effect.

TI  - Developing Biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 Wastewater-Based Epidemiology: A Systematic Review of Trends, Limitations and Future Perspectives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) permits the sustainable surveillance of pathogens in large populations and does not discriminate between symptomatic and asymptomatic groups. WBE allows health authorities and policymakers to make swift decisions to limit the impact of local and regional disease outbreaks, minimise the spread of infection and mitigate the effects of pathogen importation. Biosensors are an exciting addition to conventional WBE analytical approaches. Combined with sentinel surveillance programs, biosensors can be reactive to novel variants of a virus in the community. However, progress developing biosensors for wastewater surveillance is severely limited compared to advances in clinical diagnostics, with a lack of well-developed biosensors currently being available. Whilst the field of biosensors is vast, this review focuses on trends in monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater over a key period (2020-2021). We explore the complexities involved in sampling within wastewater networks, the options for target selection, and reflect on the ethical considerations and limitations of this approach by highlighting the complex transdisciplinary connections needed. The outlook for WBE biosensors is assessed to be on a positive trajectory as current technical challenges are overcome. Finally, we outline the current status and where further development is needed to have a systematic feedback mechanism which would allow wastewater biosensors to be kept current and relevant to emergent pathogens.

TI  - Multifractal Analysis of MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellite Time Series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Enhanced Vegetation Index of Sites Affected by Wildfires
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS Aqua and Terra Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series acquired during nearly two decades (2000 to 2020) covering the area burned by the Camp Fire (California) in 2018 is investigated in this study by using the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis in relation to the recovery process of vegetation after fire. In 2008, the same area was partially burned by two wildfires, the BTU Lightning Complex Fire and the Humboldt Fire. Our results indicate that all vegetation index time series are featured by six- and twelve-month modulating periodicities, with a larger spectral content at longer periods for two-fire-affected sites. Furthermore, two fires cause an increase of the persistence of the NDVI and EVI time series and an increase of the complexity, suggesting that the recovery process of vegetation dynamics of fire-affected sites is characterized by positive feedback mechanisms, driving the growth-generating phenomena, which become even more effective in those sites affected by two fires.

TI  - EFFICACY OF THE RICE CROP GROWTH USING DIFFERENT SMOOTHING METHODS
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ANALYSIS AND COMPUTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of India???s most important food crops. The government of India has a major duty in agriculture: perfect mapping and continual mon-itoring of paddy rice fields. Rice growth has a major impact on SCATSAT-1 backscatter images, and rice fields have been successfully mapped using a time-series analysis employing satellite data. SCATSAT-1 time-series data was used to detect single-cropped, double-cropped, and triple-cropped rice fields (1 to 3 harvests per year) and identify different phonological stages using a crop phenology-based categorization. The usefulness of rice crop growth utilizing exponential smoothing approaches to estimate and forecast yield growth is demonstrated in this paper. The Holt linear trend, Holt-Winters methods (additive and multiplicative), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Sum Squared Error (SSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Percentile Error (MPE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) are used as error factors to choose the best forecasting methods among the exponential smoothing techniques.

TI  - Analysis on the Fire Progression and Severity Variation of the Massive Forest Fire Occurred in Uljin, Korea, 2022
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the progression of forest fires is critical in understanding fire regimes and managing the risk of active fires. Major fire events in Korea mostly occur in the eastern mountainous areas (Gangwon Province), where the wind and moisture conditions are prone to fire in the late winter season. Despite the significance of the fire events in the area both in terms of frequency and severity, their spatial progression characteristics and their dependency on forest types have not been sufficiently analyzed so far, particularly with satellite data. This study first derived the severity map for the Uljin fire which occurred in March 2022, using a series of satellite images acquired over the fire period with very high frequency (every 5 days), and analyzed the characteristics of spatio-temporal progression in terms of forest types. The analysis revealed that the core fire area expanded very rapidly in the first few days, followed by an intensification phase that elevated severity in the active areas with marginal expansion in the peripheral areas. The analysis of the progression showed that the fire did not expand selectively by the forest type, despite the clear difference in their severity levels in the burned areas, where coniferous forest exhibited 3 times higher severity than deciduous forest.

TI  - Urban Flood Detection Using TerraSAR-X and SAR Simulated Reflectivity Maps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery is a vital tool for flood mapping due to its capability to acquire images day and night in almost any weather and to penetrate through cloud cover. In rural areas, SAR backscatter intensity can be used to detect flooded areas accurately; however, the complexity of urban structures makes flood mapping in urban areas a challenging task. In this study, we examine the synergistic use of SAR simulated reflectivity maps and Polarimetric and Interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) features in the improvement of flood mapping in urban environments. We propose a machine learning model employing simulated and PolInSAR features derived from TerraSAR-X images along with five auxiliary features, namely elevation, slope, aspect, distance from the river, and land-use/land-cover that are well-known to contribute to flood mapping. A total of 2450 data points have been used to build and evaluate the model over four different areas with different vegetation and urban density. The results indicated that by using PolInSAR and SAR simulated reflectivity maps together with five auxiliary features, a classification overall accuracy of 93.1% in urban areas was obtained, representing a 9.6% improvement over using the five auxiliary features alone.

TI  - Naive Bayes classification-based surface water gap-filling from partially contaminated optical remote sensing image
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing images are a common data sources for surface water monitoring, while they are easily contaminated by clouds, cloud shadows, terrain shadows, etc., resulting in spatial gaps in surface water images. This paper proposes a surface water gap-filling method based on Naive Bayes classification. It uses the historical cloud-free binary (water, non-water) surface water images as prior data and the uncontaminated pixels in the partially contaminated ternary (water, non-water, contaminated pixels) surface water image as evidence to identify the category of gap pixels to achieve the purpose of gap-filling. This method considers the relationship between disconnected water bodies and does not depend on terrain data. When the image is heavily covered by clouds, this method can also reconstruct the complete water extent accurately. Five study areas with different scenarios including rivers, lakes or reservoirs, are selected to evaluate the method. Results show that the average gap-filling accuracy in all five study areas is over 90 %. After gap-filling, the time series of surface water area presents a good correlation with the time series of water level (e.g., the coefficient of determinationR2 = 0.95 in the Dartmouth reservoir). The proposed method is proved effective in filling gaps caused by clouds, cloud shadows and terrain shadows in surface water image, and it would be suitable for high-frequency surface water monitoring and near real-time surface water mapping.

TI  - Application of Soil Moisture Data Assimilation in Flood Forecasting of Xun River in Hanjiang River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate projection of floods is of great significance to safeguard economic and social development as well as people's life and property. The development of hydrological models can improve the level of flood projection, however, the numerous uncertainties in the models limit the projection accuracy. By adding observations to correct the operation of prediction models, the accuracy can be improved to some extent. In this paper, taking the Xun River, of the Hanjiang River Basin in China, as the research object, combined with the soil moisture satellite data obtained by the soil moisture active and passive satellite (SMAP), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) algorithm was used to assimilate the upper soil water content (WU) of the Xinanjiang model. In addition, based on the simultaneous assimilation of state variables and parameters, two improved assimilation schemes were proposed here, namely, the augmented ensemble Kalman filter (AEnKF) scheme and the dual ensemble Kalman filter (DEnKF) scheme. The results showed that compared with the WU assimilation scheme, the simultaneous assimilation of parameters and WU improved the prediction ability of the Xinanjiang model to a greater extent. The two improved schemes had similar effects on flood prediction accuracy, and improved the overall Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) from 0.725 for non-assimilated, and 0.758 for assimilated WU, to 0.781. Among them, AEnKF and DEnKF schemes, respectively, improved the NSE by 10.1% and 11% at maximum. This study demonstrated that the application of data assimilation for the Xun River effectively improved the flood forecast accuracy of the Xinanjiang model, which will provide a reference basis and technical support for future flood prevention and mitigation and flood projection in this basin.

TI  - Challenges in Preparation of Albumin Nanoparticle-Based Radiopharmaceuticals
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Review
AB  - Albumin nanocolloids have been used as radiopharmaceuticals for more than 40 years. Their main use is in lymphoscintigraphy and the detection of the sentinel lymph node as part of the surgical treatment of a variety of solid tumours. The main licensed products are labelled with the gamma emitter technetium-99m. Recently, two analogues labelled with positron emitters have been reported, using gallium-68 and zirconium-89. For about 10 years, there has been interest in dual-modal agents with both radioactive and fluorescent labels to improve the localisation of the sentinel lymph node. Indocyanine green (ICG) has been the most widely used fluorescent label, largely due to its availability as a licensed agent and its ease of application. The further development of alternative radiolabels or improved fluorescent tags will require investment in the development and licensing. There is also a vast potential for the targeting of albumin nanocolloids using existing strategies, which could be promising for the development of both diagnostic and therapeutic agents.

TI  - Analysis of the Fire Season of 2020 in the Mediterranean Bioclimatic Zone of Croatian Adriatic
T2  - SEEFOR-SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN FORESTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Fire season in the Mediterranean bioclimatic area is most associated with the period from June to late October. Despite this, a large number of fires occur in February and March due to the intentional burning of agricultural lands. A characteristic of the Mediterranean region is the strong adaptation of vegetation to fire, though this adaptation also depends on the frequency and intensity of fires. This frequency is shown on satellite images via MODIS. This paper provides an overview of indicators of vegetation fires in the Croatian coast and karst coastal belt in the 2020 fire season. The 2020 fire season was above average in comparison with the period 2010 to 2019, with more fires than average and more burnt area. A specificity of the 2020 season is seen in the large number of fires in February and March. Fire protection in Croatia is facilitated by the use of new remote sensing technologies, in combination with the existing surveillance and monitoring methods, and organised protection systems to prevent open fires.

TI  - Investigation of <i>ICESat-2</i> Data Capabilities for Forest-Height Estimation over Russia
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of ICESat-2 data capabilities for forest-height estimation and assessment of its spatial distribution over Russia. A brief overview of available current and historic lidar satellite-data products is carried out. The physical basis of the ATLAS instrument operation, as well as an approach to forming an ATL08 data product with information on vertical structure of vegetation, are described. An approach for automated download and preprocessing of ATL08 product is implemented, including filtering of missing/corrupted data, conversion to vector format, and delineation of borders of aggregated lidar footprints for which characteristics of vegetation-height distribution are provided. All the available ATL08 data over Russia for the period from October 14, 2018, to May 13, 2020, was processed to form a dataset of over 125 million lidar measurements of vegetation vertical structure, including over 50 million measurements of forest height. This study was performed at local and national spatial levels. Local-scale accuracy assessment of the ATL08 product (at the level of forest stands) included actualization of field survey data using models of forest growth, and satellite-data-based estimation of mean forest height and its uncertainty considering uncertainties of input lidar measurements and forest cover heterogeneity. Results of the local-scale accuracy assessment of ATL08 data are presented, showing agreement between ground-based and satellite measurements of mean forest height at the level of R-2 = 0.67 and RMSE = 3.79 m. National level analysis included examples of potential use of the resulting dataset to study height and productivity of Russian forests. Estimates of mean forest-height spatial distribution over Russia, as well as distribution of mean height for different forest types, are presented.

TI  - Estimating the economic value and economic return of irrigation water as a sustainable water resource management mechanism
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the economic value of irrigation water in monetary terms is a crucial water management tool to address water scarcity, shortage, and overuse problems. This study seeks to couple remote-sensing-based, biophysical water productivity with empirical economic valuation of water to estimate irrigation water's near real-time economic value and the gross return that farmers can earn from using the irrigation water. The study was done at the Koga large-scale community-managed irrigation scheme in the Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia. Water productivity based on open sources remotely sensed data (WaPOR) datasets and Hedonic Pricing Method (HPM) were used to analyze near real-time crop water productivity (CWP), and determine irrigation water's economic value. Results showed that the average CWP was 1.08 kg/m(3). Farmers were willing to pay 0.074 US$/m(3), which ranged from 7.5 to 23.5% of their gross benefit from irrigation water. The study evidenced that coupling the remote-sensing-based CWP data with an empirical analysis of farmers' willingness to pay for irrigation water can generate an agreeable estimate of the economic value of irrigation water and showed the income generated from the irrigation business. Therefore, the method and result help to plan a suitable water pricing modality, which enhances sustainable irrigation management and water productivity.

TI  - Simulating Spatiotemporal Changes in Land Use and Land Cover of the North-Western Himalayan Region Using Markov Chain Analysis
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial variabilities and drivers of land use and land cover (LULC) change over time and are crucial for determining the region's economic viability and ecological functionality. The North-Western Himalayan (NWH) regions have witnessed drastic changes in LULC over the last 50 years, as a result of which their ecological diversity has been under significant threat. There is a need to understand how LULC change has taken place so that appropriate conservation measures can be taken well in advance to understand the implications of the current trends of changing LULC. This study has been carried out in the Baramulla district of the North-Western Himalayas to assess its current and future LULC changes and determine the drivers responsible for future policy decisions. Using Landsat 2000, 2010, and 2020 satellite imagery, we performed LULC classification of the study area using the maximum likelihood supervised classification. The land-use transition matrix, Markov chain model, and CA-Markov model were used to determine the spatial patterns and temporal variation of LULC for 2030. The CA-Markov model was first used to predict the land cover for 2020, which was then verified by the actual land cover of 2020 (Kappa coefficient of 0.81) for the model's validation. After calibration and validation of the model, LULC was predicted for the year 2030. Between the years 2000 and 2020, it was found that horticulture, urbanization, and built-up areas increased, while snow cover, forest cover, agricultural land, and water bodies all decreased. The significant drivers of LULC changes were economic compulsions, climate variability, and increased human population. The analysis finding of the study highlighted that technical, financial, policy, or legislative initiatives are required to restore fragile NWH regions experiencing comparable consequences.

TI  - Mapping Area Changes of Glacial Lakes Using Stacks of Optical Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lakes are an important and dynamic component of terrestrial meltwater storage, responding to climate change and glacier retreat. Although there is evidence of rapid worldwide growth of glacial lakes, changes in frequency and magnitude of glacier lake outbursts under climatic changes are not yet understood. This study proposes and discusses a method framework for regional-scale mapping of glacial lakes and area change detection using large time-series of optical satellite images and the cloud processing tool Google Earth Engine in a semi-automatic way. The methods are presented for two temporal scales, from the 2-week Landsat revisit period to annual resolution. The proposed methods show how constructing an annual composite of pixel values such as minimum or maximum values can help to overcome typical problems associated with water mapping from optical satellite data such as clouds, or terrain and cloud shadows. For annual-resolution glacial lake mapping, our method set only involves two different band ratios based on multispectral satellite images. The study demonstrates how the proposed method framework can be applied to detect rapid lake area changes and to produce a complete regional-scale glacial lake inventory, using the Greater Caucasus as example.

TI  - Visual Monitoring Strategies of Sentinels in a Cooperative Breeder
T2  - BIOLOGY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Animals frequently interrupt their activities to monitor their surroundings for possible threats such as predators and intruders. How animals carry out this vigilance has received little attention. In particular, the quality of vigilance depends on where animals look and how long each look lasts. We examine how vigilance is organized in the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma caerulescens). During vigilance, these birds turn their heads in different directions to detect threats. We found that birds turned their heads regularly and also regularly returned their gaze to areas previously monitored, which is predicted when predators and intruders rely on surprise to approach. Birds turned their heads in several directions during vigilance, but often more frequently on one side of the body than the other, which was not predicted for regular vigilance. Looks were shorter in smaller groups and in juveniles presumably to increase visual coverage in more threatening situations. Visual monitoring strategies during vigilance reflect the risk posed by predators and intruders. Vigilance is important for early detection of threats. Previous studies have focused on the allocation of time to vigilance but neglected how animals monitor their surroundings during vigilance. Where animals look and how long each look lasts can affect the quality of visual monitoring and thus the ability to detect threats during vigilance. We examined visual monitoring strategies in the Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), a cooperative breeder with sentinel behaviour. Sentinels in this species make head turns from vantage points to detect the arrival of predators and intruding neighbours. We found that sentinels initiated head turns at regular intervals and also returned their gaze to areas previously monitored at regular intervals, which is predicted when predators and intruders rely on surprise rather than stealth to approach. Sentinels made head turns in several directions, but often more frequently on one side of the body than the other, which was not predicted for regular vigilance. Average look duration during sentinel bouts was shorter in smaller groups and in juveniles. We argue that shorter looks are beneficial to increase visual coverage in more threatening situations. Our study highlights how visual monitoring strategies during vigilance reflect the risk posed by predators and intruders.

TI  - The Imagosphere of Myroslav Skoryk's Opera Moses
T2  - MUSICOLOGY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is dedicated to the eminent Ukrainian composer Myroslav Skoryk's opera Moses, which has been researched here from the standpoint of musical imagology for the first time. The methodology of the paper is based on the complex imagological concepts of Manfred S. Fischer and Jean-Marc Moura, in which they propose to analyse literary phenomena in national comparative contexts in terms of imagemes, imagothemes, and imagotypes. This triad in its totality makes up the imagosphere, that is, the world of artistic images which are both a cultural representation of a given national identity and its reflection in the artist's work. It has been found that one of the central images of Skoryk's opera and entire output is the national character of his music, which is defined by references to Ukrainian folksongs as well as the nation's operatic and choral tradition. The imagothemes of Skoryk's opera are related to a wide range of 'eternal' philosophical problems, such as good vs evil, faith vs its lack, human vs God, etc. By developing the ideas of Ivan Franko, the author of the opera's literary prototype, the composer presents a whole complex of 'eternal' themes, which he refers to the contemporary Ukrainian context: freedom and faith, liberation from centuries-long slavery and dependence, as well as the theme of the nation's spiritual leaders' responsibilities and their relationship with the people. The main imagotypes of the opera: the God Jehovah, the prophet Moses, a lyrical young couple, and the Poet - correspond to the main qualities of Ukrainian mentality and national character, namely: patriotism, spirituality, piety, 'cordocentrism', and a lyrical-poetic worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - Melanoma is a tumor that continues to increase in both the number of cases presenting and mortality. Patients with disease that has spread beyond the cutaneous boundary still suffer from significant morbidity and mortality despite advances in immune therapy. It is incumbent that clinicians keep up with the latest advances in both tumorigenesis and metastatic capabilities, and be aware of clinical, histopathologic, and genetic metrics to assist in the early diagnosis of aggressive tumors. This review synopsizes some of the most recent findings.

TI  - Understanding languaculture from an indigenous M?ori worldview
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents understandings from indigenous Maori kaumatua (elders both male and female) and whanau (parents and extended family members) from Aotearoa New Zealand. These people live in a close-knit hapu (subtribe) community close to an ancestral meeting space known as their marae. Their marae continues to be essential in the promotion of Maori knowledge, language and ways of being. Kaumatua and whanau recall important cultural understandings and practices from this journey. From growing up largely in te ao Maori (the Maori world) they consider "languaculture", the inter-relationships between language, identity and culture, as foundational to their future "hope" for collective cultural strength and wellbeing.

TI  - An Econometric Analysis of Sea Surface Temperatures, Sea Ice Concentrations and Ocean Surface Current Velocities
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzed quarterly longitudinal data for 64,800 1 x 1 degree grids during 2000-2019 on sea surface temperatures, sea ice concentrations, and ocean surface current zonal and meridional velocities in the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The methodological framework addressed the processing of remote sensing signals, interdependence between sea surface temperatures and sea ice concentrations, and combining zonal and meridional velocities as the eddy kinetic energy. Dynamic and static random effects models were estimated by maximum likelihood and stepwise methods, respectively, taking into account the unobserved heterogeneity across grids. The main findings were that quarterly sea surface temperatures increased steadily in the Northern hemisphere, whereas cyclical patterns were apparent in Southern hemisphere; sea ice concentrations declined in both hemispheres. Second, sea surface temperatures were estimated with large negative coefficients in the models for sea ice concentrations for the hemispheres; previous sea ice concentrations were negatively associated with sea surface temperatures, indicating feedback loops. Third, sea surface temperatures were positively and significantly associated with eddy kinetic energy in Northern hemisphere. Overall, the results indicated the importance of reducing sea surface temperatures via reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and the dumping of pollutants into oceans for maintaining sea ice concentrations and enhancing global sustainability.

TI  - Recent Developments in Wireless Soil Moisture Sensing to Support Scientific Research and Agricultural Management
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, wireless sensor network (WSN) technology has emerged as an important technique for wireless sensing of soil moisture from the field to the catchment scale. This review paper presents the current status of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology for distributed, near real-time sensing of soil moisture to investigate seasonal and event dynamics of soil moisture patterns. It is also discussed how WSN measurements of soil measurements contribute to the validation and downscaling of satellite data and non-invasive geophysical instruments as well as the validation of distributed hydrological models. Finally, future perspectives for WSN measurements of soil moisture are highlighted, which includes the improved integration of real-time WSN measurements with other information sources using the latest wireless communication techniques and cyberinfrastructures.

TI  - Long term monitoring of rainwater harvesting tanks: Is multi-years management possible in crystalline South Indian aquifers?
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid regions as in India, where agriculture relies on groundwater abstraction, increase of water resources availability through managed aquifer recharge (MAR) or rainwater harvesting (RWH) is often perceived as a major solution. Studies on these structures' efficiency exists but despite the interest, limited information is available on the temporal variation of their replenishment. In a monsoon driven climate, the inter-annual variations are crucial to assess the potential of water storage and multiyear management especially for these structures. Here, we aim at developing a methodology to reconstruct water storage of RWH tanks to further improve our understanding on long term efficiency and multi-years drought management. To tackle this issue, long-term monitoring of a RWH tank located in Telangana in Southern India is achieved by a combination of field monitoring over 2 years (tanks surface and water levels) and a daily water balance compared to LANDSAT measurements of the tank area. The procedure allows reconstructing the tank filling dynamic over a 14-years period at a daily time step and show the extreme variability of the tank filling level. During this period, the yearly maximum tank volume ranges from 8650 to similar to 200 000 m(3). On the 14-years period, the tank reach its maximum capacity only once and, for 1/3 of the time, yearly maximum replenishment is below 15% of its capacity. The surface water availability remains limited in time since the tank dries-up annually, except for 2 years. However, water percolation to the aquifer is slightly enhanced for some years. During this monitoring period, very few extreme raining events (6) contribute for more than 50% of the collected volume. This observation highlights (1) the dependency of the structure to extreme storm events, (2) the limited capacity for a multi-year's management and (3) the farmers vulnerability to successive droughts.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomalous variations in various geophysical fields (lineament systems, thermal fields, and ionospheric parameters) during the earthquake with the magnitude M = 5.6, which took place near Lake Baikal on September 22, 2020, and during its preparation, are studied. Features of the geophysical fields are described. Combined analysis of anomalous variations in the geophysical fields in the lithosphere, atmosphere, and ionosphere during the earthquake preparation is carried out. Based on the analysis results, we detect anomalous variations in the lineament systems 15 and 6 days before; in the thermal fields 15 and 14 days before; and in the ionospheric parameters 8, 7, and 6 days before the earthquake. Correspondences are found between the occurrence of the maxima of the lineament systems and the thermal fields 15 and 6 days before the earthquake and changes in the state of the ionosphere and thermal fields 9-10 days and 4 days before the earthquake.

M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in thermal fields during the period leading up to and during earthquakes (magnitude of 4.2-4.8) in the North Caucasus between 2017 and 2022 are studied based on satellite data. The Earth's surface and near-surface air temperatures, outgoing long-wave radiation, and relative humidity near the surface recorded from space are analyzed. The changes in thermal fields during the preparation of seismic events are compared for earthquakes with epicenters located in zones of similar geological structures, such as the fold-block structures of the Greater Caucasus and the Pre-Caucasian foredeep. Similarities between the variations in the temperature, relative humidity, and fluctuations of outgoing longwave radiation are revealed for a number of earthquakes. The most similar character of the variations is for the normalized values of outgoing long-wave radiation during the preparation of all seismic events analyzed, despite the different positions of their epicenters. Hence, these parameters can be used as short-term precursors of seismic events detectable from space.

M3  - Article
AB  - Comparison between satellite data of low and medium spatial resolution allows calculation of correction factors which provide for improvement of the accuracy of estimates of burned areas and the related emission volumes taking into account various vegetation-cover types, with the use of the MCD64A1 product. Analysis is carried out of more accurate estimates of the areas of burned forest, shrub, and meadow-steppe territories in the Russian Federation and of the volume of emissions of harmful pollutants from wildfires in the period from 2001 to 2021. It is found that 16.1-104.5 thousand square kilometers of forests, shrubs, and meadow-steppes per year burned throughout the 20-year period. Wildfires were the source of the highest volumes of emissions of carbon-containing gases and fine aerosols during the period under study. The volumes of CO, CO2, and PM2.5 emissions from the combustion of forest biomass in the Siberian and Far Eastern Federal districts in 2016 and 2021 exceeded the national mean by more than 80%.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of glaciers and glacial lakes: climate change impact on the Mago Chu Basin, Eastern Himalayas
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and glacial lakes are susceptible to variations in climate and are global indicators of climate change. However, changes in glaciers and glacial lakes are rarely documented in the Eastern Himalayan region, especially from Bhutan and Arunachal Himalaya. This study attempts to bridge the knowledge gap on depletion of glaciers and glacial lake changes in the Eastern Himalayas by concentrating on the Mago Chu basin. Spatio-temporal changes in the glaciers and lakes extent and number in 1988 and 2018 are derived from Landsat TM and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries and major climatic drivers of change (temperature and precipitation) are analyzed from ERAS reanalysis data. The number of glaciers was reduced from 92 to 86 during 1988-2018, whereas the glacial lakes increased from 134 to 195 in this period. The glacial area of 83.55 (+/- 6.2) km(2), which contributed to almost 10% of the total basin area in 1988, shrank to about 58.7 (+/- 1.6) km(2) covering only 7% of the total basin area in 2018. Twenty smaller glaciers vanished, 12 fragmented, and 57 have retreated. Glacial lake area, on the other hand, increased from similar to 3.8 (+/- 1.2) km(2) in 1988 to similar to 6.4 (+/- 0.0006) km(2) in 2018, and 61 new lakes formed during this period. The new lakes are not proglacial but are glacier-fed, indicating retreat of glaciers. Climate data analysis shows increase in mean monthly temperature during the period in the study area supporting the changes observed in glaciers and lakes.

TI  - The importance of mitosis ≥2 in selecting patients with T1 cutaneous melanomas for sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging Manual removed the mitotic rate (MR) as a staging criterion for T1 melanomas, thus leading to a debate on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in thin melanomas. This study investigates whether MR plays a role in selecting patients with T1 melanoma for SLNB. We analyzed clinical and histological data from the Florence Melanoma & Skin Cancer Unit database for 313 patients with a single thin melanoma who had undergone SLNB. We determined sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity percentages in T1 melanomas according to the AJCC 8th Edition focusing on MR. Of the 313 T1 patients, 108 had MR = 0, 127 had MR = 1 and 78 had MR >= 2. The overall SLN positivity rate was 8.6%, (5.6% with MR = 0, 6.3% with MR = 1 and 16.7% with MR >= 2). The SLNB positivity rate in T1b melanomas was 12.1%, (8.5% with MR = 0, 5.7% with MR = 1 and 24.4% with MR >= 2), whereas in T1a melanomas it was 5.8%, (3.3% with MR = 0, 6.8% with MR = 1 and 8.1% with MR >= 2). In a logistic regression analysis, MR >= 2 had an odds ratio of almost three in comparison with MR = 0/1 also adjusting for thickness. Thus, MR >= 2 significantly predicted SLN metastases in T1 melanomas. Of those patients with positive SLN, 37% were classified as T1a according to the AJCC 8th edition. These findings underline the importance of MR >= 2 in selecting patients with T1 cutaneous melanomas for SLNB.

TI  - Comparing Pan-sharpened Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2 for Land-Use Classification Using Machine Learning Classifiers
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the ability of two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to generate land-use maps using the recently launched Landsat-9 and Sentinel-2, two of the most used and popular satellite imagery sources. The potential to improve Landsat-9 performance was tested by pan-sharpening different bands of high-resolution data (15 m). For optimal performance of both classifiers, model tuning methods were applied by trying different combinations of key parameters of each model. This comparison was made in two different areas in Central Morocco. The results show that SVM performs slightly better than RF in classifying two images. In addition, Sentinel-2 exhibits significant multivariety classification ability compared to the pan-sharpened Landsat-9, despite the improved resolution of the latter. Lastly, the best classification performances were recorded for the combination Sentinel-2/SVM classifier. At last, machine learning algorithms prove their efficiency in classifying satellite images with high performance.

TI  - Harvested area did not increase abruptly-how advancements in satellite-based mapping led to erroneous conclusions
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message: Using satellite-based maps, Ceccherini et al. (Nature 583:72-77, 2020) report abruptly increasing harvested area estimates in several EU countries beginning in 2015. Using more than 120,000 National Forest Inventory observations to analyze the satellite-based map, we show that it is not harvested area but the map's ability to detect harvested areas that abruptly increases after 2015 in Finland and Sweden.

TI  - The Effect of Suspended Particulate Matter on the Supraglacial Lake Depth Retrieval from Optical Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes (SGL) are a specific phenomenon of glaciers. They are important for ice dynamics, surface mass balance, and surface hydrology, especially during ongoing climate changes. The important characteristics of lakes are their water storage and drainage. Satellite-based remote sensing is commonly used not only to monitor the area but also to estimate the depth and volume of lakes, which is the basis for long-term spatiotemporal analysis of these phenomena. Lake depth retrieval from optical data using a physical model requires several basic assumptions such as, for instance, the water has little or no dissolved or suspended matter. Several authors using these assumptions state that they are also potential weaknesses, which remain unquantified in the literature. The objective of this study is to quantify the effect of maximum detectable lake depth for water with non-zero suspended particulate matter (SPM). We collected in-situ concurrent measurements of hyperspectral and lake depth observations to a depth of 8 m. Additionally, we collected water samples to measure the concentration of SPM. The results of empirical and physically based models proved that a good relationship still exists between the water spectra of SGL and the lake depth in the presence of 48 mg/L of SPM. The root mean squared error for the models ranged from 0.163 m (Partial Least Squares Regression-PLSR model) to 0.243 m (physically based model), which is consistent with the published literature. However, the SPM limited the maximum detectable depth to approximately 3 m. This maximum detectable depth was also confirmed by the theoretical concept of Philpot (1989). The maximum detectable depth decreases exponentially with an increase in the water attenuation coefficient g, which directly depends on the water properties.

TI  - Spring phenology of oak stands in the Western Carpathians: validation of satellite metrics from MODIS using ground-based observations
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focuses on the validation of the leaf unfolding (LU) onset of oak stands in the Western Carpathians in 2000-2021 derived from MODIS satellite data. LU onset was derived from the annual trajectories of the Normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) fitted with a double sigmoid logistic function. The satellite metric Growing speed day (GSD) corresponding to the LU onset is represented by the first derivative of the sigmoid function. Ground-based observations from 22 phenological stations of the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute (SHMI) were used to validate the date of GSD. The results showed a good agreement between the medians of ground- and satellite-based LU onset dates. In addition to the median, the LU onset at the 5th and 95th percentiles were compared. For both percentiles, we found differences in the onset from MODIS and SHMI. The 5th percentile of the LU onset derived from MODIS was determined later than the one from SHMI data. With the 95th percentile, it was the opposite. As a result, the range determining the duration of LU onset from MODIS was significantly shorter than from SHMI observations. The trend analyses over the period 2000-2021 revealed a shift to the earlier onset of LU similar to 0.33 day.year(-1) (p = 0.13) from satellite and similar to 0.32 day.year(-1) from ground-based observations (p = 0.08). The validated LU onset and trends using the median allow analysing of the oak stands response to changing environmental conditions. However, the differences at the 5th and 95th percentiles, i.e. at the beginning and the end of the LU onset duration, remained unexplained.

TI  - The Contribution of the Non-Muslim Teacher to the Ideal Identity of the Islamic Primary School
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2021, more than one million Muslims lived in the Netherlands, corresponding to approximately 5% of the total population. From the start of the first Islamic schools in the Netherlands in 1988, Islamic schools employed mostly non-Muslim teachers. How the identity of an Islamic school should be put into practice in the plural Dutch context is a regularly recurring topic of discussion. Many researchers and board members assume that the ideal identity of the Islamic school cannot be formed with non-Muslim teachers. They suppose that the ideal identity can only be shaped with Muslim staff. This article describes, on the basis of qualitative research among three non-Muslim teachers, how they can contribute to the development of the ideal identity of Islamic primary schools. This research shows that the contribution that non-Muslim teachers make to the ideal identity of the Islamic school can be very important. The presence of the non-Muslim teacher gives the pupils the opportunity to learn about religious diversity. The school becomes a training ground for dialogue and respectful interaction with each other. The results of this research are not only relevant for Islamic schools, but also, schools of other denominations can revise their view of the ideal identity and staff with a different worldview than the board of the school.

TI  - Lagrangian Analysis of Pacific Waters in the Sea of Okhotsk Based on Satellite Data in Application to the Walleye Pollock Fishery
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The trajectories of 114 000 passive particles regularly distributed on a grid in the Sea of Okhotsk are calculated for each day of the interval from January 31, 1997 to March 10, 2021, based on satellite altimetry data on geostrophic current speeds. All particles coming to the Sea of Okhotsk from the Pacific Ocean are identified and the age of the Pacific-origin waters and the area where these waters enter the sea are determined. Using daily vessel-position data in the walleye pollock fishery from 1997 to 2021, Lagrangian maps of the origin and age of the Pacific waters over the same period, and statistical analysis, it is shown that the Walleye pollock fishing grounds are more often in the Pacific waters which passed through the northern Kuril Straits not more than 100 days before the catch dates than in the waters which entered the sea to the south or have been in the sea for more than 100 days. Analysis of satellite imagery of sea surface temperatures leads to the conclusion that the reasons for the aggregation of walleye pollock catch locations in intrusions and Lagrangian fronts of Pacific waters are their warmer temperatures and higher concentrations of feed.

TI  - INDIVIDUAL AUTHOR'S FEATURES OF THE VOCABULARY REPRESENTING LEAN FOOD IN I. S. SHMELEV'S WORK "SUMMER OF THE LORD"
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - I. S. Shmelev is a well-known Russian writer, a native of the urban merchant environment, knowing the peculiarities of this environment so well and clearly conveying them in his works. Born and raised in a patriarchal family where all religious rites were sacredly observed, I. S. Shmelev could not help but absorb a reverent attitude to the Orthodox religion, which is why most of his works are imbued with a Christian worldview. We believe that the above circumstances have influenced the formation of individual authorial features of the use of lexemes of certain thematic groups in the texts of works. In this regard, the task of the proposed study is to identify the author's features of the use of lexemes calling lean food in the novel "Summer of the Lord" which in structural terms is a description of the year of an Orthodox person, thereby clearly demonstrating to the reader that Russian life and faith are inextricably linked. Upon analyzing the individual author's features of the vocabulary representing lean food in I. S. Shmelev's work "Summer of the Lord", we came to the following conclusions. Food and all the rituals associated with it are very instrumental in reflecting both the national and individual picture of the world. According to what kind of food a person uses, it is possible to draw conclusions about his well-being. In the novel "Summer of the Lord" the author uses lexemes related to both common forms of the Russian literary language and dialect forms to represent lean food. In addition, the author introduces lexemes that have come out of active word usage; this makes us understand that some of the realities that are familiar to a person in the time described by I. S. Shmelev are inaccessible to modern people. In order to demonstrate the ease of Great Lent, the author resorts to the use of diminutive suffixes, as well as to the use of anaphora. One of the most important features of the individual I. S. Shmelev author's picture of the world lies in the fact that the lexemes naming lean food appear in the work under consideration as a kind of reference points of time.

TI  - Phenology impact on mangrove area estimation pre- and post a cyclone in Fiji using Sentinel-1 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves offer many socioeconomic and ecological benefits which can be lost due to damage caused by tropical cyclones. Thus, it is important to monitor the damage and recovery more accurately after these events to protect their benefits. In this study, mapping of mangrove damage and recovery was done using Sentinel-1 radar data after Tropical Cyclone Yasa in Suva-Navua, Fiji. Mature mangroves first needed to be discriminated from herbaceous, sapling and damaged mangroves, and then the distribution of mangroves corresponding to phenology seasons was calculated over three years. The ability to discriminate mature mangroves was found to vary with phenological season and before/after the cyclone event. Before the cyclone, poor classification of mature mangroves was observed in the Start of Season and the Peak Growth seasons due to full canopy cover causing radar signal attenuation. After the cyclone event, when there was damage to the mature mangroves, the reduced canopy cover improved the ability to discriminate the mature mangroves as the radar attenuation was reduced. A 7% loss of mature mangroves was observed from the End of Season to Start of Season in the post-cyclone period and a subsequent 6% gain was then observed from Start of Season to Peak Growth season in Suva-Navua. Time series Sentinel-1 data can be used to discriminate mature mangroves from other vegetation types in tropical regions where optical data acquisition is significantly impacted by cloud cover; however, it is important to account for phenological seasons to improve estimates of mature mangrove damage and recovery due to canopy-signal attenuation relationship. The next step in this research is to explore if there is optimal time series of radar data for monitoring mature mangroves in a post-cyclone period.

TI  - A Sentinel-2 Based Multi-Temporal Monitoring Framework for Wind and Bark Beetle Detection and Damage Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of extreme windstorms and increasing heat and drought events induced by climate change leads to severe damage and stress in coniferous forests, making trees more vulnerable to spruce bark beetle infestations. The combination of abiotic and biotic disturbances in forests can cause drastic environmental and economic losses. The first step to containing such damage is establishing a monitoring framework for the early detection of vulnerable plots and distinguishing the cause of forest damage at scales from the management unit to the region. To develop and evaluate the functionality of such a monitoring framework, we first selected an area of interest affected by windthrow damage and bark beetles at the border between Italy and Austria in the Friulian Dolomites, Carnic and Julian Alps and the Carinthian Gailtal. Secondly, we implemented a framework for time-series analysis with open-access Sentinel-2 data over four years (2017-2020) by quantifying single-band sensitivity to disturbances. Additionally, we enhanced the framework by deploying vegetation indices to monitor spectral changes and perform supervised image classification for change detection. A mean overall accuracy of 89% was achieved; thus, Sentinel-2 imagery proved to be suitable for distinguishing stressed stands, bark-beetle-attacked canopies and wind-felled patches. The advantages of our methodology are its large-scale applicability to monitoring forest health and forest-cover changes and its usability to support the development of forest management strategies for dealing with massive bark beetle outbreaks.

TI  - How Mesoscale Eddies Masquerade as Rossby Waves in Merged Altimetric Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave-like signals formed by mesoscale-eddy propagation, in particular, overlap with actual waves, resulting in Rossby waves being misidentified or overestimated. This study revisited the puzzle of wave-eddy aliasing in state-of-the-art altimetric products, with up to six altimetry satellites operating simultaneously after 2016. Spatiotemporal scales and westward-propagating speeds are the primary factors in diagnosing a low-latitude Rossby wave regime from a high-latitude geostrophic turbulence regime, confirming the coexistence of Rossby waves and eddies in wave-like components. Long-lived westward-propagating eddies (prevailing in oceans at latitudes 10 degrees-40 degrees) with weaker meridional deflection are good candidates for masquerading as Rossby waves. The focus here is therefore on the long, first baroclinic mode Rossby waves, which are quantified in several periodic bands by removing eddy signals. From 2016 to 2020, energetic biannual Rossby waves can explain more than 10% of observed sea level anomalies at latitudes equatorward of 25 degrees, 20 degrees, and 15 degrees in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans, respectively. Numerical modeling results support similar assessments, indicating an intrinsic property of eddies masquerading as Rossby waves. This study provides a more accurate assessment of oceanic Rossby waves, which can deepen insight into the energy cascade of the geostrophic features and their dynamic effects on biogeochemical cycles.Plain Language Summary Mesoscale eddies are isolated and closed circulations with typical spatial scales of O (100) km, while oceanic Rossby waves are neither solitary nor circular, consisting of several crests and troughs perpendicular to the phase propagation direction across the whole basin. Satellite altimeter is the only observation that provides a global picture of these features. However, westward-propagating eddies at the theoretical speeds of Rossby waves present wave-like patterns in low-resolution altimetric products and form a dilemma like "wave-particle duality." Decoupling Rossby wave and eddy signals remains problematic. Recently, up to six satellite concurrent samplings support more accurate altimetric products. Combining linear theory-based bandpass filters, satellite data, eddy datasets, and numerical modeling results, we reconfirmed the presence of oceanic Rossby waves and quantified their contributions to total sea level signals, with values up to nearly 25%. Observed Rossby wave signals increase with wave periods, with the clearest signals for the central period of 2 years and well below 10% for semiannual periods. Quantitative results provide a clear reference for distinguishing between the Rossby wave and eddy regimes.

T2  - REVISTA UNIVERSIDAD Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims to understand the expansion of Protestant Pentecostal Christianity with an emerging research methodology. Pentecostal Christians tend to establish a social conglomerate through a worldview that generates social cohesion. This worldview allows the organization of local groups articulated with other regional and international structures. Parishioners have a common goal centered on a proselytizing vision. 1. Regarding purity, they can be divided in"purists" and "liberals". 2. Regarding the gender vision, they are patriarchal groups. This social group generates a theological knowledge from which they promote multidimensional and dialectical social changes. Culture and religion conform a theoretical construct that both allows the study of human groups and promotes positive social change. The conclusion of the study is that Pentecostalism is projected through a proselytizing vision, with a worldview of priorities (personal, work, ecclesial) and a division in which liberal Pentecostals are more assimilated to contemporary reality than dogmatic and traditional Pentecostals.

TI  - Sedimentation and Erosion Patterns of the Lena River Anabranching Channel
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lena River is one of the largest "pristine" undammed river systems in the World. In the middle and low (including delta) 1500 km course of the Lena main stem river forms complex anabranching patterns which are affected by continuous permafrost, degradation of the frozen ground and changes in vegetation (taiga and tundra). This study provides a high-resolution assessment of sediment behavior along this reach. Comprehensive hydrological field studies along the anabranching channel located in the middle, low and delta courses of the Lena River were performed from 2016 to 2022 including acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) discharge measurements and sediment transport estimates by gravimetric analyses of sediment concentration data and surrogate measurements (optical by turbidity meters and acoustic by ADCP techniques). These data were used to construct regional relationships between suspended sediment concentrations (SSC, mg/L), turbidity (T, NTU) and backscatter intensity (BI, dB) values applicable for the conditions of the Lena River. Further, field data sets were used to calibrate the seasonal relationships between Landsat reflectance intensities and field surface sediment concentration data. Robust empirical models were derived between the field surface sediment concentration and surface reflectance data for various hydrological seasons. Based on the integration of in situ monitoring and remote sensing data we revealed significant discrepancies in the spatial and seasonal patterns of the suspended sediment transport between various anabranching reaches of the river system. In the middle course of the Lena River, due to inundation of vegetated banks and islands, a downward decrease in sediment concentrations is observed along the anabranching channel during peak flows. Bed and lateral scour during low water seasons effects average increase in sediment load along the anabranching channels, even though a significant (up to 30%) decline in SSC occurs within the particular reaches of the main channel. Deposition patterns are typical for the secondary channels. The anabranching channel that was influenced by the largest tributaries (Aldan and Viluy) is characterized by the sediment plumes which dominate the spatial and temporal sediment distribution. Finally, in the distributary system of the Lena delta, sediment transport is mostly increased downwards, predominantly under higher discharges and along main distributary channels due to permafrost-dominated bank degradation.

TI  - Trend analysis and inter-annual variability in wind speed in South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable forecasts of long-term longitudinal wind speed patterns may help predict air circulation changes. They are also essential for the planning and financing of wind projects for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). Long-term wind speed trends and variations in historical mean wind speed data were examined using Mann Kendalls test and calculating inter-annual variability (IAV). The Wind Atlas for South Africa (WASA) provides high resolution quality wind data for research and applications locally. WASA has 19 meteorological stations in South Africa. The WASA project began in 2009 with the aim of mapping South Africa's wind resource, allowing stakeholders in the wind energy sector and industry to explore and prepare for utility-scale wind power generation. For the past ten years, WASA has been measuring and providing data.The results showed an increasing trend at WM01 and a decreasing trend at WM08. There was no clear trend at other wind masts. Satellite data was used to validate results and no trends were observed at most of the stations. IAV values for this study ranged between 1.088% and 3.353% which is relatively low compared to the commonly found IAV values of 5-6%, implying that mean annual wind speed variation at these stations is low. To confirm a clear trend in wind speed, it is recommended that further work be done with long term periods and substantiate our finding with the use of historical simulation and climate change scenarios.

TI  - Quality Assessment of FY-3D/MERSI-II Thermal Infrared Brightness Temperature Data from the Arctic Region: Application to Ice Surface Temperature Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic region plays an important role in the global climate system. To promote the application of Medium Resolution Spectral Imager-II (MERSI-II) data in the ice surface temperature (IST) inversion, we used the thermal infrared channels (channels 24 and 25) of the MERSI-II onboard Chinese FY-3D satellite and the thermal infrared channels (channels 31 and 32) of the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA) Aqua satellite for data analysis. Using the Observation-Observation cross-calibration algorithm to cross-calibrate the MERSI and MODIS thermal infrared brightness temperature (T-b) data in the Arctic, channel 24 and 25 data from the FY-3D/MERSI-II on Arctic ice were evaluated. The thermal infrared T-b data of the MERSI-II were used to retrieve the IST via the split-window algorithm. In this study, the correlation coefficients of the thermal infrared channel T-b data between the MERSI and MODIS were >0.95, the mean bias was -0.5501-0.1262 K, and the standard deviation (Std) was <1.3582 K. After linear fitting, the MERSI-II thermal infrared T-b data were closer to the MODIS data, and the bias range of the 11 mu m and 12 mu m channels was -0.0214-0.0119 K and the Std was <1.2987 K. These results indicate that the quality of the MERSI-II data is comparable to that of the MODIS data, so that can be used for application to IST inversion. When using the MERSI thermal infrared T-b data after calibration to retrieve the IST, the results of the MERSI and MODIS IST were more consistent. By comparing the IST retrieved from the MERSI thermal infrared calibrated T-b data with MODIS MYD29 product, the mean bias was -0.0612-0.0423 degrees C and the Std was T-b data after calibration is better than that before calibration for retrieving the IST. When comparing the Arctic ocean sea and ice surface temperature reprocessed data (L4 SST/IST) with the IST data retrieved from MERSI, the bias was 0.9891-2.7510 degrees C, and the Std was <3.5774 degrees C.

TI  - Application of Spatially Distributed Calibrated Hydrological Model in Evapotranspiration Simulation of Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China: A Case Study in the Madu River Basin
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the key to the water cycle process and an important factor for studying near-surface water and heat balance. Accurately estimating ET is significant for hydrology, meteorology, ecology, agriculture, etc. This paper simulates ET in the Madu River Basin of Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China during 2009-2018 based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, which was calibrated and validated using the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)/Terra Net ET 8-Day L4 Global 500 m SIN Grid (MOD16A2) dataset and measured ET. Two calibration strategies (lumped calibration (LC) and spatially distributed calibration (SDC)) were used. The basin was divided into 34 sub-basins, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of each sub-basin were greater than 0.6 in both the calibration and validation periods. The R-2 and NSE were higher in the validation period than those in the calibration period. Compared with the measured ET, the accuracy of the model on the daily scale is: R-2 = 0.704 and NSE = 0.759 (SDC results). The model simulation accuracy of LC and SDC for the sub-basin scale was R-2 = 0.857, R-2 = 0.862 (monthly) and R-2 = 0.227, R-2 = 0.404 (annually), respectively; for the whole basin scale was R-2 = 0.902, R-2 = 0.900 (monthly) and R-2 = 0.507 and R-2 = 0.519 (annually), respectively. The model performed acceptably, and SDC performed the best, indicating that remote sensing data can be used for SWAT model calibration. During 2009-2018, ET generally increased in the Madu River Basin (SDC results, 7.21 mm/yr), with a multiyear average value of 734.37 mm/yr. The annual ET change rate for the sub-basin was relatively low upstream and downstream. The linear correlation analysis between ET and meteorological factors shows that on the monthly scale, precipitation, solar radiation and daily maximum and minimum temperature were significantly correlated with ET; annually, solar radiation and wind speed had a moderate correlation with ET. The correlation between maximum temperature and ET is best on the monthly scale (Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.945), which may means that the increasing ET originating from increasing temperature (global warming). However, the sub-basins near Shennongjia Nature Reserve that are in upstream have a negative ET change rate, which means that ET decreases in these sub-basins, indicating that the 'Evaporation Paradox' exists in these sub-basins. This study explored the potential of remote-sensing-based ET data for hydrological model calibration and provides a decision-making reference for water resource management in the Madu River Basin.

TI  - Assessments of the Above-Ocean Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Detection Capability of the GAS Instrument Onboard the Next-Generation FengYun-3H Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The next-generation FengYun-3H satellite carrying a greenhouse gas absorption spectrometer (GAS) is planned for launch by 2024 with a strengthened ability to help researchers understand the global carbon cycle. However, assessments of the atmospheric CO2-detection capabilities of GAS are still incomplete, mainly in the following aspects: previous studies on the spectral range of GAS instruments often used the weak absorption band of CO2 molecules (1.61 mu m); research on the measurement accuracies of different atmospheric environments above oceans is lacking; and most studies considered land surfaces as the bottom boundaries. Here, we simulated high spectral CO2 absorption spectra in both the strong and weak bands (2.06 and 1.61 mu m) while considering the effects of different instrumental (spectral resolution and sampling rate) and environmental (wind speed, visibility, and rough sea surface) parameters. This is the first atmospheric CO2 absorption spectrum study to consider rough-sea-surface effects. The preliminary results show that the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute difference (MAD) values of the atmospheric CO2 transmittance spectra of GAS are 0.031 and 0.011, respectively, in the 1.61 mu m band and 0.05 and 0.033 in the 2.06 mu m band, revealing that GAS is competitive among similar CO2 instruments. This study provides a design reference for next-generation GAS instruments and contributes to spectral data CO2 processing in the above-sea atmosphere.

TI  - All-Weather and Superpixel Water Extraction Methods Based on Multisource Remote Sensing Data Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spatial and temporal resolution of water body data offers valuable guidance for disaster monitoring and assessment. These data can be employed to quickly identify water bodies, especially small water bodies, and to accurately locate affected areas, which is significant for protecting people's lives and property. However, the application of optical remote sensing is often limited by clouds and fog during actual floods. In this paper, water extraction methods of the multisource data fusion model (MDFM) and superpixel water extraction model (SWEM) are proposed, in which the MDFM fuses optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and all-weather water extraction is achieved by using spectral information of optical images, texture information and the good penetration performance of SAR images. The SWEM further improves the accuracy of the water boundary with superpixel decomposition for extracted water boundaries using the fully constrained least squares (FCLS) method. The results show that the correlation coefficient (r) and area accuracy (P-area) of the MDFM and SWEM are improved by 2.22% and 9.20% (without clouds), respectively, and 3.61% and 18.99% (with clouds), respectively, compared with the MDFM, and 41.54% and 85.09% (without clouds), respectively, and 32.31% and 84.31% (with clouds), respectively, compared with the global surface water product of the European Commission Joint Research Centre's Global Surface Water Explorer (JRC-GSWE). The MDFM and SWEM can extract water bodies with all weather and superpixel and improve the temporal and spatial resolution of water extraction, which has obvious advantages.

TI  - Possible Mechanism of Phytoplankton Blooms at the Sea Surface after Tropical Cyclones
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although previous studies have recorded that tropical cyclones cause a significant increase in chlorophyll a concentration (Chl-a), most of these results were only based on surface Chl-a observed by satellite data. Using satellite, reanalysis and model data, this study investigated the response of the upper ocean and sea surface Chl-a to three different levels of tropical cyclones in the South China Sea. In our results, the severe tropical storm (STS) did not cause an increase in surface Chl-a or depth-integrated Chl-a in the short term (i.e., similar to 2 days); the typhoon (TY) increased the surface Chl-a from 0.12 mg center dot m(-3) to 0.15 mg center dot m(-3) in the short term, but the depth-integrated Chl-a did not increase significantly; the super typhoon (STY) caused the surface Chl-a to increase from 0.15 mg center dot m(-3) to 0.37 mg center dot m(-3) in the short term, and also increased the depth-integrated Chl-a from 40.41 mg center dot m(-2) to 42.59 mg center dot m(-2). These results suggest that the increase in the surface Chl-a after TY and STY were primarily caused by physical processes (e.g., vertical mixing). However, the increase in the depth-integrated Chl-a of STY may be due to the entrainment of both nutrients and phytoplankton through upwelling and turbulent mixing under the influence of STY.

TI  - Spatiotemporal image fusion using multiscale attention-aware two-stream convolutional neural networks
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) is considered as a promising way to produce remote sensing images at fine scales in both space and time by blending two types of satellite images. The learning-based STF approaches with deep convolutional neural networks can provide the unified framework to address both gradual and abrupt changes. This paper intends to develop an enhanced learning-based STF using multiscale attention-aware two-stream convolutional neural networks (MACNN). With a coarse image at the prediction date and two pairs of coarse and fine images at other dates as inputs, it employs a multiscale module to characterize different sizes of objects and a spatial and channel attention module to emphasize important information in feature learning. Two experiments on real Landsat and MODIS images are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MACNN and it outperforms four existing STF methods in both visual and quantitative.

TI  - Remote-Sensing Drought Monitoring in Sichuan Province from 2001 to 2020 Based on MODIS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, four drought monitoring indices were selected to simulate drought monitoring in the study area and a correlation analysis was conducted using the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Index (sc-PDSI) to screen for the most suitable drought monitoring index for the study area. Then, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of drought in the study area were discussed and analyzed. The results showed that the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) was most suitable for drought monitoring in the Sichuan Province. CWSI had the best monitoring in grasslands (r = 0.48), the worst monitoring in woodlands (r = 0.43) and the highest fitting degree of overall correlation (r = 0.47). The variation of drought time in the Sichuan Province showed an overall trend of wetting and the drought situation was greatly alleviated. In the past 20 years, the dry years in the Sichuan Province were from 2001 to 2007, in which the driest years were 2006 and 2007; 2012-2013 was the transition interval between drought and wet; any year from 2013 to 2020 was a wet year, showing a transition trend of "drought first and then wet". The spatial distribution of drought was greater in the south than in the north and greater in the west than in the east. Panzhihua City and the southern part of the Liangshan Prefecture were the most arid areas, while the non-arid areas were the border zone between the western Sichuan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin. Looking at the spatial distribution of drought, "mild drought" accounted for the largest percentage of the total area (60%), mainly concentrated in the western Sichuan plateau. The second largest was "drought free" (33%), mostly concentrated in the transition area between the western Sichuan Plateau and the Sichuan Basin (western Aba Prefecture, Ya'an City, Leshan City and northern Liangshan Prefecture). The area of "moderate drought" accounted for a relatively small proportion (6%), mainly concentrated in Panzhihua City, the surrounding areas of Chengdu City and the southern area of the Liangshan Prefecture. The area of severe drought accounted for the least (1%), mostly distributed in Panzhihua City and a small part in the southern Liangshan Prefecture. The drought center ranged from 101.8 degrees E to 103.6 degrees E and 28.8 degrees N to 29.8 degrees N, with the movement trend of the drought center moving from the northeast to the southwest to the northeast.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Seaweed Aquaculture along the Jiangsu Coast of China Using Google Earth Engine (2016-2022)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seaweed aquaculture produces enormous economic and ecological service benefits, making significant contributions to achieving global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, large-scale development of seaweed aquaculture and the unreasonable use of aquaculture rafts may trigger green tide, bringing negative ecological, social, and economic impacts. Therefore, it is vital to monitor the seaweed aquaculture industry accurately. Here, we mapped 10-m-resolution seaweed aquaculture along the Jiangsu coast of China based on active and passive remote sensing (Sentinel-1/2) and Random Forest using Google Earth Engine. The results demonstrate satisfactory model performance and data accuracy. The square seaweed aquaculture in the Lianyungang Offshore (Mode-I) has gradually expanded to the deep sea since 2016, with a maximum area of 194.06 km(2) in 2018. Between 2021 and 2022, the area of the strip-shaped seaweed aquaculture in Subei radiation shoals (Mode-II) was considerably reduced, with most of the reduced land lying on the east side of the Dafeng Elk National Nature Reserve. In general, the area of the seaweed aquaculture in the prohibited breeding area was reduced from 20.32 km(2) to 3.13 km(2), and the area of the seaweed aquaculture in the restricted breeding area was reduced from 149.71 km(2) to 33.15 km(2). Results show that under the policy restriction, the scale of unsustainable seaweed aquaculture along the Jiangsu coast has been greatly reduced within seven years. This study can provide an efficient approach for the medium-scale extraction of seaweed aquaculture and provide decision support for the sustainable development of marine aquaculture.

TI  - Geospatial measurement of urban sprawl using multi-temporal datasets from 1991 to 2021: case studies of four Indian medium-sized cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, medium-sized Indian cities have experienced accelerated urban growth due to the saturation of large cities. Such rapid urban growth combined with inadequate urban planning has triggered urban sprawl in medium-sized Indian cities. In this context, the present study focuses on the geospatial measurement of urban sprawl in four rapidly expanding Indian medium-sized cities located in diverse physiographic regions, such as Lucknow urban agglomeration (UA), Bhubaneswar UA, Raipur UA, and Dehradun UA. Multi-temporal Landsat imageries from 1991 to 2021 were downloaded for land cover classification through the maximum likelihood classification tool in ArcGIS 10.3. Thereafter, spatiotemporal land cover change detection was performed based on the classified land cover maps. The presence of urban sprawl was detected using the relative entropy index while the urban expansion index quantified the urban sprawl typologies such as edge expansion, leapfrog development, and ribbon development. The results exhibited a rapid rise in built-up land cover from 1991 to 2021. The prevalence of urban sprawl was detected in all four cities as per the relative entropy index. Edge expansion typology of urban sprawl was dominant compared to leapfrog development and ribbon development. Such urban growth phenomenon creates a hindrance in promoting sustainable urban development in medium-sized Indian cities. The results obtained from this paper would assist urban planners and policymakers in developing strategies to encourage planned urban growth. This paper exhibits the potential of geoinformatics to monitor and analyze urban sprawl.

TI  - Limits to Sinocentrism: Persistence of Nativist Discourses of Identity in Joseon Korea
T2  - SEOUL JOURNAL OF KOREAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decades, scholars have examined the far-reaching legacy of the Mongol empire in transforming the cultures of the countries it ruled. Aiming to recreate the Mongol world-empire, the early Ming rulers sought to incorporate neighboring polities into a reinvigorated Sinocentric system. In Korea, elites no longer saw themselves occupying an independent imperial sphere, as they did before the Mongol subjugation. They reportedly internalized the Sinocentric worldview and Korea's predetermined second-rate position. But internalizing the Sinocentric worldview did not mean that the Koreans of Joseon imagined or governed their country only as a vassal of the Chinese empire or entirely forgot about the nativist identity that existed before the Mongol subjugation. This article aims to reveal some of the nativist discourses of identity from Goryeo that survived into Joseon. Positioning Korea as a "rival" of China, these nativist discourses argued that the Korean Peninsula in some ways paralleled China as a geographical entity and that the Joseon people's ancestors "defeated" the unified empires of Sui and Tang China on the battlefields. This article argues that the Joseon acceptance of Sinocentrism was far from total, and a sense of Korea as an independent geopolitical entity survived Korea's formal subservience to Beijing.

TI  - Surface Water Area Extraction by Using Water Indices and DFPS Method Applied to Satellites Data
T2  - SENSING AND IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagesare usedto extract and calculate surface water area and water resource features accurately. Water index and optimum threshold methods are essential for the extraction of surface water area. Various water indices have been developed during the past two decades, such as Normalized difference water index (NDWI), Modified normalized difference water index, Automated Water Extraction Index for shadow and non-shadow, Water Ration Index (WRI) and Normalized difference vegetation index. With application of each of these indices, the surface water area can be extracted by applying the respective threshold values for the indices and computed areas. The present study focuses on the comparing the accuracy of surface water area extraction for respective water indices and obtaining an optimal threshold value to separate water and other features from output images of indices using a Semi-automatic double-window flexible pace search (DFPS) method. The surface water areas of the Kaylana Lake (at Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India)have been extracted for different years with above stated indices and further compared with the extracted values by applying the polygon method on historical images received from Google Earth. The extracted surface water areas with polygon method on historical Google Earth images are 0.88 km(2), 0.74 km(2), 1.22 km(2), 0.67 km(2)and 1.00 km(2)for the years 2002, 2008, 2010, 2015, 2019 respectively. The comparison of extracted output results using different indices clearly indicates that the Semi-Automatic DFPS method is the best method to obtain optimum threshold value and to classified water indices output. The final comparison of outputs of indices also shows that overall NDWI provided much better surface water area output results. This study method identifies water bodies using Landsat TM, Lansat ETM + , Landsat OLI, and Sentinel-2A imagery with high accuracy by using NDWI water index and DFPS optimum threshold calculation method.

TI  - Building Change Detection Based on a Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recovery phase following an earthquake event is essential for urban areas with a significant number of damaged buildings. A lot of changes can take place in such a landscape within the buildings' footprints, such as total or partial collapses, debris removal and reconstruction. Remote sensing data and methodologies can considerably contribute to site monitoring. The main objective of this paper is the change detection of the building stock in the settlement of Vrissa on Lesvos Island during the recovery phase after the catastrophic earthquake of 12 June 2017, through the analysis and processing of UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) images and the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). More specifically, change detection of the settlement's building stock by applying an ANN on Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features of orthophotomaps acquired by UAVs was performed. For the training of the ANN, a number of GLCM texture features were defined as the independent variable, while the existence or not of structural changes in the buildings were defined as the dependent variable, assigning, respectively, the values 1 or 0 (binary classification). The ANN was trained based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and its ability to detect changes was evaluated on the basis of the buildings' condition, as derived from the binary classification. In conclusion, the GLCM texture feature changes in conjunction with the ANN can provide satisfactory results in predicting the structural changes of buildings with an accuracy of almost 92%.

TI  - Study of the Spatiotemporal Variability of Oceanographic Parameters and Their Relationship to <i>Holothuria</i> Species Abundance in a Marine Protected Area of the Mediterranean Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine protected areas (MPAs) are designated to protect marine ecosystems and, among other things, to monitor climate variability, which in turn affects aquatic species. The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of remotely sensed data as an indication of Holothuria abundance, by investigating the spatiotemporal variability of physicochemical parameters. The study area is in the National Marine Park of Alonissos Northern Sporades, which is included in the NATURA 2000 network. Firstly, the abundance of Holothuria species was measured by scuba diving. At the same time, depth profiles of five physicochemical parameters (temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen and Chl-a) were recorded by CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth), a primary instrument used to determine the essential physical and chemicals properties of seawater column profiles in the coastal zone. The physicochemical variables examined are the most common environmental parameters with the highest impact on growth, reproduction, productivity and survival rate of sea cucumber species, affecting the availability of food sources. Analysis of this data allows us to identify parameters which are essential for their existence. The analysis showed that only temperature and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) could be useful for identifying the abundance. These two parameters are readily available from satellite data. Additionally, particulate organic carbon (POC) is essential for Holothuria's existence. Consequently, a time series of satellite data products from Terra/MODIS sensor were utilized from 2000 to 2020 for sea surface temperature (SST), Chl-a and POC. The monthly temporal trend shows that the abundance could be justified in areas where the Holothuria presence has been established. Monthly spatiotemporal analysis shows that SST, Chl-a and POC availability, could be an indication of the differences in abundance recorded.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Distribution Characteristics of Lightning Activity over the Pacific Ocean and Adjacent Land and Its Relationship with AOD and CAPE
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on LIS / OTD gridded lightning climatology data, ERA5 reanalysis data, and MODIS atmosphere monthly global products, we examined latitudinal and daily variations of lightning activity over land, offshore areas, open sea, and all marine areas (i.e., the aggregate of open sea and offshore areas) for different seasons over the Pacific Ocean and the adjacent land areas at 65 degrees N-50 degrees S, 99 degrees E-78 degrees W, and analysed the relationships of lightning activity with CAPE (Convective Available Potential Energy) and AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth). At any given latitude, the lightning density is the highest over land, followed by offshore areas, all marine areas and the open sea in sequence. The lightning density over land is approximately an order of magnitude greater than that over all marine areas. Lightning activity over land, offshore areas, open sea, and all marine areas varies with season. The diurnal variation of lightning density over land has a single-peak pattern. Over the offshore area, open sea, and all marine areas, lightning densities have two maxima per day. The magnitude of the daily variation in mean lightning density is the largest over land and the smallest over the open sea. The lightning density over the Pacific Ocean and adjacent land areas is significantly and positively correlated with CAPE. The correlation is the strongest over land and the weakest over the open sea. Cloud Base Height (CBH) may affect the efficiency of CAPE conversion to updraft. CAPE has a positive effect on lightning activity and has a greater impact on land than on the ocean. Over the sea, both CAPE and AOD can contribute to lightning activity, but the magnitudes of the influence of CAPE and AOD on lightning activity remain to be determined. Lightning activity over land and sea is a result of the combined action of AOD and CAPE.

TI  - State of neutrality in land degradation in the Chaco Salteno between 2001 and 2018
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for the fulfillment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), SDG 15 promotes "Life on land", and Target 15.3 focuses on achieving land degradation neutrality (LDN). This work is focused on the Chaco Salteno region and the semi-arid Chaco pilot site in the province of Salta, Argentina (SPChS). The objectives are 1) to assess the state of LDN in the Chaco Salteno region and in the SPChS between 2001 and 2018, and 2) to determine the structural variables of the vegetation and physical-chemical properties of the soil at a local scale that can be used to complement the LDN evaluation. To evaluate the status of LDN, the indicators of changes in land cover and in aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) were calculated, based on the coverage maps of the MapBiomas Chaco Project -Collection 2.0 and MODIS biweekly products (MOD 13Q1, annual). To explore the relationship between ANPP with the vegetation and soil variables, a correlation analysis was performed. We found that 14.3% of the Chaco Salteno region experienced negative changes in coverage and 20.8% losses in ANPP associated mainly with the transition from areas with native forests to crops. Meanwhile, in the SPChS, these changes represent a low extension of the surface. The ANPP correlated significantly and positively, in particular, with vegetation cover, organic matter and aggregate stability, so these variables could be used as complementary indicators in the evaluation of LDN at a local scale. Finally, the results of this research constitute a first frame of reference to articulate priorities in the planning of LDN interventions in the Chaco Salteno region, and particularly in the SPChS.

TI  - On Sea-Level Change in Coastal Areas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in sea-level, based on tide gauge data (GSLTG) and on combining tide gauges and satellite data (GSLl), are subjected to singular spectrum analysis (SSA) to determine their trends and periodic or quasi-periodic components. GLSTG increases by 90 mm from 1860 to 2020, a contribution of 0.56 mm/yr to the mean rise rate. Annual to multi-decadal periods of similar to 90/80, 60, 30, 20, 10/11, and 4/5 years are found in both GSLTG and GSLl. These periods are commensurable periods of the Jovian planets, combinations of the periods of Neptune (165 yr), Uranus (84 yr), Saturn (29 yr) and Jupiter (12 yr). These same periods are encountered in sea-level changes, the motion of the rotation pole RP and evolution of global pressure GP, suggesting physical links. The first SSA components comprise most of the signal variance: 95% for GSLTG, 89% for GSLl, 98% for GP and 75% for RP. Laplace derived the Liouville-Euler equations that govern the rotation and translation of the rotation axis of any celestial body. He emphasized that one must consider the orbital kinetic moments of all planets in addition to gravitational attractions and concluded that the Earth's rotation axis should undergo motions that carry the combinations of periods of the Sun, Moon and planets. Almost all the periods found in the SSA components of sea-level (GSLl and GSLTG), global pressure (GP) and polar motion (RP), of their modulations and their derivatives can be associated with the Jovian planets. The trends themselves could be segments of components with still longer periodicities (e.g., 175 yr Jose cycle).

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewMelioidosis and its causative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei are being found in unexpected locations and bacterial genotyping is providing new insights into global spread and where and how individuals are being infected. This review summarizes recent studies covering the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of melioidosis.Recent findingsWhole-genome sequencing of B. pseudomallei from patients and environmental sampling is informing the phylogeography of B. pseudomallei at regional, continental, and global levels, while also defining the epidemiology for individual cases. The situation in Africa remains the most unresolved, while the evolving story of B. pseudomallei in the Americas may establish that B. pseudomallei is endemic in parts of southern USA. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of melioidosis are well established, and published mortality has decreased from 50% or higher to 10% or lower in some countries but access to laboratory and therapeutic resources are not available or are extremely limited in many melioidosis-endemic regions.The enormous clinical diversity of melioidosis and the complexities of laboratory diagnosis and of treatment make it a sentinel disease for highlighting the continuing global disparities in access to and provision of healthcare.

TI  - Effects of Mining on Urban Environmental Change: A Case Study of Panzhihua
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The environment supplies water, land, biological resources, and climate resources for people's daily life and development, dramatically affecting the subsistence and development of human beings. Panzhihua City is a representative resource-based industrial city of southwestern China. The abundant mineral resources provide the material basis for the city's development. However, while the overdevelopment of the past decades has provided the preconditions for its rapid economic growth, it has also inevitably had a huge impact on its environmental quality and land use structure. In this study, the landsat remote sensing images, terrain data, socio-economic data, and mining resources exploitation data of Panzhihua were used to extract the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NDBSI (Normalized Difference Build and Soil Index) and LST (Land Surface Temperature) of the past 20 years at 5-year intervals. We normalized four indicators by Principal Component Analysis to derive a remote sensing ecological index of each factor and build the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index evaluation model. This research quantified the changes in environmental quality in the past 20 years through the range method, showing that the environmental quality of Panzhihua City first declined and then increased slowly. This research also analyzed the influence of land use types, terrain, mining area, and socio-economy on the environmental quality of Panzhihua City by grey relational analysis and buffer analysis. It is found that with the influence of its unique topographical factors and economic aspects, the environmental quality of Panzhihua City changed to varying degrees. The results provide a reliable basis for the future environmental planning of Panzhihua City and a reference for the ecological restoration of mining areas with different mineral species accurately.

TI  - SAR Observation of Waves under Ice in the Marginal Ice Zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The marginal ice zone (MIZ) connects the open ocean and the pack ice, playing significant roles in shaping the ice edge and wave-ice interaction. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been demonstrated to be one of the most advantageous sensors for MIZ exploration given its capability to collect images under all weather conditions during day and night. In this study, we take advantage of the Sentinel-1 wave mode vignettes acquired around the Antarctic to quantify the image properties over MIZ. A data set of SAR images covering the ice edge with both open water and sea ice present in the same scene was created by manual inspection. It is found that the radar return over sea ice decreases by an average of approximately 1.78 dB in comparison to its adjacent open water, which is roughly independent of the polarizations and incidence angles. The long ocean waves are barely attenuated right across the ice edge in terms of their comparable azimuth cutoff. Further inside the ice from the edge, the waves are gradually dampened out at distances associated with their wavelengths. The results obtained in this study shall help interpret the radar scattering model validation as well as the wave-ice interaction.

TI  - Early Detection of the Start of the Influenza Epidemic Using Surveillance Systems in Catalonia (PREVIGrip Study)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel physician networks are the method of influenza surveillance recommended by the World Health Organization. Weekly clinical diagnoses based on clinical history are a surveillance method that provides more immediate information. The objective of this study is to evaluate which influenza surveillance system is capable of the earliest detection of the start of the annual influenza epidemic. We carried out an ecological time-series study based on influenza data from the population of Catalonia from the 2010-2011 to the 2018-2019 seasons. Rates of clinical diagnoses and of confirmed cases in Catalonia were used to study the changes in trends in the different surveillance systems, the differences in area and time lag between the curves of the different surveillance systems using Joinpoint regression, Simpson's 1/3 method and cross-correlation, respectively. In general, changes in the trend of the curves were detected before the beginning of the epidemic in most seasons, using the rates for the complete seasons and the pre-epidemic rates. No time lag was observed between clinical diagnoses and the total confirmed cases. Therefore, clinical diagnoses in Primary Care could be a useful tool for early detection of the start of influenza epidemics in Catalonia.

TI  - A Novel Method for Estimating Biomass and Carbon Sequestration in Tropical Rainforest Areas Based on Remote Sensing Imagery: A Case Study in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau, Vietnam
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a key role in sustaining life on this planet, given their functions in carbon storage, oxygen production, and the water cycle. To date, calculations of the biomass and carbon absorption capacity of forest ecosystems-especially tropical rainforests-have been quite limited, especially in Vietnam. By applying remote sensing materials, geographic information systems (GIS) facilitate the synchronized estimation of both biomass and ability of forest ecosystems to absorb carbon over large spatial ranges. In this study, we calculated the biomass of tropical rainforest vegetation in the Kon Ha Nung Plateau, Vietnam, according to four regression models based on Sentinel-2 satellite image data, forest reserve maps, and forest survey standard cell data (including 19 standard cells for 2016 and 44 standard cells for 2021). The results of the data comparison for the four biomass computing models (log-log, log-lin, lin-log, and lin-lin) demonstrated that the models with the highest accuracy were the lin-log model for 2016 (with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.76) and the lin-log model for 2021 (with a correlation coefficient of R-2 = 0.765). Based on the analytical results and the selection of biomass estimation models, biomass maps were developed for the Kon Ha Nung Plateau area, Vietnam, in 2016 and 2021, with a predominant biomass value of 80-180 tons/ha (Mg/ha); furthermore, biomass fluctuations were analyzed for the period 2016-2021. Accordingly, the ability to absorb carbon and CO2 equivalents in this research area for 2016 and 2021 was calculated based on the estimated biomass values. In summary, we present a method for estimating biomass via four basic linear regression models for tropical rainforest areas based on satellite image data. This method can serve as a basis for managers to calculate and synchronize the payment of carbon services, which contributes to promoting the livelihoods of local people.

TI  - Prevalence of Depression and Predictors of Discharge to a Psychiatric Hospital in Young People with Hospital-Treated Deliberate Self-Poisoning at an Australian Sentinel Unit
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Hospital treated deliberate self-poisoning is common in young people. Internationally, estimates of rates of depression in this population are very wide (14.6% to 88%). The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of depression and the independent predictors of referral for psychiatric hospitalisation in young people (aged 16 to 25 years) following an index episode of hospital treated deliberate self-poisoning. Method: A retrospective cohort study design (n = 1410), with data drawn from a population-based clinical case register. Unadjusted and adjusted estimates of predictors of referral for psychiatric admission (after-care) used logistic regression models. Results: Prevalence of any depression diagnosis was 35.5% (n = 500); and 25.4% (n = 358) were referred for a psychiatric admission. The adjusted estimates for predictors of psychiatric inpatient referral were: high suicidal level (OR 118.21: CI 95% 63.23-220.99), low/moderate suicidal level (14.27: 9.38-21.72), any depression (2.88: 1.97-4.22), any psychosis (4.06; 1.15-14.36), older age (1.12: 1.04-1.21), and number of support people (0.88: 0.78-0.98). Conclusion: Depression was diagnosed in more than a third and was an independent predictor of psychiatric inpatient referral, so service providers need to account for this level of need in the provision of assessment and after-care services. Evidence-based guidelines for psychiatric inpatient after-care for deliberate self-poisoning and/or depression in young people are limited. Our explanatory model included suicidal level, depression, psychosis, older age, and available support persons, suggesting that the treating clinicians were making these discharge decisions for admission in keeping with those limited guidelines, although the balance of benefits and harms of psychiatric hospitalisation are not established. Future research examining patient experiences, effectiveness of psychiatric hospitalisation, and alternatives to hospitalisation is warranted.

TI  - Sub-Decimeter Onboard Orbit Determination of LEO Satellites Using SSR Corrections: A Galileo-Based Case Study for the Sentinel-6A Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In GNSS-based navigation onboard Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, typical accuracy requirements are 10 cm and 0.1 mm/s for 3D position and velocity, respectively. Previous works have shown that such performance is achieved by including Galileo measurements in the estimation process. Here, we aim to evaluate the impact of employing State Space Representation (SSR) corrections, i.e., GNSS satellite orbit, clock, and biases, to be applied to the broadcast ephemerides. In this framework, the Precise Onboard Orbit Determination (P2OD) software (SW) tool developed at the University of Padua (UNIPD) is used to investigate the needs of onboard navigation. The UNIPD SW employs an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) using a reduced-dynamics approach. The force model implemented is adapted to onboard processing, and empirical accelerations are included to take into account residual force mismodeling. Actual observation data from the LEO Sentinel-6A satellite are processed along with SSR corrections from the CNES service. Galileo-based solutions are compared to ground-based POD reference orbits. The analysis suggests that the use of SSR corrections provides sub-decimeter and below 0.1 mm/s accuracies in 3D position and velocity, respectively. Such results indicate a P2OD solution quality close to that achievable by adopting precise orbits and clocks.

TI  - Estimating Coffee Plant Yield Based on Multispectral Images and Machine Learning Models
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coffee plant is one of the main crops grown in Brazil. However, strategies to estimate its yield are questionable given the characteristics of this crop; in this context, robust techniques, such as those based on machine learning, may be an alternative. Thus, the aim of the present study was to estimate the yield of a coffee crop using multispectral images and machine learning algorithms. Yield data from a same study area in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Sentinel 2 images, Random Forest (RF) algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Linear Regression (LR) were used. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the absolute Pearson correlation and coefficient of determination values. The Sentinel 2 satellite images proved to be favorable in estimating coffee yield. Despite the low spatial resolution in estimating agricultural variables below the canopy, the presence of specific bands such as the red edge, mid infrared and the derived vegetation indices, act as a countermeasure. The results show that the blue band and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) exhibit greater correlation with yield. The NN algorithm performed best and was capable of estimating yield with 23% RMSE, 20% MAPE and R-2 0.82 using 85% of the training and 15% of the validation data of the algorithm. The NN algorithm was also more accurate (27% RMSE) in predicting yield.

TI  - Mosquito Fauna and Spatial Distribution in an Atlantic Forest Area in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, Reveal a High Risk of Transmission of Yellow Fever and Other Arboviruses
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2017-2019, Brazil recorded its most severe outbreak of yellow fever due to the spread of the virus (YFV) in the country's southeast. Here, we investigated mosquito fauna and the spatial distribution of species in a primatology center in the Atlantic Forest bioregion in Rio de Janeiro state to evaluate the risk of YFV transmission in distinct environments. Fortnightly mosquito collections were performed from December 2018 to December 2019 at 12 sites along a disturbance gradient from a modified environment to 400 m inside the forest. We used ovitraps, BG-Sentinel, and protected human attraction (PHA). A total of 9349 mosquitoes of 21 species were collected. The collection method strongly influenced the captured fauna, with species such as Anopheles cruzii, Psorophora ferox, Runchomyia cerqueirai, Wyeomyia incaudata, Wy. theobaldi, Sabethes chloropterus, and Sa. albiprivus only collected via PHA. Collections with ovitraps resulted in low diversity and richness, with Haemagogus leucocelaenus and Hg. janthinomys/capricornii predominating. The diverse local fauna and the abundance and ubiquity of the latter species, which are the primary vectors of YFV, indicated that this area was highly vulnerable to arbovirus transmission, especially yellow fever, highlighting the need for improved surveillance and vaccination coverage in human and captive endangered non-human primates.

TI  - Estimation of Water Use in Center Pivot Irrigation Using Evapotranspiration Time Series Derived by Landsat: A Study Case in a Southeastern Region of the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, irrigated agriculture is responsible for 46% of withdrawals of water bodies and 67% of use concerning the total water abstracted volume, representing the most significant consumptive use in the country. Understanding how different crops use water over time is essential for planning and managing water allocation, water rights, and farming production. In this work, we propose a methodology to estimate water used in agriculture irrigated by center pivots in the municipality of Itobi, Sao Paulo, in the Brazilian Savanna (known as Cerrado), which has strong potential for agricultural and livestock production. The methodology proposed for the water use estimate is based on mapping crops irrigated by center pivots for the 2015/2016 crop year and actual evapotranspiration (ETa). ETa is derived from the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance model (SSEBop) and parameterized for edaphoclimatic conditions in Brazil (SSEBop-Br). Three meteorological data sources (INMET, GLDAS, CFSv2) were tested for estimating ETa. The water use was estimated for each meteorological data source, relating the average irrigation balance and the total area for each crop identified in the map. We evaluated the models for each crop present in the center pivots through global accuracy and f1-score metrics, and f1-score was more significant than 0.9 for all crops. The potato was the crop that consumed the most water in irrigation, followed by soy crops, beans, carrots, and onions, considering the three meteorological data sources. The total water volume consumed by center pivots in the municipality of Itobi in the 2015/2016 agricultural year for each meteorological data source was 3.2 million m(3) (INMET), 2.5 million m(3); (GLDAS), and 1.8 million m(3) (CFSv2).

TI  - Wetland Fire Assessment and Monitoring in the Parana River Delta, Using Radar and Optical Data for Burnt Area Mapping
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past decades, important research has been carried out to map the natural disturbances in the Parana River Delta. The benefits of the combined use optical and radar data are also known. The main objective of this paper is to assess the wetland fire cartography through a synergetic use of radar and optical data. We focus on integrating radar (SAOCOM) and Sentinel 1, as well as Sentinel 2 optical data, concerning the fires impact analyses in the wetland areas. The generation of water masks through the radar images can contribute to improve the burned wetland area estimations. The relationship between landforms, vegetation cover, and the spatial/temporal resolution imposed by the flood pulse, play a vital role in the results. Burnt areas represent a total of 2439.57 sq km, which is more than 85% of the wetland, during the winter and spring (Q3 and Q4) periods. Understanding the wetland heterogeneity and its recovery pattern after a fire, is crucial to improve the cartography of the burned areas; for this, biweekly or monthly image compositions periodicity are of crucial importance. The inclusion of different indexes, for optical and radar images, improve the precision for the final classification. The results obtained here are promising for post-flood and post-fire evaluation, even applying radar and optical data integration into the evaluation and the monitoring of wetland fires is far from being a uniform standardized process.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Intensity Changes in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China Revealed by Downscaling MODIS LST with Deep Learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect caused by urbanization negatively impacts the ecological environment and human health. It is crucial for urban planning and social development to monitor the urban heat island effect and study its mechanism. Due to spatial and temporal resolution limitations, existing land surface temperature (LST) data obtained from remote sensing data is challenging to meet the long-term fine-scale surface temperature mapping requirement. Given the above situation, this paper introduced the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method to make up for the data deficiency and applied it to the study of thermal environment change in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 2000 to 2020. The results showed (1) the ResNet-based surface temperature downscaling method achieves high accuracy (R-2 above 0.85) and is suitable for generating 30 m-resolution surface temperature data from 1 km data; (2) the area of severe heat islands in the GBA continued to increase, increasing by 7.13 times within 20 years; and (3) except for Hong Kong and Macau, the heat island intensity of most cities showed an apparent upward trend, especially the cities with rapid urban expansion such as Guangzhou, Zhongshan, and Foshan. In general, the evolution of the heat island in the GBA diverges from the central urban area to the surrounding areas, with a phenomenon of local aggregation and the area of the intense heat island in the Guangzhou-Foshan metropolitan area is the largest. This study can enrich the downscaling research methods of surface temperature products in complex areas with surface heterogeneity and provide a reference for urban spatial planning in the GBA.

TI  - Socio-cultural preconditions for the cult of aggression and destructive processes among young people
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-PRAVO-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the socio-cultural preconditions of the cult of aggression and destructive processes in the modern youth environment. The authors point out that the ongoing global hybrid war of information is using the levers of mass culture for its own purposes. The Internet has become one of its main spokespeople and its main advantage - the high speed of spontaneous dissemination of information. In essence, it is about the purposeful formation of a new type of terrorist by the ideologists of terrorist organizations through the distortion of consciousness and worldview. Further the authors specify the marked chronological sequence of application to Russian youth of technologies of management of masses from 2014 to 2021.Such technologies have been organically incorporated into mass Internet culture, not least because of the new ideal of young people - the anti-hero who challenges the system and destroys their enemies exclusively by force. In society today there is a desire for individualism, for isolation.Instead of critical analysis, cliched thinking, born and bred by a crisis of ideals, dominates today. An example is the now booming genre of superhero cinema. Bright heroes in equally bright and grotesque costumes battle some alien evil, destroying half of their own world along the way. It's a dumbing down of sensuality, a domination of form over content, a cliched shell that hides a reverse morality of permissiveness. And this is one of the tenets of terrorist movements and destructive ideologies.In order to confirm these theses, the authors conducted criminological research aimed at identifying the causes of the distortion of the moral image of modern society and moral categories in mass culture. The relationship between the moral values of individuals and their impact on the crime situation in society was studied.The study was conducted among teachers and students of the College of Altai State University. The respondents were also teachers from the Department of Criminal Law and Criminology at the Law Institute and the Department of Social Philosophy, Ontology and Theory of Knowledge at the Institute of Mass Communication, Philosophy and Political Science. A total of 330 respondents, aged 18-25 (students), 30-45 (teachers) were randomly sampled.The results confirmed the authors' hypothesis that the cult of power propagated by the mass media provoked a spontaneous social contamination, which was met by a surge of violent acts of a terrorist nature. Hybrid confrontation between states and uncontrolled, and often encouraged, terrorist activities in the digital sphere have given rise to an aggressive ideal of the hero of our time. Combating this triad requires a solid ideological basis in the anti-terrorist sphere, created through the joint efforts of the state and civil society institutions.

TI  - Root Cause Analysis in Nuclear Medicine for Sentinel Events
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A sentinel event is any unexpected event that results in death or serious physical or psychologic injury to a patient unrelated to a patient's illness. Establishing and determining cause-and-effect relationships are key to preventing future sentinel or near-miss events. However, it can be challenging to establish a cause-and-effect relationship when a process involves multiple steps or peo-ple. Root cause analysis (RCA) is a technique that can pinpoint the causes of sentinel events for medical procedures involving numerous steps and people. This article provides a rationale for RCA and the basic steps in a nonmedical RCA investigation. The article then describes a more detailed, 9-step, RCA approach for investigating sentinel events and illustrates the technique with a nuclear medicine example.

TI  - New saline wetlands in the dry agricultural plains of Argentina: how they are, where do they occur and what to do with them?
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decades and as a result of the rapid transformation of the terrestrial ecosystems, a new category called 'neo-ecosystems' has emerged. In the dry plains of Argentina, the agricultural expansion replacing forests, woodlands and natural grasslands has generated water surpluses at the regional scale. This water excess has favoured the development of neo-wetlands characterized by shallow water tables, frequent waterlogging and progressive salinization. In this work, we characterize these neo-ecosystems that spontaneously occupy these degraded environments by reviewing bibliography in the Dry Chaco-Espinal area and by taking the El Morro basin in the province of San Luis as a case of study. Through a temporal analysis of high-resolution images, we found that in the last 13 years, the neo-wetlands of the El Morro basin have tripled their extension, covering more than 15% of the lower basin, mainly in depressed areas of the landscape where salinization has been more widespread. These neo-wetlands showed lower NDVI-LANDSAT values than the surrounding forests (0.44 & PLUSMN;0.04 vs 0.35 & PLUSMN;0.09) but similar to the annual crops (neo-wetlands 0.35 & PLUSMN;0.09 and crops 0.37 & PLUSMN;0.13). Compared to the crops, the neo-wetlands presented longer growing seasons (241 & PLUSMN;54 days vs. 194 & PLUSMN;54 days, for neo-wetlands and crops, respectively), showing revegetation with saline tolerant species adapted to the new environment. Finally, we propose guidelines for the restoration and use of these neo-ecosystems in order to recover their functionality but also their ecological-productive value.

TI  - Cytology Smears: An Enhanced Alternative Method for Colorectal Cancer pN Stage-A Multicentre Study
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Recurrence of stage II (pT3-T4 pN0) colorectal cancer (CRC) occurs in about 15% of patients and it is often due to undetected lymph node (LN) metastases with conventional pathology haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) LN analysis. Despite more sensitive molecular methods of LN staging having proved to have prognostic value in stage II CRC, we aimed at determining whether the pN stage could be better assessed with LN cytology smears. We analysed 3936 LNs from 217 CRC surgical resections, using three methods, H&E, cytology smears, and the One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) molecular assay. We compared the pN stages obtained from both H&E and cytology, as well as with the OSNA results. We concluded that LN analysis with cytology smears not only enables performing the pN stage, but detects more LN metastases than H&E, with a similar detection rate to molecular methods. Cytology LN analysis would allow a better patient therapeutic management. Stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence remains a clinical problem. Some of these patients are true stage III CRC with a pN0 pathology stage. This large prospective multicentre cohort study aimed at evaluating the diagnostic ability of lymph node (LN) cytology smears to perform the pN stage and compare it with the conventional haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) pathology pN stage. Additionally, we used the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA), a high-sensitive molecular method of LN staging. A total of 3936 fresh LNs from 217 CRC surgical specimens were examined by three methods, H&E, LN cytology smears, and OSNA. H&E detected 29% of patients with positive LNs, cytology smears 35%, and OSNA 33.2% (p < 0.0001). H&E and cytology concordantly classified 92.2% of tumours, and 88.5% between OSNA and H&E. Cytology had 96.8% sensitivity and 90.3% specificity to discriminate positive/negative patients compared to H&E (p = 0.004), and 87.3% sensitivity and 89% specificity when compared to OSNA (p = 0.56). Patients with positive LNs detected by any of the three methods had significantly worse disease-free and overall survival. We conclude that pN stage accuracy for detecting positive LNs is superior with LN cytological smears than with conventional H&E, which would enable a better pN stage and management of early-stage CRC patients.

AB  - This article presents a medium-scale map of the forage areas of the Kaskakulan cluster area of the Barsakelmes Nature Reserve, where wild ungulates, kulans, saigas, and goitered gazelles, live. The map was designed using data from ground surveys and remote sensing. The author's technique and a set of spectral indices were used for processing satellite data. Maps of seasonal rangeland yields, which were considered when calculating the total yield, were designed based on the interpretation of space images. The legend to the Rangeland map is a system of headings that take into account zonality, ecological and physiognomic types of vegetation, and soil conditions. Types of rangelands are reflected in the legend by 15 numbers; for each the total yield for the seasons of the year is given. The map can be used to assess the grazing capacity of the territory and calculate the allowable number of wild ungulates to maintain ecosystems in a balanced state.

TI  - Urban Land-Cover Changes in Major Cities in China from 1990 to 2015
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerated urbanization process in China has led to land-cover changes, triggering a series of environmental issues as one of the major drivers of global change. We studied the land-cover changes in the built-up areas of 50 major cities in China from 1990 to 2015 with Landsat data combined with spectral unmixing methods and decision tree classification. The overall accuracy of urban land-cover type products with 30 m resolution was obtained as 84%, which includes impervious surfaces, bare soil, vegetation, and water bodies. Based on these land-cover type products, the results show that the urbanization of major cities in China manifests itself as a steep expansion of impervious surfaces (+32.91%) and vegetation (+36.93%), while the proportion of bare soil (-68.64%) and water bodies (-1.20%) decreases. The increase in vegetation indicates an increasing emphasis on greening during urbanization, which is especially vital for the sustainability of urban ecosystems. Increasing economic standards and population sizes are significantly correlated with impervious surface expansion and may be the main drivers of urbanization. Nationwide, there is a decreasing trend of shape complexity among different large cities, which indicates that landscape shapes will gradually become regular when cities grow to a certain level. Greenspace areas in the cities increased significantly during 1990-2015 and became more fragmented and tended to disperse across cities. These changes reflect the government's efforts to enhance urban ecosystem functions to serve the rapidly increasing urban population in China over the past three decades.

TI  - Postoperative Radiotherapy and the Role of Regional Lymph Node Irradiation in Localized Merkel Cell Carcinoma: A Single-Center Retrospective Analysis
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, malignant primary skin tumor with high rates of recurrence and stage adapted 5-year overall survival rates around 66-75% at stage I, 50-60% at stage II, 42-52% at stage III and 17-18% at stage IV. Wide local tumor excision is indicated for localized disease, usually followed by postoperative radiotherapy of the tumor bed. A positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is considered a poor prognostic factor, but the only randomized controlled trial on elective lymph node irradiation was in times before introduction of SLNB in MCC, hence the management of the regional lymph nodes with respect to SLNB is currently not clear. The aim of this study was to analyze the pattern of relapse of patients with MCC that underwent surgery and postoperative radiotherapy at our institution and to determine the role of elective radiotherapy to regional lymph nodes with respect to SLNB results. The aim of this study was to analyze the pattern of relapse of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) that underwent resection of the primary tumor site and postoperative radiotherapy at the Department of Radiation Oncology of Heidelberg University and to determine the role of the elective radiotherapy of regional lymph nodes with respect to SLNB results. A total of 57 patients were included in the present retrospective analysis. A total of 33 patients had additional lymph node irradiation (LNI); 24 had postoperative radiotherapy of the tumor bed only. Median follow-up was 43 months. Recurrence rate of the total cohort was 22.8%. Most relapses (69%) occurred in the regional nodes. Cumulative infield-tumor recurrence rate was low with 5.3%. Regional recurrence was more frequent in the cohort without LNI with 85.7% versus 37.5% with LNI. These results were similar for patients with negative sentinel lymph node (SLN) only with 80% regional relapses for those without LNI versus 33% with LNI. In conclusion, our data show that regional recurrence is the most frequent site of relapse in stage I-III MCC treated with curative intended postoperative radiotherapy and that elective irradiation of the regional lymph nodes reduces the risk of regional relapse even if the SLN was negative.

TI  - Remote Sensing Monitoring and Evaluation of Vegetation Changes in Hulun Buir Grassland, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Constantly increasing vegetation changes pose serious challenges to the sustainable use of global ecosystems. Thus, facing the increasingly serious climate and ecological environment problems and improving vegetation coverage is crucial to the sustainable development of the region. Along these lines, in this work, a monitoring model of vegetation cover change was proposed and developed by using Landsat TM (1989, 1999, and 2011) and Landsat OLI-TIRS (2021) data. More specifically, it was used to assess vegetation change. Based on this model, the vegetation change in the core area of Hulun Buir Grassland was systematically analyzed., From the acquired results, the existence of spatial differences in the vegetation coverage changes in the study area were demonstrated. The total area of vegetation coverage changes was 758.95 km(2), and the area from low vegetation coverage to high vegetation coverage was 456.41 km(2), accounting for 60.14% of the total change area. The area from high vegetation coverage to low vegetation coverage was 302.57 km(2), accounting for 39.86% of the total change area, whereas the area of the area without vegetation coverage was 1963.92 km(2), accounting for 72.13% of the study area, and the overall vegetation coverage is improving. Vegetation cover change monitoring models can also be used to reveal and describe large-scale vegetation landscape changes and obtain clear vegetation change results through easy-to-obtain data; our work suggests that in the process of pursuing regional economic development and accelerating urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural modernization, human beings should assume more responsibilities and pursue the sustainable development of the natural environment. The results of this work are of great importance to further study the potential driving mechanism of the vegetation coverage changes and provide theoretical guidance for relevant managers to formulate vegetation restoration measures.

TI  - Measuring Sand Dune Dynamics in the Badain Jaran Desert, China, Using Multitemporal Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Badain Jaran Desert (BJD) and surrounding deserts are the main sources of sand and dust storms in Asia. However, for complex factors, the descriptions of the sand dune dynamics in the BJD and investigations on the contribution of the BJD to the formation of the Tengger Desert (TD) and the Ulan Buh Desert (UBD) are lacking. We evaluated the performance of the discrete Fourier transform method in achieving subpixel precision when measuring the displacements of sand dunes in the BJD and surrounding deserts. This method was applied to Landsat 5/8 and 7 scan-line-corrector (SLC)-off/8 image pairs, respectively. The results show that it is a robust method in desert conditions without ground control points. Nineteen scenes of Landsat 5/8 were tested for estimating the movements of the BJD and surrounding areas. We found that the sand dunes moved eastward during 2004-2016. However, the dunes' movements showed different patterns in different parts of the desert. In the western BJD, the dunes moved at an average speed of 1-3 myr(-1), while in the southern and middle parts of the BJD, the dunes' speed was about 0.1-1 myr(-1). The fastest displacements of dunes were located in the northeastern BJD, and the mean speed was about 12 myr(-1). The sand fluxes in the two corridors between the BJD and the TD and UBD were estimated. The annual total amount of sand transported from the BJD to the TD through the main corridor was about 0.95 million tonnes, while that from the BJD to the UBD was about 2.24 million tonnes. The estimations of dune displacements and sand transport based on Landsat images in this study are important for understanding the dynamics of the BJD and surrounding areas.

TI  - Variety Vocal Art in the Context of Integration into Society of the Future
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urgency of the research is determined by the intensive development of new technologies as prospects for further development of society. Art accumulates intellectual, spiritual, material, and value heritage of previous epochs and determines the perspective features of the future. Vocal art is thereby one of the manifestations of individual ideological rethinking. Variety as a socio-cultural phenomenon combines different styles of music, genres, types, and aspects of professional music and vocal performance, which is important for the research in the context of social rethinking of future social development. Objective of the article is to determine specifics of pop vocal art, its long-term development as an aspect of integration into society of the future. The article reflects the essential characteristics of the concept of pop vocal art and worldview perception of art as an aspect of the future society.In the process of research a method of abstraction, descriptive method, methods of analysis and synthesis were used in the theoretical substantiation and characterization of pop music as a vocal art. The method of generalization and systematization was used to determine the results of the research. The results became the basis for asserting the importance of pop vocal art in the further development of society.

TI  - Rapid and Automated Approach for Early Crop Mapping Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 on Google Earth Engine; A Case of a Highly Heterogeneous and Fragmented Agricultural Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid crop type mapping is critical for agricultural sustainability. The growing trend of cloud-based geospatial platforms provides rapid processing tools and cloud storage for remote sensing data. In particular, a variety of remote sensing applications have made use of publicly accessible data from the Sentinel missions of the European Space Agency (ESA). However, few studies have employed these data to evaluate the effectiveness of Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 spectral bands and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in challenging highly heterogeneous and fragmented agricultural landscapes using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. This work aims to map, accurately and early, the crop types in a highly heterogeneous and fragmented agricultural region of the Tadla Irrigated Perimeter (TIP) as a case study using the high spatiotemporal resolution of Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and a Random Forest (RF) classifier implemented on GEE. More specifically, five experiments were performed to assess the optical band reflectance values, vegetation indices, and SAR backscattering coefficients on the accuracy of crop classification. Besides, two scenarios were used to assess the monthly temporal windows on classification accuracy. The findings of this study show that the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can accurately produce the early crop mapping of the studied area with an Overall Accuracy (OA) reaching 95.02%. The scenarios prove that the monthly time series perform better in terms of classification accuracy than single monthly windows images. Red-edge and shortwave infrared bands can improve the accuracy of crop classification by 1.72% when compared to only using traditional bands (i.e., visible and near-infrared bands). The inclusion of two common vegetation indices (The Normalized Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)) and Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients to the crop classification enhanced the overall classification accuracy by 0.02% and 2.94%, respectively, compared to using the Sentinel-2 reflectance bands alone. The monthly windows analysis indicated that the improvement in the accuracy of crop classification is the greatest when the March images are accessible, with an OA higher than 80%.

TI  - In Space, No One Can Hear You're Green: Standardization of Environmental Reporting, the SEC's Proposed Climate Change Disclosure Rules, and Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - AMERICAN BUSINESS LAW JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is the existential issue of our age. Its challenges are massive, its science is ever-developing and most now agree that its demands are immediate. How society deals with the immensity and immediacy of the challenge in the face of incomplete, immature, and sometimes inconclusive data is a question playing out now in our capital markets. Bending to demand from green investors and environmental activists, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed new rules on March 21, 2022, "to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures " to better inform investors' decision-making. How should reporting companies, already obligated to report on material risks to their businesses, "enhance and standardize " climate-related disclosure when the data are ambiguous or in conflict? This article proposes one possible and currently available solution: use satellite-based data. By requiring the use of available satellite data, regulators can protect investors from being misled by cherry-picked emissions data. We begin with a case for standardization and a brief history of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) reporting and metrics, both in the United States and internationally, as well as SEC efforts regarding climate change disclosures. We then explore the precedent for satellite use and space-based technology in monitoring and regulatory compliance and argue that satellite and space data can be instrumental to help investors make more informed investment decisions based on reporting companies' true environmental impact.

TI  - Lithological Mapping of Kohat Basin in Pakistan Using Multispectral Remote Sensing Data: A Comparison of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-based multispectral remote sensing has been the best supporting tool using limited resources to enhance the lithological mapping abilities with accuracy, supported by ground truthing through traditional mapping techniques. The availability of the dataset, choice of algorithm, cost, accuracy, computational time, data labeling, and terrain features are some crucial considerations that researchers continue to explore. In this research, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied to the Sentinel-2 MSI dataset for classifying lithologies having subtle compositional differences in the Kohat Basin's remote, inaccessible regions within Pakistan. First, we used principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction (MNF), and available maps for reliable data annotation for training SVM and (ANN) models for mapping ten classes (nine lithological units + water). The ANN and SVM results were compared with the previously conducted studies in the area and ground truth survey to evaluate their accuracy. SVM mapped ten classes with an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.78% and kappa coefficient of 0.95, compared to 95.73% and 0.95 by ANN classification. The SVM algorithm was more efficient concerning computational efficiency, accuracy, and ease due to available features within Google Earth Engine (GEE). Contrarily, ANN required time-consuming data transformation from GEE to Google Cloud before application in Google Colab.

TI  - The Name as 'Anti-pagan' Monument
T2  - JOURNAL OF REFORMED THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - K.H. Miskotte's Bijbels abc, recently translated into English as Biblical abcs, resources resistance by carefully reading the Hebrew scriptures. This article argues that the cen-tral, defining theme of the book is the focus on the Name YHWH as `anti-pagan mon-ument par excellence.' Paganism for Miskotte does not mean the absence of religion nor a particular, polytheistic religion or worldview, but the natural human inclination to declare the existing order sacred. Humanity is profoundly `occupied' and needs the Word, the Name-in-action, in order to be liberated from pagan, religious occupying forces-whether these forces are political, spiritual, military, economical or linguis-tic. This focus on the `anti-pagan' stance of the Name determines the entire structure of Biblical abcs, its method and content.

AB  - In this paper, we consider a wave equation with incomplete data, where we do not know the potential coefficient and the initial conditions. From observing the system in the boundary, we want to get information on the potential coefficient independently of the initial conditions. This can be obtained using the sentinel method of Lions, which is a functional insensitive to certain parameters. Shows us through the adjoint system that the existence of the sentinel is equivalent to an optimal control problem. We solve this optimal control problem by using the Hilbert uniqueness method (HUM).

TI  - Impacts of land-use changes and landholding fragmentation on crop water demand and drought in Wadi El-Farigh, New Delta project, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite Egypt's limited water resources, more lands in the western desert of the Nile Delta are currently being reclaimed to increase the agricultural area to feed its fast-growing population and provide jobs for new generations. These reclaimed lands are prone to drought since they are located in arid regions with limited water resources for irrigation. Moreover, a high rate of landholdings fragmentation was observed with the migration of large numbers of new farmers to the newly reclaimed areas. Hence, the current work uses remote sensing data to investigate the impacts of landholdings fragmentation and land-use changes on irrigation water demand and drought propagation in two selected sites in Wadi El-Farigh area, one of the newly reclaimed valleys in the western desert of Egypt. To achieve that goal, high -resolution satellite images were used to quantify the land-use changes and patterns. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was used to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from 2010 to 2020. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were used to monitor drought. Results indicated a large transformation of seasonal herbaceous crops to tree-fruit crops in the two study sites. However, landholding fragmentation caused a reduction in the total cultivated area and thus the accumulated water consumption over one study site. Although the accumulated ETa decreased following the decline in the total cultivated area, the ETa rate per hectare increased by 18.4% and 19.6% for trees and herbaceous crops, respectively, reflecting the negative impact of climate change. ESI and SPI time series confirms that the area became extremely dry, particularly after 2017. In conclusion, land use and climate change increased crop water demand, while landholding fragmenta-tion led to cropland loss. Hence, more policies for land protection and adaptation strategies to climate change are essentially needed.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The rapid expansion of the remote sensing satellite constellation produced large volumes of Earth's remote sensing data. New approaches are required to store and access the data to enable real-time analytics. As consumers demand not just standard ERS data processing but an integrated virtual environment for ERS data applications, the most promising and sought-after solution for many users is a cloud platform for ERS data processing and analysis. The range of available cloud platforms is extensive which makes it difficult for users to understand the internal structure, interconnections between the platform components, their functions, and properties. There is a need for a scientific systematization of such platforms. This is a review of international and Russian cloud platforms. We identified the standard structure of a cloud platform and its layers with their dedicated functionality, autonomy, standardization, and horizontal scalability. The review indicates that cloud platforms are the most promising tool for ERS data processing and analytics.

T2  - Heliyon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The land use analyses most often focused on the spatio-temporal change detection and how the current conversion status is associated with the previous legacies of land use dynamics are little understood. Here, we examined how the forest land use has been converted to other land use types, and if the intermittent and the current extent of the dynamics are associated with the previous extent of land conversions along spatio-temporal scale. For this, we performed the land use change detection with respective to simplified, moderate and complex landscapes forest cover gradients. These analyses were carried out for the periods of forty-five years (1973-2018) by employing supervised classification method. Our results showed that the forestland has been converted to other land use types at the annual rates of -1.23, -1.34 and -0.81 in simplified, moderate and complex landscapes, respectively. Especially, the rate of forest conversion to crop land has been higher in simplified and moderate landscapes when compared with that of the complex landscapes. These results show that the current statuses of land conversions are largely dependent on the landscape complexity gradients occurred as the result of land use legacies (varying intensity of land management regime in the past). Altogether, a landscape complexity per se is not only a guarantee, and the previous land conversion legacies and the current land use dynamics as well need to be considered in developing landscape management strategies.

TI  - Buddhist's Traditional Views on Violence and Non-Violence (On the Example of the Kalmyks of the Russian Empire)
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the ideas of Buddhist Kalmyks, who became Russian subjects in the 17th century and made a significant contribution to the strengthening of Russian statehood, about violent and non-violent methods of conflict resolution. Kalmyks traditionally profess Buddhism, which organically entered their ethnic culture and had a noticeable impact on their worldview. It is determined that the Kalmyks faithfully carried out military service for centuries, often being at the forefront of the Russian army. They guarded the southern borders of the country, participated in many Russian military campaigns. At the same time, the Kalmyks formed specific views based on the Buddhist ethics of non-violence, which was reflected in their legislative acts. The combination of the Buddhist ethics of non-violence and military prowess for the Kalmyks themselves might not seem contradictory to them due to their specific views on "skilful means" and spiritual development in accordance with Vajrayana Buddhism. Idealizing the image of angry protector deities, the Kalmyks could justify the military methods they used to influence their opponents, since they were defending the holy teaching and their people. However, it is important to bear in mind that the ideas of the Kalmyks cannot be equated with the very Buddhist idea of worshiping angry deities. According to Buddhist sources, the essence of this idea lies in the symbolic use of destructive states of mind on the path of rapid spiritual transformation. The Kalmyks could literally, that is, not quite correctly, interpret the Tantric teaching. At the same time, this interpretation allowed them to maintain spiritual strength to protect not only the Buddhist religion and their people, but also the entire population of Russia. The conclusions drawn allow us to expand the view of the ethical ideals of peoples who traditionally practice Buddhism.

TI  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Zat valley, Marrakech: comparison and dynamics
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents vegetation land cover mapping based on Remote Sensing (RS) data processing, including satellite imagery scenes from Sentinel-2A, ASTER, and Landsat, in order to show the spatio-temporal correlation between the climate and environmental setting in Morocco. The main objective of this study is to contribute on land use planning and ecosystem protection. The distribution of vegetation in the study area was analyzed based on the satellite image processing and computing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The study was conducted on different satellite imagery (Sentinel-2A, ASTER and the Landsat TM5, ETMthorn, and OLI) using SAGA GIS and SNAP software, to achieve two specific objectives: (1) conducting a comparative analysis of the NDVI calculation results from three satellite images (i.e., sentinel-2A, ASTER, Landsat 8); (2) highlighting the dynamics of the NDVI index from 1984 to 2020 by processing 35 satellite images from Landsat data Archive using SAGA GIS software, and then correlating these changes with other vegetation indices for the Marrakech-Haouz region provided by NOAA, namely: Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and NDVI indices. This study shows a repetitive fluctuation in the decrease of NDVI mean value from 1984 to 2020, due to the contrasting climate setting of the study area and the influence of the alternation of humid and dry periods in the High Atlas of Marrakech. In addition, the presented results underline that open-source software, such as SAGA GIS and SNAP can provide satisfactory results for vegetation coverage dynamics.

TI  - Continued Circulation of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Variants and Detection of Novel Transmission Foci, the Netherlands
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an emerging pathogen that was first detected in ticks and humans in the Netherlands in 2015 (ticks) and 2016 (humans). To learn more about its distribution and prevalence in the Netherlands, we conducted large-scale surveillance in ticks and rodents during August 2018-September 2020. We tested 320 wild rodents and >46,000 ticks from 48 locations considered to be at high risk for TBEV circulation. We found TBEV RNA in 3 rodents (0.9%) and 7 tick pools (minimum infection rate 0.02%) from 5 geographically distinct foci. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that 3 different variants of the TBEV-Eu subtype circulate in the Netherlands, suggesting multiple independent introductions. Combined with recent human cases outside known TBEV hotspots, our data demonstrate that the distribution of TBEV in the Netherlands is more widespread than previously thought.

The long history of supporting soil moisture products and partnering with other U.S. government agencies led to the partnering between the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, resulting in a merger of those organizations' modeling systems, collaborative development of the Land Information System (LIS), and operational fielding of the system within the USAF 557th Weather Wing [557 WW; formerly, Headquarters Air Force Weather Agency (HQ AFWA)]. In 2009, the USAF implemented the NASA LIS and later made it the primary software system to generate global soil hydrology and energy budget products. The implementation of LIS delivered a significant upgrade over the existing Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) the USAF operated, the Agriculture Meteorology (AGRMET) system. Implementation enabled the rapid integration of new LDAS technology into USAF operations, and led to a long-term NASA-USAF partnership resulting in continued development, integration, and implementation of new LIS capabilities. This paper documents both the history of the USAF Weather organization capabilities enabling the generation of soil moisture and other land surface analysis products, and describes the USAF-NASA partnership leading to the development of the merged LIS-AGRMET system. The article also presents a successful example of a mutually beneficial partnership that has enabled cutting-edge land analysis capabilities at the USAF, while transitioning NASA software and satellite data into USAF operations.

TI  - Geospatial analytics for multi-decadal morphodynamics along Gwadar coastal zone
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of morphological changes in coastal areas plays a fundamental role in assessment of their spatio-temporal evolution. The focus of this research is to analyze the morphodynamic evolution of shoreline, built-up areas, and vulnerability assessment of Gwadar coastal zone. Using Landsat data, from 1987 to 2021, shorelines were extracted and both long and short-term shoreline changes were assessed in a GIS environment. The results indicate high accretion and sediment entrainment due to anthropogenic developments in Eastern and Western zones. Moderate to high erosion was observed in Eastern zone, whereas, only moderate erosion was observed in the Western zone. The values of greatest retreat and advance along the shoreline of -65.67 m and 827.9 m respectively were recorded in the Eastern zone. The dominant factor of coastal evolution was anthropogenic, augmented by an increase of 13.86% in built-up area. Short-term analysis revealed that erosion and accretion dominated intermittently, with greatest erosion observed during 1994-2001, while, highest accretion occurred from 2001-2007. Furthermore, results of coastal vulnerability assessment indicate that about 15.22% of shoreline consisting of sandy formations is highly vulnerable to hazards. In conclusion, integrated approaches using remote sensing and spatial analysis represent a significant framework for long-term synoptic monitoring of coastal areas.

TI  - Evaluation of Fengyun-4A Detection Accuracy: A Case Study of the Land Surface Temperature Product for Hunan Province, Central China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in determining surface energy balance and a fundamental variable detected by the advanced geostationary radiation imager (AGRI), the main payload of FY-4A. FY-4A is the first of a new generation of Chinese geostationary satellites, and the detection product of the satellite has not been extensively validated. Therefore, it is important to conduct a comprehensive assessment of this product. In this study, the performance of the FY-4A LST product in the Hunan Province was authenticity tested with in situ measurements, triple collocation analyzed with reanalysis products, and impact analyzed with environmental factors. The results confirm that FY-4A captures LST well (R = 0.893, Rho = 0.915), but there is a general underestimation (Bias = -0.6295 degrees C) and relatively high random error (RMSE = 8.588 degrees C, ubRMSE = 5.842 degrees C). In terms of accuracy, FY-4A LST is more accurate for central-eastern, northern, and south-central Hunan Province and less accurate for western and southern mountainous areas and Dongting Lake. FY-4A LST is not as accurate as Himawari-8 LST; its accuracy also varies seasonally and between day and night. The accuracy of FY-4A LST decreases as elevation, in situ measured LST, surface heterogeneity, topographic relief, slope, or NDVI increase and as soil moisture decreases. FY-4A LST is also more accurate when the land cover is cultivated land or artificial surfaces or when the landform is a platform for other land covers and landforms. The conclusions drawn from the comprehensive analysis of the large quantity of data are generalizable and provide a quantitative baseline for assessing the detection capability of the FY-4A satellite, a reference for determining improvement in the retrieval algorithm, and a foundation for the development and application of future domestic satellite products.

TI  - Design of the Optical System of Coaxial PGP Imaging Spectrometer with Eliminating Spectral Smile
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing technology is an optical remote sensing technology developed on the basis of imaging spectroscopy,which can realize comprehensive observation of spatial information, spectral information and radiation information. The imaging spectrometer adopting the Prism-Grating-Prism (PGP) spectroscopic element avoids the off-axis problem of traditional prism- type and grating-type imaging spectrometers,and is conducive to the miniaturization and compactness of imaging spectrometers. Aiming at the problem that the spectral smile of coaxial PGP imaging spectrometer is difficult to correct, this paper proposes a method to rectify the curvature of spectral line by using curved slit and distortion of the collimator lens and focusing lens. On the basis of retaining the advantages of PGP such as high diffraction efficiency and coaxial optical path,this method can correct spectral smile and keystone of the instrument. In this paper,the prism-grating-prism vector dispersion model is established by focusing on the influence of lens distortion,the number of grating lines and prism angle on spectral smile and keystone. By tracing the light vector and analyzing the intersection between the light vector and the image plane after the light vector passes through the PGP element with different parameters, the influence of different parameters on the smile was analyzed. It is worth noting that when the shape of the slit changes,the direction of the initial light vector also changes. Therefore,this model can also analyze the effect of the slit shape on the spectral smile and keystone. Further,the prism- grating-prism vector dispersion model is used to analyze the spectral line bending characteristics of coaxial PGP spectroscopic elements:when the coaxial condition is met,the PGP imaging spectrometer will inevitably have a large smile, and the spectrum is bent in the short-wave direction. After adjusting the prism Angle,the number of grating lines and the lens distortion, we analyzed the smile size of the combination of the above parameters, and came to an optimistic conclusion:the smile problem of the imaging spectrometer could not be eliminated only by changing the prism,grating and lens. However,the smile can be corrected well by the method of bending the slit and matching the appropriate lens distortion. In order to improve the versatility of this method,this paper gives an objective function for correcting spectral curvature and spectral line curvature by using the PGP vector dispersion model,and uses genetic algorithm to optimize the objective function and calculate the best combination of slit shape and lens parameters quickly. In order to verify the feasibility of this method, this paper uses the calculation results of this method to design a curved slit PGP imaging spectrometer with a slit length of 22 mm,an operating wavelength of 400 similar to 800 nm, a spectral resolution of 3 nm,and an F number of 3.5 which has a spectral curvature of less than 2 mu m and a spectral line curvature of less than 2 mu m. The optical system has a diffuse spot radius of less than 5.4 mu m in the wavelength range of 400 similar to 800 nm,and can distinguish slit images with a spectral interval of 2 nm. The energy concentration of all fields of view can reach 90% in the 2x2 pixel scale. The design results show that the use of curved slit and distortion of the collimator lens and focusing lens can effectively correct the curve of the spectral line,which has important guiding significance for the design of the coaxial PGP imaging spectrometers.In this article,we calculated the optimal slit shape and lens parameters for different slit lengths and different grating parameters,which proved that the method had universal applicability.

TI  - Impacts of Extreme Temperature and Precipitation on Crops during the Growing Season in South Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - South Asia, one of the most important food producing regions in the world, is facing a significant threat to food grain production under the influence of extreme high temperatures. Furthermore, the probability of simultaneous trends in extreme precipitation patterns and extreme heat conditions, which can have compounding effects on crops, is a likelihood in South Asia. In this study, we found complex relationships between extreme heat and precipitation patterns, as well as compound effects on major crops (rice and wheat) in South Asia. We also employed event coincidence analysis (ECA) to quantify the likelihood of simultaneous temperature and crop extremes. We used the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the primary data to evaluate the distinct responses of major crops to weather extremes. Our results suggest that while the probability of simultaneous extreme events is small, most regions of South Asia (more than half) have experienced extreme events. The regulatory effect of precipitation on heat stress is very unevenly distributed in South Asia. The harm caused by a wet year at high temperature is far greater than that during a dry year, although the probability of a dry year is greater than that of a wet year. For the growing seasons, the highest significant event coincidence rates at a low EVI were found for both high- and low-temperature extremes. The regions that responded positively to EVI at extreme temperatures were mainly concentrated in irrigated farmland, and the regions that responded negatively to EVI at extreme temperatures were mostly in the mountains and other high-altitude regions. Implications can guide crop adaptation interventions in response to these climate influences.

TI  - EVOLUTION OF LAND COVER IN THE TRARAS MTS. REGION BETWEEN 1984 AND 2020 BY REMOTE SENSING AND GIS (NORTHWEST ALGERIA)
T2  - Ekologia (Bratislava)
M3  - Article
AB  - In Algeria, the mountainous zones represent 11% of agricultural land of the country and are home to 25% of the population. The economic development and the associated urbanization have led to environmental degradation in the Traras Mountains, which are part of the Atlas Mountains. With the aim to evaluate the degradation consequences of this region, we focused on the evolution of land use and land cover over 36 years (1984-2020). Accordingly, we used Landsat and Google Earth Pro images, topographic and ecological inventory maps, as well terrain truth; our analysis tools were mainly based on ArcGIS, Global Mapper, and ENVI software. The diachronic analysis showed that the Traras Mountains lost 8,100 ha of agricultural and forestland between 1984 and 2020. Relating to this, we point out the destruction of 9,200 ha of forested area by the fire. The urbanization also contributed to the loss of agricultural and forested areas (6,300 ha), of which 27% are located in the coastal zone. The built-up situation led to an increase of soil impermeability which causes flooding during heavy rainfall.

TI  - Possible Overestimation of Nitrogen Dioxide Outgassing during the Beirut 2020 Explosion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 4 August 2020, a strong explosion occurred near the Beirut seaport, Lebanon and killed more than 200 people and damaged numerous buildings in the vicinity. As Amonium Nitrate (AN) caused the explosion, many studies claimed the release of large amounts of NO2 in the atmosphere may have resulted in a health hazard in Beirut and the vicinity. In order to reasonably evaluate the significance of NO2 amounts released in the atmosphere, it is important to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of NO2 during and after the blast and compare it to the average day-to-day background emissions from vehicle and ship traffic in Beirut. In the present study, we use Sentinel-5 TROPOMI data to study NO2 emissions in the atmosphere close to the affected area prior, during, and after the Beirut explosion (28 July-8 August 2020). Analysis shows an increase in NO2 concentrations over Beirut up to about 1.8 mol/m(2) one day after the explosion that was gradually dissipated in about 4 days. Seven days before the blast (on 28 July 2020) NO2 concentration was, however, observed to be up to about 4.3 mol/m(2) over Beirut, which is mostly attributed to vehicle emissions in Lebanon, ships passing by the Beirut seaport and possibly the militant activities in Syria during 20-26 July. It is found that the Beirut blast caused a temporarily and spatially limited increase in NO2. The blast mostly affected the coastal areas in Lebanon, while it did not have much effect on inland regions. TROPOMI data are also analyzed for the Greater Cairo Area (GCA), Suez Canal, Egypt, and in Nicosia, Cyprus to confirm the effect of human activities, vehicles, and ship traffic on NO2 emissions in relatively high and relatively low populated zones.

TI  - Comparison of Random Forest and Kriging Models for Soil Organic Carbon Mapping in the Himalayan Region of Kashmir
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The knowledge about the spatial distribution of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) helps in sustainable land-use management and ecosystem functioning. No such study has been attempted in the complex topography and land use of Himalayas, which is associated with great spatial heterogeneity and uncertainties. Therefore, in this study digital soil mapping (DSM) was used to predict and evaluate the spatial distribution of SOCS using advanced geostatistical methods and a machine learning algorithm in the Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir, India. Eighty-three soil samples were collected across different land uses. Auxiliary variables (spectral indices and topographic parameters) derived from satellite data were used as predictors. Geostatistical methods-ordinary kriging (OK) and regression kriging (RK)-and a machine learning method-random forest (RF)-were used for assessing the spatial distribution and variability of SOCS with inter-comparison of models for their prediction performance. The best fit model validation criteria used were coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) with resulting maps validated by cross-validation. The SOCS concentration varied from 1.12 Mg/ha to 70.60 Mg/ha. The semivariogram analysis of OK and RK indicated moderate spatial dependence. RF (RMSE = 8.21) performed better than OK (RMSE = 15.60) and RK (RMSE = 17.73) while OK performed better than RK. Therefore, it may be concluded that RF provides better estimation and spatial variability of SOCS; however, further selection and choice of auxiliary variables and higher soil sampling density could improve the accuracy of RK prediction.

TI  - A Tailored Approach for the Global Gas Flaring Investigation by Means of Daytime Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Daytime Approach for gas Flaring Investigation (DAFI), running in Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment, exploits a Normalized Hotspot Index (NHI), analyzing near-infrared and short-wave infrared radiances, to detect worldwide high-temperature gas flaring sites (GFs). Daytime Landsat 8-Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations, of 2013-2021, represents the employed dataset. A temporal persistence criterion is applied to a gas flaring customized NHI product to select the GFs. It assures the 99% detection accuracy of more intense and stable GFs, with a very low false positive rate. As a result, the first daytime database and map of GF sites, operating during the last 9 years at global scale, has been generated. For each site, geographical metadata, frequency of occurrence and time persistence levels, at both monthly and annual scale, may be examined, through the specific developed GEE App. The present database will complement/integrate existing gas flaring maps. The joint use of global scale daytime and nighttime GFs inventories, in fact, will allow for tracking gas flaring dynamics in a timely manner. Moreover, it enables a better evaluation of GF emissions into the atmosphere. Finally, the next DAFI implementation on Landsat 9 and Sentinel 2 data will further improve our capabilities in identifying, mapping, monitoring and characterizing the GFs.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Properties above Productive Waters of Gorky Reservoir for Atmospheric Correction of Sentinel-3/OLCI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main challenge that one has to face during the atmospheric correction (AC) of productive inland waters is the inability to correctly separate aerosol radiance from water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared range (NIR) bands. This leads both to incorrect estimates of the aerosol parameters and the remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). For the Gorky Reservoir, where we are developing regional bio-optical models, the situation is complicated by the lack of field measurements of aerosol optical properties due to the significant remoteness of AERONET stations. The standard AC algorithms, as shown earlier, greatly overestimated the aerosol radiance in all spectral bands up to red bands during the period of intense cyanobacteria blooms, while the algorithm with a fixed aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained in a clean water area gave encouraging results. Therefore, it was important to investigate the characteristics of the atmosphere above the reservoir and validate the proposed approach for regular use of Sentinel-3 imagery of the Gorky Reservoir. To solve these issues, regular in situ aerosol measurements using the handheld sun photometer SPM were performed. The measured AOD and the Angstrom exponent were compared with the estimates of these parameters from two Sentinel-3/OLCI Level-2 products, namely, Synergy (SYN) and Water Full Resolution products (OL_2_WFR). It was found that AOD and the Angstrom exponent from these standard products were overestimated by 2-3 times and almost 2 times in all cases. Atmospheric correction with fixed AOD, defined by measurements, allows us to completely get rid of negative R-rs, and its shapes and values became typical for the Gorky Reservoir. Despite the overestimation of AOD in traditional AC and its large variations in general, it was found that the minimum AOD spectrum is close to the measured spectrum. Therefore, the AOD spectra, which correspond to the two percentiles of the distribution, can be used for preliminary AC with a fixed AOD of the Sentinel-3/OLCI imaginary. The relative errors of the R-rs retrievals using the two percentile AOD compared to the measured AOD were 3-35% in the green and red bands of Sentinel-3/OLCI.

TI  - A Bias Correction Scheme with the Symmetric Cloud Proxy Variable and Its Influence on Assimilating All-Sky <i>GOES-16</i> Brightness Temperatures
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - All-sky assimilation of brightness temperatures (BTs) from GOES-16 infrared water vapor channels is challenging, primarily because these channels are sensitive to cloud ice that causes large nonlinear errors in the forecast and forward models. Thus, bias correction (BC) for all-sky assimilation of GOES-16 BTs is vital. This study examines the impacts of different BC schemes, especially for a scheme with a quartic polynomial of cloud predictors (the ASRBC4 scheme), on the analysis and WRF Model forecasts of tropical cyclones when assimilating the all-sky GOES-16 channel-8 BTs using the NCEP GSI-based 3D ensemble-variational hybrid data assimilation (DA) system with variational BC (VarBC). Long-term statistics are performed during the NASA Convective Processes Experiment field campaign (2017). Results demonstrate that the ASRBC4 scheme effectively reduces the average of all-sky scaled observation-minus-backgrounds (OmBs) in a cloudy sky and alleviates their nonlinear conditional biases with respect to the symmetric cloud proxy variable, in contrast to the BC schemes without the cloud predictor or with a first-order cloud predictor. In addition, adopting the ASRBC4 scheme in DA decreases the positive temperature increments at 200 hPa and the accompanying midlevel cyclonic wind increments in the analysis of Tropical Storm (TS) Cindy (2017). Applying the ASRBC4 scheme also leads to better storm-track predictions for TS Cindy (2017) and Hurricane Laura (2022), compared to experiments with other BC schemes. Overall, this study highlights the importance of reducing nonlinear biases of OmBs in a cloudy sky for successful all-sky assimilation of BTs from GOES-16 infrared water vapor channels.

TI  - Interannual Variabilities of the Southern Bay of Bengal Cold Pool Associated with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern Bay of Bengal (BOB) cold pool (SCP) plays an important role in the regional climate fluctuation of the BOB. However, the interannual variability in the SCP is still unknown. Multisource satellite remote sensing data and assimilation have been applied to explore the interannual variability in the SCP and its relationship with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events for the period 1982-2020. The anomalous SST of the SCP in the summer following the peak phase (i.e., winter) of the ENSO was closely related to the ENSO events. El Nino (La Nina)-induced the warm (cold) anomaly of the SCP starting from May and persisted throughout August with a peak value appearing in June during the El Nino (La Nina) decaying years. In the El Nino decaying years, the southwest monsoon current (SMC) was weakened, forced locally by the weakening southwesterly wind and remotely by the easterly wind anomaly at the equator associated with El Nino. The El Nino-related weakening SMC and the associated less cold advection led to the warm anomaly of the SCP. In addition, El Nino-related atmospheric heating also made a comparable contribution to the evolution of the SCP's SST. In the early stage (15 May to 10 June), its contribution to the warming of the SCP was much larger than that of the SMC, whereas from mid-June to August, it reversed to have a cooling effect and partially offset the advection heating induced by the SMC on the SCP. In the La Nina decaying years, similar oceanic and atmospheric processes operated but in an opposite way.

TI  - Quantifying the Ecological Effectiveness of Poverty Alleviation Relocation in Karst Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2015-2020), the Poverty alleviation relocation (PAR), led by the Chinese government in the karst regions of southwest China, aimed to cope with poverty and ameliorate the ecological environment. Nevertheless, few research results have involved quantitative assessment of the ecological effectiveness of PAR. Moreover, few studies on the ecological effects of migration relocation have distinguished the effects of relocation on climatic factors and other ecological restoration projects concerning the ecological environment. It remains unclear to what extent PAR affects the regional ecological environment. In order to quantitatively assess the extent of PAR's ecological restoration contribution, we adopted the Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) model, which integrates the four more intuitive and critical influencing factors of greenness, moisture, dryness, and heat. On the Google earth engine (GEE) platform, utilizing its powerful remote sensing data storage capacity and computational capability, we quantitatively assessed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of ecological environmental quality (EEQ). As revealed by our research findings, overall EEQ showed a fluctuating upward trend over the period 1996-2021 in the study area, exhibiting an improvement of 22.66%. Mann-Kendall mutation test curves showed the most significant improvement occurred after 2015, with an improvement of 8.06%. Based on the residual analysis model, in order to remove the influence of climatic factors and other anthropogenic activities, and to assess the driving effectiveness of PAR, PAR was remarkedly effective in ameliorating EEQ, causing the RSEI to improve by 0.0221-0.0422. The LISA correlation model further analyzed that 44.91% of regional PAR implementation exerted a remarkable influence on RSEI change, of which 54.59% belonged to positive correlation. Aside from that, we also found that not all areas involved in PAR experienced ameliorated RSEI. In the western region, where the human-land conflict is prominent and the ecology is more fragile, PAR exhibited a significant effect in ameliorating EEQ, but in the eastern region, where the EEQ foundation is better, PAR did not show significant effect, and, thus, the ecological restoration effect of PAR exhibited noticeable geographical suitability.

TI  - MPFINet: A Multilevel Parallel Feature Injection Network for Panchromatic and Multispectral Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of a high-spatial-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image and a corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image can yield a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image, which is also known as pansharpening. Most previous methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results. However, information of different scales has not been fully mined and utilized, and still produces spectral and spatial distortion. In this work, we propose a multilevel parallel feature injection network that contains three scale levels and two parallel branches. In the feature extraction branch, a multi-scale perception dynamic convolution dense block is proposed to adaptively extract the spatial and spectral information. Then, the sufficient multilevel features are injected into the image reconstruction branch, and an attention fusion module based on the spectral dimension is designed in order to fuse shallow contextual features and deep semantic features. In the image reconstruction branch, cascaded transformer blocks are employed to capture the similarities among the spectral bands of the MS image. Extensive experiments are conducted on the QuickBird and WorldView-3 datasets to demonstrate that MPFINet achieves significant improvement over several state-of-the-art methods on both spatial and spectral quality assessments.

TI  - Exploring the Potential of Lidar and Sentinel-2 Data to Model the Post-Fire Structural Characteristics of Gorse Shrublands in NW Spain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of aboveground biomass is important in forest management planning, with various objectives ranging from prevention of forest fires to restoration of burned areas, especially in fire-prone regions such as NW Spain. Although remotely sensed data have often been used to assess the recovery of standing aboveground biomass after perturbations, the data have seldom been validated in the field, and different shrub fractions have not been modelled. The main objective of the present study was to assess different vegetation parameters (cover, height, standing AGB and their fractions) in field plots established in five areas affected by wildfires between 2009 and 2016 by using Sentinel-2 spectral indices and LiDAR metrics. For this purpose, 22 sampling plots were established in 2019, and vegetation variables were measured by a combination of non-destructive measurement (cover and height) and destructive sampling (total biomass and fine samples of live and dead fractions of biomass). The structural characterization of gorse shrublands was addressed, and models of shrub cover-height, total biomass, and biomass by fraction and physiological condition-were constructed, with adjusted coefficients of determination ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. The addition of LiDAR data to optical remote sensing images improved the models. Further research should be conducted to calibrate the models in other vegetation communities.

TI  - SNAPPING Services on the Geohazards Exploitation Platform for Copernicus Sentinel-1 Surface Motion Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We are communicating recent developments regarding the Surface motioN mAPPING (SNAPPING) service for the Sentinel-1 mission on the Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) platform in support of the scientific community as well as of EO practitioners. We present the processing scheme adopted for the service and the designed implementation on the GEP, and we discuss in detail the user-defined processing parameters and service outputs. SNAPPING is offered through three independent services, namely the SNAPPING IFG for the generation of interferometric stacks, utilized consequently as input for the SNAPPING PSI Med and SNAPPING PSI Full services, which execute Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) analyses at medium and full resolutions, respectively. The inter-verification of the SNAPPING results was performed to underline the robustness of the provided measurements, and several showcases from diverse environments are demonstrated. The service aims to pave the way towards the improved acceptance of EO-hosted processing services and deeper community engagement, anticipating operational exploitation in response to geohazards.

TI  - Holocene ice-stream shutdown and drainage basin reconfiguration in northeast Greenland
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable knowledge of ice discharge dynamics for the Greenland ice sheet via its ice streams is essential if we are to understand its stability under future climate scenarios. Currently active ice streams in Greenland have been well mapped using remote-sensing data while past ice-stream paths in what are now deglaciated regions can be reconstructed from the landforms they left behind. However, little is known about possible former and now defunct ice streams in areas still covered by ice. Here we use radio-echo sounding data to decipher the regional ice-flow history of the northeastern Greenland ice sheet on the basis of its internal stratigraphy. By creating a three-dimensional reconstruction of time-equivalent horizons, we map folds deep below the surface that we then attribute to the deformation caused by now-extinct ice streams. We propose that locally this ancient ice-flow regime was much more focused and reached much farther inland than today's and was deactivated when the main drainage system was reconfigured and relocated southwards. The insight that major ice streams in Greenland might start, shift or abruptly disappear will affect future approaches to understanding and modelling the response of Earth's ice sheets to global warming.

TI  - One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) Lysate Samples Are Suitable to Establish a Transcriptional Metastatic Signature in Patients with Early Stage Hormone Receptors-Positive Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) is a recent technique for sentinel lymph nodes staging in breast cancer (BC). After OSNA assay, instead of being discarded, the residual OSNA lysate can also be used for gene expression studies, being the potentially ideal sample to search for new biomarkers. The aim of our study was to identify biomarkers related to tumor-microenvironment interplay in OSNA lysate of sentinel lymph nodes in women with early stage hormone receptors-positive BC. We identified 11 upregulated genes in metastatic lymph nodes. These genes codify proteins mainly involved in cancer aggressiveness and with impact in immune response. Thus, these findings support that OSNA lysate transcriptomic analysis may identify biomarkers potentially useful in the future for prognosis stratification and therapy selection. As OSNA assay is being implemented for sentinel lymph nodes staging in other cancers, this approach could also have a wider utility. The One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) is being adopted worldwide for sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) staging in breast cancer (BC). As major disadvantage, OSNA precludes prognostic information based on structural evaluation of SLNs. Our aim is to identify biomarkers related to tumor-microenvironment interplay exploring gene expression data from the OSNA remaining lysate. This study included 32 patients with early stage hormone receptors-positive BC. Remaining OSNA lysates were prepared for targeted RNA-sequencing analysis. Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was performed by DESeq2 in R and data analysis in STATA. The results show that, in metastatic SLNs, several genes were upregulated: KRT7, VTCN1, CD44, GATA3, ALOX15B, RORC, NECTIN2, LRG1, CD276, FOXM1 and IGF1R. Hierarchical clustering analysis revealed three different clusters. The identified DEGs codify proteins mainly involved in cancer aggressiveness and with impact in immune response. The overexpression of the immune suppressive genes VTCN1 and CD276 may explain that no direct evidence of activation of immune response in metastatic SLNs was found. We show that OSNA results may be improved incorporating microenvironment-related biomarkers that may be useful in the future for prognosis stratification and immunotherapy selection. As OSNA assay is being implemented for SLNs staging in other cancers, this approach could also have a wider utility.

TI  - Multispectral Spaceborne Proxies of Predisposing Forest Structure Attributes to Storm Disturbance-A Case Study from Germany
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Windstorms are among the primary drivers of forest disturbances. Although they are inherent part of the natural ecosystem processes, they severely impact managed forests. Modeling approaches serve as key tools for the evaluation of disturbance risk and different predisposing factors. However, data availability on relevant forest attributes can be problematic on a larger scale. While spaceborne remote sensing has already proven itself as a tool for disturbance detection, its use in relation to predisposing forest attributes remains underexploited. The present work explores multispectral object-based proxy predictors for statistical wind disturbance modeling based on the publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery and recorded damage polygons from the pan-European FORWIND database. Potential predictors were tested in logistic and random forests (RF) regression models for both disturbance occurrence and severity for a case study of a major storm event in Northern Germany from 2017. The results reveal a general potential of the derived spaceborne variables to be used as proxy variables to critical predisposing forest attributes. The presented proxy variables also outperformed a set of publicly available derived spatial data products for modeling both disturbance occurrence and severity. Model accuracies were moderate (reaching AUC = 0.76 for logistic regression fit and AUC = 0.69 for predictive accuracy of RF models), yet falling within the range of reported results in previous studies from the field. Limitations of the spectral satellite imagery as a single information source were acknowledged; however, the results indicate the further potential of spaceborne imagery applications in disturbance modeling, assessment and resulting mapping of disturbance susceptibility at different spatial scales. Considering the growing spatiotemporal availability of high-resolution spaceborne data, we propose that a model representation of post-disturbance forest patterns could improve the understanding of complex disturbance regimes and recurrent susceptibility.

TI  - The Guardians of the Sea: Echinoderms as Sentinels of Marine Pollution
T2  - Toxicology International
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year tons of heavy metals, plastic, pesticides, industrial chemicals, and sewage reach the oceans. Many of these compounds are not biodegradable and have a prolonged half-life, occurring and causing effects even several years after application. The consequences are diverse as biomagnification of toxins, infertility, neoplasia, hormonal alteration, or malformations. Sentinel species can be barometers for current or potential negative impacts on individuals, animal populations and ecosystem health, helping to identify hidden risks to human health and predict future changes. Several bioindicators allow us to evaluate the status of ecosystems, echinoderms are one of them. Their diversity of habitats, diet, sensibility to changes in the environment and position of the trophic zones makes them one the most ideal marine sentinels. This paper aims to present a summarized review with the latest information available that is related to the echinoderms as a sentinel of human, animal and environmental health.

TI  - Identification of sentinel plant species for evaluating phytotoxicity of veterinary antibiotics in Mediterranean Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Antibiotics used to treat livestock species enter agricultural fields when they are excreted by grazing animals or are present in manure that is added to fields as fertiliser. In the European Union, the potential effects of such antibiotics on terrestrial plants must be evaluated following the standardised OECD 208 method, which specifies the crop and wild species that should serve as "sentinels" for assessing antibiotic exposure. The present study aimed to compare this approved list of sentinel species against crop and wild plant species actually present in agricultural and pasture lands in Mediterranean Europe in order to identify the most appropriate sentinel plants for the region. The study focused on Spain as a region representative of Mediterranean Europe. Georeferenced layers for wild plant species and cultivated areas (crops), livestock density and land cover were combined, and then selection criteria were applied, leading to the identification of sentinel crop and wild species for crop land and pasture scenarios. Results In the crop land scenario, the sentinel crop species were barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum spp.), corn (Zea mays L), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), dried pea (Pisum sativum L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), vetch (Vicia sativa L.), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and sugar beet (Saccharum officinarum L.), all of them listed in the OECD 208 method with the exception of alfalfa; the sentinel wild species were Papaver rhoeas L., Galium aparine L. and Chenopodium album L. In the pasture scenario, sentinel wild species were Bromus tectorum L., Agrostis capillaris L., Trifolium pratense L., Lotus corniculatus L. and Galium aparine L. The following common weed species in field boundaries or in pasture lands also emerged as potential sentinel species for risk assessment, even though they are not listed in the OECD 208 method: Sonchus oleraceus L., Avena sterilis L., Dactylis glomerata L., Hordeum murinum L. and Lolium rigidum Gaudin. Conclusions The sentinel species identified in this study may be useful in risk assessment procedures covering the Mediterranean Europe. The method developed for this study could be applied to identify sentinel species for other representative agroclimatic regions in Europe (such as Atlantic and Continental).

TI  - Total Stem Biomass Estimation Using Sentinel-1 and-2 Data in a Dense Coniferous Forest of Complex Structure and Terrain
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation across multiple spatial and temporal scales is essential for mitigating climate change and optimizing forest management strategies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of Sentinel optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data in reliably estimating the plot-level total stem biomass (TSB), which constitutes the dominant material among the different tree components of AGB (stem, branches, and leaves). The study area was located in a dense coniferous forest characterized by an uneven-aged structure and intense topography. A random forest (RF) regression analysis was performed to develop TSB predictive models using Sentinel-1 and -2 images in an individual and combined manner. Consequently, three RF models were produced and evaluated for their predictive performance through the k-fold cross-validation (CV) method. The results showcased that the individual use of Sentinel-1 contributed to the production of the most accurate plot-level TSB estimates (i.e., coefficient of determination-R-2 = 0.74, relative mean square error (RMSE) = 1.76 Mg/1000 m(2), mean absolute error (MAE) = 1.48 Mg/1000 m(2)), compared to the use of Sentinel-2 data individually and the Sentinel-1 and -2 combination. In fact, the synergistic use of optical and SAR data led to the generation of an RF model that only marginally underperformed the SAR model (R-2 = 0.73 and R-2 = 0.72, respectively).

TI  - Integration of multiple earthquakes precursors before large earthquakes: A case study of 25 April 2015 in Nepal
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we analyze magnetic data, Land Surface Temperature (LST), Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), Air Temperature (AT) and Relative Humidity (RH) around the epicenter before and after the large EQs occurred on April 25, 2015 in Nepal. Daytime and nighttime LST values were retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite. We used the magnetic data acquired by Swarm satellites in the top side ionosphere, and daily OLR data was obtained from the United States National Oceanic and At-mospheric Administration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellites. Moreover, AT and RH values were provided from the nearest meteorological ground station to the epicenter located at Katmandu airport. As data analysis, short-term (15 days before and 5 days after the earthquakes) and medium-term (2 months before and 1 month after the earthquakes) evaluations were carried out. For short-term analysis, the results of the magnetic field in the topside ionosphere detected an interesting anomaly on April 12, 2015. Besides, nighttime LST anomaly was observed on April 13, 2015, 14 days before the earthquakes, which was also an anomalous day for AT and RH analysis. Moreover, in the OLR analysis, April 12, 2015 was anomalous day based on the time series of the epicentral pixel that coincides with the magnetic field anomaly. Concerning the medium-term nighttime LST analysis, 13th April was the day, which may be associated with the earthquakes. For the medium-term OLR analysis, April 12, 2015 was found to be related to the seismic activity based on the epicentral pixel. Besides, the RH anomaly on 13 April was the only mutual day with the anomalies of LST and OLR for the medium-term analysis. Based on the short-term and medium-term results, these two days, 12 and April 13, 2015, may be associated with the preparation for the earthquake occurrence. Overall, it is concluded that these methods could be effective and reliable in detecting anomalies that precede upcoming EQs with further investigations.

TI  - Estimating the Agricultural Farm Soil Moisture Using Spectral Indices of Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1, and Artificial Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of soil moisture at various stages of agricultural production plays a fundamental role in better managing water resources. Satellite data provide useful information regarding soil moisture and have been frequently used to estimate soil moisture in recent years. The main objective of this study has been to examine the capabilities of integration of the optical and radar images for soil moisture estimation. For this purpose, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and artificial neural networks have been used to measure soil moisture in 30 hectares area of Rosa Damascena Mill farm located at Qom province of Iran. Soil moisture data were collected in the interval between two irrigations of agricultural land as target data. The findings of this study reveal that integration of the spectral indices of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature data (LST) from Landsat 8 and vertical-horizontal polarization (VH) and vertical-vertical polarization (VV) data from Sentinel-1 leads to 10-cm depth soil moisture estimation with root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.9 percent. Positive relations were observed between the soil moisture estimation errors and the distance from the irrigation starting points. Therefore, distance data were utilized as the contextual input information and the spectral data leading to a reduction of the RMSE from 4.9 to 4.6 percent and an eleven percent reduction of the maximum error rate. On the other hand, RMSE of networks with one and two middle layers with 20 neutrons, respectively, were 4.6 and 5.0%. Therefore, in the conditions of this study, one middle layer with 20 neurons yielded better outcomes than those of using two middle layers.

TI  - Automatic Mapping of Burned Areas Using Landsat 8 Time-Series Images in Google Earth Engine: A Case Study from Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the natural conditions and inappropriate management responses, large part of plains and forests in Iran have been burned in recent years. Given the increasing availability of open-access satellite images and open-source software packages, we developed a fast and cost-effective remote sensing methodology for characterizing burned areas for the entire country of Iran. We mapped the fire-affected areas using a post-classification supervised method and Landsat 8 time-series images. To this end, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Colab computing services were used to facilitate the downloading and processing of images as well as allowing for effective implementation of the algorithms. In total, 13 spectral indices were calculated using Landsat 8 images and were added to the nine original bands of Landsat 8. The training polygons of the burned and unburned areas were accurately distinguished based on the information acquired from the Iranian Space Agency (ISA), Sentinel-2 images, and Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) products. A combination of Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Neural Network (NN) approaches was then implemented to specify 19 optimal features out of the 22 bands. The 19 optimal bands were subsequently applied to two classifiers of NN and Random Forest (RF) in the timespans of 1 January 2019 to 30 December 2020 and of 1 January 2021 to 30 September 2021. The overall classification accuracies of 94% and 96% were obtained for these two classifiers, respectively. The omission and commission errors of both classifiers were also less than 10%, indicating the promising capability of the proposed methodology in detecting the burned areas. To detect the burned areas caused by the wildfire in 2021, the image differencing method was used as well. The resultant models were finally compared to the MODIS fire products over 10 sampled polygons of the burned areas. Overall, the models had a high accuracy in detecting the burned areas in terms of shape and perimeter, which can be further implicated for potential prevention strategies of endangered biodiversity.

TI  - Mapping Dwellings in IDP/Refugee Settlements Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The improvement in computer vision, sensor quality, and remote sensing data availability makes satellite imagery increasingly useful for studying human settlements. Several challenges remain to be overcome for some types of settlements, particularly for internally displaced populations (IDPs) and refugee camps. Refugee-dwelling footprints and detailed information derived from satellite imagery are critical for a variety of applications, including humanitarian aid during disasters or conflicts. Nevertheless, extracting dwellings remains difficult due to their differing sizes, shapes, and location variations. In this study, we use U-Net and residual U-Net to deal with dwelling classification in a refugee camp in northern Cameroon, Africa. Specifically, two semantic segmentation networks are adapted and applied. A limited number of randomly divided sample patches is used to train and test the networks based on a single image of the WorldView-3 satellite. Our accuracy assessment was conducted using four different dwelling categories for classification purposes, using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1, and Kappa coefficient. As a result, F1 ranges from 81% to over 99% and approximately 88.1% to 99.5% based on the U-Net and the residual U-Net, respectively.

TI  - Geospatial Evaluation of Cropping Pattern and Cropping Intensity Using Multi Temporal Harmonized Product of Sentinel-2 Dataset on Google Earth Engine
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the declining land resources over the past few decades, the intensification of land uses has played a significant role in balancing the ever-increasing demand for food in developing nations such as India. To optimize agricultural land uses, one of the crucial indicators is cropping intensity, which measures the number of times a single parcel of land is farmed. Therefore, it is imperative to create a timely and accurate cropping intensity map so that landowners and agricultural planners can use it to determine the best course of action for the present and for the future. In the present study, we have developed an algorithm on Google Earth Engine (GEE) to depict cropping patterns and further fused it with a GIS environment to depict cropping intensity in the arid western plain zone of Rajasthan, India. A high-resolution multi-temporal harmonized product of the Sentinel-2 dataset was incorporated for depicting the growth cycle of crops for the year 2020-2021 using the greenest pixel composites. Kharif and Rabi accounted for 73.44% and 26.56% of the total cultivated area, respectively. Only 7.42% was under the double-cropped area to the total cultivated area. The overall accuracy of the classified image was 90%. For the Kharif crop, the accuracy was 95%, while for Rabi and the double-cropped region, the accuracy was 88%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.784. The present study was able to depict the seasonal plantation system in arid arable land with higher accuracy. The proposed work can be used to monitor cropping patterns and cost-effectively show cropping intensities.

TI  - Wall-to-Wall Mapping of Forest Biomass and Wood Volume Increment in Italy
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several political initiatives aim to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the twenty-first century. In this context, forests are crucial as a carbon sink to store unavoidable emissions. Assessing the carbon sequestration potential of forest ecosystems is pivotal to the availability of accurate forest variable estimates for supporting international reporting and appropriate forest management strategies. Spatially explicit estimates are even more important for Mediterranean countries such as Italy, where the capacity of forests to act as sinks is decreasing due to climate change. This study aimed to develop a spatial approach to obtain high-resolution maps of Italian forest above-ground biomass (ITA-BIO) and current annual volume increment (ITA-CAI), based on remotely sensed and meteorological data. The ITA-BIO estimates were compared with those obtained with two available biomass maps developed in the framework of two international projects (i.e., the Joint Research Center and the European Space Agency biomass maps, namely, JRC-BIO and ESA-BIO). The estimates from ITA-BIO, JRC-BIO, ESA-BIO, and ITA-CAI were compared with the 2nd Italian NFI (INFC) official estimates at regional level (NUT2). The estimates from ITA-BIO are in good agreement with the INFC estimates (R-2 = 0.95, mean difference = 3.8 t ha(-1)), while for JRC-BIO and ESA-BIO, the estimates show R-2 of 0.90 and 0.70, respectively, and mean differences of 13.5 and of 21.8 t ha(-1) with respect to the INFC estimates. ITA-CAI estimates are also in good agreement with the INFC estimates (R-2 = 0.93), even if they tend to be slightly biased. The produced maps are hosted on a web-based forest resources management Decision Support System developed under the project AGRIDIGIT (ForestView) and represent a key element in supporting the new Green Deal in Italy, the European Forest Strategy 2030 and the Italian Forest Strategy.

TI  - First record of trace element accumulation in a freshwater ectoparasite, <i>Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon</i> (Monogenea; Diplozoidae), infecting the gills of two yellowfish species, <i>Labeobarbus aeneus</i> and <i>Labeobarbus kimberleyensis</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRACE ELEMENTS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Elevated levels of trace elements in the aquatic environment poses risks to the health of biota and humans. Parasites are important components in ecosystems; responding to changes in the health of aquatic ecosystems and can accumulate trace elements in their tissues to higher levels than their hosts. Monogeneans are an important group of fish ectoparasites being directly exposed to the aquatic environment.Methods: In this study concentrations of Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb, Sr and Ag were analysed in the monogenean parasite, Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon (by total reflection x-ray fluorescence spectrometry and graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry), and the muscle, liver and gills of two host fish species, Labeobarbus aeneus and Labeobarbus kimberleyensis (by inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry).Results: Most striking was the accumulation pattern for Zn in parasites; mean levels of Zn were as high as 1448 and 1652 mg kg(-1) dw, respectively, with no significant difference between the two host-parasite groups, leading to bioconcentration factors of approximately 93 (parasite/fish muscle) and 15 (parasite/fish liver). In addition, Fe was accumulated in the parasite to a higher degree compared to the fish hosts' tissues. Cu levels were higher in P. ichthyoxanthon than in the muscle tissue of both host fishes, but lower than liver tissue.Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the usefulness of this parasite species as a sentinel organism in aquatic ecosystems it inhabits for Fe and Zn. Other trace elements under investigation were not accumulated higher in the parasite compared to its fish host. Lower Rb levels in the parasite compared to its hosts indicate no bio-magnification of this metal. Further investigations are required to determine if similar trends in trace element accumulation occur in other monogeneans. Data availability: All data generated in the analysis of host and parasite tissues are presented in the manuscript.

TI  - On the Dynamics of Waters in Kara-Bogaz-Gol (Satellite Information)
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Kara-Bogaz-Gol (KBG) is a hypersaline reservoir (with water salinity varying from 40 to 270 parts per thousand), which is an effective evaporator of water from the Caspian Sea entering in the bay through the strait of the same name. At the end of 2020, the water level in the bay, according to the HydroWEB LEGOS (France) system, dropped to -29.25 m BS, which is 0.75 m below the Caspian level. The area and volume of the bay at the same time amounted to approximately 17 300 km(2) and 60 km(3). The depth of the bay did not exceed 5-7 m. Sentinel-2 optical satellite images with spatial resolution of 10 m (four images from July 16 to July 31, 2021, and image from October 9, 2021), OLI Landsat-8 IR image (July 20, 2021, 100-m resolution), all MODIS_ Terra_Corrected Reflectance_True Color optical images available for 2021 (250-m resolution), IR images of the NOAA-15, -16, and -18 satellites in 2001-2005 (1-km resolution) and MODIS-Aqua image (a combination of RGB channels 1, 4, and 3) from October 2, 2005, were used to reveal the structure of the transformed Caspian waters at the exit from the strait, their manifestation in the temperature field, the routes of further propagation of the flow from the mixing zone, and the possibility of vortex formation in the waters of the bay. It is shown that water flows into the bay through numerous branches of the strait delta in jets, the boundaries of which are identified even at a distance of several kilometers from the channel. The temperature contrast between the water in the jets at the exit from the strait and in the bay in the summer season, when the water in the bay is warmer than the water in the Middle Caspian (especially during the period of intense upwelling near the eastern coast of the sea), can reach 10-11 degrees C. The direction of flow propagation with sharp frontal boundaries from the area of mixing of sea and bay waters is diverse: it can be directed (presumably depending on the wind direction) along the coast to the north or southeast, to have the shape of an elliptical lens with clear frontal boundaries against the background of the flow propagating along the coast or a mushroom shape oriented perpendicular to the coast. In KBG, eddy structures of different scales (from about 7 to 50 km) are observed in different parts of the water area both in the visible range of the spectrum and in IR images (the tracers are the difference in the color of the waters of the bay and the Caspian waters, turbidity, and temperature contrasts). The manifestation of the Langmuir circulation on the surface of the bay on October 9, 2021, with a distance between convergence lines of 50-100 m at a northeast wind of 3.3 m/s and an air temperature of 14.5 degrees C is considered.

TI  - De-implementation of Axillary Dissection in Women With Breast Cancer is Largely Driven By Site-level Contextual Effects
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective:To assess the contribution of unknown institutional factors (contextual effects) in the de-implementation of cALND in women with breast cancer. Summary of Background Data:Women included in the National Cancer Database with invasive breast carcinoma from 2012 to 2016 that underwent upfront lumpectomy and were found to have a positive sentinel node. Methods:A multivariable mixed effects logistic regression model with a random intercept for site was used to determine the effect of patient, tumor, and institutional variables on the risk of cALND. Reference effect measureswere used to describe and compare the contribution of contextual effects to the variation in cALND use to that of measured variables. Results:By 2016, cALND was still performed in at least 50% of the patients in a quarter of the institutions. Black race, younger women and those with larger or hormone negative tumors were more likely to undergo cALND. However, the width of the 90% reference effect measures range for the contextual effects exceeded that of the measured site, tumor, time, and patient demographics, suggesting institutional contextual effects were the major drivers of cALND de-implementation. For instance, a woman at an institution with low-risk of performing cALND would have 74% reduced odds of havinga cALND than if she was treated at a median-risk institution, while a patient at a high-risk institution had 3.91 times the odds. Conclusion:Compared to known patient, tumor, and institutional factors, contextual effects had a higher contribution to the variation in cALND use.

TI  - Modelling level I Axillary Lymph Nodes depth for Microwave Imaging
T2  - PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Patient-specific information on the depth of Axillary Lymph Nodes (ALNs) is important for the development of new diagnostic imaging technologies, e.g. Microwave Imaging (MWI), aiming to assess the diagnosis of ALNs during breast cancer staging. Studies about ALNs depth have been presented for treatment planning, but they lack information on sample size and usability of the data to infer the depth of ALNs. The aim of this study was to create a mathematical model that can be used to predict a depth interval where level I ALNs are likely to be located.Methods: We extracted biometric features of 98 patients who underwent breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to train two types of regression models. We then tested different combination of features to predict ALNs depth and found the best predictor. The final prediction models were then implemented in an algorithm used for MWI and tested with anthropomorphic phantoms of the axillary region.Results: Body Mass Index (BMI) was the feature with best performance to predict ALNs depth with coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.49 to 0.55 and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) ranging from 0.68 to 0.91 cm. The proposed model showed satisfactory results in microwave images of patients with different BMIs.Conclusions: The presented results contribute to the development of reconstruction algorithms for new imaging technologies and to the assessment of ALNs in other medical applications.

AB  - The optical sensors on satellites nowadays provide images covering large areas with a resolution better than 1 meter and with a frequency of more than once a week. This opens up new opportunities to utilize satellite-based information such as periodic monitoring of transport flows and parked vehicles for better transport, urban planning and decision making. Current vehicle detection methods face issues in selection of training data, utilization of augmented data, multivariate classification or complexity of the hardware. The pilot area is located in Prague in the surroundings of the Old Town Square. The WorldView3 panchromatic image with the best available spatial resolution was processed in ENVI, CATALYST Pro and ArcGIS Pro using SVM, KNN, PCA, RT and Faster R-CNN methods. Vehicle detection was relatively successful, above all in open public places with neither shade nor vegetation. The best overall performance was provided by SVM in ENVI, for which the achieved F1 score was 74%. The PCA method provided the worst results with an F1 score of 33%. The other methods achieved F1 scores ranging from 61 to 68%. Although vehicle detection using artificial intelligence on panchromatic images is more challenging than on multispectral images, it shows promising results. The following findings contribute to better design of object-based detection of vehicles in an urban environment and applications of data augmentation.

TI  - Evaluating Environmental Quality and Its Driving Force in Northeastern China Using the Remote Sensing Ecological Index
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the three major black soil regions in the world, northeastern China has an important strategic position there. Since the 20th century, the local environment has undergone great changes under the influence of the natural economy, and it is particularly important to quantitatively assess the degree of change. However, there have been few long-term quantitative studies of environmental spatial-temporal variances in the three northeastern provinces. Therefore, in this study, four typical remote sensing indices of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), normalized differential building-soil index (NDBSI) and wetness (WET) were employed to construct the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) using a principal component analysis (PCA) method based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in northeastern China. The spatiotemporal variations in the eco-environmental quality were detected using linear slope and M-K test, and the direct and interactive effects of different influencing factors on the RSEI changes during 2000-2020 were explored based on geographic detection. The results show that the interannual variations in the RSEI show a fluctuating upward trend, with an increase percentage of 12.45% in the last two decades, indicating that the ecological quality of northeast China has gradually improved. Furthermore, that the western and eastern Heilongjiang provinces and western Jilin provinces contributed substantially to the improvement of environmental quality, while the environmental quality of Jilin provinces and central Liaoning provinces decreased to varying degrees. Compared with 2000, the area with a fair environmental quality grade had the greatest change, and had decreased by 60.69%. This was followed by the area with an excellent quality grade, which increased by 117%. Land-use type had the greatest impact on environmental changes in northeastern China, but the impact degree gradually decreased, while the impact of socioeconomic factors such as the gross production of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery and population density on environmental quality gradually increased. The major reason for the decline of environmental quality in central Jilin and central Liaoning is that urbanization development had occupied a large amount of cropland. This shows that taking into account the virtuous cycle of an ecological environment while promoting urban and rural development may be an important task for northeastern China in the future.

AB  - The present study compares the spatial and temporal characteristics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) in Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) polar-orbiting satellite reprocessed outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) data and NOAA OLR data during 2011-2020. The spatial distributions of climatological mean and intraseasonal standard deviation of FY-3B OLR during boreal winter (November-April) and boreal summer (May-October) are highly consistent with those of NOAA OLR. The FY-3B and NOAA OLRs display highly consistent features in the wavenumber-frequency spectra, the occurrence frequency of MJO active days, the eastward propagation of MJO along the equator, and the interannual variability of MJO according to diagnoses using the all-season multivariate EOF analysis. These results indicate that the FY-3B OLR produced by the polar-orbiting satellites is of high quality and worthy of global application.

TI  - Detection of iron-bearing mineral assemblages in Nainarmalai granulite region, south India, based on satellite image processing and geochemical anomalies
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although India's large iron ore reserves are well known, there are still few studies and research on iron ore prospecting in smaller deposits or the deposits with lower grade. Remote sensing concepts are useful to target for mineral exploration, since it covers a large area at low cost. In this research spectral remote sensing and digital image processing of ASTER data to locate and delineate the regions with iron oxide-bearing soils in granulite terrain at Nainnarmalai (southern India) that has hypothetical reserve 8.2 million tons of iron in sub-surface banded magnetite quartzites. The image-based study component involved pre-processing atmospheric correction and processing of the image data reminiscent of band ratio and band mixture to locate iron-bearing soils. We used blending of bands 5/3 + 1/2 to delineate ferrous iron oxide, band combination of 2/1 to delineate ferric iron oxide, and band ratio of 5/4 to delineate the lateritic soil. Further, the linear spectral unmixing outcome of ASRER data was evaluated concerning the ground truth of geochemical compositions of samples from the study area. Our results showed that image processing of the ASTER satellite data has the potential to delineate ferric, ferrous, and lateritic mineral assemblages in the iron-bearing soils with minimal requirement of ground truth verification. This research work aided in increasing trust in the use of space-based data for mineral prospecting. Image processing has demonstrated that ASTER data can be used to enhance iron ore exploration and the discovery of new mineralized areas.

TI  - Satellite Mapping of Urban Air Overheating Risk (Case Study of Helsinki, Finland)
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm is proposed and a methodology is developed for satellite mapping of the risks (probabilities) of exceeding of the minimum mortality temperature by the average daily air temperature. Knowledge of these risks makes it possible to map the economic damage in cities from the increase in the number of deaths caused by overheating. The urgency of the problem is determined by the observed global warming. The city of Helsinki (Finland) is chosen as the object of the study. A series of 32 infrared scenes from Landsat satellites and the results of standard observations at the WMO ID 2978 and METAR EFHK Vantaa (airport) urban weather stations for the period 2007-2019 are used for the study. A map of the risk of exceeding the minimum mortality temperature as a result of urban overheating is created for the city of Helsinki. The heterogeneity of the spatial distribution of risks is shown. Industrial areas are characterized by high risks of overheating of the urban environment, while in recreational areas the risks are minimal. It is noted that the obtained results can be used as information support of the management decision-making system aimed at early countering of threats to environmental security due to overheating of the urban environment as a result of global warming.

T2  - CIVIL AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current research represents a pilot study for application of the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) for an area with forests in Bulgaria. It is the first of its kind when it comes to forest studying in the country to the best knowledge of the author. When it comes to soil background Landsat images and other spectral data may be used for monitoring forest territories as well. The study area is Pernik Province which is located in the western parts of Bulgaria. The main aim is to investigate the PVI for the forests of Pernik Province. The index has been calculated by the application of Landsat 8 bands. The PVI has been processed for several months of different years. The main focus is both on the beginning and the end of the growing season when there are significant changes in leaf biomass. The results are promising and show typical vegetation features in the beginning of the growing season (April), a well-developed vegetation (July) and a steadily decreasing biomass in November.

AB  - The Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) represents a vegetation index that allows for making analysis. The index is not that sensitive to atmospheric effects. GEMI has been applied for the investigation of disruptions in the coniferous forests in Pernik Province, which is situated in the western parts of Bulgaria. The basic data comes from Landsat 8 and Corine Land Cover. The results of the study show that the index performs well in the distinguishment of broad-leaved vegetation from the coniferous one. At the same time the index doesn't always provide satisfying results when it comes to deforestation. In conclusion GEMI provides good results, yet it's use should be controlled and supported by other vegetation indices.

TI  - A New Automated Ship Wake Detector for Small and Go-Fast Ships in Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of maritime surveillance with satellite imagery, ship detection with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is largely successful with the exception of those cases where the target Radar Cross Section (RCS) results very low and hard to detect. The paper presents an automatic algorithm that tackles the problem of ship detection in situations where the ship's RCS is not measurable but its wake is. At this purpose, the algorithm proposed uses a combination of image processing techniques in order to identify ships exclusively by detecting the wakes they leave behind. Once a ship is identified through its wake, its position in the image, its heading and its speed are determined. The algorithm was developed, tested and validated on SAR imagery from the European Space Agency mission Sentinel-1; the results are here presented and discussed. The algorithm was validated on a total of 43 images and resulted in a ship detection rate of 93% with wakes' components recognized in more than 80% of the cases analysed.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Supported Flood Forecasting of Urbanized Watersheds-A Case Study in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has significant impacts on watershed hydrology, but previous studies have been confirmatory and not comprehensive; in particular, few studies have addressed the impact of urbanization on flooding in highly urbanized watersheds. In this study, this effect is studied in Chebei Creek, a highly urbanized watershed in the Pearl River Delta, southern China. Landsat satellite images acquired in 2015 were used to estimate land use and cover changes using the Decision Tree (DT) C4.5 classification algorithm, while the Liuxihe model, a physically based distributed hydrological model (PBDHM), is employed to simulate watershed flooding and hydrological processes. For areas with high degrees of urbanization, the duration of the flood peak is only 1 h, and the flood water level shows steep rises and falls. These characteristics increase the difficulty of flood modeling and forecasting in urbanized areas. At present, hydrological research in urbanized watersheds generally focuses on the quantitative simulation of runoff from urban areas to the watershed, flood flows, peak flood flow, and runoff depth. Few studies have involved real-time flood forecasting in urbanized watersheds. To achieve real-time flood forecasting in urbanized watersheds, PBDHMs and refined underlying surface data based on remote sensing technology are necessary. The Liuxihe model is a PBDHM that can meet the accuracy requirements of inflow flood forecasting for reservoir flood control operations. The accuracies of the two flood forecasting methods used in this study were 83.95% and 97.06%, showing the excellent performance of the Liuxihe model for the real-time flood forecasting of urbanized rivers such as the Chebei Creek watershed.

TI  - Analyzing Rainfall Threshold for Shallow Landslides Using Physically Based Modeling in Rasuwa District, Nepal
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - On 25 April 2015, an M7.8 large earthquake happened in Nepal, and 4312 landslides were triggered during or after the earthquake. The 2015 earthquake happened years ago, but the risk of rainfall-induced landslides is still high. Rainfall-induced shallow landslides threaten both human lives and economy development, especially in the Rasuwa area. Due to financial conditions and data availability, a regional-scale rainfall threshold can be an effective method to reduce the risk of shallow landslides. A physically based model was used with limited data. The dynamic hydrological model provides the soil moisture and groundwater change, and the infinite slope stability model produces the factor of safety. Remote sensing data, field investigation, soil sample tests, and literature review were used in the model parameterization. The landslide stability condition of 2016 was simulated. In addition, intensity-antecedent rainfall thresholds were defined based on the physically based modelling output. Sixty groups of data were used for validation, and the 15-day intensity-antecedent rainfall threshold has the best performance with an accuracy of 88.33%.

AB  - Digital papillary adenocarcinoma (DPA) is a rare but locally aggressive eccrine tumour that has metastatic potential and most frequently found in the upper extremity. It usually presents as an unremarkable swelling of the skin, commonly misdiagnosed as a benign lesion. We present a 67-year-old male who presented with a slowly growing mass of the right middle finger that was biopsied and diagnosed with DPA. The patient was treated with wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy by us during the same operative encounter. This report highlights the need for increased clinical vigilance to diagnose DPAs, and that WLE and sentinel lymph node biopsies can be safe and effective treatments offered.

TI  - Shallow Water Bathymetry Mapping from ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 Based on BP Neural Network Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate shallow water bathymetry data are essential for coastal construction and management, marine traffic, and shipping. With the development of remote sensing satellites and sensors, the satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) method has been widely used for bathymetry in shallow water areas. However, traditional satellite bathymetry requires in-situ bathymetric data. Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) with the advanced high-resolution topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS) provides a new technical tool and makes up for the shortcomings of traditional bathymetric methods in shallow waters. In this study, a new method is proposed to automatically detect photons reflected from the shallow seafloor with ICESat-2 altimetry data. Two satellite bathymetry models were trained, to obtain shallow water depth from Sentinel-2 satellite images. First, sea surface and seafloor signal photons from ICESat-2 were detected in the Oahu (in the U.S. Hawaiian Islands) and St. Thomas (in the U.S. Virgin Islands) sampling areas, to obtain water depths along the surface track. The results show that the RMSE is between 0.35 and 0.71 m and the R-2 is greater than 0.92, when compared to the airborne LiDAR bathymetry (ALB) data in the field. Second, the ICESat-2 bathymetric points from Oahu Island are used to train the Back Propagation (BP) neural network model and obtain the SDB. The RMSE is between 0.97 and 1.43 m and the R-2 is between 0.90 and 0.96, which are better than the multi-band ratio model with RMSE of 1.03-1.57 m and R-2 of 0.89-0.95. The results show that the BP neural network model can effectively improve bathymetric accuracy, when compared to the traditional multi-band ratio model. This approach can obtain shallow water bathymetry more easily, without the in-situ bathymetric data. Therefore, it extends to a greater extent with the free ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 satellite data for bathymetry in shallow water areas, such as coastal, island and inland water bodies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation on land use and land cover and its drivers under watershed management activities in Becho, Central Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL & SOCIO-ECONOMIC STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The study sought to understand the spatio-temporal variation of land use and land cover (LULC) and its drivers under watershed management activities in Becho district, in Ethiopia's Central Highlands. To gain a better comprehension of the subject, two micro watersheds were chosen to test the effectiveness of watershed management activities (treated-Shankur Tareqo and untreated-Mende Tufessa). LULC changes were detected using aerial photography (1973), and satellite images from Landsat 5 TM (1990), Spot 5 (2005), and Landsat 8 OLI (2021) obtained from the Ethiopian Geospatial Information Institute and the United States Geological Survey. In addition, key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD) were used to elicit LULC drivers. Between 1973 and 2021, the total area of woodland, and cultivated and rural settlement land LULC classes in the treated micro-watershed decreased by 24.65% (171.9 ha) and 7.34% (759 ha), respectively. Though, grassland, forestland, and barrenland increased by 30.83% (179.52 ha), 1% (3 ha), and 183.14% (755.28 ha), respectively. The overall area of LULC class for woodland, grassland, forestland, and cultivated and rural settlement decreased by 50.36% (316.16 ha), 41.23% (196.46 ha), 2.43% (11.85 ha), and 1.35% (138.6 ha), respectively, in the untreated micro-watershed, while barrenland increased by 175.86% (666.55 ha). According to KII and FGD, the drivers of LULC changes were identified as the expansion of cultivated land, population pressure, and government policy. According to the findings, local-scale watershed management activities was not as effective as expected. As a result, in order to achieve the desired outcome, the concerned stakeholders should reconsider how watershed management activities is undertaken.

TI  - A Novel Approach Based on Machine Learning and Public Engagement to Predict Water-Scarcity Risk in Urban Areas
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change, population growth and urban sprawl have put a strain on water supplies across the world, making it difficult to meet water demand, especially in city regions where more than half of the world's population now reside. Due to the complex urban fabric, conventional techniques should be developed to diagnose water shortage risk (WSR) by engaging crowdsourcing. This study aims to develop a novel approach based on public participation (PP) with a geographic information system coupled with machine learning (ML) in the urban water domain. The approach was used to detect (WSR) in two ways, namely, prediction using ML models directly and using the weighted linear combination (WLC) function in GIS. Five types of ML algorithm, namely, support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron, K-nearest neighbour, random forest and naive Bayes, were incorporated for this purpose. The Shapley additive explanation model was added to analyse the results. The Water Evolution and Planning system was also used to predict unmet water demand as a relevant criterion, which was aggregated with other criteria. The five algorithms that were used in this work indicated that diagnosing WSR using PP achieved good-to-perfect accuracy. In addition, the findings of the prediction process achieved high accuracy in the two proposed techniques. However, the weights of relevant criteria that were extracted by SVM achieved higher accuracy than the weights of the other four models. Furthermore, the average weights of the five models that were applied in the WLC technique increased the prediction accuracy of WSR. Although the uncertainty ratio was associated with the results, the novel approach interpreted the results clearly, supporting decision makers in the proactive exploration processes of urban WSR, to choose the appropriate alternatives at the right time.

TI  - Environmental Risk Assessment in the Hindu Kush Himalayan Mountains of Northern Pakistan: Palas Valley, Kohistan
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover in the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) mountains of northern Pakistan has changed dramatically due to community dynamics such as population growth, household dynamics, and intensive economic activity for people's livelihoods. Demographic development is one of the major factors influencing forest cover change in a previously sparsely populated environment. An abrupt upsurge in population exerts adverse effects on the local natural resources, specifically forests. The present research shows an increase in population from 1980 to 2017, the development of human settlements, and a long-term decline in forest cover. This study was conducted in the Palas valley in the HKH mountains using GIS and remote sensing (RS) technology. Analysis of the changes between 1980, 2000, and 2017 was done using ArcGIS and the maximum likelihood algorithm for supervised classification of Landsat MSS TM ETM+ and Sentinel 2A satellite images. We used Euclidean distances and buffer analysis techniques to identify that most changes occurred within 1 to 3 km of the settlement's proximity in each period. We also found changes in forest cover to be much greater near settlements than elsewhere in the study area. According to the findings of the study, population explosion and other socio-economic factors have imposed excessive pressure on vegetation cover, resulting in the loss of 17,076 ha of forests in the remote Palas valley.

TI  - Damage Assessment in Rural Environments Following Natural Disasters Using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The damage caused by natural disasters in rural areas differs in nature extent, landscape, and structure, from the damage caused in urban environments. Previous and current studies have focused mainly on mapping damaged structures in urban areas after catastrophic events such as earthquakes or tsunamis. However, research focusing on the level of damage or its distribution in rural areas is lacking. This study presents a methodology for mapping, characterizing, and assessing the damage in rural environments following natural disasters, both in built-up and vegetation areas, by combining synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data. As a case study, we applied the methodology to characterize the rural areas affected by the Sulawesi earthquake and the subsequent tsunami event in Indonesia that occurred on 28 September 2018. High-resolution COSMO-SkyMed images obtained pre- and post-event, alongside Sentinel-2 images, were used as inputs. This study's results emphasize that remote sensing data from rural areas must be treated differently from that of urban areas following a disaster. Additionally, the analysis must include the surrounding features, not only the damaged structures. Furthermore, the results highlight the applicability of the methodology for a variety of disaster events, as well as multiple hazards, and can be adapted using a combination of different optical and SAR sensors.

AB  - A 61-year-old woman was found to have calcifications in the CD region of the left breast. She had previously undergone total hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy for endometriosis at the age of 37 years. Since age 59 years, she had been attending an otorhinolaryngology clinic because of vertigo. Blood tests showed no abnormal findings. Left breast cancer (cT1N0M0, stage Ⅰ)was diagnosed, and left mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. She developed postoperative nausea, and at 37 hours postoperatively, she was unable to communicate and exhibited suspected delirium. At 43 hours postoperatively a tonic-clonic seizure occurred. Hyponatremia, with serum sodium of 114 mEq/L, was present. Sodium supplementation was provided, and the patient became capable of communication 8 hours after seizure onset(Na 121 mEq/L). A hyponatremic tonic-clonic seizure is extremely rare after breast cancer surgery, and the abnormal behavior of the present patient 31 hours after surgery was also highly unusual. With such an unusual presentation, the possibility that something specific is happening must be considered. This case gave us the opportunity to review patient management after breast cancer surgery, emergency response and preparations, and nursing education from the medical safety perspective.

TI  - Trends in Forest Greening and Its Spatial Correlation with Bioclimatic and Environmental Factors in the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2001 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding trends of vegetation evolution and its spatial characteristics is critical for sustainable social development in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), which is densely populated and still has uneven economic development. Through Theil-Sen/Mann-Kendall tests, polynomial regression and bivariate local autocorrelation analyses, we investigated vegetation greening trends and their spatial correlation with bioclimatic and environmental variables. The study yielded the following results: (1) Land cover in the GMS has changed significantly over the last 20 years. Conversion between forest and grassland was the main type of change. (2) The upward trend in the forest enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly exceeded the downward trend in countries over 20 years. In GMS, the spatial variation in forest trend slope values ranged from -0.0297 a(-1) to 0.0152 a(-1). (3) Anthropogenic activities have played an important role in forest greening; planted, plantation and oil palm forests exhibit the largest contributions to greening. (4) Changes in forest EVI were most spatially correlated with radiation (12.19% for surface net solar radiation and 12.14% for surface solar radiation downwards) and least spatially correlated with seasonality precipitation (8.33%) and mean annual temperature (8.19%). The results of the analysis of EVI trends in vegetation and their spatial correlation with bioclimatic and environmental variables can provide a reference for strategies aimed for protecting the vegetation ecology.

TI  - Evaluation of Mangrove Wetlands Protection Patterns in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Using Time-Series Landsat Imageries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection of mangroves through nature reserves has been demonstrated to be effective. There were many studies evaluating the mangrove protection effect. However, the evaluation of mangrove growth quality with positive or negative growth trends, as well as restoration potential against disturbance in nature reserves, is still lacking. Thus, this study proposed a hierarchical evaluation framework for mangrove protection in nature reserves, which takes long-term metrics at three levels of loss and gain areas, patch pattern dynamics, and pixel growth trends into account. The continuous change detection and classification (CCDC) was utilized to identify the change condition of mangroves in six nature reserves of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. The Entropy Weight Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was utilized for scores evaluation of protection effort comparison from 2000 to 2020. The study results had the following three main findings. Firstly, the mangrove forest area increased by about 294.66 ha in four reserves and slightly decreased by about 58.86 ha in two. Most reserves showed an improved patches intact pattern and more positive growth trends. Secondly, the establishment of nature reserves and afforestation were the main causes of mangrove area gain. Until 2010, aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development were the biggest threats to mangroves. Finally, the protection of the reserves was successful in the early decades, but the general evaluation scores showed a decline in recent years once we considered the growth trends for quality. The proposed hierarchical evaluation methods provide a new sight to research the impacts of abrupt change and protection resilience status of the gradual restoration of nature reserves.

TI  - Estimating surface runoff using the curve number method in an ungauged watershed in Jalisco, Mexico evaluating its morphometric parameters
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface runoff was estimated using the curve number (CN) method for different storm events, and it was associated with the morphometric parameters of an ungauged watershed in Jalisco, Mexico. We deri-ved the land use and land cover map for the year 2019 from the unsupervised classification of a Sentinel-2 image at 10 m resolution. The morphometric analysis revealed that the study area is dominated by areas of gentle slope and moderate to high permeability with dense vegetation and low relief. It is a well-drained watershed with low Hood potentiality besides a groundwater potential zone. About 69% of the study area corresponds to natural cover with tropical dry forest and evergreen forest as the most representative classes. The number of storm events identified from 2013 to 2019 was 77, with runoffs ranging from 0.05 to 227.2 Mm(3). September and October were the months with the most intense rainfall and, therefore, the months with the highest runoff volume. The average runoff was 14.52 Mm(3), corresponding to an average runoff coefficient of 12.86%. Together, the methods used here provide useful results for delineating conservation strategies at the watershed level.

TI  - Research on the Impact of Water Conservancy Projects on Downstream Floodplain Wetlands-Taking Yimin River as an Example
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Continued construction of reservoirs around the world promotes socio-economic development and severely affects the ecological and hydrological processes of rivers and floodplain wetlands. In this study, the Yimin River in Inner Mongolia, China, was taken as the research area. The water inundation guarantee rate (WIGR) was used as the model basis to characterize the inundation probability of the floodplain area. The comparative study of the remote sensing data of the 38 periods before the construction of the reservoir, and the 14 periods after the construction of the reservoir, shows that: due to the impact of the reservoir construction, the submerged area of the water body (WIGR greater than zero) decreased from 49.03 km(2) to 39.32 km(2), a total reduction of 9.71 km(2); the very low water inundation guarantee rate area (WIGR value of 0-20%) was the most affected, with a decrease of 12.14 km(2), while the area of other areas with a WIGR value greater than 20% increased by 3.43 km(2). In addition, the affected floodplain wetlands have significant spatial distribution characteristics: first, they are mainly distributed in the high-curvature river reach areas, and in this study 77.96% of the three high-curvature river reach areas accounted for 26.04% of the area, with area loss in very low WIGR areas; the second is that it is distributed far from the outside of the river channel, while the WIGR value in some areas near the river channel is increased. This study provides a technical reference for downstream wetland protection based on the WIGR model.

TI  - Deriving Ionospheric Sporadic E Intensity From FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC and FY-3C Radio Occultation Measurements
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The total electron content (TEC) profiles from the FORMOsa SATellite mission-3/Constellation Observing System for the Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) and the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) radio occultation (RO) missions during 2006 and 2019 are used to establish the models for deriving the ionospheric sporadic E (Es) critical frequency (foEs). S-max is derived as the maximum vertical gradient of TEC disturbance, which is extracted from a RO TEC profile using the singular spectrum analysis method. Three candidate conversion models are obtained by fitting S-max with foEs observed by collocated ionosondes, and the one with the best performance, the COSMIC & FY-3C (CF) model, is applied for deriving foEs (foEs(CF)) from the TEC data of the two missions jointly. For comparison, the C model, which is of similar form as the CF model while being established without using the FY-3C data, is applied for deriving foEs (foEs(C)) from the COSMIC TEC data only. The validations over four independent ionosonde stations demonstrate that mean improvements of 0.11 MHz (32%) in the absolute bias and 0.24 MHz (17%) in the root mean square error are obtained by foEs(CF) compared with foEs(C). The spatiotemporal distributions of Es intensity during 2015 and 2019, presented respectively by foEs(CF) and foEs(C), are further compared. The CF model provides more abundant and more detailed information about Es intensity distribution, which is most distinct at high latitudes where the contribution of FY-3C RO TEC data is significant. Our results reveal that with the aging of the COSMIC satellites, FY-3C TEC data is a valuable supplementary RO data source for Es-related studies. Plain Language SummaryIonospheric sporadic E (Es) layers have significant impacts on radio communication and the propagation of global navigation satellite system signals, and the degrees of the impacts are closed related to the distributions and the intensity of Es layers. The radio occultation (RO) total electron content (TEC) profiles can be used for detecting the existence and the intensity of Es layers due to that the Es layers can bring to sudden enhancements of TEC values. In this study, based on the TEC data from FORMOsa SATellite mission-3/Constellation Observing System for the Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) and Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) RO missions and the collocated ionosonde observations during 2006 and 2019, an optimal model for deriving the Es intensity is promoted, and is compared with another model established using the same method but without using the FY-3C data. The model using the FY-3C data shows a better performance for deriving the Es intensity and provides more abundant and more detailed information about Es intensity distributions, especially in high-latitude regions. The results contribute to understanding the value of FY-3C RO TEC data for Es layer-related studies, which is most significant during the last years of COSMIC mission lifespan, when the aging of the satellites brings to the decline in the COSMIC RO data volume.

TI  - Study on Retrievals of Ocean Wave Spectrum by Spaceborne SAR in Ice-Covered Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea ice in the Arctic is retreating rapidly and ocean waves may accelerate the process by interacting with sea ice. Though Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has shown great capability of imaging waves in ice, there are few attempts to retrieve the ocean wave spectrum (OWS) by SAR in ice-covered areas. In this study, based on the previously developed nonlinear inversion scheme, i.e., the Max Planck Institute (MPI) scheme, and the Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired in the Barents Sea, ocean wave spectra were retrieved by using the different combinations of modulation transfer functions (MTFs) in the MPI scheme: (1) using the same MTFs as those used in open water; (2) by neglecting both the hydrodynamic and tilt modulations; (3) by neglecting the hydrodynamic modulation but involving a newly fitted tilt modulation over ice for HH-polarized SAR data. We compared the simulated SAR image spectra based on the retrievals with the observational SAR image spectra to quantify their respective performances. The comparisons suggest that neglecting hydrodynamic modulation can significantly improve the retrievals. The remaining tilt modulation can further improve the retrievals, particularly for range-travelling waves. This study enhances the understanding of the principles of SAR imaging waves in ice and provides basics for retrievals of ocean wave spectra by SAR data in ice-covered areas.

TI  - Assessment of the Impact of Rubber Plantation Expansion on Regional Carbon Storage Based on Time Series Remote Sensing and the InVEST Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber plantations in southeast Asia have grown at an unprecedented rate in recent decades, leading to drastic changes in regional carbon storage. To this end, this study proposes a systematic approach for quantitatively estimating and assessing the impact of rubber expansions on regional carbon storage. First, using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, the distributions of forest and rubber, respectively, were extracted. Then, based on the Landsat time series (1999-2019) remote sensing data, the stand age estimation of rubber plantations was studied with the improved shapelet algorithm. On this basis, the Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model (InVEST) was applied to assess the regional carbon density and storage. Finally, by setting up two scenarios of actual planting and hypothetical non-planting of rubber forests, the impact of the carbon storage under these two scenarios was explored. The results of the study showed the following: (1) The area of rubber was 1.28 x 10(5) ha in 2019, mainly distributed at an elevation of 200-400 m (accounting for 78.47% of the total of rubber). (2) The average age of rubber stands was 13.85 years, and the total newly established rubber plantations were converted from cropland and natural forests, accounting for 54.81% and 45.19%, respectively. (3) With the expansion of rubber plantations, the carbon density increased from only 2.25 Mg center dot C/ha in 1999 to more than 15 Mg center dot C/ha in 2018. Among them, the carbon sequestration increased dramatically when the cropland was replaced by rubber, while deforestation and replacement of natural forests will cause a significant decrease. (4) The difference between the actual and the hypothetical carbon storage reached -0.15 million tons in 2018, which means that the expansion of rubber led to a decline in carbon storage in our study area. These research findings can provide a theoretical basis and practical application for sustainable regional rubber forest plantation and management, carbon balance maintenance, and climate change stabilization.

TI  - Research and Application of the Calibration of the Ground Radiometer in Dunhuang Test
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - When the satellite is in orbit for a long time,the remote sensor will be affected by factors such as the space environment and the aging of components, which will cause the phenomenon of radiation response decay. To meet the quantitative requirements of satellite data and the monitoring of remote sensor performance change, continuous and precise calibration of remote sensors is required. At present,the vicarious calibration based on the reflectance-based method is widely used. A large area of uniform and stable targets are used as the radiometric calibration site. When the satellite transit,the surface reflectance and atmospheric parameters of the site are synchronously measured manually,and the apparent reflectance is calculated in combination with the radiative transfer model,to obtain the calibration coefficient of the satellite sensors. It takes much time,manpower,material and financial resources to complete an effective calibration test. At the same time,due to the limitations of weather conditions,the calibration frequency is basically maintained at the level of once a year. With the increase in the number and types of optical satellites,the radiometric calibration based on the traditional vicarious calibration method can not meet the needs of remote sensing quantification in time. In recent years,a method of automated vicarious calibration based on high frequency, high precision, low cost and other considerations has been adopted internationally. This method uses unattended and automated observation equipment to measure the surface reflectance and atmospheric parameters and combines with the radiation transfer model to realize the high-time calibration of remote sensors. The automated vicarious calibration observation network such as the Radiometric Calibration Network and the Automated Vicarious Calibration System has been deployed in Railroad Valley Playa in the United States,La Crau in France,Baotou in China,Dunhuang in China,etc. for satellite calibration and verification. Surface reflectance is an important parameter for automated vicarious calibration. Considering the long-term field observation and operation stability,the channel-type radiometer is usually used. The automated test-site radiometer is the core equipment of the automatic vicarious calibration system in the Dunhuang radiometric calibration test site, which provides surface reflectance parameters. In order to ensure the high- precision measurement of reflectance in the long-term automated vicarious calibration process, the high-precision calibration of the automated test-site radiometer is generally completed in the laboratory. The calibration process needs to be completed by returning to the laboratory. The long calibration cycle will cause the loss of observation data,and long-distance transportation vibration will also affect the calibration accuracy.The damage to the automated testsite radiometer observation area caused by manual mobilization,installation and disassembly will seriously affect its consistency with the satellite transit observation area. In addition, light sources standard lamp and sun are used for instrument calibration and surface reflectance calculation, respectively in the satellite automated vicarious calibration. There are differences in spectral distribution between the two. To solve these problems,the on-site calibration method of the channel-type automated test-site radiometer was studied.The automatic observation data of the hyperspectral irradiance meter was introduced into the solar-radiation-based calibration method to calculate the sky diffuse illuminance. The acquisition methods and calculation processes of light source,aerosol optical thickness,diffuse to total ratio and other parameters used in the calibration of the automated test-site radiometer and satellite automated vicarious calibration were consistent. The solar-radiation-based calibration method is used to calculate the calibration coefficient and surface reflectance,and the calculated surface reflectance is compared with the manually measured surface reflectance using ASD spectrometer. Then the uncertainty of surface reflectance calculation is analyzed. The results show that the relative deviation between the reflectance of the automated test-site radiometer calculated by the solar-radiation-based calibration method and the reflectance of artificial ASD measurement is better than 1.4%, and the uncertainty of reflectance calculation is better than 2.78%similar to 4.35%. Solar-radiation- based calibration method has high accuracy and system advantages in practical application. The calibration coefficient of the automated test-site radiometer calculated by the solarradiation-based calibration method is applied to the satellite's automatic vicarious calibration. The automatic vicarious calibration results in recent three years are in good agreement with the AQUA/MODIS on- board calibration coefficient. The relative deviation of single calibration of each channel is basically within 5%, and the average percentage deviation is better than 3.58%. It can monitor and track the operation of satellite load,and verify the effectiveness and applicability of the SRBC method.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Risk Prediction Tool to Identify People at Greater Risk of Having Hepatitis C among Drug Users
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: People who use drugs (PWUD) are among those with the highest risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents offer an opportunity to eliminate HCV. A simple tool for the prediction of HCV infection risk in PWUD is urgently needed. This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction tool to identify people at greater risk of having hepatitis C among PWUD that is applicable in resource-limited settings. Methods: We extracted data from national HIV/AIDS sentinel surveillance in PWUD (Zhejiang Province, 2016-2021) and developed and validated a risk score to improve HCV testing in PWUD. This risk score consists of seven risk factors identified using multivariable logistic regression modeling (2016-2020, exploratory group). We validated this score using surveillance data for 2021 (validation group). The accuracy of the model was determined using C-statistics. Results: We identified seven risk factors, including sex, age, marital status, educational attainment, and the use of heroin, morphine, and methamphetamine. In the exploratory group, the positive rates of detecting the HCV antibody in the low-risk (0-9 points), intermediate-risk (10-16 points), and high-risk (>= 17 points) groups were 6.72%, 17.24%, and 38.02%, respectively (P-trend < 0.001). In the validation group, the positive rates in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 4.46%, 12.23%, and 38.99%, respectively (P-trend < 0.001). Conclusions: We developed and validated a drug-specific risk prediction tool for identifying PWUD at increased risk of HCV infection. This tool can complement and integrate the screening strategy for the purpose of early diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - A review on digital mapping of soil carbon in cropland: progress, challenge, and prospect
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cropland soil carbon not only serves food security but also contributes to the stability of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool due to the strong interconnection with atmospheric carbon dioxide. Therefore, the better monitoring of soil carbon in cropland is helpful for carbon sequestration and sustainable soil management. However, severe anthropogenic disturbance in cropland mainly in gentle terrain creates uncertainty in obtaining accurate soil information with limited sample data. Within the past 20 years, digital soil mapping has been recognized as a promising technology in mapping soil carbon. Herein, to advance existing knowledge and highlight new directions, the article reviews the research on mapping soil carbon in cropland from 2005 to 2021. There is a significant shift from linear statistical models to machine learning models because nonlinear models may be more efficient in explaining the complex soil-environment relationship. Climate covariates and parent material play an important role in soil carbon on the regional scale, while on a local scale, the variability of soil carbon often depends on topography, agricultural management, and soil properties. Recently, several kinds of agricultural covariates have been explored in mapping soil carbon based on survey or remote sensing technique, while, obtaining agricultural covariates with high resolution remains a challenge. Based on the review, we concluded several challenges in three categories: sampling, agricultural covariates, and representation of soil processes in models. We thus propose a conceptual framework with four future strategies: representative sampling strategies, establishing standardized monitoring and sharing system to acquire more efficient crop management information, exploring time-series sensing data, as well as integrating pedological knowledge into predictive models. It is intended that this review will support prospective researchers by providing knowledge clusters and gaps concerning the digital mapping of soil carbon in cropland.

TI  - Trend of Vegetation and Environmental Factors and Their Feedback in the Karst Regions of Southwestern China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a vital role in the terrestrial ecosystem. Vegetation variations not only result from climatic and environmental change but also feed back to the climate through biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes. Previous studies have mainly focused on the influence of environmental factors on vegetation changes, but the interactions between vegetation and the prevalent environmental factors in the karst areas of southwestern China have been poorly understood. Based on remote sensing data, this study used trend analysis and Granger causality analysis to investigate vegetation trends, the driving factors, and their interactions during the period 2001 to 2021. In summary, we explored how these factors influenced vegetation growth and how vegetation changes fed back to produce ecosystems and environmental variations in southwestern China during this period. The results showed improvements in water conditions as well as a vegetation greening trend in most of the regions of southwestern China, together with a weakening trend of rocky desertification and an increasing trend of vegetation growth during the period. Both terrestrial water storage and vegetation growth in the energy-limited alpine regions are sensitive to temperature. Natural restoration is suggested in this area. Vegetation growth in the karst areas is sensitive to water stress-related variables due to the particular geological and soil characteristics. The bidirectional causality relationship between vegetation greening and the environment factors in many of these areas indicates that the vegetation changes can also significantly affect water balance and conditions. Ecological engineering projects are suggested in this area. The vegetation growth in the SC Basin, HN, HB, GD, and eastern GX is also sensitive to water stress, while these regions are vulnerable to waterlogging. This study helps to improve our understanding of ecosystem management and promote sustainable development in southwestern China.

TI  - An Improved Exponential Model Considering a Spectrally Effective Moisture Threshold for Proximal Hyperspectral Reflectance Simulation and Soil Salinity Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization has become one of the main factors restricting sustainable development of agriculture. Field spectrometry provides a quick way to predict the soil salinization. However, soil moisture content (SMC) seriously interferes with the spectral information of saline soil in arid areas. It is vital to establish a model that is insensitive to SMC for potential in situ field applications. The soil spectral reflectance exponential model (SSREM) has been widely employed for reflectance simulation and SSC inversion. However, its reliability for saline soils with high SMC has not been verified yet. Based on hyperspectral remote sensing data (400 similar to 1000 nm) on 459 saline soil samples in Shiyang River Basin of Northwest China, we investigated the role of SMC and SSC in soil spectral reflectance from 29 October 2020 to 22 January 2021. Targeted at saline soils, soil spectral moisture threshold (MT) was introduced to improve the SSREM toward a modified spectral reflectance exponential model (MT-SSREM). The bands that are sensitive to SSC but not sensitive to SMC were obtained based on a method of correlation analysis between original spectra, four kinds of spectral data, and SSC. SSREM and MT-SSREM were finally applied to inversely estimate SSC. Results show that wavelengths at 658 similar to 660, 671 similar to 685, 938 nm were suitable for SSC estimation. Furthermore, although SSREM was able to simulate the spectral reflectance of most saline soils, its simulation accuracy was low for saline soil samples with high SMC (SMC > MT(i), 400 nm <= i <= 1000 nm), while MT-SSREM performed well over the whole range of SMC. The simulated spectral reflectance from MT-SSREM agreed well with the measured reflectance, with the R-2 being generally larger than 0.9 and RMSE being less than 0.1. More importantly, MT-SSREM performed substantially better than SSREM for SSC estimation; in the statistical performance of the former case, R-2 was in range of 0.60 similar to 0.66, RMSE was in range of 0.29 similar to 0.33 dS m(-1); in the latter case, R-2 was in range of 0.10 similar to 0.16, RMSE was in the range of 0.26 similar to 0.29 dS m(-1). MT-SSREM proposed in this study thus provides a new direction for estimating hyperspectral reflectance and SSC under various soil moisture conditions at wavelengths from 400 to 1000 nm. It also provides an approach for SSC and SMC mapping in salinization regions by incorporating remote sensing data, such as GF-5.

TI  - How Well Can Matching High Spatial Resolution Landsat Data with Flux Tower Footprints Improve Estimates of Vegetation Gross Primary Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddy-covariance (EC) measurements are widely used to optimize the terrestrial vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) model because they provide standardized and high-quality flux data within their footprint areas. However, the extent of flux data taken from a tower site within the EC footprint, represented by the satellite-based grid cell between Landsat and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the performance of the model derived from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) within the EC footprint at different spatial resolutions (e.g., Landsat and MODIS) remain unclear. Here, we first calculated the Landsat-footprint NDVI and MODIS-footprint NDVI and assessed their spatial representativeness at 78 FLUXNET sites at 30 m and 500 m scale, respectively. We then optimized the parameters of the revised Eddy Covariance-Light Use Efficiency (EC-LUE) model using NDVI within the EC-tower footprints that were calculated from the Landsat and MODIS sensor. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the optimized model at 30 m and 500 m scale. Our results showed that matching Landsat data with the flux tower footprint was able to improve the performance of the revised EC-LUE model by 18% for savannas, 14% for croplands, 9% for wetlands. The outperformance of the Landsat-footprint NDVI in driving model relied on the spatial heterogeneity of the flux sites. Our study assessed the advantages of remote sensing data with high spatial resolution in simulating GPP, especially for areas with high heterogeneity of landscapes. This could facilitate a more accurate estimation of global ecosystem carbon sink and a better understanding of plant productivity and carbon climate feedbacks.

TI  - Precipitation Dominates the Distribution of Species Richness on the Kunlun-Pamir Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kunlun-Pamir Plateau is a globally irreplaceable biodiversity reserve, yet it is still unclear what causes the distribution of species richness. Here, we relied on the productivity and the water-energy dynamics hypotheses to investigate the distribution pattern of species richness (and its determinants) in the Kunlun-Pamir Plateau. The productivity hypothesis is mainly based on five MODIS products (NDVI, EVI, FPAR, LAI and GPP), which were calculated for three Dynamic Habitat Indices (DHIs): (1) cumulative productivity (CumDHI), (2) minimum productivity (MinDHI) and (3) intra-annual variation productivity (VarDHI). The CumDHI was applied to assess whether or not more energy has a higher species richness value. The MinDHI was used to determine and evaluate the higher minimums, leading to a higher species richness. The VarDHI was the annual variation value in productivity and was utilized to assess if the reduced intra-annual variability triggers a higher species richness. We found that the DHIs based on the FPAR correlated slightly higher with the mammal, bird, breeding bird and non-breeding bird richness (than those based on the other four DHIs, and the values were 0.24, 0.25, 0.24 and 0.01, respectively). The correlation between the climate variables and the mammals, birds, breeding birds and non-breeding birds was bigger at 0.24, 0.54, 0.54 and 0.02, respectively, and was mainly dominated by the precipitation-related climatic factors. The water-energy dynamic hypothesis is better suited to the Kunlun-Pamir Plateau than the productivity hypothesis. Our results might provide valuable information regarding the biodiversity conservation in this region.

TI  - Representation Learning with a Variational Autoencoder for Predicting Nitrogen Requirement in Rice
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scope of this research was to provide rice growers with optimal N-rate recommendations through precision agriculture applications. To achieve this goal, a prediction rice yield model was constructed, based on soil data, remote sensing data (optical and radar), climatic data, and farming practices. The dataset was collected from a rice crop surface of 89.2 ha cultivated continuously for a 5-year period and was analyzed with machine learning (ML) systems. A variational autoencoder (VAE) for reconstructing the input data of the prediction model was applied, resulting in MAE of 0.6 tn/ha, with an average yield for the study fields and period measured at 9.6 tn/ha. VAE learns the original input data representation and transforms them in a latent feature space, so that the anomalies and the discrepancies of the data are reduced. The reconstructed data by VAE provided a more sophisticated and detailed ML model, improving our knowledge about the various correlations between soil, N management parameters, and yield. Both optical and radar imagery and the climatic data were found to be of high importance for the model, as indicated by the application of XAI (explainable artificial intelligence) techniques. The new model was applied in the 2022 rice cultivation in the study fields, resulting in an average yield increase of 4.32% compared to the 5 previous years of experimentation.

TI  - Postpartum Mental Health of Mothers in Fukushima: Insights From the Fukushima Health Management Survey's 8-year Trends
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With the aim of monitoring the mental and physical health of mothers and children following the Fukushima nuclear accident and providing them with necessary care, we have been conducting an annual survey of expectant and nursing mothers since 2011. The Pregnancy and Birth Survey is a mail-in survey of about 15,000 individuals, with a response rate of approximately 50.0% each year. In addition, because respondents to a survey conducted in the immediate aftermath of the disaster showed a particularly high rate of depression, follow-up surveys have been conducted at 4 years after childbirth. Reviewing the results of surveys from FY 2011 through FY 2018, we found that the prevalence of depressive symptoms among mothers was highest in the survey after childbirth and decreased over time. Data of follow-up surveys showed that the prevalence of depression was lower than immediately after childbirth and then decreased over time. The proportion of mothers with radiation anxiety was higher among respondents in the FY 2011 follow-up than in the FY 2014 follow-up, indicating the prolonged impact of the nuclear accident, especially among those who gave birth immediately after the disaster. Characteristics of mothers who received telephone parenting counseling included first delivery, caesarean section, living in evacuation zones, not being able to receive medical examinations as scheduled, and having radiation anxiety. Continuous care should be provided to mothers who gave birth immediately after the nuclear accident, including routine perinatal care and parenting support, provision of information on radiation, and long-term monitoring of their wellbeing.

TI  - A Statistical Approach to Using Remote Sensing Data to Discern Streamflow Variable Influence in the Snow Melt Dominated Upper Rio Grande Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the middle of the 20th century, the peak snowpack in the Upper Rio Grande (URG) basin of United States has been decreasing. Warming influences snowpack characteristics such as snow cover, snow depth, and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), which can affect runoff quantity and timing in snowmelt runoff-dominated river systems of the URG basin. The purpose of this research is to investigate which variables are most important in predicting naturalized streamflow and to explore variables' relative importance for streamflow dynamics. We use long term remote sensing data for hydrologic analysis and deploy R algorithm for data processing and synthesizing. The data is analyzed on a monthly and baseflow/runoff basis for nineteen sub-watersheds in the URG. Variable importance and influence on naturalized streamflow is identified using linear standard regression with multi-model inference based on the second-order Akaike information criterion (AICc) coupled with the intercept only model. Five predictor variables: temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, sublimation, and SWE are identified in order of relative importance for streamflow prediction. The most influential variables for streamflow prediction vary temporally between baseflow and runoff conditions and spatially by watershed and mountain range. Despite the importance of temperature on streamflow, it is not consistently the most important factor in streamflow prediction across time and space. The dominance of precipitation over streamflow is more obvious during baseflow. The impact of precipitation, SWE, sublimation, and minimum temperature on streamflow is evident during the runoff season, but the results vary for different sub-watersheds. The association between sublimation and streamflow is positive in the runoff season, which may relate to temperature and requires further research. This research sheds light on the primary drivers and their spatial and temporal variability on streamflow generation. This work is critical for predicting how warming temperatures will impact water supplies serving society and ecosystems in a changing climate.

TI  - Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Empirical Forecasting Performance of Future Shoreline Positions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coasts and coastlines in many parts of the world are highly dynamic in nature, where large changes in the shoreline position can occur due to natural and anthropogenic influences. The prediction of future shoreline positions is of great importance in the better planning and management of coastal areas. With an aim to assess the different methods of prediction, this study investigates the performance of future shoreline position predictions by quantifying how prediction performance varies depending on the time depths of input historical shoreline data and the time horizons of predicted shorelines. Multi-temporal Landsat imagery, from 1988 to 2021, was used to quantify the rates of shoreline movement for different time period. Predictions using the simple extrapolation of the end point rate (EPR), linear regression rate (LRR), weighted linear regression rate (WLR), and the Kalman filter method were used to predict future shoreline positions. Root mean square error (RMSE) was used to assess prediction accuracies. For time depth, our results revealed that the higher the number of shorelines used in calculating and predicting shoreline change rates the better predictive performance was yielded. For the time horizon, prediction accuracies were substantially higher for the immediate future years (138 m/year) compared to the more distant future (152 m/year). Our results also demonstrated that the forecast performance varied temporally and spatially by time period and region. Though the study area is located in coastal Bangladesh, this study has the potential for forecasting applications to other deltas and vulnerable shorelines globally.

TI  - Alexander von Humboldt and communication with alterity in Jorge Acha's <i>Homo-Humus and Mburucuya, cuadros de la naturaleza</i>
T2  - QUESTION
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay addresses the problem of communication as it is displayed by the screenplay Homo-Humus and the feature film Mburucuya, cuadros de la naturaleza by Jorge Acha. Both works focus on part of Alexander von Humboldt and Aime Bonpland's journey through South America, specifically their stay in the Orinoco jungle and their contact with the Yaruro people. Humboldt contemplates nature ecstatically and aesthetically, but that way of relating to the environment is instrumental to the collection of specimens and the making of measurements of all kinds without understanding how this procedure affects the worldview of the indigenous people. This contradiction marks an internal division within Humboldt himself. Bonpland, for his part, departs from Alexander's attitude as he blends in with the local population, thus embodying an alternative way of knowing. The Yaruros, in turn, maintain a poetic relationship with the environment, their way of communicating, unlike Humboldt's, does not break the continuum between culture and nature. Acha proposes, as a communicative solution to the disagreement, that Europeans and indigenous people eat each other's lice, hence that they fraternize carnally and horizontally.

TI  - Scorched earth tactics of the "Islamic State" after its loss of territory: intentional burning of farmland in Iraq and Syria
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent literature shows increasing interest in analyzing causes of what was referred to as "unusual" fires in Iraq and Syria in 2019. Here, we examine the causes of uncontrolled and irregular fires within farmlands in parts of the two countries in 2019-2020 and quantify their extent spatiotemporally using a combination of medium and coarse-resolution satellite imagery, land cover, precipitation, temperature data, and multiple sources of armed violence data. Our analysis reveals the extent of the deliberate arson of farmland in Iraq and Northeast Syria in 2019-2020. In comparison, only a few fires of farmland were observed in 2007-2013 in Iraq, and Al-Hassakeh, Syria, that became a stronghold of the Islamic State (IS) in 2013. In 2014-2017, we find evidence for increased farmland fires in various locations that closely tracked the military withdrawal of IS between 2015/2016 and 2017 when it lost most of its territory. We find that although the burned area in wheat-producing regions of Iraq (Ninewa and Kirkuk) and Syria have recently increased, the increase in the percentage burned area of agricultural lands in Iraq's Ninewa and Kirkuk was not unprecedented. MODIS overestimates burned areas when in low fire activity while it underestimates it when fire activity is high, compared to a Landsat-Sentinel-2 combination. A significant positive relationship (r = 0.83) exists between the number of IS-related incidents and the percent burned agricultural area during 2019, which raises questions about the future strategy of the IS terror group and its use and targeting of the water-food complex.

TI  - Optimizing treatment approaches for patients with cutaneous melanoma by integrating clinical and pathologic features with the 31-gene expression profile test
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Many patients with low-stage cutaneous melanoma will experience tumor recurrence, metastasis, or death, and many higher staged patients will not.Objective: To develop an algorithm by integrating the 31-gene expression profile test with clinicopathologic data for an optimized, personalized risk of recurrence (integrated 31 risk of recurrence [i31-ROR]) or death and use i31-ROR in conjunction with a previously validated algorithm for precise sentinel lymph node positivity risk estimates (i31-SLNB) for optimized treatment plan decisions.Methods: Cox regression models for ROR were developed (n = 1581) and independently validated (n = 523) on a cohort with stage I-III melanoma. Using National Comprehensive Cancer Network cut points, i31-ROR performance was evaluated using the midpoint survival rates between patients with stage IIA and stage IIB disease as a risk threshold.Results: Patients with a low-risk i31-ROR result had significantly higher 5-year recurrence-free survival (91% vs 45%, P \.001), distant metastasis-free survival (95% vs 53%, P <.001), and melanoma-specific survival (98% vs 73%, P<.001) than patients with a high-risk i31-ROR result. A combined i31-SLNB/ROR analysis identified 44% of patients who could forego sentinel lymph node biopsy while maintaining high survival rates ([98%) or were restratified as being at a higher or lower risk of recurrence or death.Limitations: Multicenter, retrospective study.Conclusion: Integrating clinicopathologic featureswith the 31-GEPoptimizespatient risk stratification compared to clinicopathologic features alone.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characterization of aerosols and trace gases over the Yangtze River Delta region, China: impact of trans-boundary pollution and meteorology
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The spatiotemporal variation of observed trace gases (NO2, SO2, O-3) and particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) were investigated over cities of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region including Nanjing, Hefei, Shanghai and Hangzhou. Furthermore, the characteristics of different pollution episodes, i.e., haze events (visibility < 7 km, relative humidity < 80%, and PM2.5 > 40 mu g/m(3)) and complex pollution episodes (PM2.5 > 35 mu g/m(3) and O-3 > 160 mu g/m(3)) were studied over the cities of the YRD region. The impact of China clean air action plan on concentration of aerosols and trace gases is examined. The impacts of trans-boundary pollution and different meteorological conditions were also examined. Results The highest annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O-3 were found for 2019 over all the cities. The annual mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 showed continuous declines from 2019 to 2021 due to emission control measures and implementation of the Clean Air Action plan over all the cities of the YRD region. The annual mean O-3 levels showed a decline in 2020 over all the cities of YRD region, which is unprecedented since the beginning of the China's National environmental monitoring program since 2013. However, a slight increase in annual O-3 was observed in 2021. The highest overall means of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and NO2 were observed over Hefei, whereas the highest O-3 levels were found in Nanjing. Despite the strict control measures, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations exceeded the Grade-1 National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines over all the cities of the YRD region. The number of haze days was higher in Hefei and Nanjing, whereas the complex pollution episodes or concurrent occurrence of O-3 and PM2.5 pollution days were higher in Hangzhou and Shanghai. The in situ data for SO2 and NO2 showed strong correlation with Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite data. Conclusions Despite the observed reductions in primary pollutants concentrations, the secondary pollutants formation is still a concern for major metropolises. The increase in temperature and lower relative humidity favors the accumulation of O-3, while low temperature, low wind speeds and lower relative humidity favor the accumulation of primary pollutants. This study depicts different air pollution problems for different cities inside a region. Therefore, there is a dire need to continuous monitoring and analysis of air quality parameters and design city-specific policies and action plans to effectively deal with the metropolitan pollution.

TI  - Multispectral Characteristics of Glacier Surface Facies (Chandra-Bhaga Basin, Himalaya, and Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard) through Investigations of Pixel and Object-Based Mapping Using Variable Processing Routines
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fundamental image processing methods, such as atmospheric corrections and pansharpening, influence the signal of the pixel. This morphs the spectral signature of target features causing a change in both the final spectra and the way different mapping methods may assign thematic classes. In the current study, we aim to identify the variations induced by popular image processing methods in the spectral reflectance and final thematic maps of facies. To this end, we have tested three different atmospheric corrections: (a) Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), (b) Dark Object Subtraction (DOS), and (c) Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH), and two pansharpening methods: (a) Hyperspherical Color Sharpening (HCS) and (b) Gram-Schmidt (GS). WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 satellite images over Chandra-Bhaga Basin, Himalaya, and Ny-angstrom lesund, Svalbard are tested via spectral subsets in traditional (BGRN1), unconventional (CYRN2), visible to near-infrared (VNIR), and the complete available spectrum (VNIR_SWIR). Thematic mapping was comparatively performed using 12 pixel-based (PBIA) algorithms and 3 object-based (GEOBIA) rule sets. Thus, we test the impact of varying image processing routines, effectiveness of specific spectral bands, utility of PBIA, and versatility of GEOBIA for mapping facies. Our findings suggest that the image processing routines exert an extreme impact on the end spectral reflectance. DOS delivers the most reliable performance (overall accuracy = 0.64) averaged across all processing schemes. GEOBIA delivers much higher accuracy when the QUAC correction is employed and if the image is enhanced by GS pansharpening (overall accuracy = 0.79). SWIR bands have not enhanced the classification results and VNIR band combination yields superior performance (overall accuracy = 0.59). The maximum likelihood classifier (PBIA) delivers consistent and reliable performance (overall accuracy = 0.61) across all processing schemes and can be used after DOS correction without pansharpening, as it deteriorates spectral information. GEOBIA appears to be robust against modulations in atmospheric corrections but is enhanced by pansharpening. When utilizing GEOBIA, we find that a combination of spatial and spectral object features (rule set 3) delivers the best performance (overall accuracy = 0.86), rather than relying only on spectral (rule set 1) or spatial (rule set 2) object features. The multiresolution segmentation parameters used here may be transferable to other very high resolution (VHR) VNIR mapping of facies as it yielded consistent objects across all processing schemes.

TI  - A Comparison of Skin Staining after Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Women Undergoing Breast Cancer Surgery Using Blue Dye and Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle (SPIO) Tracers
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Both superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) and blue dye (BD) have been reported to cause skin staining after breast-conserving surgery. SPIO is a novel tracer that has been shown to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with breast cancer. Our study was the first to compare the incidence and size of skin staining between the two tracers. We reported on these outcomes in a preplanned secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial in which women received both SPIO and BD. This study investigated whether there was a difference in the incidence and size of skin staining between SPIO and BD after SLN-dissection. In all, 270 women were operated on with breast-conserving surgery and received SPIO, and 204 of these women also received BD. After 24 months of follow up, there was no statistically significant difference between the two tracers with regard to the size and incidence of skin staining. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIO) are a tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection. In a preplanned secondary analysis of a prospective clinical trial (SentiDose) we reported on skin staining after SPIO and blue dye (BD) injections. For SPIO, either a 1.5 mL retroareolar injection on the day of surgery or a 1.0 mL peritumoral/retroareolar injection 1-7 days before surgery was given. A 1.0 mL sub-/intradermal periareolar injection of BD was also administered to all these women. Staining was then assessed at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery. A total of 270 women received SPIO and were operated on with breast-conserving surgery. Of these, 204 women also received BD. A total of 58 (21.5%) women had an SPIO stain 6 months postoperatively with a median size of 6.8 cm(2) (p = 0.56), while 51 (25.0%) had a BD stain with a median size of 8.5 cm(2) (p = 0.93). The incidence and size of SPIO and BD staining decreased over time reciprocally. At 24 months, the incidence and median size of SPIO was 23 (8.6%) and 4 cm(2), respectively. For BD, the incidence was 14 (6.3%, p = 0.13), and the median size was 3.5 cm(2) (p = 0.18). There was, therefore, no statistically significant difference in the incidence or size of skin staining between SPIO and BD over time.

TI  - Construction of a Scoring Evaluation Model for Identifying Urban Functional Areas Based on Multisource Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In rapidly developing large cities, land functions change rapidly and are mixed. It is essential to obtain accurate functional area maps to evaluate the urbanization process and its impacts on rational urban planning. Many studies have verified the usability of point of interest (POI) data in identifying functional areas. However, few studies have considered the impact of the size differences of the entity objects represented by POIs on the functional categories. A new scoring evaluation model that combines the area score and the normalized kernel density value was constructed to identify urban functional areas. The area score was obtained based on the building vector data and the constructed ambiguity function. The kernel density value was obtained by kernel density analysis of various POIs. The two factors were combined to calculate the influencing scores. Functional areas were identified by the proportion of the influencing scores. Compared with the traditional model based on the quantity of POIs and tested in the system of different functional zones, the scoring evaluation model improved the overall accuracy by 17.4%, and the kappa coefficient increased from 0.51 to 0.73, with strong robustness. Therefore, the model constructed can provide an accurate full-coverage regional functional area map, which can help planners obtain urban spatial structures and make scientific decisions.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Urban Sprawl on Green Total Factor Productivity in China: Based on Satellite Observation Data and Spatial Econometric Models
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Worsening environmental effects caused by the rapid large-scale urban expansion in most Chinese cities is a worrying trend. In response, China is advocating an economic transition from rapid (raw growth) to a high-quality development model that incorporates negative environmental consequences. Green total factor productivity (GTFP) is regarded as one of the important approaches for measuring high-quality development. Hence, the aim of this research is to quantify the impact of urban sprawl on GTFP using remote sensing data and spatial econometric models. The primary findings of this study are as follows. (1) The urban sprawl index presents a decreasing trend from 2005 to 2016, indicating that urbanization has slowed; (2) The GTFP scores of Chinese cities are not randomly distributed and thus present significant spatial spillovers; and (3) The results of spatial lag models reveal that spatial spillover of GTFP is significant and positive. In other words, increases in GTFP in neighboring cities promotes GTFP improvements in nearby cities. We also find that the impact of urban sprawl on GTFP is significant and negative, indicating that rapid urban expansion is a contributor to decreased GTFP growth in China. Moreover, urban sprawl has a negative effect on technical change and efficiency change. The main findings can provide policy makers in Chinese cities with scientific foundations to design and implement effective measures to improve GTFP.

TI  - Decoupling of the Municipal Thermal Environment Using a Spatial Autoregressive Model
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the rapid urbanization process, climate change has a huge impact on the urban thermal environment, and the urban heat island has attracted widespread attention from society. How to better detect, analyze, and evaluate the urban heat island effect has become a hot issue in current urban environmental research. However, the correlation analysis of heat island factors mostly adopts the conventional least square method, without considering the correlation of and the interaction between spatial elements. At the same time, the single analysis method makes it difficult to analyze environmental problems scientifically, which leads to great bias. Therefore, in this paper, the spatial autoregressive confusion model was used to analyze the satellite data of Beijing, and a preliminary temperature model of Beijing for all seasons was established. The regression results show that the surface temperature of Beijing has a strong spatial autocorrelation, and that the modified normalized difference water index and the normalized differential vegetation index have a strong negative effect on the land surface temperature. The prediction models established in this study can provide accurate and sustainable data support in the urbanization process and aid in the creation of a sustainable and effective urban environment.

TI  - The Early Identification and Spatio-Temporal Characteristics of Loess Landslides with SENTINEL-1A Datasets: A Case of Dingbian County, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Loess landslides represent an important geohazard in relation to the deformation of unstable loess structures occurred on the slope of loess-covered area. It has become one of the important topics to accurately identify the distribution and activity of loess landslides and describe the spatio-temporal kinematics in the western-project construction in China. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) proves to be effective for landslides investigation. This study proposes an improved InSAR-based procedure for large-area landslide mapping in loess-hilly areas, including tropospheric-delay correction based on quadtree segmentation and automatic selection of interferograms based on minimum-error boundary. It is tested in Dingbian County in Shaanxi Province, China. More than 200 SAR images were processed and a total of 50 potential loess landslides were detected and mapped. Results show that the landslides are mainly distributed along the river basins and concentrated in areas with elevation ranging from 1450 m to 1650 m, and with slope angles of 10-40 degrees. Then, a total of eight (16%) loess landslides are classified as active ones based on three parameters derived from InSAR-deformation rates: activity index (AI), mean deformation rate, and maximum deformation rate. Moreover, we characterize the segmentation of detected landslides and describe the discrepancy of local topography and deformation rates by coupling the peak in probability-density curves of deformation rates and profiles of the elevation and deformation rates. Finally, correlation between landslide deformation and rainfall is given through wavelet analysis.

TI  - Estimating All-Weather Surface Longwave Radiation from Satellite Passive Microwave Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave radiation (SLR) is an essential geophysical parameter of Earth's energy balance, and its estimation based on thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing data has been extensively studied. However, it is difficult to estimate cloudy SLR from TIR measurements. Satellite passive microwave (PMW) radiometers measure microwave radiation under the clouds and therefore can estimate SLR in all weather conditions. We constructed SLR retrieval models using brightness temperature (BT) data from an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) based on a neural network (NN) algorithm. SLR from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) product was used as the reference. NN-based models were able to reproduce well the spatial variability of SLR from ERA5 at the global scale. Validations indicate a reasonably good performance was found for land sites, with a bias of 1.32 W/m(2), root mean squared error (RMSE) of 35.37 W/m(2), and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.89 for AMSR2 surface upward longwave radiation (SULR) data, and a bias of -2.26 W/m(2), RMSE of 32.94 W/m(2), and R-2 of 0.82 for AMSR2 surface downward longwave radiation (SDLR) data. AMSR2 SULR and SDLR retrieval accuracies were higher for oceanic sites, with biases of -2.98 and -4.04 W/m(2), RMSEs of 6.50 and 13.42 W/m(2), and R-2 values of 0.83 and 0.66, respectively. This study provides a solid foundation for the development of a PMW SLR retrieval model applicable at the global scale to generate long-term continuous SLR products using multi-year satellite PMW data and for future research with a higher spatiotemporal resolution.

TI  - Generating high spatial resolution GLASS FAPAR product from Landsat images
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is an essential biophysical variable for monitoring vegetation growth and quantitatively describing the efficiency of light absorption by vegetation. Several long-term global satellite FAPAR products, such as MODIS, GLASS, GEOV2, and GIMMS3g-FAPAR, have been produced at coarse spatial resolutions, however, they are inclined to criticism over spatial heterogeneous landscapes due to mixed pixel effects. As the successor of GLASS FAPAR products, the high spatial resolution GLASS (Hi-GLASS) FAPAR product suite has been generated in this study. We developed a hybrid algorithm through integration of physically-based radiative transfer models and machine learning to estimate the black-sky, white-sky and blue-sky Hi-GLASS FAPAR products at 30 m resolution from Landsat imagery globally. The coupled soil-leaf-canopy (SLC) radiative transfer model was applied to depict the physical relationship between FAPAR and Landsat surface reflectance data, and its simulations were executed with uniform distributions of input parameters. Separate random forest models were trained with these simulation samples and applied to Landsat data to generate the Hi-GLASS FAPAR products. Extensive validation of the FAPAR products was performed for different sensors and biomes using in situ measurements from the VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI), ImagineS, and Copernicus Ground Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) projects. Results demonstrated that our FAPAR products were highly accurate for blue-sky (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.09, bias = -0.03), black-sky (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.11, bias = -0.02), and white-sky (R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.10, bias = -0.02). R2 and RMSE values for different Landsat sensors were slightly different in the order of TM (0.84, 0.13), ETM+ (0.92, 0.12), and OLI (0.95, 0.11), while the corresponding statistics for biomes were ranked from the best to the worst: shrubs (0.78, 0.08), crops (0.93, 0.09), grasslands (0.88, 0.11), and forests (0.85, 0.13). Additionally, Hi-GLASS products displayed reasonable spatial distribution and seasonal variation of vegetation dynamics. The developed method performed better than those for producing the decametric-resolution and coarse resolution FAPAR products, enabling us to generate long-term 30 m FAPAR records from the 1980s.

TI  - Remote sensing-based morphological analysis of core city growth across the globe
T2  - CITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The morphology of core city growth can be defined as the area, geometry, and change rate of core city within a specific period. A global analysis of core city growth can help predict future development with respect to different natural and social settings. However, current studies largely focus on limited cities or time series of urban expansion, providing limited insight to assess the status of global sustainable development in urban areas. In this study, we examined the morphological evolution of 2276 cities worldwide from 2003 to 2018 using harmonized nighttime satellite data. We found that during the study period the global core city area increased nearly 52 % with Asia leading the growth (4.5 x 10(5) km(2)) and North America growing the least (0.8 x 10(5) km(2)). Based on the morphological characteristics, we further identified six city morphological types: decelerated, intensifying, stable, mature, growing, and shrinking. The decelerated type dominated, followed by the intensiofying and shrinking types. Cities falling within the other three patterns accounted for about 10 % of the total. Cities with the stable and mature types grew slowly, mainly found in developed regions such as Europe and North America, while cities with the growing type exhibited a high growth rate and were mostly located in developing regions such as Africa and Asia. Moreover, cities with the shrinking pattern were also found in certain developed regions such as Japan, coinciding with the population decline there. Our analysis of global urban morphology 16 years can provide valuable insights into the variations of global core city growth, which are critical for formulating effective policies to achieve urban sustainability.

TI  - Proximal and Remote Sensing Data Integration to Assess Spatial Soil Heterogeneity in Wild Blueberry Fields
T2  - SOIL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium Ait.) are often cultivated uniformly despite significant within-field variations in topography and crop density. This study was conducted to relate apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), topographic attributes, and multi-spectral satellite imagery to fruit yield and soil attributes and evaluate the potential of site-specific management (SSM) of nutrients. Elevation and ECa at multiple depths were collected from two experimental fields (referred as Field(Und), Field(Flat)) in Normandin, Quebec, Canada. Soil samples were collected at two depths (0-0.05 m and 0.05-0.15 m) and analyzed for a range of soil properties. Statistical analyses of fruit yield, soil, and sensor data were used to characterize within-field variability. Fruit yield showed large variability in both fields (CVUnd = 54.4%, CVFlat = 56.5%), but no spatial dependence. However, several soil attributes showed considerable variability and moderate to strong spatial dependence. Elevation and the shallowest depths of both the Veris (0.3 m) and DUALEM (0.54 m) ECa sensors showed moderate to strong spatial dependence and correlated significantly to most soil properties in both study sites, indicating the feasibility of SSM. In place of management zone delineation, a quadrant analysis of the shallowest ECa depth vs. elevation provided four sensor combinations (scenarios) for theoretical field conditions. ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer's post hoc test showed that the greatest differentiation of soil properties in both fields occurred between the combinations of high ECa/low elevation versus low ECa/high elevation. Vegetation indices (VIs) obtained from satellite data showed promise as a biomass indicator, and bare spots classified with satellite imagery in Field(Und) revealed significantly distinct soil properties. Combining proximal and multispectral data predicted within-field variations of yield-determining soil properties and offered three theoretical scenarios (high ECa/low elevation; low ECa/high elevation; bare spots) on which to base SSM. Future studies should investigate crop response to fertilization between the identified scenarios.

TI  - Is it worth it? A qualitative analysis of the impact of medical education fellowships on careers
T2  - AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesMedical education fellowships provide training in teaching, assessment, educational program administration, and scholarship. The longitudinal impact of this training is unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the impact of medical education fellowships on the careers of graduates. MethodsThe authors performed a qualitative study with a constructivist-interpretivist paradigm using semistructured interviews in 2021. The authors used a purposeful randomized stratified sampling strategy of graduates to ensure diversity of representation (gender, region, fellowship duration, and career stage). Two researchers independently analyzed interview transcriptions using a modified grounded theory approach. ResultsThe authors interviewed 10 graduates and identified three overarching concepts: motivations for pursuing fellowship, benefits of training, and drivers of career development. Graduates sought training because of their desire for growth and career preparation and at the advice of mentors. Fellowships provided knowledge and skills in a structured learning environment, supported by mentors and a collaborative community. Fellowship training shaped the careers of graduates by increasing their self-efficacy, enhancing their outcome expectations, refining their goals, and influencing their professional identity formation. They acquired expertise that prepared them for jobs, developed credibility, felt competitive in the job market, anticipated successful promotion, reached for greater goals, broadened their educational worldview, and evolved their professional identity as a result of fellowship training. ConclusionsFellowship training in medical education provides knowledge and skills, a structured learning environment, and important relationships that shape the careers of graduates by impacting their self-efficacy, outcome expectations, goal creation, and professional identity formation.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 Data for Spatially and Temporally High-Resolution Detection of Drought Affected Forest Stands
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely and spatially high-resolution detection of drought-affected forest stands is important to assess and deal with the increasing risk of forest fires. In this paper, we present how multitemporal Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data can be used to detect drought-affected and fire-endangered forest stands in a spatially and temporally high resolution. Existing approaches for Sentinel-1 based drought detection currently do not allow to deal simultaneously with all disturbing influences of signal noise, topography and visibility geometry on the radar signal or do not produce pixel-based high-resolution drought detection maps of forest stands. Using a novel Sentinel-1 Radar Drought Index (RDI) based on temporal and spatial averaging strategies for speckle noise reduction, we present an efficient methodology to create a spatially explicit detection map of drought-affected forest stands for the year 2020 at the Donnersberg study area in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany, keeping the Sentinel-1 maximum spatial resolution of 10 m x 10 m. The RDI showed significant (p < 0.05) drought influence for south, south-west and west-oriented slopes. Comparable spatial patterns of drought-affected forest stands are shown for the years 2018, 2019 and with a weaker intensity for 2021. In addition, the assessment for summer 2020 could also be reproduced with weekly repetition, but spatially coarser resolution and some limitations in the quality of the resulting maps. Nevertheless, the mean RDI values of temporally high-resolution drought detection maps are highly correlated (R-2 = 0.9678) with the increasing monthly mean temperatures in 2020. In summary, this study demonstrates that Sentinel-1 data can play an important role for the timely detection of drought-affected and fire-prone forest areas, since availability of observations does not depend on cloud cover or time of day.

TI  - Risk Factors for Longer Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay Among Children Who Required Escalation of Care Within 24 Hours of Admission
T2  - PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveChildren who require early escalation of care (EOC) to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after floor admission have higher mortality and increased hospital length of stay (LOS) as compared with direct emergency department (ED) admissions. This study was designed to identify subgroups of patients within this cohort (EOC to PICU within 24 hours of hospital admission) who have worse outcomes (actual PICU LOS [aLOS] > predicted PICU LOS [pLOS]).MethodsThis was a retrospective single-center cohort study. Patients who required EOC to PICU from January 2015 to December 2019 within 24 hours of admission were included. Postoperative patients, missing cause of EOC, and mortality were excluded. Predicted LOS was calculated based on Pediatric Risk of Mortality scores. Patients with aLOS > pLOS (group A) were compared with patients with aLOS <= pLOS (group B). Multivariable logistic regression was performed to adjust for confounders.ResultsOf 587 patients transferred to PICU after hospital admission during the study period, 286 patients met the study criteria (group A, n = 69; group B, n = 217). The 2 groups were similar in age, race, the severity of illness, and ED vitals and therapies. A higher proportion of patients in group B had EOC <= 6 hours of admission (51.1% vs 36.2%, P = 0.03), and a higher proportion in group A required Mechanical ventilation (56% vs 34%, P = 0.01). On multivariable regression, patients who required EOC to PICU after 6 hours after admission (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 4.0), p,<0.01) and patients admitted to the floor from referral hospitals (adjusted odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.2), P = 0.04) had higher risk of greater than PLOS.ConclusionsAmong patients who required EOC to PICU, risk factors associated with aLOS > pLOS were patients who required EOC to PICU longer than 6 hours after admission to the hospital and patients admitted to the floor as a transfer from referral hospitals.

TI  - Towards the use of artificial intelligence deep learning networks for detection of archaeological sites
T2  - SURFACE TOPOGRAPHY-METROLOGY AND PROPERTIES
M3  - Article
AB  - While remote sensing data have long been widely used in archaeological prospection over large areas, the task of examining such data is time consuming and requires experienced and specialist analysts. However, recent technological advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and in particular deep learning methods, open possibilities for the automated analysis of large areas of remote sensing data. This paper examines the applicability and potential of supervised deep learning methods for the detection and mapping of different kinds of archaeological sites comprising features such as walls and linear or curvilinear structures of different dimensions, spectral and geometrical properties. Our work deliberately uses open-source imagery to demonstrate the accessibility of these tools. One of the main challenges facing AI approaches has been that they require large amounts of labeled data to achieve high levels of accuracy so that the training stage requires significant computational resources. Our results show, however, that even with relatively limited amounts of data, simple eight-layer, fully convolutional network can be trained efficiently using minimal computational resources, to identify and classify archaeological sites and successfully distinguish them from features with similar characteristics. By increasing the number of training sets and switching to the use of high-performance computing the accuracy of the identified areas increases. We conclude by discussing the future directions and potential of such methods in archaeological research.

TI  - Raspberry Pi Reflector (RPR): A Low-Cost Water-Level Monitoring System Based on GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although reflectometry is not the primary application of Global Positioning System (GPS) and similar Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), fast-growing GNSS tracking networks has led to the emergence of GNSS interferometric reflectometry technique for monitoring surface changes such as water level. However, scientific-grade or geodetic GNSS instruments are expensive, which is a limiting factor for their prompt and more widespread deployment as a dedicated environmental sensor. We present a prototype called Raspberry Pi Reflector (RPR) that includes a low-cost and low-maintenance single-frequency GPS module and a navigation antenna connected to an inexpensive Raspberry Pi microcomputer. A unit has been successfully operating for almost 2 years since March 2020 in Wesel (Germany) next to the Rhine river. Sub-daily and daily water levels are retrieved using spectral analysis of reflection data. The river level measurements from RPR are compared with a co-located river gauge. We find an Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of 7.6 cm in sub-daily estimates and 6 cm in daily means of river level. In August 2021, we changed the antenna orientation from upright to sideways facing the river. The RMSE reduced to 3 cm (sub-daily) and 1.5 cm (daily) with the new orientation. While satellite radar altimetry techniques have been utilized to monitor water levels with global coverage, their measurements are associated with moderate uncertainties and temporal resolution. Therefore, such low-cost and high-precision instruments can be paired with satellite data for calibrating, validating and modeling purposes. These instruments are financially (<US$ 150 as of November 2021) and technically accessible worldwide.

TI  - Changes in Onset of Vegetation Growth on Svalbard, 2000-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global temperature is increasing, and this is affecting the vegetation phenology in many parts of the world. The most prominent changes occur at northern latitudes such as our study area, which is Svalbard, located between 76 degrees 30 ' N and 80 degrees 50 ' N. A cloud-free time series of MODIS-NDVI data was processed. The dataset was interpolated to daily data during the 2000-2020 period with a 231.65 m pixel resolution. The onset of vegetation growth was mapped with a NDVI threshold method which corresponds well with a recent Sentinel-2 NDVI-based mapping of the onset of vegetation growth, which was in turn validated by a network of in-situ phenological data from time lapse cameras. The results show that the years 2000 and 2008 were extreme in terms of the late onset of vegetation growth. The year 2020 had the earliest onset of vegetation growth on Svalbard during the 21-year study. Each year since 2013 had an earlier or equally early timing in terms of the onset of the growth season compared with the 2000-2020 average. A linear trend of 0.57 days per year resulted in an earlier onset of growth of 12 days on average for the entire archipelago of Svalbard in 2020 compared to 2000.

TI  - Road Infrastructure Development Index for Urban Residential Layouts Using Satellite Images and the Analytical Hierarchy Process
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Road infrastructure, an essential support system providing mobility and accessibility within residential layouts, has become a serious concern in several countries. In some places, residential layouts (subdivisions) have been developed through private ownership. If the norms laid down by central development authorities are not followed by local developers, land use, including road infrastructure, is affected. This study presents a quantitative assessment of the impact of improper development of urban residential layouts on road infrastructure. The study developed an index for assessing the road infrastructure within residential layouts based on identifying the deficiencies which affect mobility and accessibility. A road infrastructure development index (RIDI) was conceptualized using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and parameters that affect accessibility and commuter comfort in residential layouts derived from high-resolution satellite data. The parameters used to generate this RIDI were the number of approach roads, spatial road serviceability, road density, bottlenecks, population density, dead ends or cul-de-sacs, and road width. Sample layouts were selected from varying built-up land-use classes to extract the index parameters to develop the RIDI. The RIDI values estimated for sample layouts indicate the level of development of road infrastructure in the residential layouts. A case study of the Nagpur urban area in central India, showing estimated RIDI values, is discussed. The RIDI concept can be used for proper planning, monitoring, approvals, and improvement of road infrastructure in residential layouts in urban areas, especially in the developing countries, after its calibration for varying urban scenarios.

TI  - Jewish Death in Jewish Time: The Ontological Shift Required to Understand Torah Judaism's Indigenous Approach to Historical Trauma and Historical Memory
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholars regularly make the mistake of applying critical analysis to religious traditions without a sensibility that they are often describing one ontology through the lens of another. Just as cultural anthropology attempts to understand indigenous traditions by respecting their unique worldview and minimizing the foreign a priori of the ethnographer, critical scholars of religion need to be mindful of this unconscious bias when studying religious communities from 'outside'. The traditional Jewish experience of death, mourning and historical trauma is a case in point. As such, this essay considers the indigenous ontological a priori of Torah Judaism as contrasted with the a priori of 'Enlightenment' as understood by Foucault. It then applies this hermeneutic to 'Jewish death in Jewish time'.

TI  - Surface Water Mapping from SAR Images Using Optimal Threshold Selection Method and Reference Water Mask
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Water resources are an important component of ecosystem services. During long periods of cloudiness and precipitation, when a ground-based sample is not available, the water bodies are detected from satellite SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) data using threshold methods (e.g., Otsu and Kittler-Illingworth). However, such methods do not enable to obtain the correct threshold value for the backscattering coefficient (sigma 0) of relatively small water areas in the image. The paper proposes and substantiates a method for the mapping of the surface of water bodies, which makes it possible to correctly identify water bodies, even in "water "/ "land " class imbalance situations. The method operates on a principle of maximum compliance of the resulting SAR water mask with a given reference water mask. Therefore, the method enables the exploration of the possibilities of searching and choosing the optimal parameters (polarization and speckle filtering), which provide the maximum quality of SAR water mask. The method was applied for mapping natural and industrial water bodies in the Pohjois-Pohjanmaa region (North Ostrobothnia), Finland, using Sentinel-1A and -1B ground range detected (GRD) data (ascending and descending orbits) in 2018-2021. Reference water masks were generated based on optical spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2A and -2B data. The polarization and speckle filtering parameters were chosen since they provide the most accurate sigma 0 threshold (on average for all observations above 0.9 according to the Intersection over Union criterion) and are resistant to random fluctuations. If a reference water mask is available, the proposed method is more accurate than the Otsu method. Without a reference mask, the sigma 0 threshold is calculated as an average of thresholds obtained from previous observations. In this case, the proposed method is as good in accuracy as the Otsu method. It is shown that the proposed method enables the identification of surface water bodies under significant class imbalance conditions, such as when the water surface covers only a fraction of a percent of the area under study.

TI  - Predictive Mapping of Electrical Conductivity and Assessment of Soil Salinity in a Western Turkiye Alluvial Plain
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in soil salinity due to human-induced processes poses a severe threat to agriculture on a regional and global scale. Soil salinization caused by natural and anthropogenic factors is a vital environmental hazard, specifically in semi-arid and arid regions of the world. The detection and monitoring of salinity are critical to the sustainability of soil management. The current study compared the performance of machine learning models to produce spatial maps of electrical conductivity (EC) (as a proxy for salinity) in an alluvial irrigation plain. The current study area is located in the Isparta province (100 km(2)), land cover is mainly irrigated, and the dominant soils are Inceptisols, Mollisols, and Vertisols. Digital soil mapping (DSM) methodology was used, referring to the increase in the digital representation of soil formation factors with today's technological advances. Plant and soil-based indices produced from the Sentinel 2A satellite image, topographic indices derived from the digital elevation model (DEM), and CORINE land cover classes were used as predictors. The support vector regression (SVR) algorithm revealed the best relationships in the study area. Considering the estimates of different algorithms, according to the FAO salinity classification, a minimum of 12.36% and a maximum of 20.19% of the study area can be classified as slightly saline. The low spatial dependence between model residuals limited the success of hybrid methods. The land irrigated cover played a significant role in predicting the current level of EC.

TI  - Offshore CO<sub>2</sub> Capture and Utilization Using Floating Wind/PV Systems: Site Assessment and Efficiency Analysis in the Mediterranean
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - A methanol island, powered by solar or wind energy, indirectly captures atmospheric CO2 through the ocean and combines it with hydrogen gas to produce a synthetic fuel. The island components include a carbon dioxide extractor, a desalinator, an electrolyzer, and a carbon dioxide-hydrogen reactor to complete this process. In this study, the optimal locations to place such a device in the Mediterranean Sea were determined, based on three main constraints: power availability, environmental risk, and methanol production capability. The island was numerically simulated with a purpose built python package pyseafuel. Data from 20 years of ocean and atmospheric simulation data were used to "force" the simulated methanol island. The optimal locations were found to strongly depend on the power availability constraint, with most optimal locations providing the most solar and/or wind power, due to the limited effect the ocean surface variability had on the power requirements of methanol island. Within this context, optimal locations were found to be the Alboran, Cretan, and Levantine Sea due to the availability of insolation for the Alboran and Levantine Sea and availability of wind power for the Cretan Sea. These locations were also not co-located with areas with larger maximum significant wave heights, thereby avoiding areas with higher environmental risk. When we simulate the production at these locations, a 10 L s(-1) seawater inflow rate produced 494.21, 495.84, and 484.70 mL m(-2) of methanol over the course of a year, respectively. Island communities in these regions could benefit from the energy resource diversification and independence these systems could provide. However, the environmental impact of such systems is poorly understood and requires further investigation.

TI  - THE EFFICIENCY OF BIOGENTS SENTINEL 2.0 TRAPPING AND HUMAN-LANDING CATCHING METHODS TO CALCULATE HUMAN BITING RATES
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To calculate human biting rates for various mosquito species, we performed simultaneous collections for 15 wk at 6 ecologically variable sites in Hungary. Of the dominant species, the relative abundance of Aedes vexans, Ae. sticticus, and Coquillettidia richiardii showed a significant positive correlation between CO2 + Biogents lure and human landing catch (HLC). The relative abundance of Culex pipiens was significantly lower in the HLC samples than in the CO2 + BG lure samples. Of the invasive species, Aedes korecius was found more frequently in HLC, while Ae. japonicus was more common in CO2+ BG lure samples. Estimated human biting rates, determined with the 2 collection methods, showed no significant differences at high mosquito density (100-120 bites/h/person), but there was considerable variation at low mosquito biting rates. Therefore, correcting the CO2 + BG lure trapping data to include only species biting humans provides estimates approaching the values of the HLC. Our study confirmed that while HLC is the gold standard method for determining the human biting rate, provided appropriate data adjustments are made, trapping methods performing automated data collection can provide similar data while reducing the exposure of the data collector.

TI  - Phenological normalization can improve in-season classification of maize and soybean: A case study in the central US Corn Belt
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Within-season estimates of crop-specific planted area, conditions, and expected yields are critical for decisionand policy-making related to agriculture and food security. However, these estimates require in-season crop type maps which are not currently widely available. Machine learning and remote sensing data can be used to create crop type maps that provide crop-specific land cover classifications to enable timely analysis at field scales throughout the growing season to complement traditional reporting efforts. However, existing methods are often limited by lower performance on test data from seasons with different patterns not seen during training and inability to provide classifications during the growing season when most operationally relevant. We present a new approach to in-season crop type mapping that addresses inter-annual domain shift by normalizing satellite observations by land surface phenology stage. These phenology-normalized observations are input to a neural network that extracts temporal and spatial features using both recurrent and convolutional layers respectively. Using Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) and Sentinel-1 SAR observations with test data from the U.S. states of Iowa in 2019 (late planting year) and Illinois in 2020 (standard year), we showed that this method enabled good performance in both scenarios throughout the growing season (71% and 72% in early-season, 80% and 84% in mid-season, 81% and 85% in late-season for Iowa 2019 and Illinois 2020 respectively).

TI  - Climate Change Assessment of the Spatial Potential Aggregation Zones of <i>Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri</i> and <i>Plectropomus areolatus</i> along the Saudi Coast, Using RS and GIS
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is becoming one of the main threats to fishery resources, with the attendant possibilities of decreasing income and food security. Sea surface temperature (SST) is considered a major environmental indicator of climate change, one that impacts the marine ecosystem and habitat. Studying the impacts of SST changes necessitates regular effective monitoring; remote sensing techniques provide researchers with the ability to track changes on various spatial and temporal scales. This study provides an integrated approach, using the advantages of remote sensing data and GIS tools, to assess the SST changes in the spatial potential aggregation zones of Plectropomus pessuliferus marisrubri and Plectropomus areolatus along the Red Sea's Saudi coast. This study used SST satellite data for 2011 and 2021 to detect changes and develop suitability and risk assessment maps. The SST showed an increase of 0.46 degrees C from 2011 to 2021, particularly during the summer months. As a result, the suitability of spatial potential aggregation from 2011 to 2021 has dropped in the summer months. The risk assessment analysis revealed a decrease in the suitable potential aggregation zones in the summer months, as it reached about -35.7% in August, while it increased in the winter months, reaching +2.52% in January.

AB  - Cities serve as hubs for various activities that necessitate comprehensive transportation connectivity. This study examines the decadal urban agglomeration patterns from 2001 to 2020 and critically assesses the relationship between freeway developments, industrial relocation, and population density in the DFW (Dallas Fort Worth) metropolitan area. Landsat satellite imageries, US census, and open-source GIS datasets have been utilized in the study. The Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm helped generate the vector database, using which Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) variations were assessed. The calculated overall accuracies of the classified images for 2001, 2011, and 2020 were 93.12%, 91.87%, and 93.12%, respectively. Eventually, buffer generation techniques and summary statistics helped detect potential boom hotspots. Our results indicate that the highway advancement project lures industries, leading to population migration. The LULC variations suggest that the increase in highway infrastructure resulted in a surge in built-up and a decrease in open spaces in District-3 of DFW. From our study, we find that 79.16% of old industries are located near old freeways, while 78.84% of new industries are located near new freeways. Further, our industrial area to road area comparison clearly shows that industrial relocation was driven by transportation advancements over time. Our results also confirm that this relocation of industries fostered a massive population influx during the following decades.

TI  - Flood mapping and damage assessment due to the super cyclone Yaas using Google Earth Engine in Purba Medinipur, West Bengal, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study maps flood inundation and estimates the damage caused by super cyclone Yaas in Purba Medinipur, India. We used Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a flood inundation map of the research area using pre and post-cyclone Sentinel-1 SAR data. Using ESRI 2020 land cover data, flood damage was analysed. The flood affected 5% (239.69 km(2)) of the land of Purba Medinipur. The northern and southern regions were affected the most. 95% and 3% of the total flooded area are comprised of agricultural and vegetation, respectively. Kolaghat (24 km(2)) and Nandigram-II (1 km(2)) sustained the greatest damage to both agriculture and vegetation. The areas below 18 m were impacted by flooding, with the worst damage occurring below 5 m. The GEE platform was cost-effective, efficient, and faster at calculating with enhanced precision. The outcomes of this study will aid in the management of cyclone-induced hazards. We advocate planting native and salt-tolerant crops to reduce flood damage.

TI  - Enlarging the Scope of 5-Aminolevulinic Acid-Mediated Photodiagnosis towards Breast Cancers
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, most research on treating cancers targets one single cancer, often because of the very specific operation principle of the therapy. For instance, immunotherapies require the expression of a particular antigen, which might not be expressed in all cancers or in all patients. What about metastases? Combination therapies are promising but require treatment personalization and are an expensive approach that many health systems are not willing to pay for. Resection of cancerous tissues may be conducted beforehand. However, the precise location and removal of tumors are in most cases, hurdles that require margins to prevent recurrence. Herein, we further demonstrate the wide application of aminolevulinate-based photodynamic diagnosis and therapy toward breast cancers. By selecting four breast cancer cell lines that represent the main breast tumor subtypes, we investigated their ability to accumulate the fluorescent protoporphyrin IX upon treatment with the marketed 5-aminolevulinic acid hexyl ester (ALA-Hex) or our new and more stable derivative PSI-ALA-Hex. We found that all cell lines were able to accumulate PpIX under a few hours independent of their hormonal status with both treatments. Additionally, this accumulation was less dose-dependent with PSI-ALA-Hex and induced similar or higher fluorescence intensity than ALA-Hex in three out of four cell lines. The toxicity of the two molecules was not different up to 0.33 mM. However, PSI-ALA-Hex was more toxic at 1 mM, even though lower concentrations of PSI-ALA-Hex led to the same PpIX accumulation level. Additional illumination with blue light to induce cell death by generating reactive oxygen species was also considered. The treatments led to a dramatic death of the BT-474 cells under all conditions. In SK-BR-3 and MCF-7, ALA-Hex was also very efficient at all concentrations. However, increasing doses of PSI-ALA-Hex (0.33 and 1 mM) surprisingly led to a higher viability rate. In contrast, the triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 showed a higher death induction with higher concentrations of ALA-Hex or PSI-ALA-Hex. Derivatives of ALA seem promising as fluorescence-guided resection tools and may enable subsequent completion of cancer cell destruction by blue light irradiation.

TI  - A Study on the Possibility of Religious Governance of New Religions in Korea: Focusing on the Ecological Worldview of Donghak and Won Buddhism
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The most serious threats to humankind today are environmental and ecological problems. The global warming in particular is generally perceived as a serious threat to the survival of humanity and this sense of urgency has given us a chance to consider our place in the ecosystem and question our anthropocentrism. Various faiths acknowledge human obligations to protect the environment and preserve biodiversity. In the Korean context, while the eco-friendly worldviews of Buddhism are well-known, very little is known about other Korean religions' views on the environment. This paper examines whether representative new religions of Korea, namely Donghak and Won Buddhism, can contribute as "religious mechanisms" in alleviating ecological problems. The paper particularly focuses on the former's doctrine of samgyeong or "the Threefold Respect" and the latter's philosophy of saeun or "the Fourfold Grace," examining their relevance for religious governance. The paper argues that these two doctrines are permeated with an ecological view implying the need for all living things, including humans, animals and plants as well as the natural environment, to coexist. The paper also argues that these two religions, complete with guidelines for actions or practices, provide a path for building the possibility of religious governance through religious awakening of believers, mutual respect and mutual trust, and mutual communication and reflective cooperation.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Flood Area Extraction for Fully Automated and Persistent Flood Monitoring Using Cloud Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based flood monitoring for providing visual information on the targeted areas is crucial in responding to and recovering from river floods. However, such monitoring for practical purposes has been constrained mainly by obtaining and analyzing satellite data, and linking and optimizing the required processes. For these purposes, we present a deep learning-based flood area extraction model for a fully automated flood monitoring system, which is designed to continuously operate on a cloud-based computing platform for regularly extracting flooded area from Sentinel-1 data, and providing visual information on flood situations with better image segmentation accuracy. To develop the new flood area extraction model using deep learning, initial model tests were performed more than 500 times to determine optimal hyperparameters, water ratio, and best band combination. The results of this research showed that at 'waterbody ratio 30%', which yielded higher segmentation accuracies and lower loss, precision, overall accuracy, IOU, recall, and F1 score of 'VV, aspect, topographic wetness index, and buffer input bands' were 0.976, 0.956, 0.894, 0.964, and 0.970, respectively, and averaged inference time was 744.3941 s, which demonstrate improved image segmentation accuracy and reduced processing time. The operation and robustness of the fully automated flood monitoring system were demonstrated by automatically segmenting 12 Sentinel-1 images for the two major flood events in Republic of Korea during 2020 and 2022 in accordance with the hyperparameters, waterbody ratio, and band combinations determined through the intensive tests. Visual inspection of the outputs showed that misclassification of constructed facilities and mountain shadows were extremely reduced. It is anticipated that the fully automated flood monitoring system and the deep leaning-based waterbody extraction model presented in this research could be a valuable reference and benchmark for other countries trying to build a cloud-based flood monitoring system for rapid flood monitoring using deep learning.

TI  - Phase calibration for ideal wideband chirp in satellite-based synthetic aperture radar
T2  - ICT EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of launch vehicles, the number of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been increasing. Satellite-based SAR can acquire high-resolution images at day and night regardless of the weather. Since SAR resolution is determined by a chirp bandwidth, corresponding a generation technology of wideband chirp is essentially required for high-resolution SAR images under consideration of relatively small and light weight SAR system. Therefore, an ideal chirp waveform generation, which is challenging task in actual hardware, is proposed by modifying a chirp equation for phase calibration, and is verified based on Sentinel-1 satellite SAR parameters. The proposed method is applied to our SAR hardware and we confirm the calibrated waveform. Evaluation results using SAR observation simulation show that the impulse response with the proposed method has better performances. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - Reading Park Kyung-ni's <i>Kim's Daughters</i> from the Perspective of Ethical Literary Criticism: Focusing on Ethical Representation and Ethical Knots of "Otherized Subjects"
T2  - INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES OF LITERATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Park Kyung-ni was a Korean novelist who gained international fame with her epic novel The Earth. She mainly focused on the lives of an unhappy women in her literary works. This study investigates the multi-layered narrative of a family's tragic fate and unstable social system in Kim's Daughters. While Kim's Daughters opens with a shocking death, one should not solely focus on the superficial layer of this death. This is because, in the novel, the unethical incidents and political affairs that lead to death do not originate from a single relationship between the subject and the other, but rather represent otherized subjects in family histories and historical time. The ethical texts embedded in Kim's Daughters are appropriate to read through the lens of ethical literary criticism, which dissects each ethical choice model and analyzes the motivations and processes thereof. This study explores the (non-) ethical behavior and internal chaos of the characters in Kim's Daughters, and analyzes the intertextuality reflected in the specific modern Korean history and location. This study presents a new research methodology for reading the worldview of Park Kyung-ni by deconstructing the ethical problem and examining the ethical knots in the novel. Furthermore, by applying sub-concepts such as ethical standards, ethical environment, ethical selection, ethical enlightenment, ethical taboo, and ethical dilemma, this study illuminates the ethical issues that change between life and death and are inherent in the subjects or specific events of the novel.

TI  - Applicability Assessment of a Spatiotemporal Geostatistical Fusion Model for Disaster Monitoring: Two Cases of Flood and Wildfire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A spatial time series geostatistical deconvolution/fusion model (STGDFM), as one of spatiotemporal data fusion model, combines Dense time series data with a Coarse-scale (i.e., DC data) and Sparse time series data with a Fine-scale (i.e., SF data) to generate Synthetic Dense time series data with a Fine-scale (i.e., SDF data). Specifically, STGDFM uses a geostatistics-based spatial time series modeling to capture the temporal trends included in time series DC data. This study evaluated the prediction performance of STGDFM for abrupt changes in reflectance due to disasters in spatiotemporal data fusion, and a spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and an enhanced STARFM (ESTARFM) were selected as comparative models. For the applicability assessment, flood and wildfire were selected as case studies. In the case of flood, MODIS-like data (240 m) with spatial resolution converted from Landsat data and Landsat data (30 m) were used as DC and SF data, respectively. In the case of wildfire, MODIS and Landsat data were used as DC and SF data, respectively. The case study results showed that among the three spatiotemporal fusion models, STGDFM presented the best prediction performance with 0.894 to 0.979 at the structure similarity and 0.760 to 0.872 at the R-squared values in the flood- and wildfire-affected areas. Unlike STARFM and ESTARFM that adopt the assumptions for reflectance changes, STGDFM combines the temporal trends using time series DC data. Therefore, STGDFM could capture the abrupt changes in reflectance due to the flood and wildfire. These results indicate that STGDFM can be used for cases where satellite images of appropriate temporal and spatial resolution are difficult to acquire for disaster monitoring.

TI  - Outbreak of Moroccan Locust in Sardinia (Italy): A Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moroccan locust has been considered one of the most dangerous agricultural pests in the Mediterranean region. The economic importance of its outbreaks diminished during the second half of the 20th century due to a high degree of agricultural industrialization and other human-caused transformations of its habitat. Nevertheless, in Sardinia (Italy) from 2019 on, a growing invasion of this locust species is ongoing, being the worst in over three decades. Locust swarms destroyed crops and pasture lands of approximately 60,000 ha in 2022. Drought, in combination with increasing uncultivated land, contributed to forming the perfect conditions for a Moroccan locust population upsurge. The specific aim of this paper is the quantification of land cover land use (LCLU) influence with regard to the recent locust outbreak in Sardinia using remote sensing data. In particular, the role of untilled, fallow, or abandoned land in the locust population upsurge is the focus of this case study. To address this objective, LCLU was derived from Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data between 2017 and 2021 using time-series composites and a random forest (RF) classification model. Coordinates of infested locations, altitude, and locust development stages were collected during field observation campaigns between March and July 2022 and used in this study to assess actual and previous land cover situation of these locations. Findings show that 43% of detected locust locations were found on untilled, fallow, or uncultivated land and another 23% within a radius of 100 m to such areas. Furthermore, oviposition and breeding sites are mostly found in sparse vegetation (97%). This study demonstrates that up-to-date remote sensing data and target-oriented analyses can provide valuable information to contribute to early warning systems and decision support and thus to minimize the risk concerning this agricultural pest. This is of particular interest for all agricultural pests that are strictly related to changing human activities within transformed habitats.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the five-year (2017-2021) monitoring of oil pollution in the Kerch Strait and its prestrait regions are analyzed. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the European Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B satellites, both real-time and archived, representing valuable material for searching, detecting, and studying the character of oil pollution caused by spills of crude oil, petroleum products, and other oily substances, have been used for monitoring. During monitoring, 2597 oil slicks with a total area of 1120.4 km(2) are detected on 481 SAR images. The main sources of pollution have been identified, in descending order, they are cargo transshipment areas in the strait, the port of Taman with its berthing complex, and prestrait anchorages in the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. In addition, natural seep manifestations in the adjacent Black Sea shelf have been discovered, they create a natural hydrocarbon background that should be taken into account. Based on the monitoring results, a tendency towards an overall decrease in spills is revealed, despite their growth in 2016-2019. Monitoring with SAR using the geoinformation approach has shown its high efficiency for the problems of real-time and retrospective analysis of the satellite imagery data concerning oil pollution.

TI  - Drought in Northern Italy: Long Earth Observation Time Series Reveal Snow Line Elevation to Be Several Hundred Meters Above Long-Term Average in 2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrological drought in Northern Italy in 2022 was, in large part, the consequence of a snow drought in the Italian Alps in the winter of 2021/22 and the resulting deficit of melt water runoff. In this communication, we assessed the snow-cover dynamics in nine Alpine Italian catchments using long time series of satellite-derived snow line elevation (SLE) measurements. We compared the SLE of the hydrological year 2021/22 to the long-term dynamics of 1985-2021. In early 2022, the SLE was located several hundred meters above the expected median values in all of the nine catchments. This resulted in deficits of snow-covered area of up to 83% in the Western Alps (catchment of Sesia, March 2022) and up to 61% in the Eastern Alps (Brenta, March 2022) compared to the long-term median. Although snow-cover data from optical satellite imagery do not contain information about snow depth and water content, in a preliminary qualitative analysis, the derived SLE dynamics show good agreement with the Standardized Snowpack Index (SSPI) which is based on the snow water equivalent (SWE). While the exact relationships between SLE, SWE, and runoff have to be explored further on the catchment basis, long-time series of SLE may have potential for use in drought early warning systems.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Land Use/Land Cover Mapping and Prediction Based on Hybrid Modeling Approach: A Case Study of Kano Metropolis, Nigeria (2020-2050)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The change dynamics of land use/land cover (LULC) is a vital factor that significantly modifies the natural environment. Therefore, mapping and predicting spatiotemporal LULC transformation is crucial in effectively managing the built environment toward achieving Sustainable Development Goal 11, which seeks to make cities all-inclusive, sustainable, and reliable. The study aims to examine the change dynamics of LULC in Kano Metropolis, Nigeria from 1991 to 2020 and predict the city's future land uses over the next 15 and 30 years, i.e., 2035 and 2050. The maximum likelihood algorithm (MLA) of the supervised classification method was utilized to classify the study area's land uses using Landsat satellite data and various geographic information system (GIS) techniques. A hybrid simulation model comprising cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) was then employed in validating and modeling the change dynamics of future LULC. The model integrated the spatial continuity of the CA model with the Markov chain's ability to address the limitations of individual models in simulating long-term land use prediction. The study revealed substantial changes in the historical LULC pattern of Kano metropolis from 1991 to 2020. It indicated a considerable decline in the city's barren land from approximately 413.47 km(2) in 1991 to 240.89 km(2) in 2020. Built-up areas showed the most extensive development over the past 29 years, from about 66.16 km(2) in 1991 to 218.72 km(2) in 2020. This trend of rapid urban growth is expected to continue over the next three decades, with prediction results indicating the city's built-up areas expanding to approximately 307.90 km(2) in 2035 and 364.88 km(2) in 2050. The result also suggests that barren lands are anticipated to decline further with the continuous sustenance of various agricultural activities, while vegetation and water bodies will slightly increase between 2020 and 2050. The findings of this study will help decision-makers and city administrators formulate sustainable land use policies for a more inclusive, safe, and resilient city.

TI  - Impact of Satellite Attitude on Altimetry Calibration with Microwave Transponders
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry plays a key role in monitoring changes in sea level and climate change. The quality of satellite altimetry products is commonly ensured through dedicated calibration. One such calibration is with microwave transponders acting as ground reference point targets. It is common practice that satellite ranges between the transponder phase center and the satellite center of gravity (CoG) are compared against the true geometric ranges to determine bias. Transponder ranges are, however, realized by the two phase centers of the altimeter and the ground transponder. So, to make this comparison feasible, the space origin of the measured range is transferred from the altimeter phase center (APC) to the satellite CoG by applying a constant offset, usually referred to as "CoG correction ". Instead of a fixed "CoG correction ", this work introduces the actual vector between APC and CoG in space, by examining the satellite attitude. Thus, the observed and geometric distances to the transponder are both referred to the APC. The case of Jason-3 and Sentinel-6A Michael Freilich (Sentinel-6A MF) with two transponders on Crete (CDN1) and Gavdos (GVD1) islands is examined. At first, the attitude of Jason-3 is determined by its quaternions. Then, analysis reveals that the transponder bias is correlated with the Jason-3 satellite attitude. The revised calibration brings about bias changes which fluctuate from about -2 mm to 1 mm in range and from -110 mu s to +110 mu s in datation for Jason-3. Spectral analysis on the bias differences between the revised and conventional transponder calibrations reveals constituents with periods of 117, 39 and 23 days. Finally, the revised methodology on crossover calibrations over the GVD1 transponder results in an improvement between the mean bias of the ascending and descending orbits by 12% for Jason-3 and by 14% (preliminary) for Sentinel-6A MF.

TI  - Determination of Equation Parameters as a Power Function for Forecasting the Yield of Agricultural Crops in Belarus Using Earth Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we determine the parameters of the equation for predicting the yield of agricultural crops (wheat, barley, rapeseed of both winter and spring forms) according to Earth remote-sensing data for the territory of the Republic of Belarus. As an equation for predicting yield, a power function that uses the vegetation index as one of the input values is considered. The parameters of the equation are determined (using a statistical approach) with no allowance for the variety of agricultural crops for fixed values of the plant development code and are oriented to the spectral channels of the Sentinel-2 satellites. Among those considered, the normalized vegetation index using spectral channels in the red edge and red regions of the spectrum are determined to be the best. When using this index, a stable relationship between its values and the yield of all studied types of agricultural crops for all values of the plant development code is observed. The accuracy of the forecast crop yields is estimated both from ground-based measurements and from atmospherically corrected data of the Sentinel-2 satellites both for individual plots and for a set of plots. In this case, the accuracy of the yield forecast increases significantly when analyzing multiple plots.

TI  - URBAN GREENING FOR LEAD SOILS POLLUTION CONTROL: THE USE ISOTOPE SIGNATURES ANALYSIS AND REMOTE SENSING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to understand the assessment using NDVI analysis and lead isotopic ratio for helping informed decision-making process in the urban soil pollution aspects for Chelyabinsk, Russia. We used new combination of two modern approaches to study of industrial city urban greening such as (1) Pb-isotope approach for identification of pollution sources; (2) remote sensing-based analysis of urban landscape and urban forest using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). We observed spatial variations in the NDVI calculated from Landsat satellite-observed data. The study was conducted in Chelyabinsk urban areas with different anthropogenic pressures. We used several new criteria for assessing the degree of geochemical transformation and pollution of the urban environment, and for identification of Pb pollution sources. Our results reveal that the polluted sites had a lower NDVI than the intact sites. We have identified typical mistakes in the urban areas greening and proposed modern strategies for increasing green cover in Chelyabinsk.

TI  - Streamflow of the Betwa River under the Combined Effect of LU-LC and Climate Change
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We estimate the combined effect of climate and landuse-landcover (LU-LC) change on the streamflow of the Betwa River; a semi-arid catchment in Central India. We have used the observed and future bias-corrected climatic datasets from 1980-2100. To assess the LU-LC change in the catchment, we have processed and classified the Landsat satellite images from 1990-2020. We have used Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based Cellular Automata (CA) model to simulate the future LU-LC. Further, we coupled the observed and projected LU-LC and climatic variables in the SWAT (Soil and water assessment tool) model to simulate the streamflow of the Betwa River. In doing so, we have setup this model for the observed (1980-2000 and 2001-2020) and projected (2023-2060 and 2061-2100) time periods by using the LU-LC of the years 1990, 2018, and 2040, 2070, respectively. We observed that the combined effect of climate and LU-LC change resulted in the reduction in the mean monsoon stream flow of the Betwa River by 16% during 2001-2020 as compared to 1982-2000. In all four CMIP6 climatic scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585), the mean monsoon stream flow is expected to decrease by 39-47% and 31-47% during 2023-2060 and 2061-2100, respectively as compared to the observed time period 1982-2020. Furthermore, average monsoon rainfall in the catchment will decrease by 30-35% during 2023-2060 and 23-30% during 2061-2100 with respect to 1982-2020.

TI  - Impact of temperature and precipitation lapse rate on hydrological modelling over Himalayan Gandak River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrology of Himalayan region is influenced by temperature lapse rate (TLAPS) and precipitation lapse rate (PLAPS). Therefore, hydrological modeling considering TLAPS and PLAPS is crucial to manage the water resources in these terrains. In this research, Himalayan Gandak River basin is considered as the study area where TLAPS and PLAPS vary significantly due to high altitude of Himalayas. To assess the impact of TLAPS and PLAPS on water balance components, Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was calibrated (2000-2007) and validated (2008-2014) on daily time step for three projects i.e., Reference Project (RP), Snowmelt Project (SP) and distributed elevation band snowmelt project (SWAT-ETISM). The analysis discloses that SWAT-ETISM model (which has TLAPS and PLAPS parameters) outperforms the RP and the SP models in predicting streamflow with improved statistical indicators R-2 =0.88, NSE =0.84 and PBIAS = 11.9. Furthermore, it was observed that SWAT-ETISM model comprehensively improved the streamflow statistics by improving the snow water equivalent and water balance components through the consideration of TLAPS and PLAPS values for the region. Hence, the proposed SWAT-ETISM model can be used for estimation of the water budget at the high-altitude and data scarce alpine Himalayan regions and worldwide, where PLAPS and TLAPS are substantial due to altitudinal variation.

TI  - The Effects of River Control and Climatic and Hydrological Changes on the State of Floodplain and Delta Ecosystems of the Lower Don
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial floodplain ecosystems of the Lower Don are still poorly studied, although almost the entire lower reaches of the Don are regulated by reservoirs and low-head hydroelectric systems, which significantly change ecosystems and landscapes. The research was carried out according to our own methodology. Field studies were carried out on five model ecological profiles with a detailed analysis of vegetation and the position of surface groundwater at model points. Desk studies included analysis of statistical hydrological materials and satellite images from Landsat 2, 3, and 5 and Sentinel-2, as well as the determination of the state of the ecosystems and landscapes using a two-stage methodology for assessing disturbances in terrestrial ecosystems and landscapes as a result of changes in the water level in the study area. It has been revealed that the main factor influencing the change in the biotic components of ecosystems in the Lower Don reaches is the reduction in the amplitude of fluctuations in water discharges (and levels) in the annual cycle as a result of the river control and climate changes. The decrease in the frequency of flooding of the floodplain and delta areas by almost 4 times along with a 3.5 times decrease in spring flood discharges and a 2.2 to 2.3 times increase in low-water discharges (both winter and summer-autumn flows) has led not only to a rise of the Don channel level by more than 2.5 m, but also to a rise and stabilization of the groundwater level (GWL) in the floodplain and delta of the Lower Don, which has involved a succession of communities of the upper and middle floodplains by nontypical invasive species. On the upper floodplain, native oak and elm forests have been almost completely replaced by green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) and boxelder maple (Acer negundo) forests. Typical willow (Salix alba) forests on the middle floodplain are replaced by indigobush (Amorpha fruticosa) forests in the near-channel floodplain and oleaster (Elaeagnus angustifolia) forests in the central parts of the floodplain. The forb meadows of the middle floodplain are replaced by almost monodominant reed-grass (Calamagrostis epigeios) meadows with thorny weeds of thistle (Cirsium) and cocklebur (Xanthium) species. Newly formed nontypical floodplain communities are better resistant to a year-round steadily high GWL. Assessment of the disturbance of the water level in the ecosystems and landscapes on a 5-point scale according to our own methodology has shown that the least disturbed (two of the five possible points) areas are the areas that are most distant from the hydraulic structures, namely, areas in the new and old Don deltas. The other profiles (3-5), located in the impact zone of the hydraulic structures, have a moderate degree of disturbance (three points), which currently requires only local hydraulic and forest engineering drainage measures, rather than changes in the hydrological regime of the river.

TI  - A Complete Meteo/Hydro/Hydraulic Chain Application to Support Early Warning and Monitoring Systems: The Apollo Medicane Use Case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Because of the ongoing changing climate, extreme rainfall events' frequency at the global scale is expected to increase, thus resulting in high social and economic impacts. A Meteo/Hydro/Hydraulic forecasting chain combining heterogeneous observational data sources is a crucial component for an Early Warning System and is a fundamental asset for Civil Protection Authorities to correctly predict these events, their effects, and put in place anticipatory actions. During the last week of October 2021 an intense Mediterranean hurricane (Apollo) affected many Mediterranean countries (Tunisia, Algeria, Malta, and Italy) with a death toll of seven people. The CIMA Meteo/Hydro/Hydraulic forecasting chain, including the WRF model, the hydrological model Continuum, the automatic system for water detection (AUTOWADE), and the hydraulic model TELEMAC-2D, was operated in real-time to predict the Apollo weather evolution as well as its hydrological and hydraulic impacts, in support of the early warning activities of the Italian Civil Protection Department. The WRF model assimilating radar data and in situ weather stations showed very good predictive capability for rainfall timing and location over eastern Sicily, thus supporting accurate river flow peak forecasting with the hydrological model Continuum. Based on WRF predictions, the daily automatic system for water detection (AUTOWADE) run using Sentinel 1 data was anticipated with respect to the scheduled timing to quickly produce a flood monitoring map. Ad hoc tasking of the COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation was also performed to overcome the S1 data latency in eastern Sicily. The resulting automated operational mapping of floods and inland waters was integrated with the subsequent execution of the hydraulic model TELEMAC-2D to have a complete representation of the flooded area with water depth and water velocity.

TI  - Comparison of prevention of parent-to-child HIV transmission programme & national biennial HIV sentinel surveillance data for tracking HIV epidemic in India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background & objectives: HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) among antenatal women in India has been used to track the epidemic for many years. However, reliable tracking at the local level is not possible as ANC sentinel sites are limited in number and cover a smaller sample size at each site. Prevention of parent-to-child-transmission (PPTCT) programme data has a potential advantage due to better geographical coverage, which could provide more precise HIV case estimates; therefore, we compared HSS ANC data with PPTCT programme data for HIV tracking.Methods: Out of the 499 surveillance sites, where HSS and PPTCT programme was being conducted in 2015, 210 sites (140 urban and 70 rural) were selected using a stratified random sampling method. HSS (n=72,981) and PPTCT (n=112,832) data records were linked confidentially. The sociodemographic characteristics of HSS and PPTCT attendees were compared. HIV prevalence from HSS ANC was compared with the PPTCT programme data using Chi-square test. State- and site-level correlation of HIV prevalence was also done. Concordance between HSS and PPTCT HIV positivity was estimated using kappa statistics.Results: The age distribution of HSS and PPTCT attendees was similar (range: 23 to 27 yr); however, HSS ANC participants were better educated, whereas PPTCT recorded a higher proportion of homemakers. The correlation of HIV prevalence between HSS and PPTCT was high (r=0.9) at the State level and moderate at the site level (r=0.7). The HIV positivity agreement between HSS ANC and PPTCT was good (kappa=0.633). A similar prevalence was reported across 26 States, whereas PPTCT had a significantly lower prevalence than HSS in three States where PPTCT coverage was low. Overall HIV prevalence was 0.31 per cent in HSS and 0.22 per cent in PPTCT (P<0.001).Interpretation & conclusions: High-quality PPTCT programme data can provide reliable HIV trends in India. An operational framework for PPTCT-based surveillance should be pilot-tested in a phased manner before replacing HSS with PPTCT.

TI  - Shoreline Prediction Modelling as a Base Tool for Coastal Management: The Catania Plain Case Study (Italy)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dynamic is the complex result of multiple natural and human processes, and past and future coastal behavior studies become fundamental to support coastal zone management. However, the reliability of coastal evolution studies is strongly dependent on the analyzed time interval. The longer the period is, the more reliable the past shoreline change analysis and the forecast of shoreline position will be. The present study showed the 50-years shoreline evolution of the Catania coastal plain (Southern Italy), a densely populated area where human-induced processes profoundly changed natural dynamics. Landsat and Sentinel imageries were used to extract shorelines' position over the time between 1972 and 2022 and the DSAS tool was used to calculate the shoreline change rates. The shoreline evolution in 2032 and 2042 was performed by the Kalman filter method, a tool largely applied to forecast short-term shoreline future position. Most of the Catania coastal plain was mainly retreating over the last decades. However, the most significant changes were registered in correspondence with the coastal structures and the river deltas. The reliability of the forecasting model was highly related to the coastal morphology. As such, the lower RMSE values were calculated in correspondence with the uniform coastal subsectors.

TI  - Optimizing Landsat Next Shortwave Infrared Bands for Crop Residue Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on optimizing the placement of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands for pixel-level estimation of fractional crop residue cover (f(R)) for the upcoming Landsat Next mission. We applied an iterative wavelength shift approach to a database of crop residue field spectra collected in Beltsville, Maryland, USA (n = 916) and computed generalized two- and three-band spectral indices for all wavelength combinations between 2000 and 2350 nm, then used these indices to model field-measured f(R). A subset of the full dataset with a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) < 0.3 threshold (n = 643) was generated to evaluate green vegetation impacts on f(R) estimation. For the two-band wavelength shift analyses applied to the NDVI < 0.3 dataset, a generalized normalized difference using 2226 nm and 2263 nm bands produced the top f(R) estimation performance (R-2 = 0.8222; RMSE = 0.1296). These findings were similar to the established two-band Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) (R-2 = 0.8145; RMSE = 0.1324). Performance of the two-band generalized normalized difference and SINDRI decreased for the full-NDVI dataset (R-2 = 0.5865 and 0.4144, respectively). For the three-band wavelength shift analyses applied to the NDVI < 0.3 dataset, a generalized ratio-based index with a 2031-2085-2216 nm band combination, closely matching established Cellulose Absorption Index (CAI) bands, was top performing (R-2 = 0.8397; RMSE = 0.1231). Three-band indices with CAI-type wavelengths maintained top f(R) estimation performance for the full-NDVI dataset with a 2036-2111-2217 nm band combination (R-2 = 0.7581; RMSE = 0.1548). The 2036-2111-2217 nm band combination was also top performing in f(R) estimation (R-2 = 0.8690; RMSE = 0.0970) for an additional analysis assessing combined green vegetation cover and surface moisture effects. Our results indicate that a three-band configuration with band centers and wavelength tolerances of 2036 nm (+/- 5 nm), 2097 nm (+/- 14 nm), and 2214 (+/- 11 nm) would optimize Landsat Next SWIR bands for f(R) estimation.

AB  - Ship classification based on high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery plays an increasingly important role in various maritime affairs, such as marine transportation management, maritime emergency rescue, marine pollution prevention and control, marine security situational awareness, and so on. The technology of deep learning, especially convolution neural network (CNN), has shown excellent performance on ship classification in SAR images. Nevertheless, it still has some limitations in real-world applications that need to be taken seriously by researchers. One is the insufficient number of SAR ship training samples, which limits the learning of satisfactory CNN, and the other is the limited information that SAR images can provide (compared with natural images), which limits the extraction of discriminative features. To alleviate the limitation caused by insufficient training datasets, one of the widely adopted strategies is to pre-train CNNs on a generic dataset with massive labeled samples (such as ImageNet) and fine-tune the pre-trained network on the target dataset (i.e., a SAR dataset) with a small number of training samples. However, recent studies have shown that due to the different imaging mechanisms between SAR and natural images, it is hard to guarantee that the pre-trained CNNs (even if they perform extremely well on ImageNet) can be finely tuned by a SAR dataset. On the other hand, to extract the most discriminative ship representation features from SAR images, the existing methods have carried out fruitful research on network architecture design, attention mechanism embedding, feature fusion, etc. Although these efforts improve the performance of SAR ship classification to some extent, they are usually based on more complex network architecture and higher dimensional features, accompanied by more time-consuming storage expenses. Through the analysis of SAR image characteristics and CNN feature extraction mechanism, this study puts forward three hypotheses: (1) Pre-training CNN on a task-specific dataset may be more effective than that on a generic dataset; (2) a shallow CNN may be more suitable for SAR image feature extraction than a deep one; and (3) the deep features extracted by CNNs can be further refined to improve the feature discrimination ability. To validate these hypotheses, we propose to learn a shallow CNN which is pre-trained on a task-specific dataset, i.e., the optical remote sensing ship dataset (ORS) instead of on the widely adopted ImageNet dataset. For comparison purposes, we designed 28 CNN architectures by changing the arrangement of the CNN components, the size of convolutional filters, and pooling formulations based on VGGNet models. To further reduce redundancy and improve the discrimination ability of the deep features, we propose to refine deep features by active convolutional filter selection based on the coefficient of variation (COV) sorting criteria. Extensive experiments not only prove that the above hypotheses are valid but also prove that the shallow network learned by the proposed pre-training strategy and the feature refining method can achieve considerable ship classification performance in SAR images like the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TI  - The acceptance and use of smart farming applications based on remote sensing data by German farmers
T2  - BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digitalization has the potential to make work in agriculture easier and more efficient. Many smart farming technologies are based on remote sensing data, i.e. data collected by means of sensors from satellites, drones and other aircraft. This paper focuses on whether and how German farmers use smart farming applications that use remote sensing data. For this purpose, an online survey was conducted with German farmers in July 2021. First, it was determined in which areas the farmers currently use digital applications and which factors play a role in the decision for or against their use. The most important influencing factors were comprehensible added value, costs and data protection. Farmers were also asked about their attitudes toward potential new uses. For this purpose, the farmers were presented with possible new smart farming applications, which they were asked to categorize into the best (with the highest benefit) and worst (with the lowest benefit) using best-worst scaling. The farmers see the greatest benefit in applications in field and crop monitoring (e.g., overviews of soil moisture, structure and structural damage, predictions of yield formation and threshing maturity, and the detection of damage, diseases and deficiency symptoms), while they see increased administrative support, such as automatic field boundary and crop type recognition or support for documentation obligations and reminders as little beneficial.

TI  - Using remote sensing, process-based crop models, and machine learning to evaluate crop rotations across 20 million hectares in Western Australia
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely employed to identify crop types and monitor crop yields on farms. Here, we combine successive seasons of these products to identify crop rotations in each field across 20 million hectares of the Western Australian Wheatbelt. We used the APSIM crop model to define the starting soil water, temperature stresses, biomass, and crop yield to characterize the prevailing agro-environment of that field. These remote sensing data and APSIM crop modeling outputs were then combined, with machine learning, to predict the effect of the complex interaction between agro-environment and crop rotation on wheat yield. Predictions from machine learning are employed to evaluate the benefits or otherwise of crop rotation across Western Australia for every field in the study region. In general, if fields subjected to a wheat-cereal rotation were instead subjected to a wheat-canola rotation, then 68% of these fields were predicted to experience a yield increase of between 0 and 1850 kg ha(-1). However, only 28% of fields planted to canola were predicted to have a yield benefit of 200 kg ha(-1) or more on the following wheat crops. On average, annual pastures generated a slight yield penalty of 47 kg ha(-1) to the following wheat crop. The findings from this study, using crop models, remote sensing, and machine learning, indicate that the benefits of break crops and pastures to farmers is less than the 400 to 600 kg ha(-1) benefit commonly reported from field experiments. These management insights could underpin the development of future decision aids or agricultural digital twins for crop management decisions such as crop rotation planning. The approach provides farmers with tangible insights about their production using outputs from crop-based remote sensing and crop modeling.

TI  - Diagnostic criteria for acute headache attributed to ischemic stroke and for sentinel headache before ischemic stroke
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEADACHE AND PAIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Defining the relationship between a headache and stroke is essential. The current diagnostic criteria of the ICHD-3 for acute headache attributed to ischemic stroke are based primarily on the opinion of experts rather than on published clinical evidence based on extensive case-control studies in patients with first-ever stroke. Diagnostic criteria for sentinel headache before ischemic stroke do not exist. The present study aimed to develop explicit diagnostic criteria for headache attributed to ischemic stroke and for sentinel headache. Methods This prospective case-control study included 550 patients (mean age 63.1, 54% males) with first-ever ischemic stroke and 192 control patients (mean age 58.7, 36% males) admitted to the emergency room without any acute neurological deficits or severe disorders. Standardized semi-structured interview forms were used to evaluate past and present headaches during face-to-face interviews by a neurologist on admission to the emergency room in both groups of patients. All headaches were diagnosed according to the ICHD-3. We tabulated the onset of different headaches before a first-ever ischemic stroke and at the time of onset of stroke. We divided them into three groups: a new type of headache, the previous headache with altered characteristics and previous unaltered headaches. The same was done for headaches in control patients within one week before admission to the hospital and at the time of entry. These data were used to create and test diagnostic criteria for acute headache attributed to stroke and sentinel headache. Results Our previous studies showed that headache at onset of ischemic stroke was present in 82 (14.9%) of 550 patients, and 81 (14.7%) patients had sentinel headache within the last week before a stroke. Only 60% of the headaches at stroke onset fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of ICHD-3. Therefore, we proposed alternative criteria with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97%. Besides, we developed diagnostic criteria for sentinel headache for the first time with a specificity of 98% and a sensitivity of 100%. Conclusions We suggest alternative diagnostic criteria for acute headache attributed to ischemic stroke and new diagnostic criteria for sentinel headache with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Activity of Okgye Limestone Mine in South Korea Observed by InSAR Coherence and PSInSAR Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Okgye limestone mine, which is the largest open-pit limestone mine located in a mountainous area in Korea, suffered a collapse in 2012 that claimed four casualties. Restoration work on the rocky mined-out slopes, as well as mining and dumping activities, are still in progress. Monitoring slope stability is important to prevent the sudden collapse of slopes, which can be efficiently performed by satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. Firstly, we obtained elevation changes using InSAR-generated Copernicus 30 m DEM in 2014 and an SRTM 1Sec DEM in 2000, through which the area was roughly classified into the mining area, tailings storage area, and the mined-out area. A time series of 12-day coherence images produced by Sentinel-1B SAR were averaged annually to produce an RGB-composite image to observe the change in mining activities during 2018, 2019, and 2020. We found many persistent scatterers (PS) when observing the ground displacement, both in the ascending and descending orbits, from which we decomposed this into the vertical and east components. The largest displacement of 63.6 mm/year was observed during 2019 and 2020 in the tailings storage area in the direction of the dumping slope. For the rocky outcrops and the transmission tower, we found a seasonal oscillation, which can be interpreted as the thermal expansion of limestone and iron. This paper demonstrated that the surface stability and deformation of open-pit mines could be effectively monitored by combining InSAR DEM, coherence, and PSInSAR techniques.

TI  - Deciphering changes in the incidence of the Guillain-Barre syndrome during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationwide time-series correlation study
T2  - BMJ NEUROLOGY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundPostinfectious autoimmunity is a hallmark of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), and GBS incidence closely parallels that of its immune triggers. Sociobehavioural interventions implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic have altered the infectious disease landscape.MethodsThis nationwide time-series correlation study analysed GBS incidence, sentinel surveillance and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination data from January 2017 to December 2021 in the National Health Insurance Service and Korean Disease Control and Prevention Agency databases. The incidence of GBS and sentinel gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious diseases during the pandemic (2020-2021) was estimated and compared with both prepandemic (2017-2019) and incidence predicted in a time-series forecasting model. Time-series correlation analysis was used to examine the temporal association between GBS, infectious triggers and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.ResultsDuring the pandemic, the total crude cumulative incidence rate was 2.1 per 100 000 population, which is lower than the prepandemic incidence, especially in age groups of less than 60 years. Seasonality was briefly interrupted during the winter of 2021. The majority of respiratory and some gastrointestinal conditions had a lower-than-expected incidence during the pandemic. Compared with the prepandemic state, during the pandemic period a higher number of gastrointestinal pathogens (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens, Yersinia enterocolitica and enteric adenovirus) had significant, moderate-to-strong positive temporal associations with GBS. The temporal association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS was not significant, but SARS-CoV-2 vaccination exhibited a strong positive temporal association with GBS in 2021.ConclusionThe incidence of GBS and sentinel infectious diseases decreased to below-expected levels during the pandemic, with the former attributable to the decreased incidence of non-COVID-19 respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. The evolving incidence of autoimmune postinfectious phenomena following the pandemic needs attention.

TI  - Predicting the Response of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Hormone Receptor-Positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative Breast Cancer With Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis by Multigene Assay
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The GenesWellTM breast cancer test (BCT) is a recently developed multigene assay that predicts the risk of distant recurrence in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor-2 negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (BC). The ability of this assay to predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has not been established to date.Methods: Biopsy specimens from HR+/HER2- BC patients with axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis who underwent NACT were analyzed using the BCT score. The modified BCT score was developed and patients classified into high-and low-response groups. A total of 88 patients were available for the BCT score among the 108 eligible patients. The median follow-up duration was 35.9 (7.8-128.5) months.Results: Among them, 61 (65.1%) had cN1 and 53 (60.2%) had cT1 or cT2 disease. The BCT score was low in 25 (28.4%) patients and high in 63 (71.6%). Among the 50 patients with pathologic complete response or partial response, 41 (82.0%) were in the high BCT score group and 9 (18.0%) were in the low BCT score group. Among the 38 patients with stable or progressive disease, 22 (57.9%) were in the high BCT score group and 16 (42.1%) were in the low BCT score group (p = 0.025). Ki-67 before NACT was a significant factor for predicting tumor response (p = 0.006; 3.81 [1.50-10.16]). The BCT score showed a significant response to NACT (p = 0.016; 4.18 [1.34-14.28]). Distant metastasis-free survival was significantly different between the high-and low-response groups (p = 0.004). Conclusion: We demonstrated that the BCT score predicts NACT responsiveness in HR+/ HER2- BC with LN metastasis and might help determine whether NACT should be performed. Further studies are required to validate these results.

TI  - R Libraries for Remote Sensing Data Classification by K-Means Clustering and NDVI Computation in Congo River Basin, DRC
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application Libraries of the R programming language, including RStoolbox, raster and terra, were used to classify Landsat OLI-TIRS satellite images by k-means clustering and NDVI computation for comparative vegetation mapping of tropical rainforests for the period of 2013-2022 in the three target areas (Bumba, Basoko, Kisangani) of the middle Congo River Basin, central Africa, D.R.C. In this paper, an image analysis framework is formulated for Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS) scenes using the R programming language. The libraries of R are shown to be effective in remote sensing data processing tasks, such as classification using k-means clustering and computing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The data are processed using an integration of the RStoolbox, terra, raster, rgdal and auxiliary packages of R. The proposed approach to image processing using R is designed to exploit the parameters of image bands as cues to detect land cover types and vegetation parameters corresponding to the spectral reflectance of the objects represented on the Earth's surface. Our method is effective at processing the time series of the images taken at various periods to monitor the landscape dynamics in the middle part of the Congo River basin, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Whereas previous approaches primarily used Geographic Information System (GIS) software, we proposed to explicitly use the scripting methods for satellite image analysis by applying the extended functionality of R. The application of scripts for geospatial data is an effective and robust method compared with the traditional approaches due to its high automation and machine-based graphical processing. The algorithms of the R libraries are adjusted to spatial operations, such as projections and transformations, object topology, classification and map algebra. The data include Landsat-8 OLI-TIRS covering the three regions along the Congo river, Bumba, Basoko and Kisangani, for the years 2013, 2015 and 2022. We also validate the performance of graphical data handling for cartographic visualization using R libraries for visualising changes in land cover types by k-means clustering and calculation of the NDVI for vegetation analysis.

TI  - Satellite Image Processing by Python and R Using Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS and SRTM DEM Data on Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose an advanced scripting approach using Python and R for satellite image processing and modelling terrain in Cote d'Ivoire, West Africa. Data include Landsat 9 OLI/TIRS C2 L1 and the SRTM digital elevation model (DEM). The EarthPy library of Python and 'raster' and 'terra' packages of R are used as tools for data processing. The methodology includes computing vegetation indices to derive information on vegetation coverage and terrain modelling. Four vegetation indices were computed and visualised using R: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index 2 (ARVI2). The SAVI index is demonstrated to be more suitable and better adjusted to the vegetation analysis, which is beneficial for agricultural monitoring in Cote d'Ivoire. The terrain analysis is performed using Python and includes slope, aspect, hillshade and relief modelling with changed parameters for the sun azimuth and angle. The vegetation pattern in Cote d'Ivoire is heterogeneous, which reflects the complexity of the terrain structure. Therefore, the terrain and vegetation data modelling is aimed at the analysis of the relationship between the regional topography and environmental setting in the study area. The upscaled mapping is performed as regional environmental analysis of the Yamoussoukro surroundings and local topographic modelling of the Kossou Lake. The algorithms of the data processing include image resampling, band composition, statistical analysis and map algebra used for calculation of the vegetation indices in Cote d'Ivoire. This study demonstrates the effective application of the advanced programming algorithms in Python and R for satellite image processing.

TI  - GRASS GIS Scripts for Satellite Image Analysis by Raster Calculations Using Modules r.mapcalc, d.rgb, r.slope.aspect
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrated the use of GRASS GIS scripts for satellite image analysis. The aim is to perform topographic and environmental analysis in eastern China, Shandong Province, Qingdao region. Variables include land surface temperature evaluated by correlation between the Landsat ETM+ channels and colour composites. The methodology is based on scripting by GRASS GIS modules. Data include two satellite Landsat TM images with a 5 years span (2009 and 2004). The images were imported to GRASS GIS using GDAL library by 'r.in.gdal' module. The topography (DEM) was assessed by GRASS GIS 'd.rast' module with isolines plotted using 'r.contour' and 'd.vect'. The map elements were displayed by 'v.in.region', 'd.vect', 'v.info'. The slope and aspect maps based on DEM were plotted using module 'r.slope.aspect' and visualised by a consecutive combination of 'd.rast', 'r.colours', 'd.legend', 'd.text' and 'd.grid' modules. The scatterplot of pairwise correlation of the selected Landsat TM7 channels (10 and 20, 50 and 70) was done by 'd.correlate'. The applied code from the 'r.mapcalc' was used for image calibration from the DN to apparent radiance at sensor. Two maps showing land surface temperature for 2009 and 2004 were plotted by 'r.mapcalc'. The land surface temperature maps show lower values over the water and forests, while higher values in cities. Plotting land surface temperature map was made to analyse variations in climate settings in Shandong during 5 years based on the comparative analysis using 'r.mapcalc' module. The images were plotted by natural and false colour band composites using 'd.rgb' module and band combinations: 1) colour infrared with focus on vegetation (5-4- 3); 2) natural colour composites (1-2-3); 3) contrasting slopes for topography (4-5-7); 4) vegetation analysis (2-3-4); 5) focus on land/water borders (5-6-7). The study has shown cartographic functionality of GRASS GIS scripts specifically for remote sensing data processing and topographic analysis. The environmental modelling has shown variations in land surface temperature, slope steepness and orientation (aspect). The GRASS GIS demonstrated to be an effective tool for remote sensing. Full codes are available on the GitHub repository of the author with provided link to scripts.

AB  - A new article by Ukrainian experts in ethno-pedagogy for the first time in science maximally summarizes the neuro-pedagogical, psychological and social potential of human development through the reproduction of folk games. The aim of the article is not only to consider the thematic diversity, but also to demonstrate how Ukrainian folk children's games and ancient adult games have a natural influence on the formation of worldview, socialization and maturity with the involvement of physical, neurophysiological and psycho-pedagogical mechanisms. Using general scientific, historical and neuroscientific methods, we proved the imitative, compensatory, sublimational, imitative, ritual and entertaining nature of folk games. Within the limits and possibilities available to the authors, neuroscientific commentary is presented to substantiate the underlying functions and mechanisms of folk games. The main result of the article is the creation of the fullest possible classification of the developing educational potential of folk games at two levels of generalization (general pedagogical aspects and specific functions). The authors were also able to review related literature on the topic, identify valuable observations and gnostic lacunas in need of scientific explication and ekplanatornost.

TI  - Unmeasured factors are associated with the use of completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCompletion lymph node dissection (CLND) was the standard treatment for patients with melanoma with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) until 2017 when data from the DeCOG-SLT and MLST-2 randomized trials challenged the survival benefit of this procedure. We assessed the contribution of patient, tumor and facility factors on the use of CLND in patients with surgically resected Stage III melanoma. MethodsUsing the National Cancer Database, patients who underwent surgical excision and were found to have a positive SLN from 2012 to 2017 were included. A multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression model with a random intercept for the facility was used to determine the effect of patient, tumor, and facility variables on the risk of CLND. Reference effect measures (REMs) were used to compare the contribution of contextual effects (unknown facility variables) versus measured variables on the variation in CLND use. ResultsFrom 2012 to 2017, the overall use of CLND decreased from 59.9% to 26.5% (p < 0.0001). Overall, older patients and patients with government-based insurance were less likely to undergo CLND. Tumor factors associated with a decreased rate of CLND included primary tumor location on the lower limb, decreasing depth, and mitotic rate <1. However, the contribution of contextual effects to the variation in CLND use exceeded that of the measured facility, tumor, time, and patient variables. ConclusionsThere was a decrease in CLND use during the study period. However, there is still high variability in CLND use, mainly driven by unmeasured contextual effects.

TI  - Determination of biomarkers threshold values and illustration of their use for the diagnostic in large-scale freshwater biomonitoring surveys
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Several biomarkers developed from freshwater sentinel species are used to complement chemical assessment of freshwater ecosystems and improve the evaluation of their contamination levels. While active biomonitoring strategies allow to compare biological data in the field, the lack of assessment criteria to interpret biomarkers modulations restricts their application in freshwater biomonitoring surveys. For this purpose, the determination of threshold values emerges as a relevant approach to support the biomarker-based diagnosis within biomonitoring surveys. Based on the distribution of contamination baselines, a statistical approach was proposed to define threshold values of bioaccumulated concentrations in the sentinel species Gammarus fossarum. Although this methodology is limited to chemical databases, this approach could be adapted for defining threshold values at the biological level. This study aims to demonstrate the possibility of defining threshold values for different classes of biomarkers monitored in two freshwater sentinel species (Dreissena polymorpha, G. fossarum) and evidence the added value of such an approach in biomarker-based diagnosis. Results: For this purpose, the study benefited from exceptional environmental biomarker datasets acquired from mussels and gammarids caged in hundred environmental sites, representative of the diversity of French water bodies. Thanks to these environmental datasets, inhibition and/or induction thresholds could be defined for 8 biochemical, cellular, and molecular biomarkers of D. polymorpha and 25 peptide biomarkers of G. fossarum, not influenced by confounding factors. Threshold values were then applied to another biomarker dataset acquired from mussels and gammarids caged upstream and downstream four wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Several biomarkers were modulated both downstream and upstream of WWTPs, indicating a potential contamination not related to WWTPs. In contrast, some biomarkers were impacted exclusively downstream of the WWTPs, highlighting an impact of WWTP discharges on the aquatic fauna. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the possibility to define threshold values for a wide range of biomarkers (cellular, biochemical and molecular) monitored on different sentinel species. The definition of threshold values constitutes an attractive solution to support the application of biomarkers in active biomonitoring surveys and improve the biomarker-based diagnosis without the need of "reference sites ".

TI  - Representativeness, Vaccination Uptake, and COVID-19 Clinical Outcomes 2020-2021 in the UK Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Network: Cohort Profile Summary
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) is one of Europe's oldest sentinel systems, working with the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) and its predecessor bodies for 55 years. Its surveillance report now runs twice weekly, supplemented by online observatories. In addition to conducting sentinel surveillance from a nationally representative group of practices, the RSC is now also providing data for syndromic surveillance. Objective: The aim of this study was to describe the cohort profile at the start of the 2021-2022 surveillance season and recent changes to our surveillance practice.Methods: The RSC's pseudonymized primary care data, linked to hospital and other data, are held in the Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub, a Trusted Research Environment. We describe the RSC's cohort profile as of September 2021, divided into a Primary Care Sentinel Cohort (PCSC)-collecting virological and serological specimens-and a larger group of syndromic surveillance general practices (SSGPs). We report changes to our sampling strategy that brings the RSC into alignment with European Centre for Disease Control guidance and then compare our cohort's sociodemographic characteristics with Office for National Statistics data. We further describe influenza and COVID-19 vaccine coverage for the 2020-2021 season (week 40 of 2020 to week 39 of 2021), with the latter differentiated by vaccine brand. Finally, we report COVID-19-related outcomes in terms of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death.Results: As a response to COVID-19, the RSC grew from just over 500 PCSC practices in 2019 to 1879 practices in 2021 (PCSC, n=938; SSGP, n=1203). This represents 28.6% of English general practices and 30.59% (17,299,780/56,550,136) of the population. In the reporting period, the PCSC collected >8000 virology and >23,000 serology samples. The RSC population was broadly representative of the national population in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, National Health Service Region, socioeconomic status, obesity, and smoking habit. The RSC captured vaccine coverage data for influenza (n=5.4 million) and COVID-19, reporting dose one (n=11.9 million), two (n=11 million), and three (n=0.4 million) for the latter as well as brand-specific uptake data (AstraZeneca vaccine, n=11.6 million; Pfizer, n=10.8 million; and Moderna, n=0.7 million). The median (IQR) number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and ICU admissions was 1181 (559-1559) and 115 (50-174) per week, respectively.Conclusions: The RSC is broadly representative of the national population; its PCSC is geographically representative and its SSGPs are newly supporting UKHSA syndromic surveillance efforts. The network captures vaccine coverage and has expanded from reporting primary care attendances to providing data on onward hospital outcomes and deaths. The challenge remains to increase virological and serological sampling to monitor the effectiveness and waning of all vaccines available in a timely manner.

TI  - Identification and Mapping of High Nature Value Farmland in the Yellow River Delta Using Landsat-8 Multispectral Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of high nature value farmland (HNVf) can effectively improve the problems of biodiversity reduction, non-point source pollution and carbon loss in intensive farmland. To this end, we developed a set of general indicators based on Landsat 8 OLI imagery, including land cover (LC), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), Shannon diversity (SH) and Simpson's index (SI). Combined with a Kohonen neural network (KNN), we assigned weights and developed the first potential HNVf map of the Yellow River Delta in China. The results showed that the four indicators were very effective for the expression of HNVf characteristics in the study area, and that SH and SI, in particular, could reflect the potential characteristics of HNVf at the edge of intensive farmland. LC, NDVI, SH and SI were weighted as 0.45, 0.25, 0.15 and 0.15, respectively. It was found that the potential HNVf type 2 (i.e., low-intensity agriculture, and natural and structural elements such as shrubs, woodlands and small rivers) in the study area was concentrated at the edges of intensive farmland, the transition zones from farmland to rivers and the estuary wetland areas of northern and eastern rivers. LC played a leading role in identifying HNVf. Based on six randomly selected real-world verification data from Map World, it was found that the accuracy of the validation set for HNVf type 2 was 83.33%, which exhibited the good development potential of HNVf in the study area. This is the first potential HNVf type 2 map of the Yellow River Delta in China and could provide a great deal of potential guidance for the development and protection of farmland biodiversity and regional carbon sequestration.

TI  - In-Season Prediction of Corn Grain Yield through PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth and yield monitoring are essential for food security and agricultural economic return prediction. Remote sensing is an efficient technique for measuring growing season crop canopies and providing information on the spatial variability of crop yields. In this study, ten vegetation indices (VIs) derived from time series PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 images were used to investigate the potential to estimate corn grain yield with different regression methods. A field-scale spatial crop yield prediction model was developed and used to produce yield maps depicting spatial variability in the field. Results from this study clearly showed that high-resolution PlanetScope satellite data could be used to detect the corn yield variability at field level, which could explain 15% more variability than Sentinel-2A data at the same spatial resolution of 10 m. Comparison of the model performance and variable importance measure between models illustrated satisfactory results for assessing corn productivity with VIs. The green chlorophyll vegetation index (GCVI) values consistently produced the highest correlations with corn yield, accounting for 72% of the observed spatial variation in corn yield. More reliable quantitative yield estimation could be made using a multi-linear stepwise regression (MSR) method with multiple VIs. Good agreement between observed and predicted yield was achieved with the coefficient of determination value being 0.81 at 86 days after seeding. The results would help farmers and decision-makers generate predicted yield maps, identify crop yield variability, and make further crop management practices timely.

TI  - Using HJ-1 CCD and MODIS Fusion Data to Invert HJ-1 NBAR for Time Series Analysis, a Case Study in the Mountain Valley of North China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - HJ-1 charge-coupled device (CCD) data with high temporal and medium spatial resolution are widely used in environmental and disaster monitoring in China. However, due to bad weather, it is difficult to obtain sufficient time-continuous HJ-1 CCD data for environmental monitoring. In this study, the mountain valley with farmland and forestland in North China is selected as the experimental area, and HJ-1 CCD and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used in the case study. An improved method of fusing data and inversing surface reflectivity is presented to obtain the HJ-1 inversion network-based application resolution (NBAR) data using linear matching of the Ross Thick-Li Sparse Reciprocal (RTLSR) model, and then predicted reflectivity using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. The fusion data have advantages of high spatial and temporal resolution, as well as meeting the requirements of high quality and quantity of small-scale regional data. This case study provides a feasibility method for the HJ-1 satellites to produce the secondary products for small-scale remote sensing ground surface research. It also provides a reference for dynamic information acquisition and application of small satellite data, contributing to the improvement in RS estimation of surface environment variables.

TI  - Comprehensive Study of Inversion Methods for Sound Speed Profiles in the South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional acquisition method of sound speed profiles using hydro-acoustic instruments is accurate but time-consuming and costly. To overcome this problem, some inversion methods have been developed over the last few decades. In this study, a comprehensive comparison of two inversion methods - the acoustic inversion method (AIM) and the satellite observation reconstruction method (SOR) - is presented. For AIM, the sound speed profile is first parameterized by the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and the optimal parameters are searched by simulated annealing algorithm with respect to the cross-correlation function of the receiving signal and the simulation signal. For SOR, remotely sensed data are used to construct sound speed profiles. An experiment was conducted in the northeast of the South China Sea to verify the two methods. Both methods can obtain sound speed profiles quickly and cheaply. Compared with the sound speed profiles obtained by a conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) instrument, the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of AIM is 0.55 m s(-1) and that of SOR is 1.71 m s(-1). It is clear that AIM provides better inversion performance than SOR. Another primary benefit of AIM is that this method has no limitation to the inversion depth. The simulation results of sound propagation in regard to the inversed sound speed profiles show that the transmission losses of AIM and CTD are consistent and that of SOR is adversely affected by the inversion error of the sound speed and the inversion depth. But SOR has particular advantages in the inversion coverage. Together, all of these advantages make the AIM particularly valuable in practice.

TI  - Landsat-Satellite-Based Analysis of Long-Term Temporal Spatial Dynamics of Cyanobacterial Blooms: A Case Study in Taihu Lake
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms in large and shallow freshwater lakes have become one of the most severe ecological problems threatening the environment and public health. Although great progress has been made in Taihu Lake in cyanobacterial bloom monitoring, most previous studies have used MODIS images with a resolution greater than 250 m, available after 2000, while the fine-scale studies on its long-term spatio-temporal dynamics to date are insufficient. This study monitored the spatiotemporal distribution of cyanobacterial blooms in Taihu Lake between 1984 and 2021 using Landsat images of 30 m resolution on the cloud computation platform Google Earth Engine and calculated the cyanobacterial blooms' area percentage and the cyanobacterial bloom frequency index. Then, we investigated the influence of water quality and meteorological factors on area and frequency using Spearman correlation and principal component analysis. The results show that cyanobacterial blooms spread from the northern to the central, western, and eastern parts of Taihu Lake from 1984 to 2021. With the exception of East Lake, the area and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms increased significantly. Hypereutrophic water conditions, high temperatures, abundant sunshine hours, and low wind velocities all favor cyanobacteria blooms in Taihu Lake, and the key influencing factors of dynamics in cyanobacterial blooms are the comprehensive trophic level index, annual sunshine hours, and annual maximum wind speed. This study can serve as a reference for lake eutrophication monitoring and water resource management and protection.

TI  - Direct Assimilation of Chinese FY-3E Microwave Temperature Sounder-3 Radiances in the CMA-GFS: An Initial Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FengYun-3E (FY-3E), the fifth satellite in China's second-generation polar-orbiting satellite FY-3 series, was launched on 5 July 2021. FY-3E carries a third-generation microwave temperature sounder (MWTS-3). For the first time, this study demonstrates that MWTS-3 radiances data assimilation can improve the China Meteorological Administration Global Forecast System (CMA-GFS). By establishing a cloud detection module based on the retrieval results of the new channels of MWTS-3, a quality control module according to the error characteristics of MWTS-3 data, and a bias correction module considering the scanning position of satellite and weather systems, the effective assimilation of MWTS-3 data in the CMA-GFS has been realized. Through one-month cycling experiments of assimilation and forecasts, the error characteristics and assimilation effects of MWTS-3 data are carefully evaluated. The results show that the observation errors in MWTS-3 data are similar to those in advanced technology microwave sounder (ATMS) data within the same frequency channel, are slightly larger than those in the advanced microwave-sounding unit-A (AMSU-A) data, and are much better than those in the MWTS-2 data. The validation of the assimilation and prediction results demonstrate the positive contribution of MWTS-3 data assimilation, which can remarkably reduce the analysis errors in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Specifically, the error growth on the upper layer of the model is obviously suppressed. When all other operational satellite observations are included, the assimilation of MWTS-3 data has a neutral or slightly positive contribution to the analysis and forecast results, and the improvement is mainly found in the Southern Hemisphere. The relevant evaluation results indicate that the MWTS-3 data assimilation has good application prospects for operation.

TI  - Inferring the linkage of sea surface height anomalies, surface wind stress and sea surface temperature with the falling ice radiative effects using satellite data and global climate models
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study attempts to infer the linkage of sea surface height anomaly (SSHA), surface wind stress and sea surface temperature with the falling ice (snow) radiative effects (FIREs) over the tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean using CESM1-CAM5 sensitivity experiments with FIREs-off (NOS) and on (SON) under CMIP5 historical run. The obs4MIPs monthly SSH data based upon satellite measurements are used as a reference. The seasonal and annual mean spatial patterns of SSHA difference between NOS and SON are tightly linked to those of SST and TAU over the study domain, in particular, over the south Pacific. Compared with NOS, SON simulates improved seasonal and annual mean SSHA associated with improved sea surface temperature (SST), surface wind stress (TAU) over the trade-wind areas. In SON, the simulated mean absolute bias of SSHA over the study domain is reduced (up to 30%) against NOS relative to observations. The SSHA biases are then compared with CMIP5 models. Despite the biases of SST and SSHA over the south and north flanks of the equator in SON, the seasonal variations of improved SSHA are closely related to those of TAU and SST resulting from the FIREs; that is, higher SSHA is associated with weaker TAU and warmer SST changes and vice versa. The CMIP5 ensemble mean absolute biases of SSHA show similarities to NOS mainly over the south Pacific.

TI  - Applications of Geostationary Hyperspectral Infrared Sounder Observations: Progress, Challenges, and Future Perspectives
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A hyperspectral infrared (IR) sounder from geostationary orbit provides nearly continuous measurements of atmospheric thermodynamic and dynamic information within a weather cube, specifically the atmospheric temperature, moisture, and wind information at different pressure levels that are critical for improving high-impact weather (HIW) nowcasting and numerical weather prediction (NWP). Geostationary hyperspectral IR sounders (GeoHIS) have been on board China's Fengyun-4 series since 2016 and will be on board Europe's Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) series in the 2024 time frame; the United States and other countries are also planning to include GeoHIS instruments on their next generation of geostationary weather satellites. Although availability of on-orbit GeoHIS data are limited currently, studies have been conducted and progress has been made on developing the applications of high-temporal-resolution GeoHIS observations. These include but are not limited to deriving three-dimensional wind fields for nowcasting and NWP applications, trending atmospheric instability for warning in preconvective environments, conducting impact studies with data from the experimental Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) on board Fengyun-4A, preparing observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs), and monitoring diurnal variation of atmospheric composition. This paper provides an overview of the current applications of GeoHIS, discusses the data processing challenges, and provides perspectives on future development. The purpose is to provide direction on utilization of the current and assist preparation for the upcoming GeoHIS observations for nowcasting, NWP and other applications.

So far, the development of swidden agriculture in this land-locked mountainous country during the 2000-2020 bi-decade remains poorly examined. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) time-series products have shown potential in monitoring vegetative status; however, only extremely limited cases of remote sensing of swidden agriculture landscapes have been reported. Taking northern Laos as a study area and using 2001-2020 MODIS vegetation indices products, the Savitzky-Golay filter, the Mann-Kendall trend test and a threshold method were employed to delineate and monitor annual patterns and dynamics of swidden agriculture landscape at the village level. The results showed that: MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series perform better in delineating the temporal development of swidden agriculture. The swidden agriculture landscape has shown a general descending trend in the past decades, especially in the 2010s, with an annual average of 14.70 x 10(4) ha. The total number of swidden-practicing villages (or districts) also displayed a declining trend and there were 957 villages or 91 districts practicing it continuously between 2001 and 2020. An average of 32 villages per year or two districts per decade highlights the difficulty in ending swidden agriculture in Laos, although the government of Laos has established a number of policies for the eradication of swidden agriculture by 2020. This study provides a necessary methodological reference for monitoring a two-decade evolution and transformation of swidden agriculture in the tropics.

TI  - Inversion of the Full-Depth Temperature Profile Based on Few Depth-Fixed Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seawater temperature plays a key role in underwater acoustics and marine fishery, etc. In oceanographic surveys, it is often desirable to detect the temperature profile and obtain its spatio-temporal variation. The present study shows that the temperatures at the depths which are the three extreme points of the first two empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes, contain the largest amount of information. Based on the back propagation (BP) neural network, a model for reconstructing the full-depth temperature profile using a few temperatures at fixed depth is established. The experimental result shows that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the temperature profile inversion in the test set is mostly less than 0.2 degrees C, and the three-dimensional temperature field obtained in this study is relatively reliable.

TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of global CI, FVC, and LAI products and their relationships using high-resolution reference data
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, several global clumping index (CI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and leaf area index (LAI) products have been generated using a range of optical satellite sensors. It is essential for the application community to understand the accuracy and uncertainty of these products. However, current validation studies have limited spatial coverage and temporal continuity, and the relationships between different products are not clearly understood. This study aims to validate the most recent global CAS-CI, GEOV2 FVC, and MODIS LAI products using the Ground-Based Observations for Validation (GBOV) and DIRECT 2.1 datasets. The relationships between these products, the leaf projection function in the nadir direction (G(0)), and the vertical structural characteristics of the forest were also analyzed. The GEOV2 FVC and MODIS LAI show good performance, whereas CAS-CI shows a slight underestimation (bias =-0.10) and strong seasonal variations. FVC and LAI are strongly correlated at different spatial scales [field, high-resolution (30 m and upscaled 3 km), and moderate resolution (3 km)], particularly for forests [mean Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) = 0.90]. The CI-FVC/ LAI relationship is more consistent across spatial scales for grass and shrubs than for forests. The derived G(0) overestimates the reference value (bias = 0.28) mainly due to inconsistencies between the CI, FVC, and LAI products. The overstory CI is very close to the overall forest CI, indicating that the understory may be neglected when estimating the overall CI. The overstory G(0) is similar to the overall G(0) for most forest types, except for the evergreen needleleaf forest. The overall CI-FVC/LAI relationship is mainly influenced by the overstory, while the FVC-LAI relationship is affected by both the overstory and understory. Overall, the CI-FVC/LAI relationship should be further evaluated and applied cautiously across different scales. The forest vertical structural characteristics revealed in this study are important for field measurement, remote sensing estimation, and modeling studies.

TI  - The local coupling and telecoupling of urbanization and ecological environment quality based on multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coordinating the relationship between urbanization and ecological environment quality (EEQ) is crucial to achieving sustainable development. With the development of globalization, the pattern of remote interaction between urbanization and EEQ has gradually increased. However, the current study on the coupling of urban-ization and EEQ lacks a remote perspective, and the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model has not yet considered the environmental pollution caused by population agglomeration. For these reasons, this study proposes the remote sensing ecological environment index (RSEEI) model and measures the local coupling and telecoupling coordination degree (LTCCD) of urbanization and EEQ in China from 2000 to 2020. According to the results, the rate of change of EEQ in China was-0.00011a-1. RSEEI widens the gap between the east and west of EEQ, differentiated by the Heihe-Tengchong Line. China's urbanization is growing at a 0.0008a-1 rate, with a spatially driven radiation potential with Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Macao as the core. LTCCD follows an increasing trend from inland to coastal and west to east. Over 70% of provinces experienced a shift in adjacent LTCCD levels, and 14 provinces moved from disorder to coordination after 2010. The telecoupling strengthens the correlation between urbanization and EEQ among regions compared with traditional coupling. In addition, the eastern coastal areas, the northern and central-south inland areas, and the northwest face different coordination problems.

TI  - MCSNet: A Radio Frequency Interference Suppression Network for Spaceborne SAR Images via Multi-Dimensional Feature Transform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a promising remote sensing technique, as it can produce high-resolution imagery over a wide area of surveillance with all-weather and all-day capabilities. However, the spaceborne SAR sensor may suffer from severe radio frequency interference (RFI) from some similar frequency band signals, resulting in image quality degradation, blind spot, and target loss. To remove these RFI features presented on spaceborne SAR images, we propose a multi-dimensional calibration and suppression network (MCSNet) to exploit the features learning of spaceborne SAR images and RFI. In the scheme, a joint model consisting of the spaceborne SAR image and RFI is established based on the relationship between SAR echo and the scattering matrix. Then, to suppress the RFI presented in images, the main structure of MCSNet is constructed by a multi-dimensional and multi-channel strategy, wherein the feature calibration module (FCM) is designed for global depth feature extraction. In addition, MCSNet performs planned mapping on the feature maps repeatedly under the supervision of the SAR interference image, compensating for the discrepancies caused during the RFI suppression. Finally, a detailed restoration module based on the residual network is conceived to maintain the scattering characteristics of the underlying scene in interfered SAR images. The simulation data and Sentinel-1 data experiments, including different landscapes and different forms of RFI, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Both the results demonstrate that MCSNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and can greatly suppress the RFI in spaceborne SAR.

TI  - Identification and Analysis of Landslides in the Ahai Reservoir Area of the Jinsha River Basin Using a Combination of DS-InSAR, Optical Images, and Field Surveys
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We employed ascending and descending Sentinel-1A, optical image data, and field investigation methods to identify and monitor landslides in the Jinsha River Basin to overcome the difficulties associated with the use of a single method and its inaccuracies in identifying landslides in the alpine and canyon areas. Using distributed scatterer-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DS-InSAR), Sentinel-1A ascending and descending data were integrated to obtain surface deformation information within the study area from July 2017 to May 2019. Thereafter, high-resolution optical image data were introduced to interpret landslides, and field investigations were conducted to validate landslides. These combined methods enabled the assessment of spatiotemporal evolutionary characteristics, and their accuracy in identifying typical landslides was verified. The results showed that the use of both ascending and descending data effectively avoided certain problems, such as the inability to identify certain landslide hazards or the retrieval of incomplete identification results due to geometric distortion associated with single-track SAR imaging. The combined use of these methods effectively improves the timeliness and verification of the accuracy of landslides. Fifteen landslides were identified in the study area, which had different degrees of tension cracks, vertical dislocations, and slip marks that were verified in the field. Of these, two landslides show serious deformation characteristics that currently pose a serious threat to lives and infrastructure. Follow-up monitoring of these landslides is essential. These findings will assist in obtaining comprehensive information about the distribution of landslides and their deformation developmental trends in the Ahai Reservoir area of the Jinsha River Basin and show that the combined methods can be employed to prevent and control landslides in this area.

TI  - Snow Depth Inversion in Forest Areas from Sentinel-1 Data Based on Phase Deviation Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, snow depth inversion based on active microwave remote sensing is concerned essentially with areas having a relatively simple underlying surface. The existence of forests reduces the sensitivity of microwaves to snow, which often makes the snow depth inversion results uncertain. This paper presents a snow depth estimation algorithm for forest areas by introducing a forest phase to characterize the effect of forests on backscattering electromagnetic wave. Firstly, the interferogram is generated with the differential interference of two-pass master-slave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, and the real phase under snow cover condition is obtained by phase unwrapping. Secondly, the phase models for forest and non-forest areas are constructed. The effects of forest cover are modeled as forest phase in the forest phase model, which is estimated under the assumption of snow depth consistency on both sides of the boundaries between forest and non-forest areas. Finally, snow depth is estimated by the snow phase-depth model. The correctness of the proposed forest snow depth inversion algorithm was verified by taking the Jiagedaqi area of Greater Xing'an Mountains as the study area and sentinel-1 dual polarization images as the data source. Finally, the snow depth distribution of the study area was obtained with a spatial resolution of 30 m on 7 December 2020. The experimental results show that the snow depth values estimated in Jiagedaqi area are mainly between 40-120 cm, and the average snow depth value is 80.27 cm. Taking the snow depth value of 84.69 cm reckoned from hourly accumulated snowfall in Jiagedaqi as the reference snow depth, the results of the estimated snow depth are relatively consistent and well-founded. With the introduction of the forest phase, the average snow depth values estimated in the forest area increase by 5.98 cm, which reduces the underestimation of the snow depth in forest areas.

TI  - Retrieving Soil Moisture in the Permafrost Environment by Sentinel-1/2 Temporal Data on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) products presently available in permafrost regions, especially on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), hardly meet the demands of evaluating and modeling climatic, hydrological, and ecological processes, due to their significant bias and low spatial resolution. This study developed an algorithm to generate high-spatial-resolution SM during the thawing season using Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) temporal data in the permafrost environment. This algorithm utilizes the seasonal backscatter differences to reduce the effect of surface roughness and uses the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) to characterize vegetation contribution. Then, the SM map with a grid spacing of 50 m x 50 m in the hinterland of the QTP with an area of 505 km x 246 km was generated. The results were independently validated based on in situ data from active layer monitoring sites. It shows that this algorithm can retrieve SM well in the study area. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) are 0.82 and 0.06 m(3)/m(3), respectively. This study analyzed the SM distribution of different vegetation types: the alpine swamp meadow had the largest SM of 0.26 m(3)/m(3), followed by the alpine meadow (0.23), alpine steppe (0.2), and alpine desert (0.16), taking the Tuotuo River basin as an example. We also found a significantly negative correlation between the coefficient of variation (CV) and SM in the permafrost area, and the variability of SM is higher in drier environments and lower in wetter environments. The comparison with ERA5-Land, GLDAS, and ESA CCI showed that the proposed method can provide more spatial details and achieve better performance in permafrost areas on QTP. The results also indicated that the developed algorithm has the potential to be applied in the entire permafrost regions on the QTP.

TI  - Tracers in Gastric Cancer Surgery
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Gastric cancer is a major health risk, and surgery is the primary curative option. However, the appropriate extent of lymph node dissection and appropriate surgical margins are two major issues that need to be addressed. Clinical tracers are an excellent solution. Therefore, we compiled a list of common clinical tracers for gastric cancer surgery to help surgeons better select and use them. The treatment of gastric cancer mainly depends on radical gastrectomy. Determination of appropriate surgical margins and adequate lymph node (LN) resection are two major surgical steps that directly correlate with prognosis in gastric cancer. Due to the expanding use of minimally invasive procedures, it is no longer possible to locate tumors and LNs through touch. As an alternative, tracers have begun to enter the field due to their capacities for intraoperative visualization. Herein, we summarize the application of contemporary tracers in gastric cancer surgery, including isosulfan blue, methylene blue, patent blue, indocyanine green, carbon particles, and radioactive tracers. Their mechanisms, administration methods, detection efficiency, and challenges, as well as perspectives on them, are also outlined.

TI  - Unraveling the Synoptic-Scale Penetration of the Yellow Sea Coastal Water Into the Changjiang River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most important coastal currents in the Northeast Pacific marginal seas, the Yellow Sea Coastal Water (YSCW) plays an essential role in modulating regional ocean circulation and the transregional exchange of biogeochemical materials. However, the wintertime transport pattern of the YSCW and its interaction with the Changjiang River Estuary (CJE) are intensely debated. Herein, we used a combination method of Principal Component Analysis-based cluster analysis and Optimum Multiparameter Analysis, together with remote sensing data, to investigate the classification, distributions, pathways and mixture ratios of various water masses off the CJE in winter. Results clearly suggest that in winter the YSCW can repeatedly penetrate to the CJE in response to northerly wind bursts, and flows southward around 10-30 m isobaths off the CJE, with its impact scope reaching as far as at least 29.5 degrees N. Furthermore, we propose a refined circulation pattern that the YSCW flows southward along 20-30 m isobaths on the Changjiang Bank, and thereby feeds the synoptic-scale YSCW penetration into the CJE. Crucially, this work also highlights that the combination methodologies in a mathematic framework is useful for unraveling an implicit synoptic-scale water mass interaction in highly dynamic estuaries and shelf seas, and thus provides better insight to ecological and environmental variability.Plain Language Summary The Yellow Sea Coastal Water (YSCW) that carries high turbid and cold water, is a key conduit of the coastal water into the East China Sea under winter monsoon and has significant influence on the regional environment in both physical and biogeochemical aspects. However, the wintertime transport pattern of the YSCW has been intensely debated over the last several decades and its interaction with the Changjiang River Estuary (CJE) remains unclear. Using a combination method of Principal Component Analysis-based Cluster and Optimum Multiparameter Analysis along with remoting sensing data, this work unravels a previously overlooked penetration of the YSCW into the CJE in winter. Such a synoptic-scale penetration could operate repeatedly associated with the northerly wind burst, producing a complex overlay of impacts on the regional circulation and materials transport. This work offers an refine view to wintertime pathway of the YSCW and lays the ground work for future studies of the physical-biogeochemical synergies in this region.

TI  - Identification of the Genes Encoding B3 Domain-Containing Proteins Related to Vernalization of <i>Beta vulgaris</i>
T2  - GENES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vernalization is the process of exposure to low temperatures, which is crucial for the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth of plants. In this study, the global landscape vernalization-related mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified in Beta vulgaris. A total of 22,159 differentially expressed mRNAs and 4418 differentially expressed lncRNAs were uncovered between the vernalized and nonvernalized samples. Various regulatory proteins, such as zinc finger CCCH domain-containing proteins, F-box proteins, flowering-time-related proteins FY and FPA, PHD finger protein EHD3 and B3 domain proteins were identified. Intriguingly, a novel vernalization-related lncRNA-mRNA target-gene co-expression regulatory network and the candidate vernalization genes, VRN1, VRN1-like, VAL1 and VAL2, encoding B3 domain-containing proteins were also unveiled. The results of this study pave the way for further illumination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the vernalization of B. vulgaris.

TI  - Inversion and Monitoring of the TP Concentration in Taihu Lake Using the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication is a significant factor that damages the water ecosystem's species balance. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration is a vital water quality indicator in assessing surface water eutrophication. This paper predicts the spatial distribution of TP concentration using remote sensing, measured data, and the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method. Based on the correlation analysis, the models were built and tested using the TP concentration and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image spectra. The results demonstrated that the best technique based on band combinations of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images achieved good precision. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP), and residual prediction deviation (RPD) were 0.771, 0.023 mg/L, and 2.086 for Sentinel-2 images and 0.630, 0.032 mg/L, and 1.644 for Landsat-8 images, respectively. The TP concentration maps were interpolated using the inverse distance weighting method, and the inversion results obtained from the images were in good agreement. The western and northwestern regions of Taihu Lake, where significant cyanobacterial blooms occurred, had TP concentrations greater than 0.20 mg/L; nevertheless, the central and eastern regions had amounts ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 mg/L. In order to prove the extensibility of the model, the optimal algorithm was applied to the Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images in 2017. The optimal algorithm based on Landsat-8 images has a better verification effect (RMSEP = 0.027 mg/L, and R = 0.879 for one Landsat-8 image), and the optimal algorithm based on Sentinel-2 images has moderate verification effect (RMSEP = 0.054 mg/L and 0.045 mg/L, and R = 0.771 and 0.787 for two Sentinel-2 images). The interpolation and inversion maps are in good agreement, indicating that the model is suitable for the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images, which can be complementary for higher temporal resolutions. Monitoring water quality using multiple remote sensing images can provide the scientific basis for water quality dynamic monitoring and prevention in China.

TI  - Modelling the Dynamics of Carbon Storages for <i>Pinus densata</i> Using Landsat Images in Shangri-La Considering Topographic Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest carbon storage is essential for understanding the dynamics of forest resources and optimizing decisions for forest resource management. In order to explore the changes in the carbon storage of Pinus densata in Shangri-La and the influence of topography on carbon storage, two dynamic models were developed based on the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and Landsat TM/OLI images with a 5-year interval change and annual average change. The three modelling methods used were partial least squares (PLSR), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT). Various spectral and texture features of the images were calculated and filtered before modelling. The terrain niche index (TNI), which is able to reflect the combined effect of elevation and slope, was added to the dynamic model, the optimal model was selected to estimate the carbon storage, and the topographic conditions in areas of change in carbon storage were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The dynamic model based on 5-year interval change data performs better than the dynamic model with annual average change data, and the RF model has a higher accuracy compared to the PLSR and GBRT models. (2) The addition of TNI improved the accuracy, in which R-2 is improved by up to 10.48% at most, RMSE is reduced by up to 7.32% at most, and MAE is reduced by up to 8.89% at most, and the RF model based on the 5-year interval change data has the highest accuracy after adding TNI, with an R-2 of 0.87, an RMSE of 3.82 t-C center dot ha(-1), and a MAE of 1.78 t-C center dot ha(-1). (3) The direct estimation results of the dynamic model showed that the carbon storage of Pinus densata in Shangri-La decreased in 1987-1992 and 1997-2002, and increased in 1992-1997, 2002-2007, 2007-2012, and 2012-2017. (4) The trend of increasing or decreasing carbon storage in each period is not exactly the same on the TNI gradient, according to the dominant distribution, as topographic conditions with lower elevations or gentler slopes are favorable for the accumulation of carbon storage, while the decreasing area of carbon storage is more randomly distributed topographically. This study develops a dynamic estimation model of carbon storage considering topographic factors, which provides a solution for the accurate estimation of forest carbon storage in regions with a complex topography.

TI  - Improved Understanding of Typhoon-Induced Immediate Chlorophyll-A Response Using Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) Onboard Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The biological response triggered by a tropical cyclone (TC) passage has attracted much attention due to its possible impacts on regional oceanic, ecological environment, and regional climate balance. However, the detailed progress of TC-induced chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) responses (TICRs) remains unclear due to the inherent limitation of observations in ocean color with polar-orbiting satellites as used in previous studies. The appearance of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite opens the opportunity of correcting all our understanding of TICRs due to its hyper temporal image acquisition capability. In this study, the more real relationship between Chl-a response and TC is further clarified. Results show an essentially different reacting progress of TICRs given by AHI/Himawari-8. It shows a much quicker response relative to previous understanding. Chl-a concentrations reached the highest value on the first day under the severe influences of typhoons. The averaged Chl-a response (0-3 days behind TC passage) observed by AHI is approximately three (2.95) times stronger than that observed by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Terra/Aqua satellites. The spatial characteristics of TICRs by AHI show marked differences. Overall, the rapid and strong response sheds new light on the role of TICRs in influencing the regional oceanic environment, marine ecosystem, and local climate. Whole new estimations for the impacts of TICRs on the aforementioned issues are needed urgently.

TI  - Feasibility of Breast Cancer Metastasis Assessment of Ex Vivo Sentinel Lymph Nodes through a p-H&E Optical Coherence Microscopic Imaging System
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Pseudo-H&E (p-H&E) imaging using a fluorescence-in-built optical coherence microscopic imaging system (OCMIS) is a novel microstructural technique for assessing en face optical sections of ex vivo specimens. In this study, the comparison of p-H&E, frozen-sectioned H&E, and paraffin-sectioned H&E images was intraoperatively realized through ex vivo sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for breast cancer metastasis assessment. The results revealed that OCMIS is a useful tool for intraoperative breast cancer metastasis assessment through SLN biopsy in patients requiring surgery. Frozen-sectioned hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) image evaluation is the current method for intraoperative breast cancer metastasis assessment through ex vivo sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). After frozen sectioning, the sliced fatty region of the frozen-sectioned specimen is easily dropped because of different freezing points for fatty tissues and other tissues. Optical-sectioned H&E images provide a nondestructive method for obtaining the insight en face image near the attached surface of the dissected specimen, preventing the freezing problem of fatty tissue. Specimens from 29 patients at Wanfang Hospital were collected after excision and were analyzed at the pathology laboratory, and a fluorescence-in-built optical coherence microscopic imaging system (OCMIS) was then used to visualize the pseudo-H&E (p-H&E) images of the SLNs for intraoperative breast cancer metastasis assessment, and the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy were 100%, 88.9%, and 98.8% (n = 83), respectively. Compared with gold-standard paraffin-sectioned H&E images, the specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy obtained with the frozen-sectioned H&E images (n = 85) of the specimens were the same as those obtained with the p-H&E images (n = 95). Thus, OCMIS is a useful noninvasive image-assisted tool for breast cancer metastasis assessment based on SLN images.

T2  - Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Monitoring the regional changes in vegetation coverage and analyzing its driving factors are beneficial to realizing the sustainable development of ecological environment. Based on Landsat 5/8 remote sensing images from 1989 to 2021, vegetation coverage of Helan Mountain in Ningxia was estimated by pixel dichotomy model. In addition, the influence of 10 factors, including environmental factors and human factors, on the spatial-temporal variations of vegetation coverage was quantified by geodetector. The results showed that average vegetation coverage was 35.8% in the study area from 1989 to 2021. On the temporal scale, it showed an increasing trend, with an average increasing rate of 0.043·(10 a)-1. On the spatial scale, vegetation coverage presented a distribution characteristic of decreasing from southwest to northeast. 58.1% of vegetation coverage in the study area would continue to improve in the future, but 30.7% of vegetation would have the potential risk of degradation. Precipitation was the dominant environmental factor driving the distribution of vegetation. Compared with single factor, the interaction between environmental factors and human factors had a stronger impact on vegetation coverage, while the interaction between precipitation and other factors played a leading role.

TI  - Improving urban impervious surface extraction by synergizing hyperspectral and polarimetric radar data using sparse representation
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of urban impervious surface (UIS) is essential for urban planning and environmental monitoring. However, multispectral remote sensing data for UIS extraction suffers from the inter-class spectral confusions, e.g. UIS and bare soil, and intra-class variations of sub-class UIS. Hyperspectral and full/dual-polarization synthetic aperture radar (full/dual PolSAR) data provide opportunities for reducing such confusions and have potential for fine UIS mapping, i.e., roads, buildings, and grounds. In this study, we first investigated the hyperspectral data (Gaofen-5) capability to reduce the intra/ inter-class misclassification in comparison with multispectral data (Landsat-8). Then, we explored con-tributions of synergistically using full and dual PolSAR (ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1) with hyperspectral and multispectral data using optical-SAR sparse representation classification (OSSRC). Results showed that both the hyperspectral and the SAR polarization features helped better delineation between UIS and bare soil, and sub-class UIS (roads and buildings). The relative contribution of PolSAR was higher in multispec-tral data than in hyperspectral data, with full PolSAR contributed significantly. The combined hyperspec-tral and full PolSAR data using OSSRC delivered the best result, with an overall accuracy higher than 90%. The results indicate the promising capability of synergizing hyperspectral and full/dual PolSAR data for improving UIS extraction from advanced satellite data.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - A Study on the Drivers of Remote Sensing Ecological Index of Aksu Oasis from the Perspective of Spatial Differentiation
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The overexploitation and misuse of natural resources in oaseshave put a significant strain on the ecosystem's fragility. Therefore, a rigorous study of the ecological environment's quality is required to assure the sustainability of oasis growth. The GEE platform has the features of timeliness and large data cloud processing, which accelerating the development of the remote sensing ecological index. The MODIS data of the research region from 2000 to 2020 were uploaded online to the GEE platform in order to calculate the humidity, greenness, dryness, and heat indices for each year. Principal component analysis was then used to develop the remote sensing ecological index after normalization. In addition, Pearson correlation coefficient, Moran's I index, geo-detector, and the MK trend test were employed to determine the dependability of the RSEI comprehensive index, analyze the ecological environment status and its change trend in the Aksu River Basin from 2000 to 2020, and investigate the external driving factors of RSEI spatial heterogeneity. (1) The average correlation degree of RSEI is as high as 0.820, and the Moran's I index is larger than 0.9118; thus, its practicability, dependability, and spatial rationality are enhanced. (2) The natural environment quality of Aksu basin is impacted in two ways by human influences. (1) The adoption of ecological protection measures to support the growth of groundwater reserves in the Aksu basin, increase plant covering, and so improve and enhance the ecological environment's quality. Following the adoption of ecological protection measures, the average RSEI rose by 12.89%, the ecological quality of the farmland-based region improved considerably, and the quality of the ecological environment was enhanced. (2) Urban growth inhibits environmental progress. The acceleration of urbanization and the large rise in NDBSI have exerted pressure on the development of RSEI, while the growth of cities and towns has decreased the vegetation cover in urban areas and impeded the improvement of ecological environment quality. (3) Both human and environmental causes contribute to the regional variability of RSEI in Aksu Basin. The geographical heterogeneity is mostly caused by temperature and land use, with land use being the most important driver. Strengthening research on the connection between groundwater storage change, land use, vegetation cover, and NDBSI may facilitate the growth of regional green economies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Cyanobacteria Blooms from Their MODIS-Based Automatic Identification
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - An automatic algorithm is proposed for identifying areas of cyanobacteria (CB) blooms in the Azov Sea based on an analysis of the optical spectra of MODIS satellite data. The algorithm has been validated by comparison with high-resolution quasi-synchronous Landsat data. The results obtained with this algorithm were used to study the spatiotemporal variability of CB blooms in the Azov Sea in 2003-2019 and give examples of the evolution of blooms in individual years. CB blooms in the Azov Sea are observed from March to November with a peak in August. The most intense and longest CB blooms are observed in Taganrog Bay. In the spring months, they spread from here eastward along the northern coast. In June-July, CB begin to intensively spread southward along the eastern coast and then, in some years, they penetrate into the center of the basin under the action of anticyclonic currents. An analysis of interannual variability has shown that the intensity of blooms was the highest in 2004-2011, with a peak in 2008-2009, and dropped significantly in 2011-2019. One reason for this drop is the decreased flow of the Don and Kuban rivers, as well as the increased wind speed observed in recent years.

TI  - Effect of Cloud Mask on the Consistency of Snow Cover Products from MODIS and VIIRS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover has significant impacts on the global water cycle, ecosystem, and climate change. At present, satellite remote sensing is regarded as the most efficient approach to detect long-term and multiscale observations of snow cover extent. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) satellites will replace the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to prolong data recording in the future. Therefore, it is a fundamental task to analyze and evaluate the consistency of the snow cover products retrieved from these two sensors. In this study, we performed comparisons and a consistency evaluation between the MODIS and VIIRS snow cover products in three major snow distribution regions in China: Northeast China (NE), Northwest China (NW) and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QT). The results demonstrated that (1) the normalized difference snow index (NDSI)-derived snow cover products showed suitable consistency between VIIRS and MODIS under clear sky conditions, with a mean difference value of less than 5%; (2) the VIIRS snow cover product presented much more snow and fewer clouds than that of MODIS in the snow season due to the differences in cloud-masking algorithms; (3) cloud mask strongly affects the potential of snow cover observation, and presents seasonal pattern in the test regions; and (4) VIIRS is able to distinguish clouds from snow with greater accuracy. The comparisons indicated that the greater the difference in cloud cover, the poorer the agreement in snow cover. This evaluation implies that perfecting the cloud-masking algorithm of VIIRS to update the MODIS would be the best solution to achieve better consistency for long-term and high-quality snow cover products.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Wetlands in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 1976 to 2019
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems contain rich natural resources and vital ecological functions, and the investigation of spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of wetlands and their driving factors is critical for the management and conservation of wetlands. This study aimed to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of wetlands in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) from 1976 to 2019 using multi-source remote sensing data (DISP KH-9, Landsat, and GaoFen-1), combing with the object-based classification method and landscape invasion index, and further analyze the driving forces affecting the spatial and temporal evolution of wetlands. The results showed that: (1) The total area of wetlands in the GBA showed a trend to first increase and then stabilize from 1976 to 2019. (2) The rapid development of aquaculture led to a continuous increase in aquaculture ponds and offshore aquaculture and a flat change in the middle and late stages, the area of mangroves declined substantially before 2000 and has gradually recovered since then, the invasion of various types of wetlands by built-up land is increasing, and wetlands are becoming increasingly fragmented. (3) The wetland changes in the GBA are the result of a combination of natural factors and human activities. Environmental conditions represent the basis for wetland dynamics, while the population, socio-economics, and policies are important drivers of wetland evolution. The findings will be beneficial to the understanding of wetland dynamic changes in the GBA over the past 40 years, and helpful to the scientific management and sustainable development of wetlands.

TI  - How magnitude of PM2.5 exposure disparities have evolved across Chinese urban-rural population during 2010-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China not only facilitate economic progress, but also aggravate environmental pollution and disparity. Particulate matter (especially PM2.5) pollution has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its serious adverse health impact. However, the spatial disparity and socio-economic inequality between urban and rural population owing to PM2.5 pollution have rarely been quantified. In this study, PM2.5 exposures to urban and rural population in China during 2010-2019 were estimated respectively using satellite data and the convolutional neural network. The association between socioeconomic indexes and PM2.5 exposure was then examined with the geographic detectors, considering the tremendous disparity in socioeconomic development between rural and urban communities. The regional difference and urban-rural disparity in PM2.5 exposure was finally quantified based on Theil index. The results show PM2.5 exposure and its spatial difference have decreased significantly during the decade, with the concentration decreasing by 26% (from 48 to 35 mu g/m3) and the Theil index decreasing from 0.13 to 0.05. The inter-provincial difference dominates the overall spatial variation in 2010, changing to intra-provincial difference in 2019. We also find that China has faced environmental inequality in PM2.5 exposure between urban and rural community in the past decade, manifesting that the urban population suffered from higher PM2.5 levels than the rural population, while the inequality had decreased significantly by 2019. This is consistent with the pattern that PM2.5 exposures increase with socioeconomic development in the early stage, and stabilize or decrease in the late stage. The results suggest that China should abandon the old path of "pollute first and control later" on rural revitalization strategy, otherwise rural population may experience higher exposure than urban population, plunging rural communities into the "environment-health-poverty" trap.

TI  - A Separate Calibration Method of Laser Pointing and Ranging for the GF-7 Satellite Laser That Does Not Require Field Detectors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite laser altimeters have been widely used in the surveying, mapping, forestry, and polar regions and by other industries due to their excellent elevation measurement accuracy. Satellite laser on-orbit geometry calibration is a necessary means to ensure elevation accuracy. This study proposes an iterative geometry calibration method for satellite laser altimeter pointing and ranging separation that does not require the use of field detectors. The DSM data were first used to complete the laser pointing calibration, and then the laser footprint elevation was measured accurately to complete the laser ranging calibration. The iterative calibration experiment was repeated until the convergence condition (i.e., the laser point difference was less than 1 x 10(-5) degrees and the laser ranging difference was less than 0.01 m) was met, with the calibrated laser pointing angle and ranging separation used as the input parameters. In this work, the GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite laser was used as the test object and the actual laser pointing and ranging values derived from ground detector calibrations. The results verified that the pointing accuracy of the GF-7 beam 1 was 2 arcsec and that the ranging accuracy was 2 cm after applying the calibration method presented in this paper. The pointing accuracy of the GF-7 beam 2 was 2.2 arcsec, and the ranging accuracy was approximately 1 cm. This analysis demonstrated that the GF-7 laser mission exceeded its pointing angle requirement of 3 arcsec after laser pointing and ranging separation iterative calibrations were applied. Finally, ground control points were used to verify the calibrated elevation accuracy of the GF-7 satellite laser, and its accuracy on flat terrain was 0.18 m. In summary, it was proven that the satellite laser geometry calibration method proposed in the article is effective.

TI  - Spinodal Decomposition in Natural Bornite-Chalcopyrite Intergrowths: A Way of Cu-(Fe)-Sulfide Mineral Growth
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spinodal decomposition is an important mechanism of exsolution. However, spinodal decomposition has not been observed in natural sulfide intergrowths. We utilized focused ion beam (FIB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques to confirm spinodal decomposition in natural sulfide intergrowths (chalcopyrite and bornite). According to FIB and TEM analyses, spinodal decomposition occurred as small and curving alternating dark and bright fluctuations in natural bornite-chalcopyrite intergrowths. Due to the low temperature that drove the exsolution mechanism, fluctuations similar to 10 nm wide and 20-200 nm long contained non-stoichiometric and tetragonal bornite and chalcopyrite. The corresponding electron diffraction of spinodal decomposition displayed a satellite spot in the [-210] direction for bornite, and the (200)* and (224)* of chalcopyrite paralleled the (24-2)* and (242)* of bornite, respectively. These observations all agreed with spinodal decomposition, two coexisting phases formed with a crystallographic orientation relationship, which indicated the first observation of spinodal decomposition in natural sulfide intergrowths. These findings confirmed that spinodal decomposition is a mechanism for natural crystal growth. As spinodal decomposition is larger in extent and faster than nucleation and growth, other Cu ore deposits may also form via this mechanism.

TI  - Hydrologic Model Calibration With Remote Sensing Data Products in Global Large Basins
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameters of hydrologic models are typically calibrated using in situ runoff observations. This calibration strategy cannot be implemented when runoff observations are not available. Additionally, the high accuracy of runoff simulation does not guarantee high simulation accuracy of other hydrologic variables, such as evaporation (ET) and terrestrial water storage change (TWSC), leading to uncertainties in hydrologic predictions. To overcome the shortcomings of the runoff-based calibration strategy, ET and TWSC products from remote sensing were used to design parameter calibration schemes in 59 large basins worldwide. Runoff observations were used to evaluate the effects of different calibration schemes. Results show that single-objective calibration schemes using the ET or TWSC products for parameter calibrations cannot obtain acceptable runoff simulations. Multi-objective calibration schemes using the combination of ET and TWSC products for parameter calibrations had better runoff simulation accuracy. The multi-objective calibration scheme using the combination of ET product adjusted by the Budyko formula and TWSC product as the calibration objective had the best runoff simulation accuracy. It is necessary to adjust ET products before using them for parameter calibrations of hydrologic models. The Budyko formula can be used to reduce the bias in remote sensing ET products, thereby providing better constraints on hydrologic simulations. We also find that different precipitation products used as inputs to hydrologic models can significantly affect the accuracy of runoff simulations. The results are expected to promote the application of remote sensing products in hydrologic simulations and predictions.

TI  - An Improved Altimeter in-Orbit Range Noise-Level Estimation Approach Based on Along-Track Differential Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite radar altimeters are advanced remote sensing devices that play an important role in observing the global marine environment. Accurately estimating the noise level of altimeter in-orbit ranging data is crucial for evaluating the payload performance, analyzing sea conditions, and monitoring data quality. In this study, we propose an approach based on the differential processing of along-track odd-even data sequences for altimeter in-orbit range noise-level estimation. Using the long-term along-track data sequence can notably improve the issue in the existing method in that the noise level is underestimated owing to the utilization of a relatively short data segment. On the basis of an analysis of the influence of low-frequency components on noise-level estimation, the mathematical formulas of the above differential method were deduced, and the efficacy of the approach in assessing the noise level of altimeter in-orbit data was demonstrated by simulation experiments. This method was used to estimate the noise levels of the 20 Hz datasets of Jason-3 and Sentinel-6, and the idea of the time-domain difference was extended to the frequency domain. The statistical results showed that the 20 Hz noise levels at the significant wave height (SWH) = 2 m were 7.41 cm (Jason-3 low-resolution (LR) mode), 6.66 cm (Sentinel-6 LR mode), and 3.13 cm (Sentinel-6 high-resolution (HR) mode). The power spectrum density analysis further verified its accuracy. By reprocessing the 20 Hz data of Sentinel-6 into 10, 5, and 1 Hz, the effectiveness of the along-track odd-even differential method to directly evaluate the noise level of 1 Hz data was explored, and the impact of ocean signals such as swells on noise-level estimation in synthetic aperture mode was discussed.

TI  - Estimation of the Key Water Quality Parameters in the Surface Water, Middle of Northeast China, Based on Gaussian Process Regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate the key water quality parameters on a large scale, based on Pearson's correlation analysis and band ratio, this study first obtains multiple sensitive band combinations (R >= 0.30, p < 0.01) for three key water quality parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP). Then, principal component analysis is used to reduce the dimensions and analyze multiple optimal combinations, and the first three principal components (PCs) of the optimal combinations are selected to analyze the water quality parameters. Finally, the water quality parameter models of DO, TN, and TP are proposed and compared based on spectral analysis and field measured water quality data respectively using Gaussian process regression and PCs for each parameter. Through model verification and by comparing the performance of the three models, it is found that the TP model performed well (R = 0.9824, p < 0.01), and TP grade accuracy rate is up to 94.97%. Through the error analysis of TN and DO, it is found that 93.0% of error samples occurs when TP < 0.1 mg/L in the water quality. These results would provide a scientific basis for water quality monitoring and water environment management in the study area and could also be used as a reference for water quality monitoring in other basins.

TI  - Analysis of Daytime Cloud Fraction Spatiotemporal Variation over the Arctic from 2000 to 2019 from Multiple Satellite Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Insufficient understanding of complex Arctic cloud properties introduced large errors in estimating radiant energy balance parameters at the regional and global scales. Comprehensive and reliable cloud information is necessary for improving the accuracy of flux inversion. This study evaluated daytime cloud fraction (CF) uncertainties from 16 available satellite products and estimated the spatiotemporal distributions of Arctic daytime CF during 2000-19. Our results show that the differences among multiple products had significant temporal and spatial heterogeneities. Temporally, the maximum and minimum interproduct discrepancies occurred in April and the summer months, respectively. Spatially, the largest uncertainties were seen over Greenland. Substantial inconsistency also occurred on the central and Pacific sides of the Arctic Ocean. The active satellite product tended to capture more clouds in these two regions. We found that the inconsistencies caused by sensor differences were smaller than those caused by algorithm differences; that is, for MODIS based CF products, the inconsistencies caused by different sensors and different algorithms are +/- 2% and +/- 5%, while for AVHRR-based products, these inconsistencies are +/- 6% and +/- 15%, respectively. The annual average daytime CF in sunlit months was 70.9% +/- 2.93% and increased over the Arctic during study periods. These upward trends might cool the Arctic by approximately 0.05-0.5 W m(-2) decade(-1). In terms of the spatiotemporal distributions, the CF over the ocean is higher than that over the land, and the former increased significantly while the latter decreased; the CF trends of most products are positive in June and July but are opposite in other months. From this study, the findings based on multiple products would be more robust than that based on a single or few datasets.Significance Statement: This study aimed to comprehensively understand and obtain more robust general characteristics of the temporal and spatial distributions of Arctic daytime cloud fraction by comparing and analyzing the consistencies and discrepancies of multisource satellite products. It is important because the cloud fraction is a nonnegligible modulator of Earth's energy budget and climate change. Although the Arctic is the most climate-sensitive region, existing studies lack a comprehensive assessment of the cloud fraction over the entire Arctic. We analyzed 16 different cloud products and found that although the inconsistencies were inevitable, most products showed similar spatiotemporal distribution and trend distribution of daytime CF. This study provided a new idea for Arctic CF research under the existing conditions.

TI  - Tracking Changing Evidence of Water Erosion in Ordos Plateau, China Using the Google Earth Engine
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ordos Plateau is one of the primary sources of sediment in the Yellow River, and changes in regional soil erosion directly affect the ecological status of the lower reaches of the Yellow River. Many recent studies have been published using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate soil erosion. In this study, much satellite remote sensing data in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) can better track soil erosion protection, which is significant in guiding the ecological protection and restoration of the Ordos Plateau and the Yellow River basin. In this study, we used GEE to observe the changes in soil erosion in the Ordos area from 2013 to 2021. The Theil-Sen procedure and Mann-Kendall significance test methods were used to evaluate the trend of land erosion in the Ordos area from 2013 to 2021. Based on GEE, the RUSLE is applied to evaluate soil erosion and analyze the changing trend. As a result, (1) we found that the annual change of soil and water loss in the Ordos Plateau showed three stages: 2013-2015, 2016-2018, and 2018-2021. After 2018, soil loss decreased from 14 x 10(17) Mg in 2018 to 4 x 10(17) Mg in 2021, which indicates that the environmental restoration project started in 2018 has achieved encouraging results. (2) The results showed that 40.9% of the regional soil erosion trend showed a significant decline, and 45.7% of the regional soil erosion trend showed a slight decline. Only 13.3% of the regional soil erosion is on the rise. (3) The test results of different land use types show that 87.3% of soil erosion occurs in bare and cultivated land. Because the terrain of Ordos is relatively flat, 95.39-96.17% of soil erosion occurs in areas with a slope of 0 to 5. (4) The reliability of the RUSLE model based on the GEE platform is proved by regression model verification of observation data and model prediction results. (5) GEE's cloud-based features can provide data and scripts to users in developing countries which lack sufficient observation data or the necessary computing resources to develop these data. The results show that GEE has robust analysis and processing ability, can analyze a large amount of data, and can provide efficient digital products for soil erosion research.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variation in Vegetation Coverage and Its Response to Climatic Change in Marshes of Sanjiang Plain, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sanjiang Plain is the most extensive marsh distribution region in China. Marshes in this region can protect biodiversity, regulate climate, and provide habitats for wild animals and plants. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a crucial indicator of vegetation coverage, which may reflect ecosystem structure and functional features. Clarifying the spatiotemporal change of marsh coverage and its climatic drivers is vital for observing and predicting vegetation change in Sanjiang Plain. Using meteorological dataand MODIS NDVI data from 2000 to 2020, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation in marsh vegetation coverage and climatic change effects in Sanjiang Plain. We found that the growing season vegetation NDVI of marsh increased significantly at a rate of 0.011/decade, indicating that the marsh vegetation growth has obviously improved during the past 21 years. Furthermore, we found that the increase of minimum (T-min) and maximum (T-max) temperature in July can significantly promote the marsh plant growth, and increasing nighttime T-min has a stronger impact on promoting the growth than increasing daytime T-max in this month. In addition, the increase of daytime T-max in August can promote the marsh vegetation growth, whereas the increasing precipitation in August was unfavorable for the growth in Sanjiang Plain.

TI  - Sentinel-1 InSAR and GPS-Integrated Long-Term and Seasonal Subsidence Monitoring in Houston, Texas, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For approximately 100 years, the Houston region has been adversely impacted by land subsidence associated with excessive groundwater withdrawals. The rapidly growing population in the Houston region means the ongoing subsidence must be vigilantly monitored. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has become a powerful tool for remotely mapping land-surface deformation over time and space. However, the humid weather and the heavy vegetation have significantly degraded the performance of InSAR techniques in the Houston region. This study introduced an approach integrating GPS and Sentinel-1 InSAR datasets for mapping long-term (2015-2019) and short-term (inter-annual, seasonal) subsidence within the greater Houston region. The root-mean-square (RMS) of the detrended InSAR-displacement time series is able to achieve a subcentimeter level, and the uncertainty (95% confidence interval) of the InSAR-derived subsidence rates is able to achieve a couple of millimeters per year for 5-year or longer datasets. The InSAR mapping results suggest the occurrence of moderate ongoing subsidence (similar to 1 cm/year) in nothwestern Austin County, northern Waller County, western Liberty County, and the city of Mont Belvieu in Champers County. Subsidence in these areas was not recognized in previous GPS-based investigations. The InSAR mapping results also suggest that previous GPS-based investigations overestimated the ongoing subsidence in southwestern Montgomery County, but underestimated the ongoing subsidence in the northeastern portion of the county. We also compared the InSAR- and GPS-derived seasonal ground movements (subsidence and heave). The amplitudes of the seasonal signals from both datasets are comparable, below 4 mm within non-subsiding areas and over 6 mm in subsiding (>1 cm/year) areas. This study indicates that groundwater-level changes in the Evangeline aquifer are the primary reason for ongoing long-term and seasonal subsidence in the Houston region. The former is dominated by inelastic deformation, and the latter is dominated by elastic deformation. Both could cause infrastructure damage. This study demonstrated the potential of employing the GPS- and InSAR-integrated method (GInSAR) for near-real-time subsidence monitoring in the greater Houston region. The near-real-time monitoring would also provide timely information for understanding the dynamic of groundwater storage and improving both long-term and short-term groundwater resource management.

TI  - Evaluation of remotely sensed global evapotranspiration data from inland river basins
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) data sets have been widely evaluated and applied at regional scale. However, the research is relatively insufficient on inland basins. RS global ET data sets were evaluated in 19 major inland basins around the world in this study. Monthly ET was estimated by using water balance (ET_WB), as well as multi-source precipitation and total water storage anomaly data sets from each basin. The main attributes of the ET changes were identified in each basin. The accuracy of 10 ET products was evaluated by monthly ET_WB series over the entire study region and at the basin scales. Results showed that precipitation changes were the main cause of ET changes in most basins (i.e., 11/19). The impacts of human activities, mainly because of increased irrigation diversion, dominated the ET changes in the five basins located in the western and northern regions of the Eurasian inland basin. Accurate estimated ET series in inland basins with a regular unimodal or U distribution of mean monthly ET were also obtained; this was not the case for basins with irregular seasonal ET variations. In general, ET products exhibited accurate monthly ET estimates in most inland basins, but their accuracy was reduced at the Helmand River, Iranian inland rivers, Qaidam, and Turpan Basins. All products tended to underestimate ET, except for the Penman-Monteith-Leuning product. Overall, the global land surface satellite and global land evaporation Amsterdam model products performed the best in inland basins, while the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS; MOD16A2) and surface energy balance system (SEBS) products performed relatively poorly. In addition, all products except SEBS and MOD16A2 could capture the spatial ET distribution in inland basins, and the spatial correlation coefficient ranged between 0.83 and 0.93. In general, an ensemble of optimized ET products could improve the accuracy of simulated monthly ET and reduce the uncertainty of the simulated series over the entire study region and at the basin scales.

TI  - Research on Vegetation Cover Changes in Arid and Semi-Arid Region Based on a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Model
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions have an important impact on carbon cycle, water cycle, and energy exchange at local, regional, and global scales. Therefore, it is of great significance for scientists to grasp the changes of vegetation cover in arid and semi-arid regions timely and accurately. Based on this, the applicability of ESTARFM model in the complex terrain area of arid and semi-arid Xinjiang was explored using Landsat and MODIS data fusion, and the overall change characteristics of vegetation cover (FVC) and the distribution and change patterns of different terrains in the study area in the past 15 years were analyzed by combining the dimidiate pixel model, unary linear regression and digital elevation model. The results show that: (1) the NDVI data fused by ESTARFM Model has high consistency with the real NDVI data, and it can be used for subsequent FVC estimation. (2) From 2006 to 2020, the inter FVC was at a high level as a whole, and the average annual FVC showed a weak increasing trend in fluctuation; there are obvious differences in spatial distribution, which is characterized by high distribution in the north and low in the south. (3) The improved area of vegetation cover in the study area is greater than the degraded area, accounting for 52.3% and 47.7% respectively; (4) In the elevation range of 2000 to 3500 m, the FVC showed a slight degradation trend on 25 degrees to 45 degrees slopes and south and southeast slopes, and the rest showed a slight improvement trend. ESTARFM-based model enables monitoring of vegetation cover changes in complex terrain areas of the arid and semi-arid regions in Xinjiang over a long time series. The overall FVC level in the study area is high, and there both are serious degradation and improvement phenomena.

T2  - MUSLIM WORLD
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on extensive fieldwork and original research in Iran, this article examines the establishment and evolution of the Islamic Republic's rural reconstruction and development organization, Construction Jihad (CJ), during the Iranian Revolution and the Iran-Iraq War. By invoking populist and pious concepts, newly ascendant religiopolitical elites facilitated CJ's mobilization and expansion to gain support from rural residents and to consolidate power against political opponents. As CJ transitioned from a revolutionary organization to a government ministry, some of its members underwent a motivational and existential transformation that complicated and contradicted their initially anti-bureaucratic and anti-materialistic ethos and worldview - a trajectory that paralleled that of other revolutionary and wartime activists and volunteers. This article makes a scholarly contribution by exploring a significant yet understudied Iranian institution, its multifaceted interpretation and conceptualization of non-military jihad and faith-based development, and the potential of religion to be a force for both cohesion and contention.

TI  - LANGUAGE AS A CREATIVE TOOL OF CONSCIOUSNESS
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors consider language, consciousness and creativity as an integral unity of cultural evolutional mechanisms that represent the driving forces of human development in ontogenetic and phylogenetic aspect. The methodological basis of the study is an evolutionary approach, implying a synergistic dynamic and cultural-historical perspective of the study of the problem. The context of the study reflects dynamics and recursive interaction between individual and socio-cultural creative activity. The investigation represents the actualization of creativity in the individual consciousness through the linguistic and thinking activity of a person and the dynamics of sense-making (formation of social meaning). The paper analyses consciousness and language as the key parameters of the process characterizing human evolution in the integrity of two conjugated branches of evolution at the individual and socio-cultural levels and as a single tool for creative interaction of a person with the world in terms of the creative evolution. The paper argues that the creative function of language, integrating cognitive, communicative and nominative functions at a higher level of complexity constitutes the unity and mutual influence of a unique (individual) and universal (socio-cultural) worldview. Creativity or the creative being of consciousness comes to the fore as an essential ontological characteristic that unites individual and socio-cultural reality, where language plays an intermediary role. The authors propose to consider language as a medium of consciousness that carries out the recursive movement of interaction between individual conscious experience and the cultural experience of humanity. The creative function of language is revealed through three mutually complementary components: meaning-forming (generation of ideas and notes, sense-making, etc.); relational-behavioral, including the expression of value-ethical, ethical-aesthetic spheres; speech-creative (language games, narratives, neologisms, etc.). The paper introduces the concept of "creative reality" as an eventdriven unity of language, consciousness and human creativity. The authors demonstrate the implementation of the creative aspect of language and consciousness in the field of bioethics and humanities on the examples of procreation procreative attitude in human reproduction technologies) and humanitarian invention.

TI  - Ground validation of Fengyun-4A and Global Precipitation Measurement satellite observations over an alpine and canyon basin of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based precipitation observations with high spatiotemporal resolution are essential for studying rainfall-induced natural hazards, especially in alpine and canyon areas of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, which are prone to such hazards yet sparsely gauged. Here, we evaluated precipitation estimated from the Chinese Fengyun-4A meteorological satellite (FY-4A AGRI) versus the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG), by using rain gauge data collected in the Parlung Zangbo Basin from May through September in both 2018 and 2019. Our results showed that (1) FY-4A AGRI generated smaller values of RMSE (root mean square error) on hourly to daily scales, and larger correlation coefficients (R-values) and smaller RMSE values for both moderate and heavy rain, indicating its greater accuracy at rainfall estimation, which is most likely due to the denser rain gauge network at a finer temporal scale used when calibrating FY-4A AGRI; (2) Both satellite products underestimated the volume of moderate and heavy rain, with the larger degree of underestimation by FY 4A AGRI, which could lower their performance in flood monitoring and forecasting; (3) Worse performance and greater inconsistency between the two products were observed in high-elevation areas, perhaps because of orographic cloud effects in these mountainous areas; and (4) Both products revealed that the Gangrigabu Range blocked incoming water vapor from the southwest monsoon, with a better representation of the spatial pattern and spatial variability produced by IMERG. To improve precipitation estimation, the effects of complex terrain should be explicitly incorporated into the retrieval algorithms, with more gauged observations in a denser network and at a finer temporal scale needed to robustly calibrate the satellite-based estimates.

TI  - SLAVIC ALLUSIONS OF THE AUSTRIAN LITERATURE OF THE 19th CENTURY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Slavic narrative of the Austrian literature of the 19th century was an important part of the author's worldview and the structure of the texts of many works. These are folk songs of Slovenes arranged by A. Gruen, allusions of Czech and Moravian legends and tales in the works of A. Stifter and M. Ebner-Eschenbach. Austrian writers intuitively rejected the "friend - foe" dilemma. Since childhood, the artistic world of Slavic culture was not alien to them, since they were actively attached to it. This circumstance can be explained by the peculiarity of the evolution of the Austrian Empire, which developed in the course of a long historical development. Because of this, Austrian literature was open not only to genetic and linguistic penetration, but also to the perception of other cultural layers, in particular, those associated with Slavic mythology. Slovenian semantics is introduced into the texts by A. Gruen (a Christmas carol as a wish for good, a dove as a symbol of love, King Marko as a public defender). A. Stifter implicitly refers to the Czech legends (Vitiko is a just ruler, the Field as an expression of the spirit of the forest and the world). Ebner-Eschenbach tells about the morals and problems of the Moravian village through the structure of a folk tale.

AB  - This study is devoted to the research of the dependence of the degree of forest damage by fires on the characteristics of the intensity of their burning according to satellite monitoring data by the MODIS system. As a measure of fire intensity, the study uses the fire radiation power (FRP), normalized to the area of the observation element (FRPS). The study proposes an approach that allows us to construct dependences of the degree of forest damage on FRPS values. The approach was developed based on a comparison of FRPS information obtained using MODIS instrument data and information from a postfire assessment of the degree of forest damage. An analysis was performed of the data accumulated at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences throughout Russia for the period from 2006 to 2021. This made it possible to analyze a significant number of regions (more than 10 million pixels), in which there is information on FRPS and the degree of forest damage. At the same time, data on the time (season), in which the fire was active, and the prevailing type of forest cover were also analyzed for each region. The availability of this information and representative statistics made it possible to obtain estimates of the probability of forest death from the intensity of burning, taking into account the type of forest cover and the duration of the fire. The study presents the obtained dependences and a brief analysis of their features. Based on the use of the obtained dependences, a new method for the rapid assessment of the area of pyrogenic forest death is proposed.

TI  - Joint inversion of InSAR and high-rate GNSS displacement waveforms for the rupture process of the 2022 Qinghai Menyuan M6. 9 earthquake
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and pixel offset tracking, we obtained both the coseismic displacements along line-of-sight and near-field range offsets of the 2022 Qinghai Menyuan M6. 9 earthquake from Sentinel-1 SAR images, and also got high-rate displacement waveforms at 16 Global Navigation Satellite System stations through epochwise precise point positioning solutions. Based on these measurements, we then jointly inverted the rupture process of the 2022 Menyuan M6. 9 earthquake. Our results show that this earthquake was a bilateral asymmetric event, which ruptured two faults at strikes of 82 degrees and 112 degrees with a total length of similar to 26 km. Most of the slip occurred between 0 and 5 km, and the peak slip was similar to 4 m. A total seismic moment of 8. 65 x10(18) Nm (equivalent to M(w)6. 56) was released within similar to 10 s. Coulomb failure stress change analysis indicates that stress levels of two neighbouring seismogenic faults at 10 km were increased, which was responsible for the subsequent aftershocks in this region. Our slip model implies insignificant shallow slip deficits, considering InSAR time series from 2014 to 2021, so we speculated that there should be negligible shallow creeping along Lenglongling and Tuolaishan segments during the long-term interseismic period.

TI  - Applying machine learning methods to predict geology using soil sample geochemistry
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study we compared various machine learning techniques that used soil geochemistry to aid in geologic mapping. We tested six different sampling methods (undersample, oversample, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN), SMOTE and Edited Nearest Neighbor (SMO-TEENN), and SMOTE and Tomek links (SMOTETomek)). SMOTE performed best with ADASYN and SMOTE-Tomek having slightly lower effectiveness. Nine machine learning algorithms (naive Bayes, logistic regression, quadratic discriminant analysis, nearest neighbors, radial basis function support-vector machine, artificial neural network, random forest, AdaBoost classifier, and gradient boosting classifier) were compared and AdaBoost classifiers and gradient boosting classifiers were found to be most effective. Finally, we experimented with multiple classifier systems (MCS) testing different combinations of algorithms and various combinatorial func-tions. It was found that MCS can outperform individual models, and the best MCS combined nearest neighbors, radial basis function support-vector machine, artificial neural network, random forest, AdaBoost classifiers, and gradient boosting classifier, then applied a logistic regression to the probabilities output by the models. Ulti-mately, we created a tool that is able to adequately predict underlying geology in the study area using soil geochemistry.

TI  - Permanganate Index Variations and Factors in Hongze Lake from Landsat-8 Images Based on Machine Learning
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The permanganate index (CODMn), defined as a comprehensive index to measure the degree of surface water pollution by organic matter and reducing inorganic matter, plays an important role in indicating water pollution and evaluating aquatic ecological health. However, remote sensing monitoring of water quality is presently focused mainly on phytoplankton, suspended particulate matter, and yel-low substance, while there is still great uncertainty in the retrieval of CODMn. In this study, the Landsat-8 surface reflectance data set from Google Earth Engine and in situ CODMnmeasurements were matched. The support vector regression (SVR) machine learning model was calibrated using the matchups. With the SVR model, this study estimates the CODMn in Hongze Lake, presents the historical spatiotemporal CODMn distributions, and discusses the affecting fac-tors of the change trend of the CODMn in Hongze Lake. The results showed that the SVR model adequately estimated CODMn, with a sum squared error of 1.49 mg2/L2, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95, and a root mean square error of 0.15 mg/L. CODMn in Hongze Lake was high in general and showed a decreasing trend in the past decade. Huai River, Xinsu River, and Huaihongxin River were still the main sources of oxygen-consuming pollutants in Hongze Lake. The wetland natural reserve near Yugou had a significant effect on reducing CODMn. This study provides not only a scientific reference for the management of CODMn in Hongze Lake, but also a feasible scheme for remote sensing monitoring of CODMn in inland water.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work discusses a worldview and a methodology concerning ideological approaches by which Marxists can understand and transform the world, based on well-defined value truth, theory and philosophy. The work builds on the Report to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China ( CPC), which highlights the following priorities to which XI Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era must adhere: putting the people first, maintaining self-confidence and self- reliance, upholding fundamental principles and breaking new ground, adopting a problem-oriented approach, applying system thinking, and maintaining a global vision. Furthermore, this work argues that these priorities should be applied to promote the rule of law in China's new journey. As the starting points of analysis and understanding, the meta-theory and "six must-dos" follow the general principles of Marxism in interpreting and promoting socialist concepts, theory, law-based path and legal system in the New Era with Chinese characteristics. The metatheory and the "six must-dos" provide the logical foundations and fundamental compliance with XI Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law. Only by applying these "six must-dos" well can we understand and implement XI Jinping Thought on the Rule of Law, enhance the rationality, initiative, foresight and creativity of our work in comprehensively promoting the rule of law in China.

TI  - Tracking Migration of Eastern Spot-billed Ducks <i>Anas zonorhyncha</i> and Mallards <i>Anas platyrhynchos</i> Wintering in Shanghai, China
T2  - WATERBIRDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of migratory waterfowl winter in the coastal wetlands in Shanghai City, among which Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and Mallards are among the most common species and are sensitive to infection with avian influenza virus. However, information on the migration behaviors of these two species in Northeast Asia is lacking. Therefore, GPS transmitters were used to track the migration of 13 Eastern Spot-billed Ducks and eight Mallards wintering in Shanghai during 2017-2020. Mallards covered a (mean +/- standard deviation) migration distance of 1,663.69 +/- 1,063.33 km, with wider variation than Eastern Spot-billed Ducks (1,639.24 +/- 642.72 km), though the difference was not significant. Both species ended their northward migrations in Northeast Asia encircling the Yellow Sea, mainly in northeastern China. The dynamic Brownian bridge movement model confirmed that multiple stopover sites mainly located in the Korean Peninsula along the Yellow Sea coastline were crucial nodes for maintaining the stability and function of the migration network. This study confirmed the close relationships between habitats in the Korean Peninsula and China, indicating the importance of habitat conservation in related countries to the stability of the migration network. The results of this study additionally highlight the relationships between migration behaviors and outbreaks of avian influenza virus in Northeast Asia.

TI  - Systematic Evaluation of a High-Resolution CLM5 Simulation over Continental China for 1979-2018
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface model is extensively used to simulate turbulence fluxes and hydrological and momentum variables at the land-atmosphere interface. In this study, the Community Land Model, version 5 (CLM5), driven by the 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees Chinese Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) and the field-surveyed soil parameters, is used to simulate land surface processes during 1979-2018. Various high-quality land surface datasets are adopted to assess the model simulations. In general, the CLM5 well captures the monthly variations of 0-10-cm soil moisture in subregions, particularly in the Tibetan Plateau, with an anomaly correlation coefficient between 0.56 and 0.88. However, the simulated soil moisture shows overall wet biases in the whole country, resulting from several reasons. The model simulation is skillful in replicating both the magnitude and spatial pattern when they are compared with the MODIS snow cover dataset. Compared with in situ measured soil temperature in multiple soil layers within 320-cm soil depth from 1980 to 2018, the simulations accurately capture spatial patterns, vertical profiles, and long-term warming trends. For land surface energy components, the simulations have a highly temporal correlation with the observation of Chinese Flux Observation and Research Network (ChinaFLUX) cropland and grassland sites, except for four forest sites, where biases exist in both atmospheric forcing variables and surface vegetation phenology in the model default input dataset. In summary, this study reveals the overall capability of CLM5 in reproducing land surface energy fluxes and hydrological variables over conterminous China, and the validation results may also provide some references for future model improvement and application. Significance StatementThe offline Community Land Model, version 5 (CLM5), driven by a 0.1 degrees x 0.1 degrees (similar to 10 km) horizontal resolution atmospheric forcing dataset and a set of field-surveyed soil parameters, are used to simulate the land surface hydrological and heat fluxes in continental China for 1980-2018. The simulated hydrological variables and energy fluxes are validated with various sources of high-quality observation-based datasets. From our systematic evaluations, the current CLM5 high-resolution simulation accurately captures the spatial patterns and temporal variations in most of the water and energy balance components, although biases exist in some simulated variables. Overall, this study reveals the capability of the offline CLM5 simulation in conterminous China and provides the reference for future model improvement and application.

TI  - In-Memory Distributed Mosaicking for Large-Scale Remote Sensing Applications with Geo-Gridded Data Staging on Alluxio
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented availability of petascale analysis-ready earth observation data has given rise to a remarkable surge in demand for regional to global environmental studies, which exploit tons of data for temporal-spatial analysis at a much larger scale than ever. Imagery mosaicking, which is critical for forming "One Map" with a continuous view for large-scale climate research, has drawn significant concern. However, despite employing distributed data processing engines such as Spark, large-scale data mosaicking still significantly suffers from a staggering number of remote sensing images which could inevitably lead to discouraging performance. The main ill-posed problem of traditional parallel mosaicking algorithms is inherent in the huge computation demand and incredible heavy data I/O burden resulting from intensively shifting tremendous RS data back and forth between limited local memory and bulk external storage throughout the multiple processing stages. To address these issues, we propose an in-memory Spark-enabled distributed data mosaicking at a large scale with geo-gridded data staging accelerated by Alluxio. It organizes enormous "messy" remote sensing datasets into geo-encoded gird groups and indexes them with multi-dimensional space-filling curves geo-encoding assisted by GeoTrellis. All the buckets of geo-grided remote sensing data groups could be loaded directly from Alluxio with data prefetching and expressed as RDDs implemented concurrently as grid tasks of mosaicking on top of the Spark-enabled cluster. It is worth noticing that an in-memory data orchestration is offered to facilitate in-memory big data staging among multiple mosaicking processing stages to eliminate the tremendous data transferring at a great extent while maintaining a better data locality. As a result, benefiting from parallel processing with distributed data prefetching and in-memory data staging, this is a much more effective approach to facilitate large-scale data mosaicking in the context of big data. Experimental results have demonstrated our approach is much more efficient and scalable than the traditional ways of parallel implementing.

TI  - Estimation of fine spatial resolution all-sky surface net shortwave radiation over mountainous terrain from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Net shortwave radiation (NSR) plays an essential role in surface energy budget and has been reported to exhibit low estimation accuracy when ignoring topographic effects. Several algorithms have been developed to estimate clear-sky NSR in mountains, but none have estimated NSR in mountainous terrain under all-sky (i.e., both clear and cloudy) conditions. Moreover, surface heterogeneity is considerable in mountains, and coarse-spatial -resolution satellites may not provide sufficient details for fine-scale applications. In this study, to address these challenges, we developed a method for fine-spatial-resolution (i.e., from 20 m to 30 m resolution) all-sky NSR estimation in mountains directly from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) observations with mountainous radiative transfer scheme (herein denoted 'TOPO'). For comparison, we also created the model neglecting topography (herein called 'FLAT'). The validation of the TOPO model in complex terrain against Chengde ground-based pyrometers in China was good, with an R2 of 0.91 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 80.9 W/m2, which was an improvement of 46.1% (reduction of RMSE) against the FLAT model. Meanwhile, the consistency of NSR generated from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 using TOPO model was satisfactory. Time-series comparisons of NSR derived from TOPO and FLAT models showed that topographic effects were substantial both in clear sky (maximum deviation of 643.4 W/m2) and cloudy sky (270.2 W/m2) when NSR estimates from the two models were compared. The evaluation of the FLAT model with a dataset simulated from the mountainous radiative transfer (created for the TOPO model) showed that neglecting topographic effects over mountainous terrain could lead to RMSEs of 541.7 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 159.5%) and 201.4 W/m2 (relative RMSE = 217.1%) for NSR estimation under clear and cloudy skies, respectively. This study provides a straightforward method of deriving fine-spatial-resolution all-sky NSR with topographic consideration, which can be further extended to the global mapping of NSR over mountainous terrain.

TI  - Using a Remote-Sensing-Based Piecewise Retrieval Algorithm to Map Chlorophyll-a Concentration in a Highland River System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a(chl-a) has been used as an important indicator of water quality. Great efforts have been invested to develop remote-sensing-based chl-a retrieval models. However, due to the spatial difference in chl-a concentration, a single model usually cannot accurately predict the whole range of chl-a concentration. To test the performance of precedent chl-a models, we carried out an experiment along the upper and middle reaches of the Kaidu River and around some small ponds in the Bayanbulak Wetland. We measured water surface reflectance in the field and analyzed the chl-a concentration in the laboratory. Initially, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the spectrum band to chl-a concentration with the aim of identifying the most suitable bands for various chl-a models. We found that the water samples could be divided into two groups with a threshold of 4.50 mg/m(3). Then, we tested the performance of 11 precedent chl-a retrieval models and 7 spectral index-based regression models from this study for all the sample datasets and the two separate datasets with relatively high and low chl-a concentrations. Through a complete comparison of the performance of these models, we selected the D3B model for water bodies with high chl-a concentration and OC2 model (ocean color 2) for low chl-a concentration waters, resulting in the hierarchical and piecewise retrieval algorithm OC2-D3B. The chl-a concentration of 4.50 mg/m(3) corresponded to the D3B value of -0.051; therefore, we used -0.051 as the threshold value of the OC2-D3B model. The result of the OC2-D3B model showed a better performance than the other algorithms. Finally, we mapped the spatial distribution and seasonal pattern of chl-a concentration in Bayanbulak Wetland using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2019. The results indicated that the chl-a concentration in the riparian ponds was generally in the range of 8-10 mg/m(3), which was higher than that in rivers with a range of 2-4 mg/m(3). The highest chl-a concentration usually appears in summer, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest in winter. The correlation between meteorological data and chl-a concentration showed that temperature is the dominant factor for chl-a concentration changes. Our analytical framework could provide a better way to accurately map the spatial distribution of chl-a concentration in complex river systems.

TI  - CerealNet: A Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture for Cereal Crop Mapping Using Sentinel-2 Time-Series
T2  - INFORMATICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based crop mapping has continued to grow in economic importance over the last two decades. Given the ever-increasing rate of population growth and the implications of multiplying global food production, the necessity for timely, accurate, and reliable agricultural data is of the utmost importance. When it comes to ensuring high accuracy in crop maps, spectral similarities between crops represent serious limiting factors. Crops that display similar spectral responses are notorious for being nearly impossible to discriminate using classical multi-spectral imagery analysis. Chief among these crops are soft wheat, durum wheat, oats, and barley. In this paper, we propose a unique multi-input deep learning approach for cereal crop mapping, called "CerealNet". Two time-series used as input, from the Sentinel-2 bands and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), were fed into separate branches of the LSTM-Conv1D (Long Short-Term Memory Convolutional Neural Networks) model to extract the temporal and spectral features necessary for the pixel-based crop mapping. The approach was evaluated using ground-truth data collected in the Gharb region (northwest of Morocco). We noted a categorical accuracy and an F1-score of 95% and 94%, respectively, with minimal confusion between the four cereal classes. CerealNet proved insensitive to sample size, as the least-represented crop, oats, had the highest F1-score. This model was compared with several state-of-the-art crop mapping classifiers and was found to outperform them. The modularity of CerealNet could possibly allow for injecting additional data such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) bands, especially when optical imagery is not available.

TI  - Impact of Field Topography and Soil Characteristics on the Productivity of Alfalfa and Rhodes Grass: RTK-GPS Survey and GIS Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial pattern of soil chemical properties along with the topologic indicators is essential for site-specific agriculture management. A study was conducted on a 50 ha field to investigate the effect of selected topographic indicators, including elevation (DEM), slope (SL), flow accumulation (FA) and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) on forage crop production. The soil samples and yield data were obtained from the field inventory. Topographical parameters of elevation and slope were estimated with the use of a real-time kinematic global positioning system (RTK-GPS), and then the DEM was generated. The collected soil samples were analyzed for pH, EC, nitrogen and soil organic carbon. Sentinel-2 images were for the creation of yield maps of alfalfa and Rhodes grass. Subsequently, on the basis of DEM, the generated elevation, slope and FA model were then compared with the yield and soil chemical properties. Statistical analysis revealed that the SL, FA and TWI, which are associated with water distribution, were significantly related to crop yields. The FA showed a medium-to-non-significant correlation with the productivity of both alfalfa (R-2 = 0.586; p = 0.015) and Rhodes grass (R-2 = 0.578; p = 0.01). A significant inverse correlation was recorded between the SL and the yield of both crops (R-2 = -0.591 to -0.617; p = 0.01). The yield map revealed that the majority of the area (37.56%) of the experimental field was occupied by the medium-yield class, followed by the high-yield class (33.03%).

TI  - Urban Growth Modeling and Land-Use/Land-Cover Change Analysis in a Metropolitan Area (Case Study: Tabriz)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last three decades, the expansion of the Tabriz Metropolitan Area (TMA) to the surrounding areas has caused the destruction of environmental resources and problems such as disturbing ecological balance, increasing service costs, construction over unsuitable lands, exacerbation of air pollution, and lack of consideration of existing deteriorated textures and previous ongoing trends, reducing the environmental quality of the TMA. The goal of this study was to perform ecological modeling of urban development in the TMA with respect to the preservation of environmental resources, prevention of urban sprawl, and the management of the physical expansion of the TMA in an eco-friendly manner. In this research, to investigate the previous pattern of growth of the TMA, Landsat satellite imagers from 1984 to 2018 were used to discover the non-ecological and sprawl development of the TMA, and artificial neural networks and logistic regression techniques were applied to simulate future development up to 2038. According to information from the Iranian Statistical Center and 34 year of satellite imagery analysis, the population of the TMA increased from 1,007,992 to 1,961,560 during this period. Additionally, urban and rural land area increased from 7220.34 hectares to 27,640.57 hectares. A lack of coordination between population and urban expansion, as well as a decrease of 8513.61 hectares of agricultural and garden lands was inferred from the Holdern model. Detailed Calculations of the Holdern index (sprawl tendency) showed a lack of consideration of urban development capacity with population growth rate, and the Holdern index is equal to 0.6 in Tabriz. For future ecologic development of the TMA, hexagonal blocking of the urbanization probability map was used alongside environmental development policies in the form of using 30 percent of infill development capacities of inefficient land uses to prevent sprawl growth in Tabriz. Additionally, to preserve ecological landscapes, ecological networks in the form of green belts and bows with a length of 91 km were designed that may be effective in preventing the merging of small cities and nearby villages in the Tabriz metropolis.

TI  - The Critical Perspective of Animals in Some of Franz Kafka's Works
T2  - COMPARATIVE LITERATURE-EAST & WEST
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines some of Franz Kafka's works about animals through the lens of ecocriticism and postcolonial criticism. The paper focuses particularly on the critical perspective of animals in "A Report to an Academy" (1917), "Investigations of a Dog" (1922), "A Crossbreed" (1917), and The Metamorphosis (1912). As one of the few writers of the early twentieth century who cared about the critical perspective of animals, Kafka (1883-1924) seems to have possessed special abilities of communication with animals. Reading his works invites the impression that Kafka's worldview is close to that of animals, which thus allows him to manifest such creative animal characters in his works. Though ceaselessly judging animals, humans do not seem to take the slightest notice of the animals judging them. The shift in point of view from "human character" to "animal character" in the four works casts an authentic human image. That is, through the critical eyes of animals, the confidently "superior" and "hegemonic" position of humans in the natural world is suddenly flipped into a ridiculous illusion. Such a critique also holds for the supposedly superior civilization of the imperialist nations and the half-baked modernization of the colonized peoples.

TI  - Potential of using surface temperature data to benchmark Sentinel-2-based forest phenometrics in boreal Finland
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message We present a new approach to calibrate timings of phenological events from satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2 MSI data) with readily available surface temperature data. The new approach improves the estimation of growing season length in boreal forests. Context Satellite data is used to calibrate phenology models employed in land surface model components of climate models. However, realistic quantification of forest phenological transitions, such as the greenup and senescence, across large spatial scales remains challenging due to the lack of sufficient ground validation data representative of both forest tree canopy and forest understory species compositions. Aims The aim of this study was to develop a new approach to benchmark boreal forest land surface phenology obtained from Sentinel-2 (S2) against surface temperature data. Methods We computed S2 phenological transition dates and compared them to ground reference data on temperature from a network of meteorological stations across Finland (60-70N degrees). Results Our results showed that applying standard phenometrics directly to S2 data to estimate the growing season length in boreal forests may lead to clear biases in all species groups. Conclusion Our approach to use temperature data to calibrate boreal forest phenometrics allows flexible application across spatial scales (i.e., point or grid) and different satellite sensors. It can be combined with any vegetation land cover product to provide a link between surface temperature data and forest seasonal reflectance properties.

TI  - Burn Severity Drivers in Italian Large Wildfires
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of wildfire incidence in highly populated areas significantly enhances the risk for ecosystems and human lives, activities and infrastructures. In central and southern Italy, recent decades' fire records indicate that 2007 and 2017 were extreme years in terms of the number of fires and total burned area. Among them, we selected large fire events and explored their features and drivers of burn severity. We used a standardized extraction procedure to identify large wildfires (>100 ha) from the MODIS burned areas database and Landsat multi-spectral images. We mapped burn severity with the Relative Difference Normalized Burn Ratio index and explored the main drivers of severity using topographic, land-cover and anthropogenic predictors. We selected 113 wildfires for a collective total burned area of over 100,000 ha. Large fires were more frequent in the southern than in the central and northern regions, especially in July and August. The average fire size was about 900 ha and occurred mainly in shrublands (30.4%) and broadleaf forests (19.5%). With a random forest model, we observed that the highest severity occurred in conifer plantations and shrublands, in highly populated areas and at lower elevations. Burn severity models, at the landscape or regional scales, can be very useful tools for pre- and post-fire forest management planning.

TI  - Deforestation controls landslide susceptibility in Far-Western Nepal
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major problem in the Far-Western region of Nepal, where one of the highest densities of shallow landslides within the country is observed. However, there is still a lack of understanding around the relative impact of deforestation as a predisposing factor. Here, we use remote-sensing techniques and freely accessible satellite data to quantify the effects of deforestation and related agriculture practices in the assessment of landslide susceptibility. We use a new regional landslide inventory of 8,778 events dated between 1993 to 2018 to train and validate bivariate landslide susceptibility models, in which preceding land cover/land use is included as a predisposition factor. Our results show that the use of land-cover /land-use maps enhances the average probability of model success by 7.9%. Besides, we assess land-cover changes for a period of 1 to 10 years prior to each landslide event to analyze the relative incidence of changes related to deforestation and agricultural uses. The analysis suggests that agricultural practices and deforestation that occur 5-7 years preceding the landslide event have a significant influence on the landslide occurrence (+16%). Our results reveal that negligent anthropological land use practices can significantly enhance landslide risk.

TI  - Chaotic attractors captured from remote sensing time series for the dynamics of cereal crops
T2  - JOURNAL OF DIFFERENCE EQUATIONS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A chaotic attractor was obtained from remote sensing data, for the first time, in the early 2010s, its Poincare section revealing a weakly dissipative dynamics. This attractor was captured from a time series of vegetation index, for the cycles of cereal crops in semi-arid region. This attractor was fully unexpected, since it was also the first attractor of a weakly dissipative dynamics directly extracted from observational time series. The generality of this result is questioned here by applying the same modelling approach - the global modelling technique - to four provinces in coastal and inland Morocco: Safi, El Jadida, Khourigba and Khenifra. Several experimentations are considered, applying the analyses at the provinces scale, or to several provinces in association and in aggregation. The obtained models confirm the results obtained in the early 2010s: the dynamics of cereal crops is chaotic and can be approximated by a weakly dissipative three-dimensional dynamics.

TI  - Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variability of Whitings in Lake Geneva from Multispectral Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Whiting events are massive calcite precipitation events turning hardwater lake waters to a milky turquoise color. Herein, we use a multispectral remote sensing approach to describe the spatial and temporal occurrences of whitings in Lake Geneva from 2013 to 2021. Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-3 sensors are combined to derive the AreaBGR index and identify whitings using appropriate filters. 95% of the detected whitings are located in the northeastern part of the lake and occur in a highly reproducible environmental setting. An extended time series of whitings in the last 60 years is reconstructed from a random forest algorithm and analyzed through a Bayesian decomposition for annual and seasonal trends. The annual number of whiting days between 1958 and 2021 does not follow any particular monotonic trend. The inter-annual changes of whiting occurrences significantly correlate to the Western Mediterranean Oscillation Index. Spring whitings have increased since 2000 and significantly follow the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index. Future climate change in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean could induce more variable and earlier whiting events in Lake Geneva.

TI  - The Atmospheric Correction of COCTS on the HY-1C and HY-1D Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The data quality of the remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from the two ocean color satellites HaiYang-1C (HY-1C) and HaiYang-1D (HY-1D) and the consistency with other satellites are critical for the products. The Layer Removal Scheme for Atmospheric Correction (LRSAC) has been applied to process the data of the Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) on HY-1C/1D. The accuracy of the R-rs products was evaluated by the in situ dataset from the Marine Optical BuoY (MOBY) with a mean relative error (MRE) of -1.56% and a mean absolute relative error (MAE) of 17.31% for HY-1C. The MRE and MAE of HY-1D are 1.05% and 15.68%, respectively. The comparisons of the global daily R-rs imagery with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on Terra show an MRE of 10.94% and an MAE of 21.38%. The comparisons between HY-1D and Aqua exhibit similar results, with an MRE of 13.31% and an MAE of 21.46%. The percentages of valid pixels of the global daily images of HY-1C and HY-1D are 32.3% and 32.6%, much higher than that of Terra (11.9%) and Aqua (11.9%). The gaps in the 8-day composite images have been significantly reduced, with 83.9% of valid pixels for HY-1C and 85.4% for HY-1D, which are also much higher than that of Terra (52.9%) and Aqua (50.9%). The gaps due to the contamination of sun glint have been almost removed from the 3-day composite imagery, with valid pixels of 63.5% for HY-1C and 65.6% for HY-1D, which are higher than that of the 8-day imagery of Terra and Aqua. The patterns of HY-1C imagery exhibit a similarity with those of HY-1D, but they are different on a pixel scale, mainly due to the changes in the ocean dynamic features within 3 h. The evaluations of the COCTS indicate that the imagery of HY-1C/1D can be used as a kind of standard product.

TI  - Leveraging International Influenza Surveillance Systems and Programs during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - A network of global respiratory disease surveillance systems and partnerships has been built over decades as a direct response to the persistent threat of seasonal, zoonotic, and pandemic influenza. These efforts have been spearheaded by the World Health Organization, country ministries of health, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nongovernmental organizations, academic groups, and others. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked closely with ministries of health in partner countries and the World Health Organization to leverage influenza surveillance systems and programs to respond to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Countries used existing surveillance systems for severe acute respiratory infection and influenza-like illness, respiratory virus laboratory resources, pandemic influenza preparedness plans, and ongoing population-based influenza studies to track, study, and respond to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The incorporation of COVID-19 surveillance into existing influenza sentinel surveillance systems can support continued global surveillance for respiratory viruses with pandemic potential.

TI  - Possible Mechanism for the Generation of Internal Waves by Submesoscale Eddies in the Mozambique Channel
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies a possible mechanism for the formation of spiral structures around a submesoscale eddy (Rossby number Ro similar to 5) detected on September 22, 2017, by a Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of an ocean area in the Mozambique Channel (Africa). We present a calculation of wave crest shapes of trapped internal waves in a stably stratified ocean thermocline that are generated due to advection by the eddy current of its turbulent density and velocity inhomogeneities. The shapes of the simulated internal wave crests compare well with the shape of the spiral bands in the eddy image, thereby supporting our hypothesis that eddies can generate internal waves. The parameters (variations in the intensity of a reflected radar signal and their spectra and horizontal periods) of the banded spiral structure are also analyzed for a second submesoscale eddy with a diameter of about 5 km detected in the image from September 25, 2017, and having an opposite direction of circulation of the current inside the eddy as compared to the current inside the eddy in the image from September 22, 2017.

M3  - Article
AB  - The research focuses on the influence of translingualism on the establishment of language worldview. Due to the relevance of the problem, the article sets the task to investigate the influence of translingualism on the formation of the language worldview as a process of perceiving the environment through its color components through the prism of speakers of different languages. Based on the observation of translingual connections that arise between linguistic and color stimuli, the key idea is illustrated that a number of patterns that manifest themselves in the interaction between native and foreign languages indicate that the diversity of languages creates different mental angles and projections of color term awareness. This study is based on the results of an experiment conducted among speakers of 15 different languages. This perspective of the study allows us to substantiate that awareness and perception of color terms in different languages reflect the complementarity of language processes, their dynamism, deep qualitative and quantitative features. The language worldview is a reflection of the objective color spectrum in its specific interpretation and is characteristic of representatives of different cultures. It fixes the features of its perception and the specifics of language associations, indicates that they have acquired new semantic connections and leads to creation of new meanings.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we consider and systematize the main significant parameters of natural oil seeps and the possibility for determining them according to radar and optical satellite data. It is shown that, at present, the analysis of time series of optical and radar images makes it possible to determine the main/characteristic parameters of natural oil seeps, making it possible to estimate the location of their underwater sources; the composition, intensity, and volumes of emissions; the seismical situation; and, to some extent, the prospects for the oil and gas potential of the region. The possibilities, limitations, and prospects for using remote sensing data for the considered problems are summarized and discussed. The survey nature of the paper made it possible to consider all modern methods and results of studies of natural oil seeps using remote sensing.

AB  - The tidal flats at Otomo-ura (Iwate Prefecture), which had been converted to farmland through a reclamation project from 1959 to 1969, have been partially restored after the tsunami caused by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. In the course of monitoring the benthic fauna of the tidal flats for 11 years after the tsunami, we found some adult sentinel crabs of the genus Macrophthalmus at a muddy area for the first time on July 28, 2022. During subsequent observations of the mud flat, we noted that the adult male crabs exhibited waving display of vertical non-forward-pointing type. Allocleaning, performed by both sexes, was also observed. Morphological characters include: the carpus and propodus of the ambulatory leg 3 of the adult male are not associated with tuft of setae on their ventral surfaces, and the subdistal tooth of leg 3 is not distinct. Based on these behavioral and morphological characteristics, the macrophthalmid crab was identified as Macrophthalmus japonicus. This is the first record of this species along the coast of Iwate Prefecture. In addition, five of six females captured on July 28 and August 14, 2022, were ovigerous (range in carapace width: 19.1-25.0 mm), which indicates that the crabs are reproducing on the tidal flat.

TI  - Analyzing Fire Severity and Post-Fire Vegetation Recovery in the Temperate Andes Using Earth Observation Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In wildfire areas, earth observation data is used for the development of fire-severity maps or vegetation recovery to select post-fire measures for erosion control and revegetation. Appropriate vegetation indices for post-fire monitoring vary with vegetation type and climate zone. This study aimed to select the best vegetation indices for post-fire vegetation monitoring using remote sensing and classification methods for the temperate zone in southern Ecuador, as well as to analyze the vegetation's development in different fire severity classes after a wildfire in September 2019. Random forest classification models were calculated using the fire severity classes (from the Relativized Burn Ratio-RBR) as a dependent variable and 23 multitemporal vegetation indices from 10 Sentinel-2 scenes as descriptive variables. The best vegetation indices to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery in the temperate Andes were found to be the Leaf Chlorophyll Content Index (LCCI) and the Normalized Difference Red-Edge and SWIR2 (NDRESWIR). In the first post-fire year, the vegetation had already recovered to a great extent due to vegetation types with a short life cycle (seasonal grass-species). Increasing index values correlated strongly with increasing fire severity class (fire severity class vs. median LCCI: 0.9997; fire severity class vs. median NDRESWIR: 0.9874). After one year, the vegetations' vitality in low severity and moderate high severity appeared to be at pre-fire level.

TI  - Quotes and reminiscences from the works of Lermontov in the antinihilistic novel "Nowhere" by N. S. Leskov
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with quotes and reminiscences from Lermontov's works in the novel "No- where" by Leskov. The Lermontov's text is used to express the author's assessment and in the internal and external monologues of the nihilists of the "pure race" following the "theories" of nihilism They tend not to delve into the contradictions of this phenomenon, therefore finding themselves in conflict with tradition. Lermontov's reminiscences add lyrical drama to the characters' conflict with society and their social protest. They help the author relate the theme of nihilism to the high themes and motives of Russian literature. As Leskov considers Lermontov's poetry an example of skepticism and rebellion of the gifted man against authority, he shows the connection of the nihilism of his time with the complex of rebellious and demonic worldview characteristic of Lermontov's lyrical hero and Pechorin. Lermontov's motifs in the novel elevate the images of "pure nihilists" above the socio-pragmatic tasks of their plan. The personality traits of Lisa Bakhareva, Justin Pomada reveal a romantic yearning for an ideal. Searching for an ideal, they are captured by the "theories" of nihilism Leskov regarded the contradictions in the inner world of both "Lermontov's man" and the characters in "Nowhere" as a feature of the Russian national character. The writer's sympathy for such a spiritual experience is accompanied by a desire to understand its moral origins. The quotes from Lermontov overcome the "pamphlet," "tendentious" nature of the text, which Leskov's contemporaries accused him of, to form a hidden tragic plot.

TI  - How Australian First Nations peoples living in the Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula Area of Australia describe and discuss social and emotional well-being: a qualitative study protocol
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Colonisation has, and continues to, negatively impact the mental well-being of Australia's First Nations peoples. However, the true magnitude of the impact is not known, partially because clinicians have low levels of confidence in using many existing screening tools with First Nations clients. In addition, many authors have critiqued the use of tools designed for Western populations with First Nations peoples, because their worldview of health and well-being is different. Therefore, the aim of the overarching study is to develop an appropriate mental well-being screening tool(s) for older adults (aged 45 and over) living in the Torres Strait that can be used across primary health and geriatric settings. This protocol describes the first phase designed to achieve the overarching aim-yarning about social and emotional well-being (inclusive of mental well-being) in First Nations peoples living in the Torres Strait and Northern Peninsula Area of Australia.Method and analysis The study will be guided by decolonising and participatory action research methodologies. Yarning is an Australian First Nations relational method that relies on storytelling as a way of sharing knowledge. Yarning circles will be conducted with community members and health and aged care workers living on six different island communities of the Torres Strait. Participants will be recruited using purposive sampling. Thematic analysis of the data will be led by Torres Strait Islander members of the research team.Ethics and dissemination The Far North Queensland, Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) (HREC/2021/QCH/73638-1518) and James Cook University HREC (H8606) have approved this study. Dissemination of study findings will be led by Torres Strait members of the research team through conferences and peer-reviewed publications.

TI  - Natural numerical networks for Natura 20 0 0 habitats classification by satellite images
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural numerical networks are introduced as a new classification algorithm based on the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations of forward-backward diffu-sion type on complete graphs. The proposed natural numerical network is applied to open important environmental and nature conservation task, the automated identification of protected habitats by using satellite images. In the natural numerical network, the forward diffusion causes the movement of points in a feature space toward each other. The oppo-site effect, keeping the points away from each other, is caused by backward diffusion. This yields the desired classification. The natural numerical network contains a few parameters that are optimized in the learning phase of the method. After learning parameters and optimizing the topology of the network graph, classification necessary for habitat identifi-cation is performed. A relevancy map for each habitat is introduced as a tool for validating the classification and finding new Natura 20 0 0 habitat appearances. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - When interpreting the materials of the multizone satellite survey of Resource-P (Geotone) and Landsat-7 in the central part of the Chukchi Peninsula (Q-1-XV,XVI), structural elements of tectonic-volcanogenic genesis are revealed, represented by linear, arc, annular, and zonal-concentric lineaments of various ranks of different ages. The important role of ring structures and their dissecting disjunctiva, mainly of northeastern and submeridional strike, for the localization of gold mineralization is shown. The use of high-resolution satellite imagery allows us to outline the gold-prospective area of Erguveem-1, which is characterized by an increased density of lineaments and subvolcanic intrusions.

TI  - Monitoring Conservation of Forest in Protected Areas using Remote Sensing Change Detection Approach: a Review
T2  - CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation threaten biodiversity owing to their impacts on many species. To prevent and minimise the problem, protected areas have been created with the aim of conserving biodiversity, and parts of continental territories have been designated for this purpose. However, these areas are not exempt from forest loss and can be directly and indirectly disturbed by surrounding territories, natural disasters, climate, and human actions. In addition, the management quality of many protected areas is unknown. Thus, forest change detection using remote sensing data has been implemented as an approach to assess forest loss in conservation areas, since it generates spatio-temporal information about the protected forest area, which can then be used to improve forest management and decision making. This article reviews the approaches that have been implemented to study forest changes in protected areas.

TI  - Identification of Alteration Zones using ASTER Data for Metallic Mineralization in Ahar region, NW Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this research work is to recognize the metallic mineralization potential in the Ahar 1:100,000 sheet (NW Iran) using the remote sensing data based on determination of the alteration zones. This area is located in the Ahar-Arasbaran metallogenic zone as a significant metallogenic zone in Iran and Caucasus. In this research work, the Landsat-7 ETM+ and advanced space borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) multispectral remote sensing data was interpreted by the least square fit (LS-Fit), spectral angle mapper (SAM), and matched filtering (MF) algorithms in order to detect the alteration zones associated with the metallic mineralization. The results obtained by these methods show that there are index-altered minerals for the argillic, silicification, advanced argillic, propylitic, and phyllic alteration zones. The main altered areas are situated in the SE, NE, and central parts of this region.

TI  - Digital Soil Texture Mapping and Spatial Transferability of Machine Learning Models Using Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Terrain-Derived Covariates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture is an important property that controls the mobility of the water and nutrients in soil. This study examined the capability of machine learning (ML) models in estimating soil texture fractions using different combinations of remotely sensed data from Sentinel-1 (S1), Sentinel-2 (S2), and terrain-derived covariates (TDC) across two contrasting agroecological regions in Southwest Germany, Kraichgau and the Swabian Alb. Importantly, we tested the predictive power of three different ML models: the random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) coupled with the remote sensing data covariates. As expected, ML model performance was not consistent regarding the input covariates, soil texture fractions, and study regions. For example, in the Swabian Alb, the SVM model performed the best for the sand content with S2 + TDC (RMSE = 3.63%, R-2 = 0.42), and XGB best predicted the clay content with S1 + S2 + TDC (RMSE = 6.84%, R-2 = 0.64). In Kraichgau, the best models for sand (RMSE = 7.54%, R-2 = 0.79) and clay contents (RMSE = 6.14%, R-2 = 0.48) were obtained using XGB and SVM, respectively. Moreover, the results indicated that TDC were critical in estimating soil texture fractions, especially in Kraichgau, which indicated that topography plays an important role in defining the spatial distribution of soil properties. In contrast, the contribution of remote sensing data better predicted the silt and clay content in the Swabian Alb. The transferability of a region-specific model to the other region was low as indicated by poor predictive performance. The resulting soil-texture-fraction maps could be a significant source of information for efficient land resource management and environmental monitoring. Nonetheless, further research to evaluate the added value of the Sentinel imagery and to better analyze the spatial transferability of machine learning models is highly recommended.

TI  - RIGHT FROM WRIGHT: A VIEW ON N. T. WRIGHT'S APPROACH TO THE NEW TESTAMENT
T2  - PERICHORESIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The writings of the prominent biblical scholar N. T. Wright are much debated upon throughout the world. His currently in progress 'Christian Origins and the Question of God' series intrigued some and pleased others. There are a lot of articles and books evaluating either positively or negatively his writings. This is all because of the huge amount of information and of the carefully constructed methodology that permits Wright to continue his project despite the critiques brought against him. This article strives to offer a positive account of Wright's project, having its focus on his methodology. The author suggests that the key of understanding his methodology lies in his theory of reading the New Testament texts and the history related to them. It is further suggested that this theory of reading pushed Wright toward the well-known category of 'worldview'. This puts him in the position of bringing together the 'then' and the 'now' worldviews which, in the author's view, constitutes the major contribution of Wright's project.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes and Risk Stratification of Early-Stage Melanoma Micrometastases From an International Multicenter Study: Implications for the Management of American Joint Committee on Cancer IIIA Disease
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSEIndications for offering adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with early-stage melanomas with low disease burden sentinel node (SN) micrometastases, namely, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC; eighth edition) stage IIIA disease, are presently controversial. The current study sought to identify high-risk SN-positive AJCC stage IIIA patients who are more likely to derive benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy.METHODSPatients were recruited from an intercontinental (Australia/Europe/North America) consortium of nine high-volume cancer centers. All were adult patients with pathologic stage pT1b/pT2a primary cutaneous melanomas who underwent SN biopsy between 2005 and 2020. Patient data, primary tumor and SN characteristics, and survival outcomes were analyzed.RESULTSThree thousand six hundred seven patients were included. The median follow-up was 34 months. Pairwise disease comparison demonstrated no significant survival difference between N1a and N2a subgroups. Survival analysis identified a SN tumor deposit maximum dimension of 0.3 mm as the optimal cut point for stratifying survival. Five-year disease-specific survival rates were 80.3% and 94.1% for patients with SN metastatic tumor deposits >= 0.3 mm and < 0.3 mm, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.26 [1.11 to 1.44]; P < .0001). Similar findings were seen for overall disease-free and distant metastasis-free survival. There were no survival differences between the AJCC IB patients and low-risk (< 0.3 mm) AJCC IIIA patients. The newly identified high-risk (>= 0.3 mm) subgroup comprised 271 (66.4%) of the AJCC IIIA cohort, whereas only 142 (34.8%) patients had SN tumor deposits > 1 mm in maximum dimension.CONCLUSIONPatients with AJCC IIIA melanoma with SN tumor deposits >= 0.3 mm in maximum dimension are at higher risk of disease progression and may benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy or enrollment into a clinical trial. Patients with SN deposits < 0.3 mm in maximum dimension can be managed similar to their SN-negative, AJCC IB counterparts, thereby avoiding regular radiological surveillance and more intensive follow-up.

TI  - Use of Hyperspectral Satellite Data for Identifying Cyanobacteria in the Black and Azov Seas
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we use data from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO, NASA) hyperspectral satellite sensor to identify and qualitatively estimate the content of cyanobacteria (CB) in the coastal waters of the Black and Azov seas. Three data processing algorithms are applied: two use a spectrum shape analysis and one is semianalytical. The first algorithm uses the determination of the minimum of the reflection coefficient spectrum for remote sensing in the spectral region of similar to 680 nm, the so-called CB presence index. Based on this algorithm, a second was developed to identify the presence of phycocyanin in water, which is a marker pigment for CB. The second algorithm analyzes the minimum of the reflectance spectrum for remote sensing (Rrs) in the region of 620 nm. The third semianalytical algorithm makes it possible to determine the concentration of phycocyanin. The results of automatic identification of the presence of the CB were compared with the visual analysis of the spectra. The results of applying three algorithms to images are compared. It is concluded that phycocyanin is present in the studied water areas and its presence is a consequence of the presence of CB.

M3  - Article
AB  - The trophic system of the largest freshwater lake in Europe, Ladoga, is in a state of transformation. Initially oligotrophic, the lake became mesotrophic as a result of anthropogenic eutrophication in the late 1950s. Anthropogenic nutrient loads have been sharply reduced since the late 1990s and the status of the lake is changing again, this time against a background of climate warming. Based on MODIS Aqua data, a numerical evaluation of these changes over the past 18 years (2003-2020) was carried out through assessment of the dynamics of the concentration of chlorophyll (CHL) of phytoplankton, mineral suspended matter (SM) and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The observed decrease in CDOM concentration concurringly with the decline of the CHL concentration might speak in favor of continuing supply of digestible phosphorus into the lake due to the lysis of dissolved allochthonous organic matter. This is able to slow down the return of the lake to the initially oligotrophic state regardless of the reported continuing decline of the lake average inorganic phosphorus concentration. It is shown that the climatic impact is manifested, in particular, in the expansion of the time period of biological activity at the primary production level: the growth of phytoplankton becomes appreciable in March, while its end is shifted to between October and November. At the same time, the intra-annual dynamics of CHL has increased presumably due to high occurrence of extreme meteorological conditions, which is a feature of ongoing climate change.

TI  - Integral Assessment of Atmospheric Air Quality in the Largest Cities of Russia Based on TROPOMI (<i>Sentinel-5P</i>) Data for 2019-2020
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the level of atmospheric air pollution of the 20 largest cities in Russia in 2019-2020. The data used for the study is initially collected by a TROPOMI instrument (on the Sentinel-5P satellite), including measurements of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and aerosol (aerosol index). The measurements were obtained using the cloud-based platform, Google Earth Engine, which presents L3 level data available for direct analysis. The Tropomi Air Quality Index (TAQI) integrates available TROPOMI measurements into a single indicator. The calculation results showed that most of the cities under consideration (15 out of 20) have a low or higher than usual level of pollution. Formaldehyde (35.7%) and nitrogen dioxide (26.4%) play the main role in the composition of pollution particles. A significant share is occupied by sulfur dioxide (16.4%). The contribution of carbon monoxide and aerosol averages 10.8 and 10.6%, respectively. Air pollution in cities is caused by both natural (wildfires, dust storms) and anthropogenic (seasonal migrations of the population, restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic) factors. Estimating atmospheric pollution levels in urban areas using an integral index based on remote data (such as TAQI) can be considered as a valuable information addition to existing ground-based measuring systems within the multisensory paradigm.

TI  - Foster children in care due to parental incarceration: A national longitudinal study
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Using national child welfare data, we created a longitudinal data set (N = 142,143) to examine a subset of foster children (7%) who entered care due to parental incarceration (PI). Spanning FY 2005-2017, the dataset allowed us to compare children who entered care due to PI to children entering for other reasons. We found children of incarcerated parents were younger (median age of 4 vs. 6), more often White (47% vs. 42%), and less often Black (15% vs. 20%) when compared to other foster children. Parental use of alcohol (12% v. 6%) and drugs (42% v. 26%) were both more common among children who entered due to PI compared to those who entered for other reasons. Our understanding of this population is limited by inadequate data collection procedures that fail to account for societal changes created by mass incarceration. Our data indicate that investments in substance use treatment could decrease the number of children entering care.

TI  - Ontology of human rights in today's globalized world: the philosophical dimension
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The ontology of human rights forms new features in today's globalized world. Civilizational advancement has modified the interpretation of both fundamental ontological legal concepts in general and human rights in particular. The scientific exploration aims to correlate the gnoseological and axiological aspects with the ontological manifestations of human rights in the modern sociocultural space. The objectives of the study are to determine the essential components of human rights and their interconnection with global processes. The methodological arsenal for achieving the goal of work is general scientific methods (analysis, systematization) and scientific and practical methods of legal regulation (imperative and dispositive). The problem of human rights in the dichotomous section of ontological legal concepts remains a debatable issue. The essence of the right acts as a fundamental dimension in the analysis of human dimension legal aspects. Thus, the ontology of human rights has been repositioned in the modern worldview paradigm and aligns its principles with the trends of globalization. Under the influence of modern socio-cultural factors, the nature of human rights is undergoing significant transformations, not only in the value dimension but also in the existential and semantic dimension. Prospects for further research should be considered new interpretations of ontological legal concepts -legist, natural law, and libertarian -and the development on their basis of a synergistic ontological model of human rights.

TI  - Machine Learning Applied to Tree Crop Yield Prediction Using Field Data and Satellite Imagery: A Case Study in a Citrus Orchard
T2  - INFORMATICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall goal of this study is to define an intelligent system for predicting citrus fruit yield before the harvest period. This system uses a machine learning algorithm trained on historical field data combined with spectral information extracted from satellite images. To this end, we used 5 years of historical data for a Moroccan orchard composed of 50 parcels. These data are related to climate, amount of water used for irrigation, fertilization products by dose, phytosanitary treatment dose, parcel size, and root-stock type on each parcel. Additionally, two very popular indices, the normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference water index were extracted from Sentinel 2 and Landsat satellite images to improve prediction scores. We managed to build a total dataset composed of 250 rows, representing the 50 parcels over a period of 5 years labeled with the yield of each parcel. Several machine learning algorithms were tested with the necessary parameter optimization, while the orthonormal automatic pursuit algorithm gave good prediction scores of 0.2489 (MAE: Mean Absolute Error) and 0.0843 (MSE: Mean Squared Error). Finally, the approach followed in this study shows excellent potential for fruit yield prediction. In fact, the test was performed on a citrus orchard, but the same approach can be used on other tree crops to achieve the same goal.

TI  - JPSS-2 VIIRS Pre-Launch Reflective Solar Band Testing and Performance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instruments on-board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) spacecrafts 1 and 2 provides calibrated sensor data record (SDR) reflectance, radiance, and brightness temperatures for use in environment data record (EDR) products. The SDRs and EDRs are used in weather forecasting models, weather imagery and climate applications such as ocean color, sea surface temperature and active fires. The VIIRS has 22 bands covering a spectral range 0.4-12.4 mu m with resolutions of 375 m and 750 m for imaging and moderate bands respectively on four focal planes. The bands are stratified into three different types based on the source of energy sensed by the bands. The reflective solar bands (RSBs) detect sunlight reflected from the Earth, thermal emissive bands (TEBs) sense emitted energy from the Earth and the day/night band (DNB) detects both solar and lunar reflected energy from the Earth. The SDR calibration uses a combination of pre-launch testing and the solar diffuser (SD), on-board calibrator blackbody (OBCBB) and space view (SV) on-orbit calibrator sources. The pre-launch testing transfers the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable calibration to the SD, for the RSB, and the OBCBB, for the TEB. Post-launch, the on-board calibrators track the changes in instrument response and adjust the SDR product as necessary to maintain the calibration. This paper will discuss the pre-launch radiometric calibration portion of the SDR calibration for the RSBs that includes the dynamic range, detector noise, calibration coefficients and radiometric uncertainties for JPSS-2 VIIRS.

TI  - Mapping Soil Erosion Dynamics (1990-2020) in the Pearl River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthy soil is the key foundation of the world's agriculture and an essential resource to ensure the world's food security. Soil erosion is one of the serious forms of soil degradation and a major threat to sustainable terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we utilized a continuous Landsat satellite image dataset to map soil erosion changes (1990-2020) based on the RUSLE model across the Pearl River Basin. The study results indicated that: (1) The multi-year area-specific soil erosion average in the Pearl River Basin is approximately 538.95 t/(km(2)center dot a) with an annual soil loss of approximately 353 million tons; (2) The overall soil erosion displayed a decreasing trend over the past 30 years with an annual decreasing rate of -13.44(+/- 1.53) t/(km(2)center dot a); (3) Soil erosion, dominated by low- and moderate-level erosion, primarily occurred in the tributary basin of Xijiang River, especially in the areas with slopes > 15 degrees, low vegetation coverage, or poorly managed forests; (4) the NDVI and land cover were the dominant factors regulating soil erosion dynamics versus the insignificant role of precipitation played in the erosion procedure. The study results are valuable for soil erosion management and water conservation in the Pearl River Basin.

TI  - Moderate resolution LAI prediction using Sentinel-2 satellite data and indirect field measurements in Sikkim Himalaya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) has been traditionally used as a photosynthetic variable. LAI plays an essential role in forest cover monitoring and has been identified as one of the important climate variables. However, due to challenges in field sampling, complex topography, and availability of cloud-free optical satellite data, LAI assessment on larger scale is still unexplored in the Sikkim Himalayan area. We used two optical instruments, digital hemispherical photography (DHP) and LAI-2200C, to assess the LAI across four different forests following 20 x 20 m(2) elementary sampling units (ESUs) in the Himalayan state of Sikkim, India. The use of Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices (VIs) demonstrated a better correlation with the DHP based LAI estimates than using LAI-2200C. Further, the combination of both reflectance bands and VIs were integrated to predict the LAI maps using random forest model. The temperate evergreen forests demonstrated the highest LAI value, while the predicted maps exhibited LAI maxima of 3.4. The estimated vs predicted LAI for DHP and LAI-2200C based estimation demonstrated reasonably good (R-2 = 0.63 and R-2 = 0.68, respectively) agreement. Further, improvements on the LAI prediction can be attempted by minimizing errors from the inherent field protocols, optimizing the density of field measurements, and representing heterogeneity. The recent rise of frequent forest fires in Sikkim Himalaya prompts for better understanding of fuel load in terms of surface fuel or canopy fuel that can be linked to LAI. The high-resolution LAI map could serve as input to forest fuel bed characterization, especially in seasonal forests with significant variations in green leaves and litter, thereby offering inputs for forest management in changing climate.

TI  - Sentinel-1 Backscatter Time Series for Characterization of Evapotranspiration Dynamics over Temperate Coniferous Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests' ecosystems are an essential part of the global carbon cycle with vast carbon storage potential. These systems are currently under external pressures showing increasing change due to climate change. A better understanding of the biophysical properties of forests is, therefore, of paramount importance for research and monitoring purposes. While there are many biophysical properties, the focus of this study is on the in-depth analysis of the connection between the C-band Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates based on in situ meteorological data and the FAO-based Penman-Monteith equation as well as the well-established global terrestrial ET product from the Terra and Aqua MODIS sensors. The analysis was performed in the Free State of Thuringia, central Germany, over coniferous forests within an area of 2452 km(2), considering a 5-year time series (June 2016-July 2021) of 6- to 12-day Sentinel-1 backscatter acquisitions/observations, daily in situ meteorological measurements of four weather stations as well as an 8-day composite of ET products of the MODIS sensors. Correlation analyses of the three datasets were implemented independently for each of the microwave sensor's acquisition parameters, ascending and descending overpass direction and co- or cross-polarization, investigating different time series seasonality filters. The Sentinel-1 backscatter and both ET time series datasets show a similar multiannual seasonally fluctuating behavior with increasing values in the spring, peaks in the summer, decreases in the autumn and troughs in the winter months. The backscatter difference between summer and winter reaches over 1.5 dB, while the evapotranspiration difference reaches 8 mm/day for the in situ measurements and 300 kg/m(2)/8-day for the MODIS product. The best correlation between the Sentinel-1 backscatter and both ET products is achieved in the ascending overpass direction, with datasets acquired in the late afternoon, and reaches an R-2-value of over 0.8. The correlation for the descending overpass direction reaches values of up to 0.6. These results suggest that the SAR backscatter signal of coniferous forests is sensitive to the biophysical property evapotranspiration under some scenarios.

TI  - Modelling Floodplain Vegetation Response to Groundwater Variability Using the ArcSWAT Hydrological Model, MODIS NDVI Data, and Machine Learning
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study modelled the relationships between vegetation response and available water below the soil surface using Terra's moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and soil water content (SWC). The Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) interface known as ArcSWAT was used in ArcGIS for the groundwater analysis. The SWAT model was calibrated and validated in SWAT-CUP software using 10 years (2001-2010) of monthly streamflow data. The average Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency during the calibration and validation was 0.54 and 0.51, respectively, indicating that the model performances were good. Nineteen years (2002-2020) of monthly MODIS NDVI data for three different types of vegetation (forest, shrub, and grass) and soil water content for 43 sub-basins were analysed using the WEKA, machine learning tool with a selection of two supervised machine learning algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). The modelling results show that different types of vegetation response and soil water content vary in the dry and wet seasons. For example, the model generated high positive relationships (r = 0.76, 0.73, and 0.81) between the measured and predicted NDVI values of all vegetation in the sub-basin against the groundwater flow (GW), soil water content (SWC), and combination of these two variables, respectively, during the dry season. However, these relationships were reduced by 36.8% (r = 0.48) and 13.6% (r = 0.63) against GW and SWC, respectively, in the wet season. Our models also predicted that vegetation in the top location (upper part) of the sub-basin is highly responsive to GW and SWC (r = 0.78, and 0.70) during the dry season. Although the rainfall pattern is highly variable in the study area, the summer rainfall is very effective for the growth of the grass vegetation type. The results predicted that the growth of vegetation in the top-point location is highly dependent on groundwater flow in both the dry and wet seasons, and any instability or long-term drought can negatively affect these floodplain vegetation communities. This study has enriched our knowledge of vegetation responses to groundwater in each season, which will facilitate better floodplain vegetation management.

TI  - Satellite Radar and Camera Time Series Reveal Transition from Aligned to Distributed Crater Arrangement during the 2021 Eruption of Cumbre Vieja, La Palma (Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Magma-filled dikes may feed erupting fissures that lead to alignments of craters developing at the surface, yet the details of activity and migrating eruptions at the crater row are difficult to monitor and are hardly understood. The 2021 Tajogaite eruption at the Cumbre Vieja, La Palma (Spain), lasted 85 days and developed a pronounced alignment of craters that may be related to changes within the volcano edifice. Here, we use COSMO-SkyMed satellite radar data and ground-based time-lapse photographs, offering a high-resolution dataset to explore the locations and characteristics of evolving craters. Our results show that the craters evolve both gradually and suddenly and can be divided into three main phases. Phase 1, lasting the first 6 weeks of the eruption, was characterized by a NW-SE linear evolution of up to seven craters emerging on the growing cone. Following two partial collapses of the cone to the northwest and a seismicity increase at depth, Phase 2 started and caused a propagation of the main activity toward the southeastern side, together with the presence of up to 11 craters along this main NW-SE trend. Associated with strong deep and shallow earthquakes, Phase 3 was initiated and continued for the final 2 weeks of the eruption, expressed by the development of up to 18 craters, which became dominant and clustered in the southeastern sector in early December 2021. In Phase 3, a second and oblique alignment and surface fracture was identified. Our findings that crater and eruption changes coincide together with an increase in seismic activity at depth point to a deep driver leading to crater and morphology changes at the surface. These also suggest that crater distributions might allow for improved monitoring of changes occurring at depth, and vice versa, such that strong seismicity changes at depth may herald the migration and new formation of craters, which have major implications for the assessment of tephra and lava flow hazards on volcanoes.

TI  - Spatial Clustering of Vegetation Fire Intensity Using MODIS Satellite Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyses the spatial clustering of fire intensity in Zimbabwe, using remotely sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire occurrence data. In order to investigate the spatial pattern of fire intensity, MODIS-derived fire radiative power (FRP) was utilized. A local indicator of spatial autocorrelation method, the Getis-Ord (Gi*) spatial statistic, was applied to show the spatial distribution of high and low fire intensity clusters. Analysis of the relationship between topographic variables, vegetation type, agroecological zones and fire intensity was done. According to the study's findings, the majority (44%) of active fires detected in the study area in 2019 were of low-intensity (cold spots), and themajority (49.3%) of them occurred in shrubland. High-intensity fires (22%) primarily occurred in the study area's eastern and western regions. The study findings demonstrate the utility of spatial statistics methods in conjunction with satellite fire data in detecting clusters of high and low-intensity fires (hot spots and cold spots).

TI  - What Determines Above-Anvil Cirrus Plume Infrared Temperature?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-anvil cirrus plumes (AACPs) in midlatitude convection are important indicators of severe storms and stratospheric hydration events. Recent studies of AACPs have shown large variability in their characteristics, although many of the causes remain unknown. Notably, some AACPs appear equally as cold (or colder) than the broader storm top when compared to the more frequently observed warm AACP feature in infrared satellite imagery. To confidently identify the presence of an AACP, trained experts utilize infrared imagery to support the primary source of AACP identification, visible imagery. Thus, nighttime AACPs are often left unidentified due to unavailable visible imagery, especially for cold AACPs. In this study, 89 warm and 89 cold AACPs from 1-min GOES-16 satellite imagery coupled with ground-based radar observations and reanalysis data are comparatively evaluated to answer the following research questions: 1) Why do some AACPs exhibit a warm feature in infrared imagery while others do not, and 2) what observable storm and environment differences exist between warm and cold AACPs? It is found that cold AACPs tend to occur in tropical environments, which feature higher, cold-point tropopauses. Conversely, warm AACPs tend to occur in midlatitude environments, with lower tropopauses accompanied by an isothermal region (or tropopause inversion layer) in the lower stratosphere. Similar storm characteristics are found for warm and cold AACP events, implying that infrared temperature variability is driven by environmental differences. Together, these results suggest that cold AACPs are predominantly tropospheric phenomena, while warm AACPs reside in the lower stratosphere. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to determine why some storms with a specific cloud-top feature exhibit a broad warm spot in infrared satellite imagery while others appear cold. This is important because storms with this specific cloud-top feature, whether warm or cold, produce much more severe weather than most other storms. These cloud-top features are also potentially indicative of increased water vapor in the stratosphere, which results in warming of Earth's climate. Our results help us better understand storms that are frequently severe and suggest that the storms with cold features are less important to understanding stratospheric water vapor and climate change.

TI  - Controls of Land Surface Temperature between and within Local Climate Zones: A Case Study of Harare in Zimbabwe
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban growth-related changes in land use and land cover have segmented urban areas into zones of distinct surface and air temperatures (i.e., Local Climate Zones-LCZ). While studies have revealed inter-LCZ temperature variations, understanding controls of variations in Land Surface Temperature (LST) within LCZs has largely remained uninvestigated. In view of the need for LCZ-specific heat mitigation strategies, this study investigated factors driving LST variations within LCZs. To achieve this, an LCZ map for Harare was developed and correlated with LST, both derived using Landsat 8 data. The contribution index (CI) was then used to determine the relative contribution of LCZs to cooling and warming of the city. The contribution of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Urban Index (UI), and Aspect and Elevation as quantitative measures of surface controls of LST were investigated between and within LCZs. LST generally increased with built-up density and reduced with increases in surface water and vegetation. The study showed that the cooling effect of water bodies was reduced in contribution to their insignificant proportion of the study area. At the city scale, NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, and UI had the strongest influence on LST (correlation coefficient > 0.5). At the intra-LCZ scale, the contribution of these surface properties remained significant, though to varied extents. The study concluded that surface wetness is a significant cooling determinant in densely built-up LCZs, while in other LCZs, it combines with vegetation abundance and health to mitigate elevated surface temperature. Aspect and elevation had low but significant correlations with LST in most LCZs. The study recommends that intra-LCZ controls of LST must be considered in heat mitigation efforts.

TI  - SRODNet: Object Detection Network Based on Super Resolution for Autonomous Vehicles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Object detection methods have been applied in several aerial and traffic surveillance applications. However, object detection accuracy decreases in low-resolution (LR) images owing to feature loss. To address this problem, we propose a single network, SRODNet, that incorporates both super-resolution (SR) and object detection (OD). First, a modified residual block (MRB) is proposed in the SR to recover the feature information of LR images, and this network was jointly optimized with YOLOv5 to benefit from hierarchical features for small object detection. Moreover, the proposed model focuses on minimizing the computational cost of network optimization. We evaluated the proposed model using standard datasets such as VEDAI-VISIBLE, VEDAI-IR, DOTA, and Korean highway traffic (KoHT), both quantitatively and qualitatively. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the accuracy of vehicular detection better than other conventional methods.

TI  - Automatic Detection of Marine Litter: A General Framework to Leverage Synthetic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal coverage of spaceborne optical imaging systems are well suited for automated marine litter monitoring. However, developing machine learning-based detection and identification algorithms requires large amounts of data. Indeed, when it comes to marine debris, ground validated data is scarce. In this study, we propose a general methodology that leverages synthetic data in order to avoid overfitting and generalizes well. The idea is to utilize realistic models of spaceborne optical image acquisition and marine litter to generate large amounts of data to train the machine learning algorithms. These can then be used to detect marine pollution automatically on real satellite images. The main contribution of our study is showing that algorithms trained on simulated data can be successfully transferred to real-life situations. We present the general components of our framework, our modeling of satellites and marine debris and a proof of concept implementation for macro-plastic detection with Sentinel-2 images. In this case study, we generated a large dataset (more than 16,000 pixels of marine debris) composed of seawater, plastic, and wood and trained a Random Forest classifier on it. This classifier, when tested on real satellite images, successfully discriminates marine litter from seawater, thus proving the effectiveness of our approach and paving the way for machine learning-based marine litter detection with even more representative simulation models.

T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Shirase Glacier, one of the fastest-flowing outlet glaciers in East Antarctica, flows into a bay that is usually covered by landfast sea ice. Although the presence of landfast ice is considered to stabilize glacier tongue, quantitative assessments are insufficient. We investigated the spatiotemporal variations in the flow velocities of both the glacier tongue and the surrounding landfast ice using a correlation method with ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images, before and after a landfast-ice collapse in April 2017. After the collapse, the glacier tongue flow accelerated by 8-15% (0.20-0.38 km a(-1)). After reestablishment of landfast ice, the flow velocity of the landfast ice in contact with the glacier terminus is 20%-90% of the flow velocity of the glacier terminus The estimates of interactive changes in the motions of both glacier ice and sea ice can be used to quantify the buttress effect, which is a key factor affecting the mass budget of Antarctic outlet glaciers.

TI  - EffResUNet: Encoder Decoder Architecture for Cloud-Type Segmentation
T2  - BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play a vital role in Earth's water cycle and the energy balance of the climate system; understanding them and their composition is crucial in comprehending the Earth-atmosphere system. The dataset "Understanding Clouds from Satellite Images" contains cloud pattern images downloaded from NASA Worldview, captured by the satellites divided into four classes, labeled Fish, Flower, Gravel, and Sugar. Semantic segmentation, also known as semantic labeling, is a fundamental yet complex problem in remote sensing image interpretation of assigning pixel-by-pixel semantic class labels to a given picture. In this study, we propose a novel approach for the semantic segmentation of cloud patterns. We began our study with a simple convolutional neural network-based model. We worked our way up to a complex model consisting of a U-shaped encoder-decoder network, residual blocks, and an attention mechanism for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. Being an architecture of the first of its kind, the model achieved an IoU score of 0.4239 and a Dice coefficient of 0.5557, both of which are improvements over the previous research conducted in this field.

TI  - Implementing Sentinel-2 Data and Machine Learning to Detect Plant Stress in Olive Groves
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Olives are an essential crop for Greece and constitute a major economic and agricultural factor. Diseases, pests, and environmental conditions are all factors that can deteriorate the health status of olive crops by causing plant stress. Researchers can utilize remote sensing to assist their actions in detecting these sources of stress and act accordingly. In this experiment, Sentinel-2 data were used to create vegetation indices for commercial olive fields in Halkidiki, Northern Greece. Twelve machine learning algorithms were tested to determine which type would be the most efficient to detect plant stress in olive trees. In parallel, a test was conducted by testing 26 thresholds to determine how setting different thresholds for stress incidence affects model performance and which threshold constitutes the best choice for more accurate classification. The results show that among all tested classification algorithms, the quadratic discriminant analysis provided the best performance of 0.99. The stress incidence threshold used in the current case to generate the best-performing model was 6%, but the results suggest that setting customized thresholds relevant to specific cases would provide optimal results. The best-performing model was used in a one-vs.-rest multiclass classification task to determine the source of the stress between four possible classes: "healthy", "verticillium", "spilocaea", and "unidentified". The multiclass model was more accurate in detection for the "healthy" class (0.99); the "verticillium" and "unidentified" classes were less accurate (0.76); and "spilocaea" had the lowest score (0.72). Findings from this research can be used by experts as a service to enhance their decision-making and support the application of efficient strategies in the field of precision crop protection.

TI  - Re-Introduction of West Nile Virus Lineage 1 in Senegal from Europe and Subsequent Circulation in Human and Mosquito Populations between 2012 and 2021
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) is a virus of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex and belongs to the family Flaviviridae of the genus flavivirus. The virus can cause infection in humans which in most cases is asymptomatic, however symptomatic cases exist and the disease can be severe causing encephalitis and meningoencephalitis. The virus is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and birds, humans and other mammals such as horses can be accidental hosts. A mosquito-based arbovirus surveillance system and the sentinel syndromic surveillance network (4S) have been in place since 1988 and 2015 respectively, to better understand the transmission dynamics of arboviruses including WNV in Senegal. Arthropod and human samples have been collected from the field and analysed at Institut Pasteur de Dakar using different methods including RT-PCR, ELISA, plaque reduction neutralization test and viral isolation. RT-PCR positive samples have been analysed by Next Generation Sequencing. From 2012 to 2021, 7912 samples have been analysed and WNV positive cases have been detected, 20 human cases (19 IgM and 1 RT-PCR positive cases) and 41 mosquito pools. Phylogenetic analyzes of the sequences of complete genomes obtained showed the circulation of lineage 1a, with all these recent strains from Senegal identical to each other and very close to strains isolated from horse in France in 2015, Italy and Spain. Our data showed lineage 1a endemicity in Senegal as previously described, with circulation of WNV in humans and mosquitoes. Phylogenetic analyzes carried out with the genome sequences obtained also revealed exchanges of WNV strains between Europe and Senegal which could be possible via migratory birds. The surveillance systems that have enabled the detection of WNV in humans and arthropods should be extended to animals in a one-health approach to better prepare for global health threats.

TI  - Using the Sentinel-3B Satellite in Geospatial Analysis of Suspended Aerosols in the Kiev, Ukraine Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of images from the Sentinel-3B SYN satellite (surface reflectance and aerosol parameters over land) is currently one of the most advanced technologies utilized to identify atmospheric aerosol concentrations on a global scale. The general aim of this study is to analyze the evolution of aerosols in the atmosphere of the Kiev region in northern Ukraine during 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022. Due to this study's timing, both prior to and during the current military incursion into Ukraine, this study also evaluates the consequences of the invasion of the Russian army on the territory of Ukraine, in relation to the quantitative levels of aerosols present in the atmosphere. Satellite image data were modelled in SNAP software (Sentinel Application Platform). Using the JASP software (version 0.14.1.0), clusters with variations of T550 (Aerosol Optical Thickness) were generated. The Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images were made available by the European Space Agency (ESA), with moderate spatial resolution (>300 m), calibrated and normalized to an average standard of 0.83 mu g/mg, with a maximum error of 6.62% in the 30 sampled points. Satellite image data were modelled in SNAP software. Using the JASP software (version 0.14.1.0), clusters with variations of T550 (Aerosol Optical Thickness) were generated. The results show variations in the concentration of T550 in different periods, revealing that the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine directly influenced the dynamics of aerosol concentration, attributed to factors incompatible with environmental sustainability.

T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In 2020 more than 2.2 million cases of breast cancer were registered, and these figures indicate that this disease is very widespread. Lymphatic metastasis is one of the most important causes of local recurrence of breast cancer and is unfavorable factor of prognosis. The purpose of the work is to improve the method of intraoperative diagnosis of the sentinel lymph node in patients with breast cancer. Between 2016 and 2021, 200 patients with T1-T3N0M0 breast cancer were operated at the Odesa Regional Clinical Hospital. Two types of dyes - Patent Blue and ICG were used. The patients who had mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy as a rule had a clinical diagnosis of T2-T3N0M0 breast cancer. In group 1, 100 patients had sentinel lymph node biopsy. Staining of lymph nodes was performed using Patent Blue. In group 2, 100 patients, sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was conducted using fluorescent dye ICG, which was also administered subdermally. A total five-year survival rate after axillary lymph dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy was 91% and 92%, respectively. A five-year recurrence-free survival rate after axillary lymph dissection was approximately 82.2%, and after sentinel lymph node biopsy - 83.9%. Regional recurrence in the sentinel lymph nodes on the affected side were found in only 1.1% of cases. The sentinel lymph nodes were intact in 58% of patients, so, the next lymph dissection was not performed. The affected lymph nodes were observed in 42% of patients. The time of follow-up ranged from 60 to 180 months. The recurrence was registered in 0.2%. The study revealed no difference in total and recurrence-free survival rate between the groups. With detected mts lesions of the axillar (sentinel) lymph nodes, the operation should be continued with an obligatory determination of the second and third order lymph nodes. The extent of surgical intervention is determined on the operating table based on the results of intraoperative histological examination. The fluorescent lymphography method has a high accuracy - 99%, which allows to recommend it for implementation into clinical practice.

TI  - Estimation of Ecosystem Services Value at a Basin Scale Based on Modified Equivalent Coefficient: A Case Study of the Yellow River Basin (Henan Section), China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The value of ecosystem services is an extremely important parameter that reflects regional ecological benefits and resources. Estimating the value of ecosystem services is essential for regional land-use optimization, ecological construction, and biodiversity protection. In this study, Landsat-TM/ETM remote sensing images were used to analyze land-use data in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section), China, defined by natural boundaries. An equivalent factor method was used to construct a model to calculate the ecosystem services value that introduced grain yield, regional difference coefficient, and social development stage coefficient. Thus, land-use changes and evolution of ecosystem services values in the Yellow River Basin (Henan section) in the past 30 years were analyzed. Land use in the basin changed significantly from 1990 to 2020. Except for an increase in area of construction land, areas of other land-use types decreased. Cultivated land area first increased and then decreased, whereas the water area first decreased and then increased. The total value of ecosystem services in the study area fluctuated but increased overall by 43.82 x 10(8) USD in the past 30 years. Spatially, the total value of ecosystem services was high in the southwest and low in the northeast. Among individual ecosystem service values, water conservation, gas regulation, and climate regulation accounted for a relatively high proportion of the total value. Regulation services were the main ecosystem service functions, followed by support and supply services, with cultural services accounting for the lowest proportion. Sensitivity coefficients of different land types in different periods were all less than one. Therefore, the value coefficients were reasonable, and the results were consistent with the actual situation of the study area. The study improves the method to estimate the ecosystem services value of the basin and also indicates ways to support ecological protection of the Yellow River Basin (Henan section), China.

TI  - Assessment of Past Decadal Dynamics of Tree Stands in Forest-Tundra Transition Zone on the Polar Ural Mountains Calibrated Using Historical and Modern Field Measurements
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Altitudinal forest limits are typically climatically dependent, such that increasing temperatures connected to global warming are causing upslope shifts in treeline ecotones worldwide. However, at the local and regional levels, the degree of such a response is dependent on differences in climate, topography and soil features. In recent decades, attempts have been undertaken to estimate tree stand dynamics with remote sensing methods, but their resolution is still too coarse for a precise assessment of stand structural changes, and requires ground-truthing, which is not possible without historical data collected on a single-tree level. We used aerial photos (1962) and satellite images (2021) in combination with historical inventory data to investigate changes in open forest positions at different spatial scales at the eastern macroslope of the Polar Urals over the past 60 years. Additionally, obtained remote sensing data were validated on a single-slope level using tree crown size estimations. Our investigations showed that since 1960 up to present day, the total crown coverage increased from 6.9 to 22.1% within the test polygon. A highly spatially variable upslope advance in an open forest boundary was identified from 1.7 up to 7.1 m in altitude per decade. We revealed that the rate of tree stand transformations was to a great extent depended on the stand density in the 1960s, soil substrate type, moisture regime, slope aspect and inclination. Our results highlighted the necessity to consider the abovementioned factors when trying to predict climate-induced tree distributional responses in subarctic mountain regions.

TI  - Predicting post-wildfire overland flow using remotely sensed indicators of forest productivity
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire can induce an increase in infiltration excess overland flow, which varies from barely detectible to extreme. Soil properties are an important contributor to this variability. Several studies found that a landscape's aridity (the balance of energy and water) is strongly correlated with an increased quantity of post-wildfire overland flow, with burnt forests of higher aridity producing higher peak flow compared to wetter forests. Related process-based studies suggested that this relationship can be explained by an interaction between inherent soil macroporosity (varies inversely with aridity) and fire induced water repellency; soils of higher macro-porosity maintain high infiltration rates despite fire-enhanced water repellence. Although the observed post-wildfire runoff/aridity relationship has proven useful in mapping hydrological risk, its transferability is potentially limited for areas where other soil formation factors have greater influence. Here we propose that measurements related to landscape productivity may provide a mappable landscape metric that is based on soil formation processes that influence post-fire infiltration capacity and may provide a more robust and transferable proxy of fire induced hydrologic change. To test this hypothesis, post-wildfire runoff data from three new experimental sites with a coastal climate influence were combined with previously published data collected inland across a gradient of aridity. The results showed that post-wildfire runoff was better correlated with measures of productivity than with aridity, supporting the hypothesis. It is therefore proposed that long-term average productivity may be a more robust and transferable proxy in estimating the magnitude of increase in overland flow after fire than aridity. This most likely results from a stronger causal link between productivity and soil macroporosity, though this was not measured in this study. As with aridity, this proxy is mappable at high resolution using climate and remotely sensed data, enabling the application of landscape productivity metrics when predicting post-wildfire hydrologic risk.

TI  - Spectral Harmonization of UAV and Satellite Data for the Needs of Precision Agriculture
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In precision agriculture, remote sensing using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can well complement and, in several cases, even completely replace satellite imagery. However, it is important to harmonize their signals for consistent use. In this work, the problem of spectral harmonization is considered. We propose two new methods of spectral harmonization: method of root-polynomial correction (RPC) and model-based spectral harmonization (MBSH). The methods are evaluated on a synthetic dataset that is generated using AVIRIS hyperspectral data and known spectral sensitivities of two sensors: Sentinel-2A (satellite) and Parrot Sequoia+ (UAV). The RPC has outperformed all state-of-the-art methods in most bands. The MBSH method, despite of moderate result, has an important advantage: it does not require retraining for sensors with different spectral sensitivities.

TI  - Trends in Lifestyle-related Diseases and Their Risk Factors After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident: Results of the Comprehensive Health Check in the Fukushima Health Management Survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Residents were forced to evacuate owing to the radiation released after the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) accident following the Great East Japan Earthquake on 11/03/2021; thus, their lifestyles drastically changed. The Comprehensive Health Check (CHC) of the Fukushima Health Management Survey (FHMS) was performed to evaluate health statuses and prevent lifestyle-related diseases in evacuation area residents. The first part of the CHC survey is a retrospective analysis of pre- and postdisaster data on health check-ups of evacuation area residents. The second part is a cross-sectional, prospective analysis of postdisaster (fiscal year (FY) 2011-2017) data on health check-ups. Subjects were men and women living in 13 municipalities in areas surrounding the NPP in Fukushima Prefecture. Post-disaster (FY 2011-2012) overweight, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, liver dysfunction, hyperuricemia, polycythemia and atrial fibrillation cases increased from the predisaster (FY 2008-2010) levels. This tendency was strongest among residents who were forced to evacuate. Proportion of overweight people remained unchanged, the prevalence of liver dysfunction decreased and the proportion of people with treated hypertension and dyslipidemia increased during FY 2011-2017. Meanwhile, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and mean levels of HbA1c increased. Furthermore, Evacuees showed higher risks of diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney diseases and liver dysfunction than non-evacuees. Therefore, residents in the evacuation area, especially evacuees, are at high risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases; therefore, it is necessary to observe health statuses and implement measures to prevent lifestyle-related diseases.

TI  - Transformational Dialogue and Christian Identity in a Multi-Religious Context: Nigeria in Focus
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dialogue within a multi-religious context presupposes the recognition of the many identities that are involved in mutual encounter and exchange. The understanding, shape or interpretation of each identity plays a critical role in the nature of the dialogical process as well as the outcome of the dialogue itself. This article re-assesses the Christian identity in the dialogue between Christians and Muslims, with a focus on how this plays out in the Nigerian context. It explores how a distinctive African worldview can shape the Christian identity towards an increased relationality, solidarity, and interdependence. Furthermore, the article critically investigates fundamentalist tendencies within Nigerian Christianity, and finally addresses how 'a personalist approach' could foster better intra- and inter-religious encounters in Nigeria in a manner that preserves identity while remaining open towards the other (Christian or religious).

TI  - Epistemological keys in Charles Taylor's approach to understand other cultures, part II
T2  - CINTA DE MOEBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the article is to point out the limitations of scientism to account human experience and to affirm the need to apprehend the human being from a comprehensive perspective, which is the way to a perennial intercultural encounter. For this purpose, Charles Taylor's approach is used. First, the conceptual difference between the "natural sciences" and the "social sciences" is clarified. Secondly, the importance of a hermeneutic methodology in the social sciences is stressed to overcome the double risk of ethnocentrism and the relativistic thesis of cultural incorrigibility. Finally, intercultural dialogue is presented as an appropriate way towards a self-criticism of cultures and a broadened understanding between human beings.

TI  - Uptake of Microplastics in the Wedge Clam <i>Donax trunculus</i>: First Evidence from the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mediterranean Sea is affected by microplastic contamination, and several methods have been developed to investigate the degree of environmental plastic pollution. Among these, the use of bioindicators is strongly suggested, and in particular bivalves are sensitive sentinel organisms of the level of microplastic contamination. The wedge clams Donax trunculus is an important edible species for the Mediterranean, area but only rudimentary knowledge is available about microplastic contamination in this species, and no data are available about this topic in the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the microplastic accumulation in the wedge clam and in different water samples (seawater and purged water) in the Tyrrhenian Coast from September to June. The microplastics found were characterized by color, shape, and polymer type through micro-FTIR. For the first time, the microplastic contamination in wedge clams of the Mediterranean Sea was recorded. In September was recorded the highest concentration of microplastics in wedge clams (0.56 MPs/individual). Only microfiber shapes of different colors and types of polymers were found in both wedge clams and water samples. Polyethylene terephthalate was the most common polymer in wedge clams, while a diversified composition was found in water samples. The most common size both in wedge clams (42.8%) and water samples (>= 50%) was in the range 0.1-1 mm. Our results highlight the presence of microplastics in an edible species widely commercialized in the Mediterranean Basin and the possibility of using this species to assess microplastic pollution.

TI  - Clinical and Economic Impact of COVID-19 on Agricultural Workers, Guatemala
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated clinical and socioeconomic burdens of respiratory disease in banana farm workers in Guatemala. We offered all eligible workers enrollment during June 15December 30, 2020, and annually, then tracked them for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) through self-reporting to study nurses, sentinel surveillance at health posts, and absenteeism. Workers who had ILI submitted nasopharyngeal swab specimens for testing for influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and SARS-CoV-2, then completed surveys at days 0, 7, and 28. Through October 10, 2021, a total of 1,833 workers reported 169 ILIs (12.0 cases/100 person-years), and 43 (25.4%) were laboratory-confirmed infections with SARS-CoV-2 (3.1 cases/100 person-years). Workers who had SARS-CoV-2.positive ILIs reported more frequent anosmia, dysgeusia, difficulty concentrating, and irritability and worse clinical and well-being severity scores than workers who had test result.negative ILIs. Workers who had positive results also had greater absenteeism and lost income. These results support prioritization of farm workers in Guatemala for COVID-19 vaccination.

TI  - High-Resolution Deformation Monitoring from DInSAR: Implications for Geohazards and Ground Stability in the Metropolitan Area of Santiago, Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large urban areas are vulnerable to various geological hazards and anthropogenic activities that affect ground stability-a key factor in structural performance, such as buildings and infrastructure, in an inherently expanding context. Time series data from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites make it possible to identify small rates of motion over large areas of the Earth's surface with high spatial resolution, which is key to detecting high-deformation areas. Santiago de Chile's metropolitan region comprises a large Andean foothills basin in one of the most seismically active subduction zones worldwide. The Santiago basin and its surroundings are prone to megathrust and shallow crustal earthquakes, landslides, and constant anthropogenic effects, such as the overexploitation of groundwater and land use modification, all of which constantly affect the ground stability. Here, we recorded ground deformations in the Santiago basin using a multi-temporal differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) from Sentinel 1, obtaining high-resolution ground motion rates between 2018 and 2021. GNSS stations show a constant regional uplift in the metropolitan area (similar to 10 mm/year); meanwhile, DInSAR allows for the identification of areas with anomalous local subsistence (rates < -15 mm/year) and mountain sectors with landslides with unprecedented detail. Ground deformation patterns vary depending on factors such as soil type, basin geometry, and soil/soil heterogeneities. Thus, the areas with high subsidence rates are concentrated in sectors with fine sedimentary cover and a depressing shallow water table as well as in cropping areas with excess water withdrawal. There is no evidence of detectable movement on the San Ramon Fault (the major quaternary fault in the metropolitan area) over the observational period. Our results highlight the mechanical control of the sediment characteristics of the basin and the impact of anthropogenic processes on ground stability. These results are essential to assess the stability of the Santiago basin and contribute to future infrastructure development and hazard management in highly populated areas.

TI  - Assessment of Future Land Use/Land Cover Scenarios on the Hydrology of a Coastal Basin in South-Central Chile
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change is one of the clearest representations of the global environmental change phenomenon at various spatial and temporal scales. Chile is worldwide recognized to have areas dedicated to non-native forest plantations that specifically in coastal range show high environmental and economic deterioration, questioning the sustainability of the forestry industry. Currently, there are no studies in Chile that reveal the real effects of the LULC change on the water balance at basin or sub-basin scales associated with future scenarios, which might contribute to territorial decision-making and reveal the real magnitude of the effects of these dynamics. In this study, in order to study LULC dynamics in a coastal basin in South-Central Chile, we assessed and analyzed the effects of future LULC change scenarios on the hydrological processes by generating future synthetic land cover maps from Landsat (Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI) image datasets. The hydrological model Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was calibrated and validated, using hydroclimatic time series, to simulate discharges and other hydrological components over those future LULC scenarios. The LULC future scenarios were projected using combined Markov chain analysis (CA-Markov) and cellular automata algorithms for the near (2025), middle (2035) and far (2045) future. The results revealed that the effects on the different components of the water balance of the basin are not as significant except in the soil water transfer in percolation (increase 72.4%) and groundwater flow (increase 72.5%). This trend was especially observed in sub-basins with non-native forest plantations that dominated land cover in the year 2035, in which an increase of 43.6% in percolation and groundwater flows resulted in increased aquifer recharge and water storage, mainly offset by a decrease of 27% in the evapotranspiration. This work demonstrates the importance of evaluating the impacts of the dynamics of LULC on the hydrological response of a coastal basin, and also on how the land use governance and policy are closely linked to that of water resources.

TI  - Assessing the Fragmentation, Canopy Loss and Spatial Distribution of Forest Cover in Kakamega National Forest Reserve, Western Kenya
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kakamega National Forest Reserve is a tropical forest ecosystem at high risk of irreplaceable biodiversity loss due to persistent human-induced pressures. The aim of this paper is to assess the effect of fragmentation and forest cover loss on forest ecosystems in Kakamega National Forest Reserve, with the objectives: (1) to quantify the forest cover loss and analyse fragmentation in the Kakamega forest ecosystem and (2) to analyse the effect of forest cover loss on the spatial distribution of the Kakamega forest ecosystem at different timescales. Hansen global forest change data was used as an input training dataset on the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE) to estimate the area of forest cover loss by aggregating the sum of pixel values, and to provide a time series visualization of forest change by the extent of cover loss using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 7 false colour composites (RBG) in QGIS software. Fragmentation analysis was performed using reclassified forest loss and distribution data from the Hansen product as binary raster input in Guidos software. Total forest cover loss over 20 years was estimated at 826.60 ha. The first decade (2000-2010) accounted for 146.31 ha of forest cover loss, and the second decade (2010-2020) accounted for 680.29 ha of forest cover loss. Forest area density (FAD) analysis depicted an increase in the dominant layer by 8.5% and a 2.5% decrease in the interior layer. Morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) illustrated a change in the core layer of 96% and a 14% increase in the openings class layer. Therefore, this study demonstrates that forest cover loss and landscape pattern alteration changed the dynamics of species interaction within ecological communities. Fragmented habitats adversely affected the ecosystem's ability to recover the loss of endemic species, which are at risk of extinction in the backdrop of climate change. Anthropogenic drivers i.e., the clearing of natural forest and conversion of forest land for non-forest use, have contributed significantly to the loss of forest cover in the study area.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics and Predictive Analysis of Vegetation Cover in the Oueme River Delta in Benin (West Africa)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation cover of the Oueme Delta constitutes a biodiversity hotspot for the wetlands in southern Benin. However, the overexploitation of natural resources in addition to the intensification of agricultural practices led to the degradation of the natural ecosystems in this region. The present work aims to reconstruct, using remote sensing, the spatial dynamics of land use in the Oueme Delta in order to assess the recent changes and predict the trends in its vegetation cover. The methodology was based on remote sensing and GIS techniques. Altogether, this process helped us carry out the classification of Landsat images for a period of 30 years (stating year 1990, 2005, and 2020) via the Envi software. The spatial statistics resulting from this processing were combined using ArcGIS software to establish the transition matrices in order to monitor the conversion rates of the land cover classes obtained. Then, the prediction of the plant landscape by the year 2035 was performed using the "Land Change Modeler" extension available under IDRISI. The results showed seven (07) classes of occupation and land use. There were agglomerations, mosaics of fields and fallow land, water bodies, dense forests, gallery forests, swamp forests, and shrubby wooded savannahs. The observation of the vegetation cover over the period of 15 years from 1990 to 2005 showed a decrease from 71.55% to 63.42% in the surface area of the Oueme Delta. A similar trend was noticed from 2005 to 2020 when it reached 55.19%, entailing a loss of 16.37% of the surface area of natural habitats in 30 years. The two drivers of such changes are the fertility of alluvial soils for agriculture along and urbanization. The predictive modeling developed for 2035 reveals a slight increase in the area of dense forests and shrubby wooded savannas, contrary to the lack of significant decrease in the area of gallery forests and swamp forests. This is key information that is expected to be useful to both policy and decision makers involved in the sustainable management and conservation of natural resources in the study area.

AB  - This article presents the results of a linguistic-cognitive analysis of selected German and Polish terms that indicate medical diseases or disorders, and in addition include elements that refer to animals. The aim of this analysis is to examine the equivalence between the medical terms used in both languages with respect to the linguistic worldview generated by the specific language, and that is symptomatic of its material cultural sphere. On the basis of the analysis the conclusion can be drawn that in most cases of terms indicating medical illnesses or disorders there either is a full or partial equivalence between the Polish and German terms.

TI  - On the conception of an ethnolinguistic mythological dictionary of the Altaians
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the conception of the Mythological Dictionary of the Altaians, the principles of description and thematic classification of mytholexemes. The conception of the mythological dictionary is outlined. The dictionary's development takes into account the specifics of the national worldview. The purpose and objectives of the dictionary are formulated; the material and research methods are characterized; the description and characteristics of the structure of the dictionary and dictionary entry are given; the basic principles of glossary formation are highlighted. The compiled dictionary refers to the linguoculturological explanatory dictionary type. The main principles for choosing mythemes were: (1) complete or partial inconsistency of the mythological significate (the conceptual content of a name or sign) with the referent (an object of extralinguistic reality); (2) mythologism, or the presence in the semantics of the word of a reduced myth; (3) conceptual content that is not limited to the lexical meaning of the word, and the semantics of the mythological concept revealed by its historical, ethnographic, figurative, evaluative components; (4) stability and variability of the mytholexeme in the mythology and folklore of a given ethnic group or area. The identified mytholexemes were classified based on their part-of-speech affiliation, word-formation pattern, and conceptual content. In addition to the mythological vocabulary of the southern Altaians (Altai-Kizhi, Telengits, Teleuts), the dictionary includes the vocabulary of the northern dialect groups (Chalkans, Kumandins, Tubalars).

T2  - TURKISH POLICY QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contradicting political worldviews of the EU and Russia contribute to their conflictual relations much more than the attention currently given to this facet of the relations. Each of their solidarist worldviews creates an ideological wall severing their communication that is essential for possible peaceful solutions. However, shifting toward a pluralist worldview inspired by conceptual tools of the English School and Michael Oakeshott's theory of civil association could be an alternative to the current situation of conflict. Building on this theoretical framework, we also attempt to explain the significance of Turkiye's mediation efforts along the way and present a constructive criticism of today's norms-based international law.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Water Hyacinth Monitoring in the Lower Mondego (Portugal) Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring invasive plant species is a crucial task to assess their presence in affected ecosystems. However, it is a laborious and complex task as it requires vast surface areas, with difficult access, to be surveyed. Remotely sensed data can be a great contribution to such operations, especially for clearly visible and predominant species. In the scope of this study, water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) was monitored in the Lower Mondego region (Portugal). For this purpose, Sentinel-2 satellite data were explored enabling us to follow spatial patterns in three water channels from 2018 to 2021. By applying a straightforward and effective methodology, it was possible to estimate areas that could contain water hyacinth and to obtain the total surface area occupied by this invasive species. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used for this purpose. It was verified that the occupation of this invasive species over the study area exponentially increases from May to October. However, this increase was not verified in 2021, which could be a consequence of the adopted mitigation measures. To provide the results of this study, the methodology was applied through a semi-automatic geographic information system (GIS) application. This tool enables researchers and ecologists to apply the same approach in monitoring water hyacinth or any other invasive plant species in similar or different contexts. This methodology proved to be more effective than machine learning approaches when applied to multispectral data acquired with an unmanned aerial vehicle. In fact, a global accuracy greater than 97% was achieved using the NDVI-based approach, versus 93% when using the machine learning approach (above 93%).

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Distribution Characteristics of Active Fires in China Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the FIRMS MODIS active fire location data in the Chinese mainland from 2001 to 2018, the GIS fishing net (1 km x 1 km) was used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of active fire occurrence probability and intensity, and a GWLR fire risk assessment model was established to explore its influencing factors. The results show that active fires in the Chinese mainland are mainly low intensity. They are mainly distributed in the area where the annual average temperature is 14-19 degrees C, the precipitation is 400-800 mm, the surface temperature is 15-20 degrees C, the altitude is 1000-3000 m, the slope is <15 degrees, and the NDVI value is >0.6. The GWLR fire risk assessment model was constructed to divide mainland China into five fire risk zones. NDVI, temperature, elevation, and slope have significant spatial effects on the occurrence of active fires in the Chinese mainland. Eight fire risk influencing factor areas were divided by calculation, and differentiated fire prevention suggestions are put forward.

TI  - Comparison of Typical Alpine Lake Surface Elevation Variations and Different Driving Forces by Remote Sensing Altimetry Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine lakes play a significant role in improving watershed ecology, adjusting water storage, and managing regional water resources. They are also a valuable freshwater reservoir, flood storage, and species gene pool in Central Asia. This article validated the accuracy of the CryoSat-2 footprints altimetry dataset for the Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul ranges. The time series for the surface elevations of the Central Asian alpine lakes Karakul and Chatyrkul were established, based on footprints altimetry data. The lake hydrological drivers were analyzed using remote sensing meteorological reanalysis data of the lake basins. The following main conclusions were reached. The CryoSat-2 footprints altimetry dataset has high confidence in lake surface elevation monitoring. Compared with Hydroweb monitoring results, the agreement between the monitoring results in the range between Lake Bosten and Lake Issyk-Kul are 0.96 and 0.84. The surface elevation of Lake Karakul shows an overall increasing trend with a variation rate of +7.7 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a positive correlation with the temperature in the basin. This indicates that the increased temperature, which results in the increased snow and ice meltwater in the basin, is the main driving force of the increased lake evolution. The lake surface elevation of Lake Chatyrkul shows an overall decreasing trend, with a variation rate of -9.9 cm/yr from 2010 to 2020, which has a negative correlation with the temperature in the basin. This suggests that Lake Chatyrkul is poorly recharged by snow and ice meltwater. The main driving force of its evolution is the increased evaporative output of the lake due to the increase in temperature. These conclusions prove that temperature and alpine glacial variability within the lake basin play an important role in lake surface elevation variations in alpine regions of Central Asia.

TI  - Assessment of Remote Sensing Ecological Quality by Introducing Water and Air Quality Indicators: A Case Study of Wuhan, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of ecological protection and urban expansion, the quality of the ecological environment and ecological security are gravely at risk. A simple, effective, and comprehensive assessment method for regional environmental quality monitoring is urgently required at this time. This study proposes a comprehensive approach for evaluating regional ecological quality. Based on Landsat TM+OLI/TIRS images, indicators representing the ecological quality of land and water were constructed. Land ecological quality consists of land surface moisture (WET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized building bare soil index (NDBSI), and land surface temperature (LST), which represent humidity, greenness, dryness, and temperature, respectively. At the same time, the remote sensing indices of chlorophyll_a (chl_a) and suspended solids (SS) were constructed to characterize the water quality. Air quality was characterized based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) in MCD19A2. By introducing water and air quality indicators and utilizing principal component analysis, a remote sensing ecological index that improves water area assessment (WIRSEI) was established and applied to Wuhan from 2000 to 2020. The driving force of WIRSEI change was analyzed using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The results revealed that (1) air quality AOD and humidity WET greatly impacted the ecological quality (WIRSEI). WIRSEIs in seven central urban areas were significantly lower than that in six remote urban regions, and the ecological quality of lakes was higher than that of rivers. (2) From 2000 to 2020, Wuhan's overall WIRSEI showed a "rising-falling-rising-stable" trend. In most regions, the degree of ecological quality change was relatively small; most grades were "no change", "slightly better", and "slightly worse", representing 88-93% of the total area. (3) The change in WIRSEI from 2000 to 2020 was closely related to urban expansion, population change, and economic development. The effects of land use and socioeconomic changes on WIRSEI were significantly different in spatial distribution. Compared to the driving factors, land use dynamics (LUCD) significantly impacted WIRSEI changes, while the effects of gross domestic product (GDP) and population (POP) were very small. This study uses WIRSEI to evaluate the regional ecological quality, providing a vital reference and basis for enhancing regional ecological quality assessment methods, promoting ecological environmental protection and restoration, regional coordination, and sustainable development. The research results show that the proposed approach is simple and effective, strongly supporting regional ecological quality and protection monitoring.

TI  - Modeling Permafrost Distribution Using Geoinformatics in the Alaknanda Valley, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian Himalayan region is experiencing frequent hazards and disasters related to permafrost. However, research on permafrost in this region has received very little or no attention. Therefore, it is important to have knowledge about the spatial distribution and state of permafrost in the Indian Himalayas. Modern remote sensing techniques, with the help of a geographic information system (GIS), can assess permafrost at high altitudes, largely over inaccessible mountainous terrains in the Himalayas. To assess the spatial distribution of permafrost in the Alaknanda Valley of the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand state, 198 rock glaciers were mapped (183 active and 15 relict) using high-resolution satellite data available in the Google Earth database. A logistic regression model (LRM) was used to identify a relationship between the presence of permafrost at the rock glacier sites and the predictor variables, i.e., the mean annual air temperature (MAAT), the potential incoming solar radiation (PISR) during the snow-free months, and the aspect near the margins of rock glaciers. Two other LRMs were also developed using moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived land surface temperature (LST) and snow cover products. The MAAT-based model produced the best results, with a classification accuracy of 92.4%, followed by the snow-cover-based model (91.9%), with the LST-based model being the least accurate (82.4%). All three models were developed to compare their accuracy in predicting permafrost distribution. The results from the MAAT-based model were validated with the global permafrost zonation index (PZI) map, which showed no significant differences. However, the predicted model exhibited an underestimation of the area underlain by permafrost in the region compared to the PZI. Identifying the spatial distribution of permafrost will help us to better understand the impact of climate change on permafrost and its related hazards and provide necessary information to decision makers to mitigate permafrost-related disasters in the high mountain regions.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Estimating Forest Carbon Density Using the Tree Species Classification Method
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and effective estimation of forest carbon density is an essential basis for effectively responding to climate change and achieving the goal of carbon neutrality. Aiming at the problem of the significant differences in the forest carbon model parameters of different tree species, this study used the tree forest in Yueyang City, Hunan Province, China, as the study object and used the random forest classification algorithm through the Google Earth Engine platform to classify the dominant tree species within the forested range of the study area based on the image elements. The overall accuracy in the forest/non-forest classification (primary classification) was 93.79% with a Kappa of 0.9145. The overall accuracy in the dominant species classification (secondary classification) was 87.30% with a Kappa of 0.7747. Based on the classification, a multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF) were constructed for different dominant tree species by combining some Forest Resource Inventory data and remote sensing data. The results showed that the RF model had a significantly higher coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.4054-0.7602) than the MLR (R-2 = 0.0900-0.4070) and SVM (R-2 = 0.1650-0.4450) as well as a substantially lower RMSE and MAE; its spatial distribution of forest carbon density ranged from 3.06 to 62.80 t center dot hm(-2). Compared with the spatial distribution of the forest carbon density (4.64 to 31.96 t center dot hm(-2)) without the classification of dominant species, the method eliminated the problems of severe overfitting and significant underestimation of peak values when estimating under unclassified conditions. The method provides a reference for the remote sensing inversion of forest carbon density on a large scale.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of <i>Escherichia coli</i> with Resistance against Third-Generation Cephalosporines Isolated from Deployed German Soldiers-A Retrospective Assessment after Deployments to the African Sahel Region and Other Sites between 2007 and 2016
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Colonization and infection with bacteria with acquired antibiotic resistance are among the risks for soldiers on international deployments. Enterobacterales with resistance against third-generation cephalosporines are amongst the most frequently imported microorganisms. To contribute to the scarcely available epidemiological knowledge on deployment-associated resistance migration, we assessed the molecular epidemiology of third-generation cephalosporine-resistant Escherichia coli isolated between 2007 and 2016 from German soldiers after deployments, with a particular focus on the African Sahel region. A total of 51 third-generation cephalosporine-resistant E. coli isolated from 51 military returnees from deployment collected during the assessment period between 2007 and 2016 were subjected to short-read next-generation sequencing analysis. Returnees from the Sahel region (Djibouti, Mali, South Sudan, Sudan, Sudan, and Uganda) comprised a proportion of 52.9% (27/51). Repeatedly isolated sequence types according to the Warwick University scheme from returnees from the Sahel region were ST38, ST131, and ST648, confirming previous epidemiological assessments from various sub-Saharan African regions. Locally prevalent resistance genes in isolates from returnees from the Sahel region associated with third-generation resistance were bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-1), bla(TEM-169), bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-99)-like, bla(CTX-M-125), bla(SHV-12), and bla(DHA-1), while virulence genes were east1, sat, and tsh in declining order of frequency of occurrence each. In line with phenotypically observed high resistance rates for aminoglycosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, multiple associated resistance genes were observed. A similar, slightly more diverse situation was recorded for the other deployment sites. In summary, this assessment provides first next-generation sequencing-based epidemiological data on third-generation cephalosporine-resistant E. coli imported by deployed German soldiers with a particular focus on deployments to the Sahel region, thus serving as a small sentinel. The detected sequence types are well in line with the results from previous epidemiological assessments in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI  - Assessment of Autumn Migration Conditions of the Black Sea European Anchovy to the Shores of Crimea in 2019 and 2020 according to Satellite Data
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of the analysis of spatial and temporal variability of the circulation elements and the surface-temperature field of the waters of the northwestern part of the Black Sea during the autumn migration of the Black Sea European anchovy in 2019 and 2020. The Black Sea European anchovy, being the main fishery object of the Black Sea countries, very rarely comes for wintering and is caught by Russian fishermen off the coast of Crimea. The 2019/2020 fishing season of this species was the most successful in the modern history of the Black Sea European anchovy fishing off the Crimean coast. The analysis of the main abiotic factors determining the nature of European anchovy migration in the northwestern part of the sea to the shores of Crimea shows that its mass occurrence on the Crimean shelf is primarily facilitated by the formation of the eastern current in the south of the northwestern part of the Black Sea in November and December and the increased December thermal background of surface waters outside the shelf of this part of the sea. Strengthening of the eastern currents leads to the movement of the European anchovy to the shelf, and the western direction of the surface-water temperature gradient increases the density of its commercial accumulations on the southwestern shelf of Crimea. The performed studies are of scientific interest and determine the necessity of regular monitoring of European anchovy migration conditions using information from satellites for forecasting the possibilities of its fishing off the coast of Crimea.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Detection of Floating Marine Litter Targets with Partial Spectral Unmixing and Spectral Comparison with Other Floating Materials (Plastic Litter Project 2021)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-area, artificial floating marine litter (FML) targets were deployed during a controlled field experiment and data acquisition campaign: the Plastic Litter Project 2021. A set of 22 Sentinel-2 images, along with UAS data and ancillary measurements were acquired. Spectral analysis of the FML and natural debris (wooden planks) targets was performed, along with spectral comparison and separability analysis between FML and other floating materials such as marine mucilage and pollen. The effects of biofouling and submersion on the spectral signal of FML were also investigated under realistic field conditions. Detection of FML is performed through a partial unmixing methodology. Floating substances such as pollen exhibit similar spectral characteristics to FML, and are difficult to differentiate. Biofouling is shown to affect the magnitude and shape of the FML signal mainly in the RGB bands, with less significant effect on the infrared part of the spectrum. Submersion affects the FML signal throughout the range of the Sentinel-2 satellite, with the most significant effect in the NIR part of the spectrum. Sentinel-2 detection of FML can be successfully performed through a partial unmixing methodology for FML concentrations with abundance fractions of 20%, under reasonable conditions.

TI  - Forest Damage by Extra-Tropical Cyclone Klaus-Modeling and Prediction
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Windstorms may have negative consequences on forest ecosystems, industries, and societies. Extreme events related to extra-tropical cyclonic systems remind us that better recognition and understanding of the factors driving forest damage are needed for more efficient risk management and planning. In the present study, we statistically modelled forest damage caused by the windstorm Klaus in south-west France. This event occurred on 24 January 2009 and caused severe damage to maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) forest stands. We aimed at isolating the best potential predictors that can help to build better predictive models of forest damage. We applied the random forest (RF) technique to find the best classifiers of the forest damage binary response variable. Five-fold spatial block cross-validation, repeated five times, and forward feature selection (FFS) were applied to the control for model over-fitting. In addition, variable importance (VI) and accumulated local effect (ALE) plots were used as model performance metrics. The best RF model was used for spatial prediction and forest damage probability mapping. The ROC AUC of the best RF model was 0.895 and 0.899 for the training and test set, respectively, while the accuracy of the RF model was 0.820 for the training and 0.837 for the test set. The FFS allowed us to isolate the most important predictors, which were the distance from the windstorm trajectory, soil sand fraction content, the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the wind exposure index (WEI). In general, their influence on the forest damage probability was positive for a wide range of the observed values. The area of applicability (AOA) confirmed that the RF model can be used to construct a probability map for almost the entire study area.

TI  - Peculiarities of Vocal art in the Context of Postmodernism as a Factor of Cultural Value
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article interprets the formation of personal value orientations in the context of the artistic perception of the world. Personality is formed in the process of socialization and self-realization. Every person in the world is an individual, and individuality is formed in the process of acquiring value orientations, as well as in the conditions of cultural and educational development. Thus, an individual perceives the world and the environment in own way. His or her idea is a consequence of the value perception of the world, which arose as a result of certain life experience and educational activitiy. Human has a value attitude to oneself, to people, to art, to work, to society and state, and such an attitude is formed individually for everyone, but on equal conditions. After all, each individual has own characteristics, own worldview, dreams, and ideas. The perception of art is phenomenological in the formation of value orientations of human. After all, works of art are already a consequence of a certain value representation of a creator, which is interpreted through the work of art. In the course of our research the integration method of synthesis and the analysis of figurative structure, and, the characteristic of works of art are used. The methods of synthesis, analysis and interpretation contribute to the scientific perception of works of art that influence the formation of human values to culture. The results of our study reveal that in general, value attitude are formed throughout a person's life.

TI  - Assessing Crop Water Requirement and Yield by Combining ERA5-Land Reanalysis Data with CM-SAF Satellite-Based Radiation Data and Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread development of Earth Observation (EO) systems and advances in numerical atmospheric modeling have made it possible to use the newest data sources as input for crop-water balance models, thereby improving the crop water requirements (CWR) and yield estimates from the field to the regional scale. Satellite imagery and numerical weather prediction outputs offer high resolution (in time and space) gridded data that can compensate for the paucity of crop parameter field measurements and ground weather observations, as required for assessments of CWR and yield. In this study, the AquaCrop model was used to assess CWR and yield of tomato on a farm in Southern Italy by assimilating Sentinel-2 (S2) canopy cover imagery and using CM-SAF satellite-based radiation data and ERA5-Land reanalysis as forcing weather data. The prediction accuracy was evaluated with field data collected during the irrigation season (April-July) of 2021. Satellite estimates of canopy cover differed from ground observations, with a RMSE of about 11%. CWR and yield predictions were compared with actual data regarding irrigation volumes and harvested yield. The results showed that S2 estimates of crop parameters represent added value, since their assimilation into crop growth models improved CWR and yield estimates. Reliable CWR and yield estimates can be achieved by combining the ERA5-Land and CM-SAF weather databases with S2 imagery for assimilation into the AquaCrop model.

TI  - A 3D Space-Time Non-Local Mean Filter (NLMF) for Land Changes Retrieval with Synthetic Aperture Radar Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sequences of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are routinely used for land-use land-change (LULC) applications, allowing the retrieval of accurate and up-to-date information on the state of the Earth's surface and its temporal variations. Change detection (CD) methods that rely on the exploitation of SAR data are, generally, made of three distinctive steps: (1) pre-processing of the SAR images; (2) comparison of the pairs of SAR images; and (3) the automatic extraction of the "changed areas", employing proper thresholding algorithms. Within this general framework, the reduction in speckle noise effects, which can be obtained by applying spatial multi-looking operations and ad hoc noise filters, is fundamental for the better detecting and classifying of changed regions. Usually, speckle noise filters are singularly and independently applied to every SAR image without the consideration of their inherent temporal relationships. In particular, most use local (spatial) approaches based on determining and averaging SAR backscattered signals related to neighboring SAR pixels. In this work, conversely, we explore the potential of a joint 3D space-time non-local mean filter (NLMF), which relies on the discrimination of similar features in a block of non-local SAR pixels extracted from the same or different SAR images. The theory behind non-local-mean filters is, first, shortly revised. Then, the developed space-time NLMF is applied to a real test case for the purposes of identifying flooded zones due to the massive inundations that hit the Kerala region, India, during the summer of 2018. To this aim, a set of 18 descending SAR images collected from the European (EU) Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S-1) sensor was exploited. The performance of the developed NLMF has also been assessed. It is worth remarking that the proposed method can be applied for the purposes of analyzing a heterogenous set of natural and/or artificial disastrous conditions. Further, it can also be helpful during the pre-processing stages of the sequences of SAR images for the purposes of CD applications.

TI  - A Single Image Deep Learning Approach to Restoration of Corrupted Landsat-7 Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is increasingly recognized as a convenient tool with a wide variety of uses in agriculture. Landsat-7 has supplied multi-spectral imagery of the Earth's surface for more than 4 years and has become an important data source for a large number of research and policy-making initiatives. Unfortunately, a scan line corrector (SLC) on Landsat-7 broke down in May 2003, which caused the loss of up to 22 percent of any given scene. We present a single-image approach based on leveraging the abilities of the deep image prior method to fill in gaps using only the corrupt image. We test the ability of deep image prior to reconstruct remote sensing scenes with different levels of corruption in them. Additionally, we compare the performance of our approach with the performance of classical single-image gap-filling methods. We demonstrate a quantitative advantage of the proposed approach compared with classical gap-filling methods. The lowest-performing restoration made by the deep image prior approach reaches 0.812 in r(2), while the best value for the classical approaches is 0.685. We also present the robustness of deep image prior in comparing the influence of the number of corrupted pixels on the restoration results. The usage of this approach could expand the possibilities for a wide variety of agricultural studies and applications.

TI  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service: From Research to Operations
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), part of the European Union's Earth observation program Copernicus, entered operations in July 2015. Implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) as a truly European effort with over 23,500 direct data users and well over 200 million end users worldwide as of March 2022, CAMS delivers numerous global and regional information products about air quality, inventory-based emissions and observation-based surface fluxes of greenhouse gases and from biomass burning, solar energy, ozone and UV radiation, and climate forcings. Access to CAMS products is open and free of charge via the Atmosphere Data Store. The CAMS global atmospheric composition analyses, forecasts, and reanalyses build on ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) and exploit over 90 different satellite data streams. The global products are complemented by coherent higher-resolution regional air quality products over Europe derived from multisystem analyses and forecasts. CAMS information products also include policy support such as quantitative impact assessment of short- and long-term pollutant-emission mitigation scenarios, source apportionment information, and annual European air quality assessment reports. Relevant CAMS products are cited and used for instance in IPCC Assessment Reports. Providing dedicated support for users operating smartphone applications, websites, or TV bulletins in Europe and worldwide is also integral to the service. This paper presents key achievements of the CAMS initial phase (2014-21) and outlines some of its new components for the second phase (2021-28), e.g., the new Copernicus anthropogenic CO2 emissions Monitoring and Verification Support capacity that will monitor global anthropogenic emissions of key greenhouse gases.

TI  - Forests for forests: combining vegetation indices with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in random forest models improves gross primary productivity prediction in the boreal forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a powerful tool for understanding and scaling measurements of plant carbon uptake via photosynthesis, gross primary productivity (GPP), across space and time. The success of remote sensing measurements can be attributed to their ability to capture valuable information on plant structure (physical) and function (physiological), both of which impact GPP. However, no single remote sensing measure provides a universal constraint on GPP and the relationships between remote sensing measurements and GPP are often site specific, thereby limiting broader usefulness and neglecting important nuances in these signals. Improvements must be made in how we connect remotely sensed measurements to GPP, particularly in boreal ecosystems which have been traditionally challenging to study with remote sensing. In this paper we improve GPP prediction by using random forest models as a quantitative framework that incorporates physical and physiological information provided by solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) and vegetation indices (VIs). We analyze 2.5 years of tower-based remote sensing data (SIF and VIs) across two field locations at the northern and southern ends of the North American boreal forest. We find (a) remotely sensed products contain information relevant for understanding GPP dynamics, (b) random forest models capture quantitative SIF, GPP, and light availability relationships, and (c) combining SIF and VIs in a random forest model outperforms traditional parameterizations of GPP based on SIF alone. Our new method for predicting GPP based on SIF and VIs improves our ability to quantify terrestrial carbon exchange in boreal ecosystems and has the potential for applications in other biomes.

TI  - High Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness and Absence of Increased Influenza-like-Illness Epidemic Activity in the 2021-2022 Influenza Season in Catalonia (Spain) Based on Surveillance Data Collected by Sentinel Pharmacies
T2  - VACCINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza surveillance and influenza vaccination are the key activities for preventing and controlling influenza epidemics. The study assessed the influenza surveillance and influenza vaccination data obtained from sentinel pharmacies of Catalonia, Spain, in the 2021-2022 influenza season. The sentinel pharmacies were selected from all community pharmacies to report all influenza-like illness (ILI) cases detected during the 2021-2022 influenza season and collect influenza surveillance and influenza vaccination data. The ILI cases were identified based on European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) criteria. The moving epidemic method (MEM) was used to assess the ILI epidemic activity. The screening method was used to assess influenza vaccination effectiveness in patients aged 65-or-more years old. The sentinel pharmacies reported 212 ILI cases with a negative COVID-19 test and a total number of 412 ILI cases. An absence of increased ILI epidemic activity was observed in the 2021-2022 influenza season based on two criteria: (1) Number of ILI cases reported per week in the 2021-2022 influenza season significantly lower than the MEM-based epidemic threshold. (2) Mean number of ILI cases reported per week in the 2021-2022 influenza season significantly lower than during the ILI/influenza epidemic periods detected from 2017 to 2020 using the same methodology. Influenza vaccination was effective in preventing ILI among patients aged 65-or-more-years old. The absence of the influenza epidemic during the 2021-2022 influenza season could be explained by influenza vaccination and COVID-19 prevention measures (wearing face masks, social distancing). The sentinel pharmacies provided influenza surveillance data not provided by traditional influenza surveillance systems.

TI  - Innovative Technologies in Physical Education: Adapting to a Postmodern Society
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights innovative technologies in the context of physical education as one of the main factors of postmodern society. The main features of innovative technologies as an effective way to develop personal competencies and the formation of value orientations are defined in the context of the study. Physical education contributes to the development of individual personality traits, as well as forming the health-saving foundations of the development of society in the perspective of evolution. Among current approaches in the methodology of competence formation and its transformation the most important are innovative activities. Innovation is the result of implementing new ideas for the purpose of further practical use to meet any needs of society. In the sphere of physical education innovation is a natural phenomenon, as in many other industries. Innovations do not arise by their own efforts; they are the result of applying the best pedagogical experience and scientific search. The relevance of the study is determined by the need for effective formation of physical health of the individual in the period of postmodern information society. This article analyzes today's innovative technologies in the field of physical education and implementation in the public process. The theoretical and methodological foundations of the concept of postmodern society and innovative technologies were analyzed in the course of the study. The article explores the peculiarities of the use of innovative technologies in the aspect of physical education.

TI  - Coherence of Fluctuations of Components of the Global Climate System with Slow Fluctuations of Solar Activity according to Ground-Based and Satellite Observations
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of extensive data from remote sensing of the atmosphere, the ocean, and the cryosphere has opened up new opportunities for studying the causes and mechanisms of natural climate fluctuations. Slow climatic fluctuations in the water temperature of the surface oceanic layer and for ocean depths up to 700 m in the Northern Hemisphere have been identified and studied as a response to the corresponding modulations of solar activity. It is shown that, taking into account the nonstationary nature of the climatic series, the most appropriate method of analysis is the calculation of wavelet and wavelet cross spectra. It is found that the maxima of 11-year solar cycles are subject to long-term modulations with a wide spectrum of quasi-periodicities, in which the intervals of 60- to 80-year-long, as well as quasi-century and quasi-two-century fluctuations, are distinguished. These fluctuations are also translated into corresponding oscillations of the global surface-air temperature (SAT) and outgoing longwave radiation fluxes. Long-term modulations with a quasi-period of 60-80 years, which we call, following preceding researchers, the fundamental climatic oscillation (FCO), pass further within the climate system into the detected fluctuations in the area of ice and snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere, obtained exclusively from remote sensing data, with maintaining the quasi-periodicities specified by fluctuations in solar activity. It is shown that, in turn, the FCO is repeated in the series of satellite data of altimetric measurements of the World Ocean level. Moreover, the increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is also affected by modulations of solar activity, which is probably due to the forced fluctuations in the temperature of the waters of the ocean, which is the main container of carbon and CO2. Thus, if it is said about natural climate fluctuations of the half-century, secular, and two-century scales, it can be said about the coherence of these fluctuations, on the one hand, and solar activity oscillations, as an external disturbing factor, on the other.

TI  - Spit and inlet dynamics, beach morphology, and sediment characteristics along shore front of Chilika lagoon, East coast of India
T2  - GEO-MARINE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Beach morphology and sediment characteristics were investigated on a seasonal scale (January, May, and September 2013) along the shorefront of Chilika lagoon. Shorefront of Chilika lagoon covers 65 km and includes barrier spit and the inlet region (three spits: south, middle, and north). Dynamics of the inlets during pre (1973-1999) and post (2000-2020) hydrological intervention period were studied based on time series satellite data. Seasonal and inter-annual spit dynamics (2009-2020) were investigated based on observed data. Results indicate depositional environment on the barrier spit and south spit while erosional environment on the middle and north spit. After the hydrological intervention period (2000-2020), the south spit enhanced by 5.37 km, resulting in northward migration of the Sipakuda inlet, while the morphological changes of the middle and the north spit were observed considerable both in spatiotemporal scale. The variability of the middle and north spit is attributed to their position on the downdrift side of the inlet leading to short supply of sediments. As a result, the width and elevation of the middle and north spit significantly decreased. Depositional environment of the barrier and south spit can be attributed to their sediment characteristics which are predominantly fine and medium. On the other hand, the erosional environment of the middle and north spit are attributed to the prevalence of coarse sediments. Significant variability in inlet position and morphology along with vulnerability of the middle and north spit are matters of concern for the lagoon environment. Therefore, the study suggests that limiting the northward growth of south spit and adopting measures to control erosion at middle and north spit as two management interventions to restore the stability along the shorefront of Chilika lagoon.

TI  - Wetland Vulnerability Metrics as a Rapid Indicator in Identifying Nature-Based Solutions to Mitigate Coastal Flooding
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood mitigation in low-gradient, tidally-influenced, and rapidly urbanizing coastal locations remains a priority across a range of stakeholders and communities. Wetland ecosystems act as a natural flood buffer for coastal storms and sea level rise (SLR) while simultaneously providing invaluable benefits to urban dwellers. Assessing the vulnerability of wetlands to flood exposure under different SLR scenarios and vegetation responses to climatic variability over time allows for management actions, such as nature-based solutions, to be implemented to preserve wetland ecosystems and the services they provide. Nature-based solutions (NBSs) are a type of green infrastructure that can contribute to flood mitigation through the management and restoration of the ecosystems that provide socio-environmental benefits. However, identifying the flood mitigation potential provided by wetlands and the suitability for NBS implementation depends on the ecological condition and environmental exposure. We propose that wetland vulnerability assessments can be used as a rapid method to quantify changes in ecosystem dynamics and flood exposure and to prioritize potential locations of NBSs implementation. We quantified exposure risk using 100- and 500-year special flood hazard areas, 1-10 ft of sea level rise scenarios, and high-tide flooding and sensitivity using timeseries analyses of Landsat 8-derived multispectral indices as proxies for wetland conditions at subwatershed scales. We posit that wetland areas that are both highly vulnerable to recurrent flooding and degrading over time would make good candidate locations for NBS prioritization, especially when they co-occur on or adjacently to government-owned parcels. In collaboration with local governmental agencies responsible for flood mitigation in the coastal sub-watersheds of the City of New Bern and New Hanover County, North Carolina, we conducted field verification campaigns and leveraged local expert knowledge to identify optimal NBS priority areas. Our results identified several government-owned parcels containing highly vulnerable wetland areas that can be ranked and prioritized for potential NBS implementation. Depending on the biophysical characteristics of the area, NBS candidate wetland types include brackish and freshwater marshes and riverine swamp forests, even though the predominant wetland types by area are managed loblolly pinelands. This study underscores the critical importance of conserving or restoring marshes and swamp forests and provides a transferable framework for conducting scale-invariant assessments of coastal wetland condition and flood exposure as a rapid method of identifying potential priority areas for nature-based solutions to mitigate coastal flooding.

TI  - The Use of Multi-Temporal High-Resolution Satellite Images to Soil Salinity Assessment of the Solonetzic Complex (Republic of Kalmykia)
T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote assessment of soil salinity in natural solonetzic complexes, which are characterized by subsurface salinization of soils, is a difficult task. However, research in this area is promising, since salinity is a clear limiting factor that influences vegetation growth; thus, it affects the spectral characteristics of vegetation. This study carried out an analysis of multi-temporal high-resolution space images, which consisted of comparison with detailed ground-based data on soil salinity using the principal component method and multiple linear regression. Images from the QuickBird (2007) and SuperView-1 (2021) spacecraft with a spatial resolution of 2 m were used as remote sensing data. Ground studies were carried out in 2011 and 2021. Soil salinity was estimated from the specific electrical conductivity (EC) in an aqueous suspension of 1 : 5. It was found that there were no significant changes in soil salinity in the key area over the 10-year period; however, there were changes in the state of vegetation, which are reflected on the maps of the NDVI vegetation index. Multi-temporal high-resolution satellite images were used as a basis to calculate the principal components; it was concluded that the first three components explained almost 97% of the entire image variance. Models built using multiple linear regression analysis describe soil salinity well (R (2) of the model is 0.68, 0.77, 0.83 for the 0-30, 0-50, 0-100 cm layers, respectively). When tested on a control sample, the constructed models based on remote data showed good convergence (R (2) between the predicted and real values of EC is 0.70, 0.87, 0.83 for the 0-30, 0-50, 0-100 cm layers, respectively). The proposed models will be useful for assessing the salinization of soils in the solonetzic complex in the south of the steppe zone according to high-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - Ecological risk changes and their relationship with exposed surface fraction in the karst region of southern China from 1990 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to anthropogenic disturbances, the karst region in southern China is vulnerable to ecological problems such as soil erosion and surface exposure. However, limited studies on variations in large-scale ecological risk (ER) and their influencing factors, particularly the coupling/decoupling relationship with an exposed surface fraction (ESF), make ER regulations and ecological restoration challenging. The present study evaluates the ER of eight typical karst provinces in Southern China from 1990 to 2020 using the technique for order preference by sim-ilarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) model and ecosystem services (habitat quality, water yield, carbon storage, soil conservation, and food production), and extracts the contemporaneous ESF using Landsat satellite data in Google Earth Engine (GEE). The spatiotemporal change of ER and ESF are analyzed, and their coupling/ decoupling relationship and driving mechanism are explored using coupling coordination degree (CCD) and multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models. The results show that: (1) Over the past 30 years, the ER has increased until 2010 and subsequently declined, with an increasing mean value (0.463-0.503), except in Chongqing municipality. The ESF decreased significantly (the mean value dropped from 44.7% to 38.7%), except that in Sichuan province. (2) The average CCD between ER and ESF decreased with fluctuation of-0.017, with a decoupling relationship (58.18%). The coupling area is larger than the decoupling area in the Sichuan area, while other provinces are opposite. (3) The coupling/decoupling relationship in the study area is mainly driven by terrain (elevation, slope) and socio-economic (population density, per capita GDP) factors. More attention should be paid to the role of these factors in the continuous reduction and control of ESF and ER. This study can serve as a reference for similar studies in karst regions, such as risk assessment and surface monitoring, rocky desertification control, ecological engineering layout, and territorial planning.

TI  - EXPRESIONES LITERARIAS SOBRE LA PANDEMIA POR COVID-19: IRRUPCIONES DE LA OTREDAD EN "THE WUHAN I KNOW" (LAURA GAO) Y "YOU CLAP FOR ME NOW" (DARREN SMITH)
T2  - ATENEA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the unfolding of the COVID-19 pandemic, literature becomes one of the many forms of agency to re-signify the emerging worldview that arose as a result of the pandemic mega-crisis. The crisis uncovered profound changes in human and social interactions, among them, the processes of oppression and segregation towards im-migrants and ethnic minorities were accentuated. Based on the relationship between otherness/pandemic, this paper proposes the analysis of two texts: "You Clap for Me Now", a poem by Darren Smith, and "The Wuhan I know", a graphic memoir by Laura Gao. We hypothesize that in both texts, the condition of being other emerges as part of the complex web of the pandemic crisis, revealing the tension between the enduring dichotomy of modernity "self and otherness". We conclude that "The Wuhan I know" humanizes and constructs an identitary dimension of Wuhan, countering the racist rhetoric of the dominant regimes of representation that emerged during the pandemic. "You Clap for Me Now" creates a social frame in which the figure of the immigrant is deconstructed from a shared metaphorical platform with the pandemic virus.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Single-Scattering Albedo from MODIS Data Using an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) is one of the largest sources of uncertainty in the evaluation of the aerosol radiative forcing effect. The SSA signal, coupled with aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface reflectance in satellite images, is difficult to retrieve by the look-up table approach. In this study, we proposed an artificial neural network- (ANN) based approach that retrieves SSA over land based on MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) visible (red band) reflectance variations among nearby pixels that have different surface reflectivities. Using the training dataset generated by the radiative transfer model, the ANN model was trained to establish the relationship among SSA, surface reflectance, and top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. Then, based on the trained ANN model, SSA can be retrieved using the surface and apparent reflectance of several heterogeneous pixels. According to sensitivity analysis, this method works well on nonuniform land surfaces with high AODs. The root mean square error (RMSE) of retrieved and measured SSA (from 28 sites of AErosol RObotic NETwork, AERONET) was 0.042, of which the results with an error less than 0.03 accounted for 51%. In addition, the SSA retrieval method was applied to several thick aerosol layer events over different areas (South Asia, South America, and North China Plain) and compared with the ozone monitoring instrument near-UV aerosol data product (OMAERUV). The comparison results of the images show that the retrieval method of visible wavelength proposed in this study has similar outcomes to those from the ultraviolet wavelengths in these regions. The retrieval algorithm we propose provides an effective way to produce an SSA product in visible wavelength and might help to better estimate the aerosol radiative and optical properties over high heterogeneous areas, which is important for the aerosol radiative impact estimate at a regional scale.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics of Chlorophyll-a Concentration and Its Response to Human and Natural Factors in Lake Taihu Based on MODIS Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a plays an essential biochemical role in the eutrophication process, and is widely considered an important water quality indicator for assessing human activity's effects on aquatic ecosystems. Herein, 20 years of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns and trends of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) in the eutrophic Lake Taihu, based on a new empirical model. The validated results suggested that our developed model presented appreciable performance in estimating Chla, with a root mean square error (MAPE) of 12.95 mu g/L and mean absolute percentage error (RMSE) of 29.98%. Long-term MODIS observations suggested that the Chla of Lake Taihu experienced an overall increasing trend and significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity during 2002-2021. A driving factor analysis indicated that precipitation and air temperature had a significant impact on the monthly dynamics of Chla, while chemical fertilizer consumption, municipal wastewater, industrial sewage, precipitation, and air temperature were important driving factors and together explained more than 81% of the long-term dynamics of Chla. This study provides a 20 year recorded dataset of Chla for inland waters, offering new insights for future precise eutrophication control and efficient water resource management.

TI  - Exploring the spatiotemporal variation characteristics and influencing factors of gully agricultural production transformation in the Chinese Loess Plateau: A case study of loess hilly and gully region in Yan'an City
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the variation characteristics and influencing factors of gully agricultural production transformation (GAPT) in the Loess Plateau (LP) can provide scientific reference for the evolution of rural human-environment relationship and agricultural multi-functional development in the context of green high-quality development. In this paper, Taking Yan'an City of loess hilly and gully region (LHGR) as the study area, 30m resolution Landsat TM/OLI data in the year of 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2018 were selected, and kernel density estimation and geographic detector model were used to analyzes the process of GAPT, and to explore the driving force of GAPT in the LP and its spatial-temporal differentiation pattern. The results show that: (1) In the past 20 years, the gully agricultural production in the Yan'an LHGR has shown a divergent distribution and phased expansion, and the overall trend of fluctuating shrinkage. The gully agricultural production transformation center of gravity in the study area has shifted from the middle-altitude to the low-altitude area. (2) The gully agricultural production in the study area is transforming to agglomeration at small spatial scales. GAPT mostly occurs in the water supply belts near river waters, and in the area close to roads and areas near rural settlements which are closely related to human activities. (3) The process of GAPT mainly driven by socio-economic factors and policy factors, and it presents three evolution characteristics: contiguous distribution of traditional agricultural production, trans-formation of modern gully agricultural production functions, and modern agricultural and tourism multi-functional three-industry integration. The essence is the functional transformation of gully agricultural land. (4) GAPT in the LP is driven by many factors. Behavior subjects at different levels would promote the GAPT in different directions under the background of major national and regional development policies. The research results can provide scientific reference for crop planting mode adjustment, sustainable land use management, and the similar regional agriculture green transformation, thus supporting the realization of the strategic ob-jectives of high-quality agricultural development and rural revitalization in the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - New features of media imperialism: The South African online media and the coverage of the Ukrainian war
T2  - COMMUNICARE-JOURNAL FOR COMMUNICATION SCIENCES IN SOUTHERN AFRICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The coverage of the war in Ukraine has unravelled inherent biases within the South African online commercial media. These biases are largely driven by its location within the global capitalist power structures, thus confirming continuities of media imperialism. By relying on Western sources, this media invariably exports Western norms, standards, hegemonic narrative and worldview. This paper employs content analysis to examine the coverage of the war by five South African online publications (News24, IOL, TimesLive, Citizen.co.za and BusinessTech) between January and February 2022. The coverage was largely negative because of concerns about the impact on global markets. The West's dominant views are discernible due to the chosen sources, with over 80 per cent coming from its newswires. Similarly, the opinions of Western political and business leaders and their business and economic analysts are prevalent. While it is expected for stories to be framed from a conflict perspective, it is the economic consequences frame that also drives the coverage, with Russia blamed, as reflected in the predominant theme "Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine". While there have been fundamental developments since the concept of media imperialism emerged, this coverage points to some continuities. It is precisely for this reason that the South African media should develop partnership beyond the West, more so, in the context of the growing importance of BRICS.

TI  - X-Band Radar System to Detect Bathymetric Changes at River Mouths during Storm Surges: A Case Study of the Arno River
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm surges are natural events that influence the dispersion of sediment along coasts, leading to sudden morphological changes in the seabed. From this perspective, we focused our study on the analysis of measurements from a mobile X-band radar system to survey the sea state and the changes in the seabed depth during storm surges. This analysis was supported by additional information from Sentinel 2 satellite images, the Gorgona wave buoy, the San Giovanni alla Vena hydrometric station, and an echosounder survey. The survey period was from 26 to 28 February and 3 March 2020. During these days, the simultaneous occurrence of a storm surge and flooding of the Arno River was monitored. The analysis of the marine X-band radar mobile images determined the formation and dismantling of seabed shapes. An elongated shoal and a bar-like shape are visible on the right side of the Arno River in the radar image of 26 February and at the Arno mouth on that of 28 February, respectively. The radar image of 3 March shows, near the mouth of the Arno, a delta shape probably due to the deposition of sediment favoured by the interaction between the river flow and storm waves. X-band coastal radar is a detection system that improves the effectiveness and reliability of coastal monitoring because it has a high temporal and spatial resolution. It can be considered a valuable warning system to monitor the sea-bed depth changes in strategic sites, such as harbour areas, during sea storms. Moreover, this system, together with a satellite observing system, is a valid tool for shedding light on the environmental drivers that reshape coastal areas.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Wind Energy in the Caspian Sea: An Ecosystem Service Modeling Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecosystem services that can be obtained from the oceans and seas are very diverse; one of the sources of energy is wind power. The Caspian Sea is characterized by a fragile ecosystem that is under serious anthropogenic stress, including oil and gas production and transportation. In particular, rich oil and gas resources in the region make renewables less important for the Caspian Sea Region. Depletion of hydrocarbon resources, a rise of their price on the international markets, geopolitical tensions, a decrease in the Caspian Sea level, regional climate change, and other factors make exploring offshore wind energy production timely. In order to model the offshore wind energy of the Caspian Sea, data from the ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalysis were used from 1980 to 2015 combined with QuikSCAT and RapidSCAT remote sensing data. The modeling results showed a wind power density of 173 W/m(2) as an average value for the Caspian Sea. For the 1980-2015 period, 57% of the Caspian Sea area shows a decreasing trend in wind power density, with a total insignificant drop of 16.85 W/m(2). The highest negative rate of change is observed in the Northern Caspian, which seems to be more influenced by regional climate change. The Caspian Sea regions with the highest potential for offshore wind energy production are identified and discussed.

TI  - Potential of Time-Series Sentinel 2 Data for Monitoring Avocado Crop Phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to accurately and systematically monitor avocado crop phenology offers significant benefits for the optimization of farm management activities, improvement of crop productivity, yield estimation, and evaluation crops' resilience to extreme weather conditions and future climate change. In this study, Sentinel-2-derived enhanced vegetation indices (EVIs) from 2017 to 2021 were used to retrieve canopy reflectance information that coincided with crop phenological stages, such as flowering (F), vegetative growth (V), fruit maturity (M), and harvest (H), in commercial avocado orchards in Bundaberg, Queensland and Renmark, South Australia. Tukey's honestly significant difference (Tukey-HSD) test after one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with EVI metrics (EVImean and EVIslope) showed statistically significant differences between the four phenological stages. From a Pearson correlation analysis, a distinctive seasonal trend of EVIs was observed (R = 0.68 to 0.95 for Bundaberg and R = 0.8 to 0.96 for Renmark) in all 5 years, with the peak EVIs being observed at the M stage and the trough being observed at the F stage. However, a Tukey-HSD test showed significant variability in mean EVI values between seasons for both the Bundaberg and Renmark farms. The variability of the mean EVIs between the two farms was also evident with a p-value < 0.001. This novel study highlights the applicability of remote sensing for the monitoring of avocado phenological stages retrospectively and near-real time. This information not only supports the 'benchmarking' of seasonal orchard performance to identify potential impacts of seasonal weather variation and pest and disease incursions, but when seasonal growth profiles are aligned with the corresponding annual production, it can also be used to develop phenology-based yield prediction models.

TI  - Transferability of Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)-Derived Feature Sets for Support Vector Machine Land Cover Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing analyses frequently use feature selection methods to remove non-beneficial feature variables from the input data, which often improve classification accuracy and reduce the computational complexity of the classification. Many remote sensing analyses report the results of the feature selection process to provide insights on important feature variable for future analyses. Are these feature selection results generalizable to other classification models, or are they specific to the input dataset and classification model they were derived from? To investigate this, a series of radial basis function (RBF) support vector machines (SVM) supervised machine learning land cover classifications of Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery were conducted to assess the transferability of recursive feature elimination (RFE)-derived feature sets between different classification models using different training sets acquired from the same remotely sensed image, and to classification models of other similar remotely sensed imagery. Feature selection results for various training sets acquired from the same image and different images widely varied on small training sets (n = 108). Variability in feature selection results between training sets acquired from different images was reduced as training set size increased; however, each RFE-derived feature set was unique, even when training sample size was increased over 10-fold (n = 1895). The transferability of an RFE-derived feature set from a high performing classification model was, on average, slightly more accurate in comparison to other classification models of the same image, but provided, on average, slightly lower accuracies when generalized to classification models of other, similar remotely sensed imagery. However, the effects of feature set transferability on classification accuracy were inconsistent and varied per classification model. Specific feature selection results in other classification models or remote sensing analyses, while useful for providing general insights on feature variables, may not always generalize to provide comparable accuracies for other classification models of the same dataset, or other, similar remotely sensed datasets. Thus, feature selection should be individually conducted for each training set within an analysis to determine the optimal feature set for the classification model.

TI  - S1-PSINSAR MONITORING AND HYPERBOLIC MODELING OF NONLINEAR GROUND SUBSIDENCE IN NAGA CITY, CEBU ISLAND IN THE PHILIPPINES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities are increasingly altering subsurface conditions leading to unwanted ground deformations. Excessive ground deformations endanger buildings, linear systems, underground facilities, and, ultimately, people's safety. Thus, mapping and monitoring ground deformation are critical in managing disaster risk and mitigating socio-economic damage from possible geohazards. Accessible and archived satellite data and the continual development of advanced remote sensing technologies can now provide valuable information about the earth's surface for various applications. This study applied the descending Sentinel-1 Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (S1-PSInSAR) technique for long-term remote ground deformation monitoring over the coastal city of Naga in Cebu Island in the Philippines. The S1-PSInSAR technique provided relatively dense ground monitoring points, specifically over built-up areas. The maximum ground subsidence along the radar line-of-sight (LOS) estimated throughout the monitoring period from October 2014 to September 2018 exceeds -50 mm, whereas the LOS mean displacement velocity exceeds -15 mm/yr. The two-parameter hyperbolic model well fitted the S1-PSInSAR results to describe the ground deformation's non-uniform and nonlinear behavior. Ground deformation over the coastal city continues to evolve, and stabilization is yet to occur. This study suggests that the S1-PSInSAR technique and the hyperbolic function can provide technical support in mapping, monitoring, and (or) forecasting ground deformation over vast areas with less human labor and efficient cost.

AB  - ObjectivesTo estimate the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in close contacts of adults at high risk of infection due to occupation, participants of the CoVIDA study, in Bogota D.C., Colombia.SettingThe CoVIDA study was the largest COVID-19 intensified sentinel epidemiological surveillance study in Colombia thus far, performing over 60 000 RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study implemented a contact tracing strategy (via telephone call) to support traditional surveillance actions performed by the local health authority.ParticipantsClose contacts of participants from the CoVIDA study.Primary and secondary outcome measuresSARS-CoV-2 testing results were obtained (RT-PCR with CoVIDA or self-reported results). The secondary attack rate (SAR) was calculated using contacts and primary cases features.ResultsThe CoVIDA study performed 1257 contact tracing procedures on primary cases. A total of 5551 close contacts were identified and 1050 secondary cases (21.1%) were found. The highest SAR was found in close contacts: (1) who were spouses (SAR=32.7%; 95% CI 29.1% to 36.4%), (2) of informally employed or unemployed primary cases (SAR=29.1%; 95% CI 25.5% to 32.8%), (3) of symptomatic primary cases (SAR of 25.9%; 95% CI 24.0% to 27.9%) and (4) living in households with more than three people (SAR=22.2%; 95% CI 20.7% to 23.8%). The spouses (OR 3.85; 95% CI 2.60 to 5.70), relatives (OR 1.89; 95% CI 1.33 to 2.70) and close contacts of a symptomatic primary case (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.24 to 1.77) had an increased risk of being secondary cases compared with non-relatives and close contacts of an asymptomatic index case, respectively.ConclusionsContact tracing strategies must focus on households with socioeconomic vulnerabilities to guarantee isolation and testing to stop the spread of the disease.

TI  - Climatological Drought Monitoring in Switzerland Using EUMETSAT SAF Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatological drought monitoring in Switzerland relies heavily on station-based precipitation and temperature data. Due to the high spatial variability and complexity of droughts, it is important to complement station-based drought indices with gridded information and to couple multiple drought indicators within the monitoring system. Here, long-term satellite-based drought parameters from the EUMETSAT SAF network are analyzed in terms of dry anomalies within their climatology's, namely ASCAT soil water index (SWI), CM SAF land surface temperature (LST), complemented with NOAA vegetation data, and LSA SAF Meteosat evapotranspiration data. The upcoming EUMETSAT SAF climate data records on land surface temperature and evapotranspiration will cover for the first time the WMO climatological 30-year reference period. This study is the first study investigating the potential of those long-term data records for climate monitoring of droughts in Europe. The satellite datasets are compared with the standardized precipitation index (SPI), soil moisture observations from the SwissSMEX measurement network, with a modelled soil moisture index (SMI) based on observations, and with evapotranspiration measurements, focusing on the temporal dynamics of the anomalies. For vegetation and surface temperature, the dry years of 2003, 2015, and 2018 are clearly visible in the satellite data. CM SAF LSTs show strong anomalies at the beginning of the drought period. The comparison of in situ and modelled soil moisture and evapotranspiration measurements with the satellite parameters shows strong agreement in terms of anomalies. The SWI indicates high anomaly correlations of 0.56 to 0.83 with measurements and 0.63 to 0.76 with the SMI at grassland sites. The Meteosat evapotranspiration data strongly agree with the measurements, with anomaly correlations of 0.63 and 0.67 for potential and actual evapotranspiration, respectively. Due to the prevailing humid climate conditions at the considered sites, evapotranspiration anomalies during the investigated dry periods were mostly positive and thus not water limited, but were also a driver for soil moisture drought. The results indicate that EUMETSAT SAF satellite data can well complement the station-based drought monitoring in Switzerland with spatial information.

TI  - MODIS-Derived Fire Characteristics and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Cropland Residue Burning in Central India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland residue burning is one of the major causes of the emission of greenhouse gases and pollutants into the atmosphere, and is a major global environmental problem. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal changes in greenhouse gas emissions from cropland residue burning in Chhattisgarh, India. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire data was analyzed over a 21-year (2001-2021) period, and associated greenhouse gas emissions were estimated. A total of 64,370 fire points were recorded for all land cover types. The number of cropland fires increased from 49 to 1368 between 2001 and 2021, with a burning peak observed between December and March. Fires in cropland areas contributed to 32.4% (19,878) of the total fire counts in the last 21 years. The total estimated emissions of greenhouse gases between 2001 and 2021 ranged from 421.5 to 37,233 Gg, with an annual rate of emission of 8972 Gg from wheat residue burning, and from 435.45 to 64,108.1 Gg, with an annual emission of 15,448.16 Gg from rice residue burning. The Chhattisgarh plain region was the cropland fire hotspot of the state. The present study indicates increased cropland residue-burning activity in Chhattisgarh. Therefore, there is an immediate need to develop sustainable alternative methods for agricultural residue management and eco-friendly methods for the disposal of crop residues.

TI  - Downward Trend in Methane Detected in a Northern Colorado Oil and Gas Production Region Using AIRS Satellite Data
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil and gas (O&G) sector is estimated to be the largest contributor to anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions in Colorado. Since 2004, the State of Colorado has implemented multiple regulations to significantly reduce emissions from the O&G sector. The Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) is a significant O&G producing region in northern Colorado, and O&G production here has steadily increased over the last decade. To assess CH4 trends in Northern Colorado, we selected CH4 retrievals from the NASA Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) instrument for 2003-2020. The study grid cell includes Denver, Boulder, and much of the dense O&G production in the DJ Basin. We computed mean June-August ascending node AIRS 700 hPa CH4 for each year and subtracted mean June-August CH4 sampled at NOAA's Niwot Ridge (NWR) station, a high-altitude background site. Differences represent estimated enhancement over background. Linear regression shows an annual change of -2.84 ppb 0.8 ppb from 2012 to 2020 (R-2 0.90) and an estimated reduction of 56% for 2012-2020, despite substantial increases in O&G production. Local CH4 enhancement is strongly correlated with surface measurements of ethane at Platteville which is in the center of the O&G fields (correlation coefficient 0.96), and this is evidence that reductions in O&G emissions are driving reductions in CH4. We conclude that AIRS CH4 can be used to measure the efficacy of emissions control programs in this region and that regulatory requirements are having an effect.

TI  - Phases of Match-Play in Professional Australian Football: Positional Demands and Match-Related Fatigue
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the influence of player position and match quarter on activity profiles during the phases of play in Australian Football. Global positioning satellite data was collected for one season from an Australian Football League team for nomadic, key position and ruck players (age: 24.8 +/- 4.2 years, body mass: 88.3 +/- 8.7 kg, height: 1.88 +/- 0.8 m). Separate linear mixed models and effect sizes were used to analyse differences between positions and game quarter within each phase of play for values of distance, speed and metabolic power indices. There were clear differences between positions for low-speed running, high-speed running, total distance and average speed. Nomadic players generally recorded the highest match running outputs, followed by key position players and ruckmen. Within each position, offence and defence involved the highest intensities, followed by contested play and then stoppage periods. Across the four quarters, there were small to large reductions in average speed, high-speed running, high power and energy expenditure during offence, defence and contested play, but not during stoppages. Accordingly, conditioning staff should consider the intermittent intensities of the phases of match-play for each position to optimally prepare players for competition. Reductions in match intensities were evident during active periods of play providing implications for real-time monitoring to optimise the timing of rotations.

TI  - A Comparison of Bioimpedance Spectroscopy or Tape Measure Triggered Compression Intervention in Chronic Breast Cancer Lymphedema Prevention
T2  - LYMPHATIC RESEARCH AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study compared rates of progression to chronic breast cancer-related lymphedema (defined as >= 10% arm volume change from baseline requiring complex decongestive physiotherapy [CDP]) following an intervention for subclinical lymphedema (S-BCRL) triggered by bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) or by tape measurement (TM).Methods and Results: This stratified, randomized, international trial enrolled new breast cancer patients undergoing: mastectomy/partial mastectomy, axillary treatment (dissection, sentinel lymph node biopsy [SLNB] >6 nodes or radiation), radiation therapy (chest wall/breast, supraclavicular fossa), or taxane-based chemotherapy. Following postsurgery eligibility reassessment, centralized, 1:1 randomization to prospective surveillance by BIS or TM occurred. S-BCRL detection triggered a 4-week, 12-hour per day, compression sleeve, and gauntlet intervention. The primary outcome (n = 209), rates of postintervention progression to CDP, was assessed over 3 years. Between June 24, 2014 and September 11, 2018, 1200 patients were enrolled, 963 randomized (BIS n = 482; TM n = 481) and 879 analyzed (BIS n = 442; TM n = 437). Median follow-up was 32.9 months (interquartile range = 22, 35). BIS patients triggered an intervention at a lower rate than TM patients (20.1%, n = 89 vs. 27.5%, n = 120, p = 0.011). Median months to trigger were longer with BIS than TM (9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-12.6 vs. 3.9; 95% CI, 2.8-4.5, p = 0.001). Overall, 14.4% (n = 30) progressed post-intervention, with reduced likelihood for BIS patients than TM patients (7.9%, n = 7 vs. 19.2%, n = 23; relative risk = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.13-0.81; absolute reduction 11.3%; 95% CI, 2.3-20.3; p = 0.016).Conclusions: Compared to TM, BIS provides a more precise identification of patients likely to benefit from an early compression intervention.Clinical Trial Registration number: NCT02167659.

TI  - Contribution of <i>Populus deltoides</i> based agroforestry systems in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> reduction in northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand
T2  - RANGE MANAGEMENT AND AGROFORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed at estimating area under poplar plantations and their contribution in reduction of atmospheric CO2 in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand states. Object-oriented classification technique was applied on high resolution remote sensing data (LISS-IV/ spatial resolution- 5.8 m) for mapping agroforestry/ poplar area in six study districts. Total agroforestry area in six districts was estimated to be 91622.73 ha. Poplar area was found to be the highest in Bijnor district (12840.53 ha) of Uttar Pradesh followed by Haridwar district (8096.25) of Uttarakhand. As % of agroforestry area in district, Haridwar has the highest poplar area (61.2%). Estimated stem, aboveground and total biomass of poplar plantations were found to be the highest in Baghpat district because of high tree density. Muzaffarnagar district has second the highest values of estimated stem, aboveground and total biomass (128.55, 153.89 and 194.80 t ha(-1), respectively). Carbon stock was also found to be the highest in Bijnor district (0.909 million tonnes) followed by Muzaffarnagar district (0.813 million tonnes). About 2.795 million tonnes of C-stock in total biomass was assessed in five selected districts of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. In this way, contribution of these districts in atmospheric CO2 absorption was to the tune of 10.257 million tonnes in total biomass of poplar plantations. It was concluded that agroforestry systems in general and poplar based systems in particular have significant contribution in reduction of atmospheric CO2. Hence, they would certainly play an important role in climate change mitigation at state/ regional level.

AB  - This article discusses the use of multispectral data from Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, Aqua, and Terra satellites for monitoring the environment in areas of open-pit coal mines in the Iskitimsky district of Novosibirsk oblast for 2013-2020. The dynamics of changes in the values of the reflection coefficient (CR) from the surface and water bodies, the snow index NDSI during the snowmelt period, and the change in NDVI in summer are shown. The dynamics of changes in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) (aerosol optical thickness (AOT)) of CO and CH4 values in the atmosphere of the Iskitimsky district is shown using the Giovanni data analysis and visualization system. A satellite assessment of the state of the atmosphere revealed seasonal changes in the AOD with maximum values in April and July. It is shown that the highest concentrations of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere are observed in the winter months, as well as in the spring of March and April. A stable decrease in the concentration of carbon monoxide in the atmosphere over 7 years from 2014 to 2020 with a determination coefficient of R-2 = 0.95 and an increase in the concentration of methane with a determination coefficient of R-2 = 0.89 are shown.

TI  - Evaluation of Some Parameters of the Topsoil from Radar and Optical Data of Sentinel 1/2 Satellites Using the Example of the Novosibirsk Region
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper considers the use of radar and optical data from the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 satellites for 2019-2020 to assess the humus content and the percentage of clay and moisture in the topsoil using the example of chernozems and gray forest soils of the Novosibirsk oblast. Particular attention is paid to the selection of satellite images, because in order to quantify the humus content and clay in the soil, it is necessary to fulfill the conditions for the soil to be dry and bare. The humus content is estimated for five test sites based on a regression model (Karavanova and Orlov, 1996), which includes surface reflection coefficients at the wavelength of the B6 spectral channel of the Sentinel 2 satellite. The model parameters are adjusted for the conditions of the study area separately for chernozems and gray forest soils. The percentage of physical clay in the soil is estimated using Sentinel 2 optical data, ground measurements, and regression models with an exponential dependence of clay content on soil reflectances at the SWIR wavelengths of the Sentinel 2 spectral channels (Bousbih et al., 2019; Shabou et al., 2015). The change in the percentage of humus and clay content in the test sites of soils over the year is shown according to Sentinel 2 data. The topsoil moisture content is estimated based on radar, optical, and the combined use of radar and optical data.

TI  - Correlation of Ground-Based and Satellite Measurements of Methane Concentration in the Surface Layer of the Atmosphere in the Tiksi Region
T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, the correlation of AIRS/Aqua satellite measurements of methane concentration in the surface layer of the atmosphere with ground-based measurements at the Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory in Tiksi in 2011-2020 is determined. The correlation of satellite measurements with ground measurements depends on the season. In spring and summer, the correlation exceeds the autumn correlation, and it is lowest in winter. For the winter period (December, January, and February), the decrease in correlation is associated with possible inversions of air temperature (Yurganov et al., 2016; Anisimov and Kokorev, 2015). When the temperature contrast (TC) is less than 10 degrees C (the difference between air temperatures at the surface and at a level of 4 km (600 hPa)), it is preferable to use satellite data averaged at the levels of 400-500 hPa. This gives an increase in the Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC) between ground and satellite measurements from 0.44 (1000 hPa) to 0.63 (400-500 hPa). However, the obtained regression relationship with a determination coefficient of 0.44 makes it problematic to use it for predicting ground-based data from satellite measurements in areas similar in climatic conditions to Tiksi.

M3  - Article
AB  - Specific emissivity features of swamps and wetlands in Western Siberia were studied for changing seasonal conditions with the use of daily data from satellite microwave sounding. The research technique involved the analysis of the brightness temperatures of the underlying surface at the test sites. Variations in the seasonal dynamics of the brightness temperatures were mainly caused by different rates of seasonal freezing of the upper waterlogged layer of the underlying surface and the dielectric characteristics of the water-containing natural media (water body, soil, and vegetation). We analyzed the long-term trends in the seasonal and annual dynamics of the brightness temperatures of the underlying surface and estimated the hydrological changes in the Arctic and Subarctic. The findings open new possibilities for using satellite data in the microwave range to study natural seasonal dynamic processes and to predict hazardous hydrological phenomena.

TI  - Remote Radio-Physical Harbingers of Drought in Steppes of the South of Western Siberia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for remote sensing of the underlying surface in the microwave range based on moisture dependence of soil emissivity were successfully used in monitoring droughts and assessing water availability of the studied territories. Soil moisture influence on soil cover emissivity calibrated in units of the radio brightness temperature (T-B) was studied. We used values of T-B derived from SMOS satellite data. This paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of soil, meteorological conditions and physical characteristics of soils in the test territories of the Kulunda Plain. The experimental data were applied in computing trends of T-B and physical temperature (T) described by linear dependencies. Volume fractions of water (W) in soil were calculated based on the satellite sensing data, the results of field studies and laboratory measurements of dielectric characteristics of soils. A map scheme of spatial distribution of W was constructed and the influences of snow cover, precipitation and surface wind velocity on drought were analyzed. The comprehensive analysis of remote, field and laboratory data suggest that the rate of change in the brightness temperature (dT(BH)/dD-up to 17 K per day), which characterizes the rate of fall in volume humidity of soil (Delta W-up to 0.009 cm(3)/cm(3) per day), can be used as a short-term radio-physical harbinger of drought. An experimental dependence of the rate of change in radio brightness temperature on the rate of change in soil moisture was established.

TI  - 1 Regional Street Variations of Indonesian Cities: 2 Geometric Properties, Street Patterns, and 3 Topological Structures
T2  - JOURNAL OF REGIONAL AND CITY PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Indonesia, as a fast-growing country with one of the largest populations in the ASEAN region, cities are constantly evolving and changing. While the current political establishment is planning to relocate the country's capital to a new city on Kalimantan Island, comparative research on Indonesian cities is very limited. Indonesia is an archipelago country that consists of 17,508 islands and at least 514 urban areas, of which 98 can be categorized as cities. This study focused on examining variations in provincial capital cities from six main Indonesian regions: Sumatra, Java-Bali, Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku-Papua. We used OpensStreetMap (OSM) vector datasets to study the geometric properties of street centerlines and regression techniques on Landsat satellite images of these cities processed in GIS to study land-use patterns. We also used a pattern classification method from Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) systems to study street orientation patterns utilizing OSMnx. Finally, we used the space syntax method to describe the topological features of the natural street networks of the cities. The results of this study show that there are statistically significant regional variations among cities in Indonesia. They also show that street network orientations are correlated with global integration values, indicating that the movement potential in these cities could be affected by spatial shape patterns. The findings of this study are essential for identifying and classifying regional variations in the geometric patterns and topological structures of provincial capital cities in Indonesia.

TI  - Short-Term Effects and Vegetation Response after a Megafire in a Mediterranean Area
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mediterranean-climate areas, wildfires have an important ecological role, selecting organisms, influencing species composition and structure of vegetation, and shaping landscapes. However, the increase in frequency and severity of fires can cause, among others, progressive vegetation degradation, biodiversity, and ecosystem services loss. Under the climate change scenario, the frequency and severity of wildfires are expected to increase, especially in the Mediterranean Basin, recognized as among the most affected by the intensification of droughts and heat waves in the future. Therefore, from the perspective of adaptation, it is important not only to assess the sudden effects after a fire but also to investigate the ecological changes and vegetation response over time. In this framework, this study investigates the effects and the short-term vegetation response in an area struck by a megafire. The vegetation response one year after a fire has been assessed in semi-natural grasslands, shrublands, and woodlands at the landscape scale through spectral indices, and at the field scale through floristic and vegetation surveys. Our results showed that after a severe wildfire, although some areas did not exhibit vegetation regrowth, the response of natural vegetation was notable after one year. In the study area, the most resilient vegetation type was semi-natural grasslands, suggesting that this type of vegetation can be crucial for landscape recovery. The other vegetation types showed different response patterns that also prefigure possible changes in species composition and loss of plant diversity over the medium term. This study highlights the value of combining remote sensing spectral analyses and detailed floristic and vegetation surveys for understanding the direction of the early stages of post-fire vegetation dynamics.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network Method for Rice Mapping Using Time-Series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most essential and strategic food sources globally. Accordingly, policymakers and planners often consider a special place in the agricultural economy and economic development for this essential commodity. Typically, a sample survey is carried out through field observations and farmers' consultations to estimate annual rice yield. Studies show that these methods lead to many errors and are time-consuming and costly. Satellite remote sensing imagery is widely used in agriculture to provide timely, high-resolution data and analytical capabilities. Earth observations with high spatial and temporal resolution have provided an excellent opportunity for monitoring and mapping crop fields. This study used the time series of dual-pol synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 ESA's Copernicus program to extract rice cultivation areas in Mazandaran province in Iran. A novel multi-channel streams deep feature extraction method was proposed to simultaneously take advantage of SAR and optical imagery. The proposed framework extracts deep features from the time series of NDVI and original SAR images by first and second streams. In contrast, the third stream integrates them into multi-levels (shallow to deep high-level features); it extracts deep features from the channel attention module (CAM), and group dilated convolution. The efficiency of the proposed method was assessed on approximately 129,000 in-situ samples and compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results showed that combining NDVI time series and SAR data can significantly improve rice-type mapping. Moreover, the proposed methods had high efficiency compared with other methods, with more than 97% overall accuracy. The performance of rice-type mapping based on only time-series SAR images was better than only time-series NDVI datasets. Moreover, the classification performance of the proposed framework in mapping the Shirodi rice type was better than that of the Tarom type.

TI  - An Automated and Improved Methodology to Retrieve Long-time Series of Evapotranspiration Based on Remote Sensing and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The large-scale quantification of accurate evapotranspiration (ET) time series has substantially been developed in recent decades using automated approaches based on remote sensing data. However, there are still several model-related uncertainties that require precise assessment. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and meteorological data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were used to estimate long-term daily actual ET based on three endmember selection procedures: two land cover-based models, one with (WF) and the other without (WOF) morphological functions, and the Allen method (with the default percentiles) for 2270 Landsat images. Models were evaluated for 23 flux tower sites with four main vegetation cover types as well as different climate types. Results showed that endmember selection with morphological functions (WF_ET) generally performed better than the other endmember approaches. Climate-based classification assessment provided the clearest discrimination between the performance of the different endmember selection approaches for the humid category. For humid zones, the land cover-based methods, especially WF, appropriately outperformed Allen. However, the performance of the three approaches was similar for sub-humid, semi-arid and arid climates together; the Allen approach was therefore recommended to avoid the need for dependency on land cover maps. Tower-by-tower validation also showed that the WF approach performed best at 12 flux tower sites, the WOF approach best at 5 and the Allen approach best at 6, suggesting that the use of land cover maps alone does not explain the differences between the performance of the land cover-based models and the Allen approach. Additionally, the satisfactory error metrics results when comparing the EC estimations with EC measurements, with root mean square error (RMSE) approximate to 0.91 and 1.59 mm center dot day(-1), coefficient of determination (R-2) approximate to 0.71 and 0.41, and bias percentage (PBias) approximate to 2% and 60% for crop and non-crop flux tower sites, respectively, supports the use of GLDAS meteorological forcing datasets with the different automated ET estimation approaches. Overall, given that the thorough evaluation of different endmember selection approaches at large scale confirmed the validity of the WF approach for different climate and land cover types, this study can be considered an important contribution to the global retrieval of long time series of ET.

M3  - Article
AB  - The procedure for geographic reference of the data of radiometric measurements of the MTVZA-GYa microwave scanner/sounder onboard the Meteor-M No. 2-2 spacecraft is described. Georeferencing is performed on the basis of the information contained in the instrument's measurement data files (in .hdf format) (the observation time of each surface element, common for all frequency channels), as well as the description of the scanning scheme of this instrument, presented in scientific periodicals (sighting angles, scanning speed, etc.). As additional information, necessary to perform the georeferencing operation (orbit parameters, etc.), data freely available on the Internet are used. The georeferencing procedure consists of several sequentially performed operations, including determination of satellite coordinates in the inertial coordinate system, forming observation vectors in the instrumental coordinate system, determining the matrices of direct and inverse transitions for the six used coordinate systems, determination of the coordinates of the observation point in the inertial coordinate system, conversion of the coordinates to the Greenwich coordinate system, etc. In the presented form, it is possible to flexibly configure this operation, taking into account the instability of the orbit spacecraft position, variations in the instrument-scanning speed, instability of setting time stamps, errors in mounting the instrument on the spacecraft, etc. Also, the described georeferencing procedure can be used as part of automated algorithms for processing measurement data and procedures for searching for optimal values of the corrective parameters (for example, the roll, pitch, and yaw angles of the spacecraft and/or instrument).

TI  - Advances in surgical techniques for gastric cancer: Indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Is it ready for prime time?
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgery is still the primary curative treatment for gastric cancer, which includes resection of the tumor with adequate margins and extended lymphadenectomy. In order to improve the operative results and the quality of life of patients, several endeavors have been made toward precision medicine through image-guided surgery, allowing access to real-time intraoperative anatomy and accurate tumor staging. The goal of the surgeon is to achieve a more precise, individualized, and less invasive surgery without compromising oncological efficiency and safety. In this perspective, we have demonstrated the role of indocyanine green (ICG) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging method in gastric cancer surgery. This technique may be used to improve localization of the tumor, detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), real-time lymphatic mapping, and blood flow assessment (anastomosis perfusion).

TI  - Inundated Vegetation Mapping Using SAR Data: A Comparison of Polarization Configurations of UAVSAR L-Band and Sentinel C-Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood events have become intense and more frequent due to heavy rainfall and hurricanes caused by global warming. Accurate floodwater extent maps are essential information sources for emergency management agencies and flood relief programs to direct their resources to the most affected areas. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are superior to optical data for floodwater mapping, especially in vegetated areas and in forests that are adjacent to urban areas and critical infrastructures. Investigating floodwater mapping with various available SAR sensors and comparing their performance allows the identification of suitable SAR sensors that can be used to map inundated areas in different land covers, such as forests and vegetated areas. In this study, we investigated the performance of polarization configurations for flood boundary delineation in vegetated and open areas derived from Sentinel1b, C-band, and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) L-band data collected during flood events resulting from Hurricane Florence in the eastern area of North Carolina. The datasets from the sensors for the flooding event collected on the same day and same study area were processed and classified for five landcover classes using a machine learning method-the Random Forest classification algorithm. We compared the classification results of linear, dual, and full polarizations of the SAR datasets. The L-band fully polarized data classification achieved the highest accuracy for flood mapping as the decomposition of fully polarized SAR data allows land cover features to be identified based on their scattering mechanisms.
