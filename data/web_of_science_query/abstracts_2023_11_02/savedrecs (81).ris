TI  - African American Health and Posttraumatic Slave Syndrome: A Terror Management Theory Account
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLACK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to explicate a terror management theory (TMT) analysis of the poor social and psychological well-being of African Americans by drawing upon a model of cultural trauma to explain the antecedents and effects of posttraumatic slave syndrome. Cultural trauma is defined as a state that occurs when a people's cultural worldview has been destabilized to the point where it does not effectively meet its TMT function of providing a buffer against basic anxiety and uncertainty. The article outlines how the impact of slavery was a significant trauma to African American people, which was carried forward through successive generations; providing an explanation of their current anxiety-related conditions, poor health, and maladaptive behaviors. Findings from health and justice research and qualitative data from narratives of African Americans are presented to substantiate the adaptation of a model of cultural trauma for understanding the contemporary situation of African Americans.

TI  - Monitoring and predicting the potential distribution of alien plant species in arid ecosystem using remotely-sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities cause introduction of alien species to new areas, which may cause serious problems and threats to biodiversity and ecosystem services. Omayed biosphere reserve (OBR) at the northwestern desert of Egypt, recognized for its rich flora, has recently encountered new human-induced disturbances. The current study sought to identify alien species that might have invaded OBR as a result of such activities; and to estimate the area affected by alien species using remotely-sensed data. Field surveys of 300 sampling plots representing different habitats were conducted from spring 2011 to spring 2014, whereby occurrences of alien plant species were recorded. We evaluated the use of combined environmental and remotely-sensed data for developing predictive distribution models for 21 alien species recorded in the area using Maxent modeling technique. The inclusion spectral predictors with other environmental predictors has improved the performance of the distribution models (mean test AUC 0.88 +/- 0.06) for most of the alien species. Environmental variables that contributed the most to prediction of alien species distribution included soil, elevation and slope; in addition to predictors that represented disturbance proxies such as distance from irrigation canals and distance from roads. The results revealed that more than 40% of the area is predicted to be infested by at least one alien species. Results also manifest the merit of incorporating remotely-sensed data in prediction of alien species distribution, which hold promise for development of proactive management approaches to identify and control areas of high infestation of alien species and prevent further spread of invasive plants.

AB  - Aim: To review contemporary knowledge of the low volume metastatic disease in patients with endometrial cancer.Type of study: A literatue review.Settings: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology. University Hospital Olomouc; Department of Clinical and Molecular Pathology, University Hospital Olomouc.Introduction: The presence of micrometastases or isolated tumor cells in the sentinel node detected by ultrastaging leads to the change of tumor stage. Low volume lymph node involvement represents up to 30% of the affected lymph nodes in patients with endometrial cancer. The enhanced sentinel lymph node investigation aims to more accurately determine the extent of illness from stage Ito stage IIIC. Particularly important is the detection of low-volume metastatic nodal involvement in low-risk tumors, because compared with macrometastases, micrometastases may occure earlier in tumours with lower carcinologic aggressiveness.Conclusion: Detection of low volume metastatic disease decrease the false negativity of nodal involvement and is helpful for adjuvant treatment planning.

TI  - Fluorescence Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping: From Current Molecular Probes to Future Multimodal Nanoprobes
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - For SLN lymph node biopsy (SLNB), SLN mapping has become a standard of care procedure that can accurately locate the micrometastases disseminated from primary tumor sites to the regional lymph nodes. The broad array of SLN mapping has prompted the development of a wide range of SLN tracers, rationally designed for noninvasive and high-resolution imaging of SLNs. At present, conventional SLN imaging probes (blue dyes, radiocolloids, and few other small-molecular dyes), although serving the clinical needs, are often associated with major issues such as insufficient accumulation in SLN, short retention time, staining of the surgical field, and other adverse side effects. In a recent advancement, newly designed fluorescent nanoprobes are equipped with novel features that could be of high interest in SLN mapping such as (i) a unique niche that is not met by any other conventional SLN probes, (ii) their adoptable synthesis method, and (ii) excellent sensitivity facilitating high resolution SLN mapping. Most importantly, lots of effort has been devoted for translating the fluorescent nanoprobes into a clinical setup and also imparting the multimodal imaging abilities of nanoprobes for the excellent diagnosis of life-threatening diseases such as cancer. In this review, we will provide a detailed roadmap of the progress of a wide variety of current fluorescent molecular probes and emphasize the future of nanomaterial-based single/multimodal imaging probes that have true potential translation abilities for SLN mapping.

TI  - The Semiotics of Pir-e Shaliar Ritual Ceremony in Cultural Landscape of Hawraman
T2  - BAGH-E NAZAR
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The current study is a both a field and library research to introduce and restore the meaning of Pir-e Shaliar ritual ceremony in the cultural Landscape of Hawraman of Sarvabad in the province of Kurdistan in terms of semiotics. A significant matter in semiotics is the production of meaning and the meaningfulness of the world by the system of signs. Meaning is a concept expressed by a sign.Problem statement: The customs, traditions, and rituals, as Cultural signs/representation of human thoughts offer an interpretation of the world and the human's worldview through symbolic means, which are on the verge of oblivion by the dominance of virtual communication in the contemporary world, and their entire exploitation in various aspects of development is impossible.Research objective: The main purpose of this study is to discover and articulate the implications of meaning in Pir-e Shaliar ceremony and the system of meaning derived from its symbolic signs/representations. So by that, steps have been taken to facilitate cultural exchanges and to provide development opportunities in the region. Methodology: The present study is based on a qualitative method in which data is collected through ethnographic and documentary methods, and analyzed through semiotic method.Conclusion: The results reveal that Pir-e Shaliar ceremony is a symbolic sign of the ethnic and collective beliefs of people in the cultural landscape of Hawraman, which presents a new layer of implicit meanings to the audience. Also, this ceremony narrates an implicit scheme of a mystical tradition from the semiotic point of view, that objectifies the deism of Iranian people in a social cohesion in the Cultural Landscape of Hawraman.

TI  - EXPLORING THE MORAL DIFFERENCES, BETWEEN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN, ENGINEERING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP STUDENTS
T2  - TOWARDS A NEW INNOVATION LANDSCAPE

CL  - Univ Strathclyde Technol & Innovat Ctr, Glasgow, SCOTLAND
AB  - Over the last two years our industrial design programme has been involved in a number of interdisciplinary team projects. We have observed that in successful teams, the education and skills of team members matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work and view their contributions. We believe that there are distinct and innate differences between students in different academic disciplines when it comes to moral positions and these differences in worldview inherently causes friction in interdisciplinary teams. Consequently, we feel that if students could understand these differences extrinsically, they could potentially improve their experience within their interdisciplinary team work.We ran a pilot study with students from Brigham Young University comparing the industrial design, engineering and entrepreneurship majors using The Moral Foundations Questionnaire (Graham, Haidt & Nosek, 2008) This survey measures five facets of one's moral position: Care/Harm, Fairness/Reciprocity, In-group/Loyalty, Authority/Respect and Sanctity/Purity.Results show that designers scored higher in liberal values than their more conservative leaning engineering and business student counterparts. These results support our hypothesis. Understanding the fundamental value differences between disciplinary training should reduce friction and enhance interdisciplinary team communication. This ability to appreciate other mindsets in order to communicate and effectively design with individuals from differing disciplines will be an "essential skill for workers in the coming decades" (Colombo and Grilli, 2005).

TI  - Tectonics of the Eastern Desert of Egypt: Key to Understanding the Neoproterozoic Evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (East African Orogen)
T2  - GEOLOGY OF THE ARAB WORLD - AN OVERVIEW
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Conference of the Arabian-Geosciences-Union (ARABGU)
CL  - Algiers, ALGERIA
AB  - The tectonic evolution of the Arabian-Nubian Shield (ANS), the northern continuation of the East African Orogen (EAO), is enigmatic and a matter of controversy. The EAO is observed as a N-S trending major suture zone separating East and West Gondwanaland. It documents a prolonged tectonic history bracketed by the fragmentation of Rodinia Supercontinent and the amalgamation of Gondwana. The ANS is dominated by Neoproterozoic juvenile continental crust (i.e., crust formed directly from the mantle), formed by magmatic arc accretion and subsequent post-tectonic magmatism, and includes a mosaic of tectonic terranes juxtaposed along ophiolite-decorated megashears (suture zones). Among them is the Eastern Desert terrane (namely, Aswan or Gerf terrane in some literatures) which is regarded as the western extension of Midyan terrane in Western Arabian and shows most of the polydeformed history of the ANS. This chapter is devoted to discuss the Neoproterozoic crustal evolution of the Pan-African belt of the Eastern Desert terrane in an attempt to understand the tectonic setting of the ANS. Main points to be discussed in this chapter are: (1) infracrustal-supracrustal rocks, (2) thrusting, shearing, and folding relations; (3) gneiss domes versus metamorphic core complexes; (4) the conjugate pairs of Najd-related shears; (5) role of Najd Fault System in tectonic evolution of gneiss domes; (6) rates and transport directions of metaultramafic nappes; (7) the voluminous intrusives in northern Eastern Desert; (8) the post-amalgamation Hammamat sediments and their relation to Dokhan Volcanics; and (9) the northward decrease in intensity of deformation in the entire Eastern Desert.

AB  - Landslides are one of the main geological hazards that can cause critical damage to the infrastructure in an area and can result in serious risks to the people's safety there. Landslides can be investigated and monitored using field survey, aerial mapping and high resolution optical satellite data analysis. However, these methods are relatively time-consuming. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) can investigate and monitor landslides and provide sub-centimetre accuracy for ground-surface deformation when time series analysis techniques are employed. In this research, differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry was applied on Sentinel-1 data of two Single Look Complex (SLC) images from 16 October 2018 and 21 March 2019 in the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode using the Sentinel application platform (SNAP) to determine the extreme ground-surface deformations, as a prelude to landslides occurrence in Balloran dam area in the north-west of Syria, where the ophiolite complex deposits of the Maastrichtian are exposed causing, due to the heavy rains, several landslides affecting the road network in this area every year. The results reveal ground-surface deformations during the study period along the satellite line of sight near to the main road in Balloran dam area with a maximum value reaches to around 20 cm. The D-InSAR results were compared to the D-GPS results of 10 validation points along the main road in the study area, where the RMS difference value was 20 cm.

TI  - Thermophysical behaviour of LULC surfaces and their effect on the urban thermal environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aims of this study are to investigate the thermophysical behaviour of various urban land use/land cover (LULC) surfaces in an urban environment, and to examine the relationship between field measurements and remotely sensed data. Perth metropolitan area has been used as a test case. Two sets of surface albedo and land surface temperature (LST) measurements were taken at different locations on a variety of urban LULC surfaces using two procedures. Firstly, field measurements were made with a pyranometer and a hand-held infrared camera. Secondly, a Landsat 8 image was used to create maps of estimated surface albedo and LST. A new adjustment method was applied to the field measurements to adjust them to satellite overpass time. The results demonstrate that surface albedo and LST are influential factors in determining the thermal characteristics of LULC surfaces. Some built-up areas have a negative effect on the urban environment of Perth compared with non-built-up categories. The correlation between adjusted field work and Landsat 8 data is in strong agreement for surface albedo, and reasonably strong for land surface temperature.

Results show that reflectance and Kd490 are both reasonably estimated, whose APD are around 20% for both FR and RR data. However, chlorophyll concentration and TSM concentration cannot be estimated correctly. This indicates that atmospheric works quite well but the bio-optical model does not work at all. Therefore, local or regional bio-optical algorithms must be developed.

TI  - A Convolutional Neural Network Using Surface Data to Predict Subsurface Temperatures in the Pacific Ocean
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) method to estimate subsurface temperature (ST) in the Pacific Ocean from a suite of satellite remote sensing measurements. These include sea surface temperature(SST), sea surface height (SSH), and sea surface salinity (SSS). We propose using the multisource sea surface parameters to establish a monthly CNN model to reconstruct the ocean subsurface temperature (ST) and use Argo data for accurate validation. The results show that the CNN can accurately estimate the ST of the Pacific Ocean by using the model. We trained the model for 12 months. The most prominent months are January, April, July, and October with average mean square error (MSE) values of 0.2659, 0.3129, 0.5318, and 0.5160, and the average coefficients of determination (R-2) were 0.968, 0.971, 0.949, and 0.967, respectively. This study improves the accuracy of ST estimation and the good results based on reanalysis indicate that the model is promising to be applied to satellite observations.

TI  - Remote-sensing monitoring and analysis of China intertidal zone changes based on tidal correction
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intertidal zones are located in the transitional area of sea and land and are important to biodiversity protection, social and economic development, and global environmental changes. However, due to the irregular dynamics of the tides and the regular local time of satellite transit, it is challenging to monitor the extent of intertidal zones using only satellite remote-sensing methods. Until now, there has been no complete dataset of China's coastal intertidal zones and knowledge about their distribution is limited. In the work described in this paper, we first used 156 Landsat Thematic Mapper/Operational Land Imager images covering the entire coastal area of China in 1995 and 2015 to extract the instantaneous shoreline water boundaries. Then, by combining the tidal level information at the transit of the satellite, we simulated the average high- and low-tide lines and determined the spatial and temporal distribution of intertidal zones by the geographic information system method. At the same time, the land-use types across the intertidal zones were manually interpreted based on high-resolution images from Google Earth. On this basis, the spatial and temporal characteristics of intertidal zone changes across China's coastal areas and their driving factors were researched. The results follow. (1) In 2015, the total area of the intertidal zone in China was approximately 14070 km2, of which Fujian Province (18%) was the most distributed in the intertidal zone, followed by Liaoning Province (15%), Shandong Province (14%), Jiangsu Province (12%), and Guangdong Province (11%); the smallest area was distributed in Hainan Province (2%). (2) From 1995 to 2015, the national intertidal zone area decreased by 1375 km(2), approximately 8.9%. The intertidal zone area of different provinces and cities showed different increasing and decreasing trends. The largest reduction of intertidal zones was in Zhejiang Province, with an area decrease of 1189 km(2). The intertidal zone area of Jiangsu Province was greatly reduced, by which its first position of having the most intertidal zone area of China in 1995 decreased to the fourth in 2015. The intertidal zones in Fujian Province exhibited the greatest increase, reaching 453 km(2). The area of intertidal zones between the ports of Shanghai Luchao and Zhejiang Jintang exhibited the greatest decrease, reaching 56.5%. The area of intertidal zones between Fujian Shui'ao and Anhaiwan estuaries increased the most, reaching 37.28%, an area of 445.59 km2. ( 3) The trend of development and utilization of intertidal zones continues to increase. In 1995, the coastal intertidal zone area occupied was 3490 km(2), and by 2015, it had reached 4581 km(2). The type of development and utilization of intertidal zones changed from agricultural sea (41.8%) to marine aquaculture; the proportion of urban construction occupied also reached 13%. At the same time, the intertidal zone area in the cofferdam (under construction/unknown use) continued to grow, from 18.1% in 1995 to 29% in 2015. The intertidal zone showing the greatest level of development and utilization among the coastal provinces is Jiangsu Province, with an occupied area of 1646 km(2), accounting for 35.9% of the developed and utilized national intertidal zone, with the main types of utilization being agricultural sea and mariculture. The other provinces that developed intertidal zones are Guangdong (13.7%), Shandong (12.5%), Liaoning (10.9%), and Shanghai (10.3%).The main development and utilization types of intertidal zones are urban construction and mariculture, with a large number of intertidal zones presently under development. (4) The "squeezing effect" caused by the combination of artificial and natural factors have caused the reduction of intertidal zones in China. Human development mainly includes marine aquaculture, industrial development, port expansion, urban construction, and reclamation. And the actual high-tide line has moved towards the sea by artificial intertidal zone development. The velocity is even higher than that of low-tide line, resulting in the reduction of intertidal zones. Natural factors mainly include rising sea level and other factors, such as changes in the sediment concentration of rivers entering the sea and coastal hydrodynamic forces, which are also important factors affecting the change of coastal intertidal zones. These factors contribute to the drift of some intertidal zones towards the sea and the expansion of the area. The contradiction between economic development and coastal ecological environmental protection is still outstanding.

AB  - In this study, parallel processing codes of k-means clustering algorithm were developed and implemented in a PC-cluster for unsupervised classification of large satellite images. We implemented intra-node code using multicores of CPU (Central Processing Unit) based on OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing), inter-nodes code using a PC-cluster based on message passing interface, and hybrid code using both. The PC-cluster consists of one master node and eight slave nodes, and each node is equipped with eight multicores. Two operating systems, Microsoft Windows and Canonical Ubuntu, were installed in the PC-cluster in turn and tested to compare parallel processing performance. Two multispectral satellite images were tested, which are a medium-capacity LANDSAT 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) image and a high-capacity Sentinel 2A image. To evaluate the performance of parallel processing, speedup and efficiency were measured. Overall, the speedup was over N / 2 and the efficiency was over 0.5. From the comparison of the two operating systems, the Ubuntu system showed two to three times faster performance. To confirm that the results of the sequential and parallel processing coincide with the other, the center value of each band and the number of classified pixels were compared, and result images were examined by pixel to pixel comparison. It was found that care should be taken to avoid false sharing of OpenMP in intra-node implementation. To process large satellite images in a PC-cluster, code and hardware should be designed to reduce performance degradation caused by file I / O. Also, it was found that performance can differ depending on the operating system installed in a PC-cluster.

AB  - High volumes of satellite data management within an organization is still challenging and daunting in the era of big data. The increasing information technology costs and limited budgets, growing satellite data needs, data availability across multiple teams and projects, strategic goals of organization, and expected project outcomes require better satellite data management mechanism and system to facilitate research and development activities. An organization level centralized satellite data repository is a practical solution to satisfy these requirements. This paper describes the best practices and experiences from building such a central satellite data repository within our organization, including data management strategy and policy, scalable and extensible system infrastructure, comprehensive data management system, and technical support and user assistance. These practices can be borrowed and applied in other organizations with similar requirements.

TI  - A Cooperative Framework Based on Active and Semi-supervised Learning for Sea Ice Classification using EO-1 Hyperion Data
T2  - TRANSACTIONS OF THE JAPAN SOCIETY FOR AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the classification of remote-sensing sea ice images, labeled samples are difficult to acquire. To adequately utilize the massive number of unlabeled samples, which contain abundant information, we propose a cooperative framework based on active learning (AL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) for sea ice image classification. We acquire the most valuable samples using AL and make full use of the abundant information contained in the unlabeled samples using SSL, and then conduct a label consistency verification procedure to further ensure the quality of the pseudo-labeled samples obtained through cooperation between AL and SSL. In the AL part, we adopt a sampling strategy that integrates uncertainty and diversity criteria to acquire the most valuable samples to label. In the SSL part, we utilize the SSL sampling strategy to choose the unlabeled samples with the most information and little redundancy, and use the transductive support vector machine (TSVM) as the classification model. The cooperation between AL and SSL ensures the accuracy of the pseudo-labeled samples through a consistency verification procedure. We conduct comparative experiments using the method proposed and other methods on two hyperspectral images obtained from the Earth Observation Satellite 1 (EO-1). The proposed method achieves the highest classification accuracy for both datasets and can be effectively applied to sea ice classification.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Fine co-registration that precisely aligns multiple images acquired over a given area is an important process to exploit the very high resolution (VHR) multitemporal images in a wide range of remote sensing applications. The objective of this study is to analyze the effect of the fine co-registration performance on an unsupervised change detection between VHR images. To this end, we extract registration noise (RN) samples, which are denoted as misaligned pixels in a local region. Then, the location of conjugate points (CPs) is positioned by analyzing the local distribution of the extracted RN samples. The CPs are employed for generating a non-rigid transformation model to warp a sensed image into a reference image. An unsupervised change vector analysis approach is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fine co-registration performance. Experiments are implemented on a Worldview-3 VHR multispectral dataset.

AB  - Tatun volcano group, the last active volcano in Taiwan, is located in northern Taipei Basin, only 15 km north of the Taipei City. It was previously thought to be a dead volcano, but recent studies show that the last magmatic eruption happened about 5000 to 6000 years ago. The geothermal and seismic activities over the Tatun volcanic area have been highly active in recent years. The geochemical analysis implies the potential existing of the magma chamber under the ground surface of northern Taiwan which has the possibility of re-eruption in the future. In this study, we use ALOS-1/PALSAR images to monitor the surface deformation at the Tatun volcanic area. Stratified atmospheric delay and orbit errors are well considered and corrected by an adaptive patch-based method. The derived displacement history provides a detailed map of surface change with large spatial extent, which is validated by GPS measurements. The results demonstrate the capability of InSAR technique to monitor surface deformation over the volcanic zones.

AB  - Technology development of satellite earth observation offers multi-spectral data, variations sensitivity of satellite sensors are very useful to detect existing conditions by using the remote sensing algorithm to extract the land cover and the phenomenon that has occurred. Ecosystems have bound tolerance to nature condition and organisms have adaptation limit to climate change. Method used in this study was the extraction of land cover by applying multi spectral analysis as Maximum Likelihood, object base image analysis, (LST) land surface temperature, and also the formula Threat of Land Expansion (TLE) to the environment. Result showed that multispectral and time series analysis gave the increasing dynamic of land expansion, especially for forest high density, which areas ranged from 29098.73 ha in 2000 to 19216.7 ha in 2018. The surface temperature increase was +/- 2.8 C degrees in eighteen years. The temperature dynamic represented the micro climate changes, has followed stream of land expansion. TLE represented zone threats of land expansion to natural ecosystems. It was found that threat zone because land expansion. The area of high threat vale 0.4 around central human activity was a built up area.

AB  - Rugged terrain significantly complicates the land surface albedo modeling and retrievals in remote sensing. Neglecting the topographic effects may lead to large uncertainties when estimating land surface albedo over rugged terrain. In this study, the sensitivities of snow-free vegetation shortwave albedo to topography are quantitatively investigated and analyzed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface albedo data and the global sensitivity analysis of a mechanistically-based land surface albedo parameterized model over rugged terrain. The results reveal that the topography can account for more than 30% of the total variabilities of the land surface albedo and the topographic effects on land surface albedo cannot be neglected even for the terrain with the mean slope of 10 degrees.

CP  - 15th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Robotics and Its Social Impacts (IEEE ARSO)

AB  - This paper presents an Extra Robotic Legs (XRL) system which is designed to assist in the human walking with carrying loads. The design and basic control of the XRL system are proposed, and performances of the system are verified by primary experiments. The main aim of the design is to enable the XRL system to generate enough power for assistance during the natural human walking with low self-weight. Two robotic legs are designed for the XRL system, and each leg has three degrees of freedom (DOFs): two rotational DOFs intersecting at one point on its basis, and one prismatic one along its length generating assistant forces. The prismatic DOF is driven by synchronous belts along a linear slider, and has a high linear velocity for dynamic walking assistance. A force control method is used to generate assistant forces. The final weight of our autonomous XRL system is 8.3 kg, lower than other relative autonomous systems in present. Primary experiments verify the functional performances of the XRL system. This work may inspire other XRL designs and can expand the applications of wearable robots in daily life.

TI  - A change detection framework by fusing threshold and clustering methods for optical medium resolution remote sensing images
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In change detection (CD) of medium-resolution remote sensing images, the threshold and clustering methods are two kinds of the most popular ones. It is found that the threshold method of the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm usually generates a CD map including many false alarms but almost detecting all changes, and the fuzzy local information c-means algorithm (FLICM) obtains a homogenous CD map but with some missed detections. Therefore, a framework is designed to improve CD results by fusing the advantages of the threshold and clustering methods. The CD map generated by the clustering method of FLICM is used to remove false alarms in the CD map obtained by EM threshold method by an overlap fusion. Then, the local Markov random field model is implemented to verify the potentially missed detections. Finally, a fused CD map with less false alarms and missed detections is achieved. Two experiments were carried out on two Landsat ETM+ data sets. The proposed method obtained the least errors (1.11% and 3.51%) and the highest kappa coefficient (0.9366 and 0.8834), respectively, when compared with five popular CD methods.

T2  - FIFTH SYMPOSIUM ON NOVEL OPTOELECTRONIC DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th Symposium on Novel Optoelectronic Detection Technology and Application
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - In order to improve the estimation accuracy of Soil Moisture Content (SMC) by hyperspectral technology, the paper used actual measured spectral data to study quantitative relationship between soil hyperspectral reflectance and the SMC. All total of soil samples from the Puzhehei Scenic Spot in Qiubei County, Yunnan Province in December 2016 were measured in the lab with the spectrometer. This paper used the original reflectivity of the soil samples and its four mathematical transformations as the inversion indicators to construct Unary Linear Regression Model (ULRM), Multiple Stepwise Regression Model (MSRM) and Partial Least Squares Regression Model (PLSRM) aiming to compare the performance and inversion accuracy of these three models, and find the best performance model to inverse the SMC. The results showed that: (1) It was determined that 1350nm, 1450nm, 1841nm, 1897nm, 1905nm, 1935nm and 2146nm were the hyper-spectral characteristic bands of SMC by analyzing the correlation between soil moisture content and reflectance. (2) The coefficients of determinations R-2 varied between 0.73 and 0.91 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ranged from 1.51 to 1.86 with the best performance obtained with the PLSM, and the LRM had the lowest inversion accuracy. (3) The PLSRM established by the logarithm of the reflectivity of 1450nm, 1841nm, 1897nm, 1905nm, 1935nm and 2146nm was the best model of the 15 models by comparing the inversion precision of the samples in each model in this study.

TI  - Application of Satellite Data Assimilation in Monitoring the atmospheric duct
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The evaporation of the sea surface water causes significant changes in the vertical atmospheric environment, which in turn changes the refracting way of the radio wave. It affects the propagation path and the field strength of the radio wave, and has an important impact on the electronic systems such as radar and communication operating. However, there is still a lack of real-time and effective monitoring of the radio wave environment. Hyperspectral infrared data can provide a wide range of temperature and humidity profiles, which are the factors that directly affects refractive index calculation. In this study, regional assimilation of hyperspectral infrared radiances was carried out in a community assimilation system, using GSI coupled with the WRF model, to improve the retrieval of temperature and humidity profiles. The results show that the meteorological field after assimilation can effectively improve the accuracy of the atmospheric duct monitoring.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of the Ocean, Sea Ice, Coastal Waters, and Large Water Regions held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Sea surface salinity of ocean waters has been obtained from L-band microwave radiometer on satellite, such SMOS, Aquarius and SMAP. It provides a new technology and way to observe the salinity over large region from space. However, it is still difficult to get the sea surface salinity of the coastal waters due to that the effect on satellite-observed microwave radiance of radio frequency interference over near-shore regions. Fortunately, the colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) has conservative or semi-conservative property in the freshwater areas of coastal rivers and it has a good linear correlation between the absorption coefficient of CDOM and salinity. Based on those, a conservative mixing relationship between the fresh water from the Pearl River and the sea water from the South China Sea are established and the distribution of sea surface salinity from MODIS-retrieved absorption coefficient of CDOM (a(CDOM)) at 355nm wavelength in this study. The linear relationship between salinity and a(CDOM) at 355 nm under conservative mixing conditions can be established from the in-situ observed salinity and MODIS-retrieved a(CDOM) at 355 nm at the central water mass in the Pearl River Estuary and the northern basin region of South China Sea. By comparing daily observed MODIS-retrieved sea surface salinity with the in-site observed salinity, it shows that the salinity retrieved from satellite-based a(CDOM) has good agreement with observations, and it can better capture the location of low salinity fresh water in the Pearl River. For the summer averaged satellite-based salinity from 2002 to 2018, sea surface salinity are gradually increases from the vertical coastline to the sea in the Pearl River Estuary region. The salinity in coastal region is low by the effect of the Pearl River diluted water, and the salinity in offshore region is high. On average, the distribution of salinity shows that the diffusion of fresh water from the Pearl River generally spread along the coastline to the east and west in summer, while the runoff on the westward is larger and on the eastward it is affected by some flushing water of other rivers. In the future, MODIS-retrieved salinity can be as a supplement to salinity inversion of Microwave radiometer in the coastal region.

TI  - Integrating Risk-Based Care for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in the Community: Study Protocol for a Cluster Randomized Trial
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY HEALTH AND DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A risk-based model of care for managing patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation (KFRE) has been successfully integrated into nephrology care pathways in several jurisdictions. However, as most patients with CKD can be managed in primary care, the next pertinent steps would be to integrate the KFRE into primary care pathways.Objective: Using a risk-based approach for guiding CKD care in the primary care setting, the objective of the study is to develop, implement, and evaluate tools that can be used by patients and providers.Design: This study is a multicenter cluster randomized control trial.Setting: Thirty-two primary care clinics belonging to the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) across Manitoba and Alberta.Patients: All patients at least 18 years old or older with CKD categories G3-G5 attending the participating clinics; we estimate each clinic will have an average of 185 patients with CKD.Methods: Thirty-two primary care clinics will be randomized to receive either an active knowledge translation intervention or no intervention. The intervention involves the addition of the KFRE and decision aids to clinics' Data Presentation Tool (DPT), as well as patient-facing visual aids, a medical detailing visit, and sentinel feedback reports. Control clinics will only be exposed to current guidelines for CKD management, without active dissemination.Measurements: Data from the CPCSSN repository will be used to assess whether a risk-based care approach affected management of CKD. Primary outcomes are as follows: the proportion of patients with measured urine albuminto-creatinine ratio, and the proportion of patients being appropriately treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers. Secondary outcomes are as follows: the optimal management of diabetes (hemoglobin AIC <8.5%, and the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in CKD G3 patients), hypertension (office blood pressure <130/80 for patients with diabetes, 140/90 for those without), and cardiovascular risk (statin prescription); prescriptions of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; and decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In addition, in a substudy, we will measure CKD-specific health literacy and trust in physician care via surveys administered in the clinic post-visit. At the provider level, we will measure satisfaction with the risk prediction tools. Lastly, at the health system level, outcomes include cost of CKD care, and appropriate referrals for patients at high risk of kidney failure based on provincial guidelines. Primary and secondary outcomes will be measured at the patient level and enumerated at the clinic level 1 year after the intervention implementation, except for decline in eGFR, which will be measured 2 years postintervention.Limitations: Limitations include scalability of the proposal in other health care systems.Conclusions: If successful, this intervention has the potential to improve the management of patients with CKD within Canadian primary care settings, leading to health and economic benefits, and influencing practice guidelines.

TI  - Developing influenza and respiratory syncytial virus activity thresholds for syndromic surveillance in England
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are common causes of respiratory tract infections and place a burden on health services each winter. Systems to describe the timing and intensity of such activity will improve the public health response and deployment of interventions to these pressures. Here we develop early warning and activity intensity thresholds for monitoring influenza and RSV using two novel data sources: general practitioner out-ofhours consultations (GP OOH) and telehealth calls (NHS 111). Moving Epidemic Method (MEM) thresholds were developed for winter 2017-2018. The NHS 111 cold/flu threshold was breached several weeks in advance of other systems. The NHS 111 RSV epidemic threshold was breached in week 41, in advance of RSV laboratory reporting. Combining the use of MEM thresholds with daily monitoring of NHS 111 and GP OOH syndromic surveillance systems provides the potential to alert to threshold breaches in real-time. An advantage of using thresholds across different health systems is the ability to capture a range of healthcare-seeking behaviour, which may reflect differences in disease severity. This study also provides a quantifiable measure of seasonal RSV activity, which contributes to our understanding of RSV activity in advance of the potential introduction of new RSV vaccines.

TI  - Why Is Early Adolescence So Pivotal in the Climate Change Communication and Education Arena?
T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ROLE OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This paper explores the characteristics that make young adolescents (12-13-year olds) ideal 'change agents' in the climate science communication arena. We argue that this age group is at a pivotal age for cultivating public opinion, broadening awareness of the science and leveraging this knowledge to promote climate-friendly policy and governance. We examine the physiological and social characteristics that make young adolescents such an ideal age group. These characteristics involve intellectual development, cultivation of self-determination, and emergence of the adolescent into society-and how these characteristics can be utilised to create better communication and education tools, methods and strategies. We hope that this paper will help educators and communicators ensure climate science communication is tailored to be cost-effective, accurately designed and appropriately scaled to this key demographic. This work contributes to climate science communication and advances existing understanding of climate science communication frameworks for this specific audience.

TI  - Developing a Climate Literacy Framework for Upper Secondary Students
T2  - CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE ROLE OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - While changes to our climate become more apparent and prevalent, adequate understanding in the broader public arena of the causes behind this phenomenon continue to be poor and incomplete. Education remains an essential tool for establishing an informed opinion as well as ensuring students are ready to enter society as adults. To this end, this paper explores the development of a climate literacy framework tested at a secondary school in each Australia and Norway. The pedagogy and curriculum are designed to provide a science-based overview of knowledge relating to climate science and climate change in the upper secondary age group. Measuring existing climate literacy at 53.62% (n = 99) we show that, not only are knowledge deficits shared across borders (culture, language, education systems) there are distinct differences in the understanding of domain-specific aspects in climate science. While no difference between the knowledge domains for the domains related to climate science, there were statistically significant differences in those domains related to drivers of natural climate variation and the impacts and consequences associated with climate change. Furthermore, our findings suggest that, while climate change is taught in secondary school in these two countries, very little improvement in understanding regarding the scientific is made during the secondary school period. We argue that too much focus is put on the consequences and impacts of climate change in the secondary classroom and too little effort if made to improve climate literacy in the physical science basis of natural climate variation and the physical causes and mechanisms underlying climate science. Our study supports previous research which shows that the consequences and impacts of climate change should be only taught after the physical science basis of climate change has been learnt. Our findings also support previous research that recommends that climate literacy interventions should begin in early adolescence and traverse the climate science curriculum in the following order: KD1: Earth in the solar system; KD2: Greenhouse Gas molecules; KD3: Albedo; KD4: Earth's atmosphere before introducing KD5: natural climate variability; KD6: Feedbacks and climate instability; and KD7: Anthropogenic emissions. By teaching climate science in this way, we will ensure our youth are adequately informed about the issue prior to their emergence into society and we may reduce worldview bias and post-fact rhetoric.

CL  - Washington, DC
AB  - In this work, we present a methodology for monitoring man-made, construction-like activities in low-resolution SAR imagery. Our source of data is the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite which provides global coverage at a 12-day revisit rate. Despite limitations in resolution, our methodology enables us to monitor activity levels (i.e. presence of vehicles, equipment) of a pre-defined location by analyzing the texture of detected SAR imagery. Using an exploratory dataset, we trained a support vector machine (SVM), a random binary forest, and a fully-connected neural network for classification. We use Haralick texture features in the VV and VH polarization channels as the input features to our classifiers. Each classifier showed promising results in being able to distinguish between two possible types of construction-site activity levels. This paper documents a case study that is centered around monitoring the construction process for oil and gas fracking wells.

TI  - Adipose-only sentinel lymph nodes: a finding during the adaptation of a sentinel lymph node mapping algorithm with indocyanine green in women with endometrial cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To identify factors that affect successful adaptation of sentinel lymph node mapping and those that lead to unintended adipose-only sentinel lymph node identification.Methods Surgical and pathological data were prospectively collected on patients with endometrial cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node mapping with indocyanine green with or without pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph node dissection between November 2013 and April 2017. All mapping cases were performed with the robotic system. Adipose-only specimens were defined as a sentinel lymph node without a pathologically identified lymph node after ultrastaging.Results A total of 202 patients were included: 83% had endometrioid pathology, 12% serous, 3% carcinosarcoma, and 2% clear cell, with mixed pathology noted in 2%. The bilateral sentinel lymph node detection rate was 66%, and the rate of mapping at least a unilateral sentinel lymph node was 86%. Neither the bilateral nor the unilateral sentinel lymph node mapping rate changed with increased surgeon experience. The rate of adipose-only sentinel lymph node identification was more frequent when comparing the first 10 cases (37%), cases 11 - 30 (28%), and > 30 cases (9%) (P = 0.006). Body mass index > 30 kg/m(2), uterine fibroids, The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) grade, and histology were not found to have a statistically significant impact on either sentinel lymph node identification or adipose-only sentinel lymph node identification. Adipose-only sentinel lymph nodes were more likely with increased time from cervical injection to identification of the sentinel lymph node in the right hemipelvis. The median range was 28 min (14-73) for true sentinel lymph node identification vs 33 min (23-74) for adipose-only sentinel lymph node identification (P = 0.02).Conclusion Patient and surgeon factors did not impact the identification of sentinel lymph nodes over time. Adipose-only sentinel lymph nodes were more frequently identified in the initial cases and represent a potential complication to adapting sentinel lymph node biopsy without lymphadenectomy. The increase in adipose-only sentinel lymph node identification that was associated with time from cervical injection may represent delayed or disrupted uptake of indocyanine green.

AB  - Satellite-based surveillance of volcanic hot spots and plumes can be coupled with modeling to allow ensemble-based approaches to crisis response. We complete benchmark tests on an effusive crisis response protocol aimed at delivering product for use in tracking lava flows. The response involves integration of four models: MIROVA for discharge rate (TADR), the ASTER urgent response protocol for delivery of high-spatial resolution satellite data, DOWNFLOW for flow path projections, and PyFLOWGO for flow run-out. We test the protocol using the data feed available during Piton de la Fournaise's April-May 2018 eruption, with product being delivered to the Observatoire du Piton de la Fournaise. The response was initialized by an alert at 19:50Z on 27 April 2018. Initially DOWNFLOW-FLOWGO were run using TADRs typical of Piton de la Fournaise, and revealed that flow at >120 m(3)/s could reach the island belt road. The first TADR (10-20 m(3)/s) was available at 09:55Z on 28 April, and gave flow run-outs of 1.2 - 2.5 km. The latency between satellite overpass and TADR provision was 105 minutes, with the model result being posted 15 minutes later. An InSAR image pair was completed six hours after the eruption began, and gave a flow length of 1.8 km; validating the run-out projection. Thereafter, run-outs were updated with each new TADR, and checked against flow lengths reported from InSAR and ASTER mapping. In all, 35 TADRs and 15 InSAR image pairs were processed during the 35-day-long eruption, and 11 ASTER images were delivered.

TI  - Cartilage-sparing surgery for melanoma of the external ear
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The excision of melanoma of the external ear poses a challenge to surgeons, who must achieve adequate oncological control while minimising impact on form and function. Cartilage-preserving surgery is an attractive option, as it leaves behind a scaffold for immediate reconstruction with a variety of techniques including full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) and local flaps. This manuscript will review the literature comparing cartilage-sparing surgery with composite excision of the skin and the cartilage for the treatment of auricular melanoma. We report the results of a 17 year experience of using both techniques, together with sentinel node biopsy at our centre.Methods: A structured review of MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted to evaluate all studies reporting local recurrence or survival rates for melanoma of the external ear treated with cartilage-preserving surgery. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing wide local excision (WLE) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for auricular melanoma at our centre between 2000 and 2017 was performed.Results: Of 40 patients identified, 29 underwent cartilage-preserving surgery with no local recurrences or evidence of perichondral involvement. There was one local recurrence out of 11 patients who had their cartilage excised. There were no significant differences in recurrence rates or melanoma-specific survival rates when comparing cartilage-preserving and cartilage-sparing surgery. Our results are supported by the literature review, which suggests that cartilage-sparing surgery is gaining acceptance as a safe practice.

AB  - A filter is a device or instrument which is able to pass a specific signal and also remove other signals. There are several types of optical filters: bandpass filter, long-pass filter, and short-pass filter. The next microsatellite developed by Satellite Technology Center is LAPAN-A4 Satellite. This satellite brings Medium Resolution Multispectral Imager (MRI) using SLIM4 and also Experiment LAPAN Line Imager Space Application (ELLISA). Moreover, this satellite also brings thermal imager which is called microbolometer, and experiment Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) camera. Especially for spectral band Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) cameras in LAPAN-A4 satellite will be narrowed down to 10.4 mu m - 12.5 mu m, therefore a band filter is needed for blocking and passing these wavelengths. The method used to design the optical bandpass filter LWIR microbolometer camera is by determining the required spectral response. The response spectral required refers to the LANDSAT 8 Thermal Infrared Sensors (TIRS) bands 10 and 11 with spectral response 10.60-12.51 mu m, Centre Wavelength (CWL) of band 10 and 11 are 10.9 mu m and 12.0 mu m, and Full-Width Half-Maximum (FWHM) of both band are 0.6 mu m and 1 mu m), and also determine the substrate filter material to be used. The design results show that, the LWIR bandpass filter has a spectral response of 10.4 - 12.5 mu m, CWL 11.45 mu m, and FWHM 2.1 mu m, max peak transmission is 80.21%, and capable of blocking at wavelengths of 7-10.4 mu m and 13-16.5 mu m, the material used in this design uses Germanium (Ge) because it has a wavelength of 2-16 mu m which can work on spectral IR transmission.

TI  - Abdominal Hysterectomy
T2  - SURGERY FOR GYNECOLOGIC CANCER
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Hysterectomy is the most common major operation performed by gynecologic surgeons. There are many indications for abdominal simple (extrafascial) hysterectomy. In high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), especially cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3, more conservative treatments such as laser conization or the loop electrosurgical excision procedure have been introduced and are effective, making hysterectomy unnecessary in most women. However, for patients with recurrent HSIL (CIN3) who do not wish to preserve fertility, hysterectomy may be an appropriate treatment option. This decision must be made after a thorough discussion between the patient and her physician. Currently, the indications for abdominal hysterectomy are recurrence following conservative treatment for HSIL (CIN3); HSIL (CIN3) with residual disease; adenocarcinoma in situ, with or without a positive surgical margin; International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA1 disease without lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI); FIGO stage IA1 with LVSI; and central recurrent or residual cervical disease in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed along with the uterus, depending on the patient's age and a variety of other factors, such as a high risk of ovarian cancer with an identified BRCA 1/2 germline mutation. Gynecologic surgeons must be aware of the potential complications of hysterectomy: infection, venous thromboembolism, urinary tract injury, bowel injury, bleeding, and vaginal cuff dehiscence. Based on the results of several prospective trials, patients with low-risk, early-stage cervical cancer, a tumor size <2 cm, stromal invasion <10 mm, and no LVSI may be appropriate candidates for less radical surgery, including simple hysterectomy, simple trachelectomy, or cervical conization, with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy or pelvic lymphadenectomy.

AB  - Mangrove forests are commonly found along coastal line where they grow in saline soil and brackish water. With the advantage of new technology, mangrove distribution information can be studied by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technique. This study is to analyse the mangrove distribution changes using GIS over Mukim Kuala Selangor, Malaysia of years 2014, 2016 and 2018. Through this study, area selection technique from Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS data was used in image processing. Supervised and unsupervised classification were applied in image processing along with the maximum likelihood classification. The findings of this study show that there were changes occured essentially on mangrove area at the study area. Therefore, it is hoped that this study can help stakeholders for the management of mangrove distribution as well as the other land cover which is vital to provide ecological balance and essential services for the community.

AB  - This study further explores the capability of very high-resolution Worldview-2 satellite image, which has four additional bands namely Coastal, Yellow, Red edge and Near-Infrared 2 in order to discriminate various types of urban land-cover features, as well as to determine the most potential band to extract features in the study area. By analyzing spectral information extract from statistical reflectance value, the potential spectral band that can be used to discriminate spectrally similar features can be determined. The output of this study is crucial as an information provider for further classification processing step via object-based image analysis approached. It is vital to have the information on the spectral characteristic of each spectral bands to extract specific urban features in order to set up appropriate ruleset as well as segmentation parameter later on based on result determine from this study.

AB  - Land cover classification is an essential process in remote sensing work flow. For this purpose, supervised methods have been preferred by many researchers due to its practicality and accuracy compared to unsupervised methods. Nevertheless there have been very minimal effort to evaluate the performance of different supervised methods particularly for tropical land covers such as those in Malaysia. The study reported in this paper aims to detect land cover changes using multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing data. The data come from Landsat TM satellite covering the area of Klang, located in Selangor, Malaysia. Landsat bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are used as the input for three supervised classification methods namely maximum likelihood (ML), neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Region of interests (ROI) are drawn for each of the land cover classes in order to extract the training sets. The accuracy of the generated classifications are then assessed by comparing the classifications with a reference data set using a confusion matrix in which showing SVM gives a more stable and realistic results compared to ML and NN.

AB  - We present postseismic deformation following the Kumamoto, Japan, earthquake sequence in April, 2016 detected with InSAR during similar to 2 years. We process ALOS2-/PAL SAR-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR images that were acquired right after the mainshock. We detected concentrated defounations along the source faults, Futagawa and Hinagu faults, as well as off-fault deformations. We found LOS displacement consistent with right lateral motion of Futagawa and Hinagu faults, which implies afterslip of causative faults. Displacements locally exceed 10 cm during 2 years. We observe various patterns of temporal evolution of LOC changes. LOS decayed with time constant of about 200 days in a part, while LOS changes accelerated in summer of 2016 in other area. LOS changes also appear to correlate to geology.

AB  - Ship classification based on remote sensing data is an important task of maritime/sea border security and surveillance applications. Therefore, in this research, ship classification was performed by using deep learning aiming for improving the accuracy of ship classification with respect to conventional approaches. The research focuses on not only ship or non-ship classification but also ship classification by its type and length, which is difficult using such filtering methods as CFAR and a standard deviation filter. The ship type classification resulted in promising accuracy for specific ship types with distinguishable features from SAR images. The ship length classification error resulted in 26% on average. Moreover, this research could classify ship or not with equivalent accuracy as GPU by using FPGA.

TI  - Laser scanning module with large sending aperture and inherent high angular position accuracy for 3D LiDAR
T2  - OPTICAL SENSORS 2019
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Optical Sensors
CL  - Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC
AB  - One design of state of the art laser scanner systems in automotive applications is based on oscillating mirror modules. The requirement of a large mirror surface for eye-safe transmission beams is a major drawback for fast and reproducible scanning. Tolerances of angular positioning, position sensing as well as vibrational perturbations limit the position accuracy of such a mirror and thus, the accuracy of the transmission spot position in the field of view (FoV). In contrast to scanner modules, Flash LiDAR systems provide high accuracy of spot positions. However, due to simultaneous illumination of the entire FoV, the maximum measurable range degrades. Our approach for a scanner module, presented in this paper, combines a micro lens array (MLA) with an objective lens for generating one optical telescope assembly for each angular scan position exclusively. The consequence is a maximum transmission beam diameter without angular FoV reduction along with minimum mirror dimensions. In order to avoid shadings between adjacent scan spots in the target distance, created by beam cut-offs at the aperture-stop of the objective lens, an array of optimized optical elements is provided additionally to the MLA. With adequate design of the MLA, the reliability of the scanner module regarding the angular positioning accuracy increases significantly. We demonstrate that the noise of the spot position is suppressed in dependence on the aperture-stop dimensions of the MLA. In conclusion, we present a new solution for a 3D LiDAR scanner module with a reliable spot-position accuracy comparable to 3D-camera/Flash LiDAR systems but with higher distance measurement range.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF CHEST DISEASES AND TUBERCULOSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRespiratory viral and atypical bacterial infections data in Egyptian patients are sparse. This study described the epidemiological pattern of viral and atypical bacteria as causes for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) in hospitalized patients in Egypt.Patients and methodsSARI surveillance was carried out at a Teaching University Hospital during the period 2010-2014. All hospitalized adults and pediatric patients meeting the WHO case definition criteria for SARI were enrolled. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected and samples were tested using reverse transcription-PCR for influenza A, B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, 3, 4, adenovirus, human bocavirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, and atypical bacteria (Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Legionella spp.).ResultsOverall, 1075/3207 (33.5%) cases had a viral etiology, and included 912 (84.4%) women and 163 (15.6%) men, with a mean age of 5.74 +/- 13.87 years. The highest rates were reported for respiratory syncytial virus (485 cases, 45.2%), parainfluenza virus (125, 11.6%), and adenovirus (105, 9.8%). Single viral etiology was reported in 901 (83.3%), while 174 (16.7%) cases had multiple etiologies. Children had a higher rate (981, 91.2%) compared with 94 (8.8%) cases in adults. Only three and one cases were positive for Mycoplasma spp. and Chlamydia spp. infections, respectively. Neither coronavirus nor Legionella spp. were detected.ConclusionViral infections were encountered in one-third of hospitalized Egyptian adult and pediatric patients with SARI. Atypical bacteria had a minor role in SARI in our locality. Ongoing surveillance programs will better describe the epidemiology of SARI and will provide specific data to enable decision makers to take appropriate prevention measures.

TI  - Writing on the Walls: Discourses on Bolivian Immigrants in Chilean Meme Humor
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Internet memes have become a popular form through which northern Chileans express frustrations with their marginalization on global, national, and local levels. At the same time, many of these memes criticize Bolivian immigrants for using resources and taking jobs from "true Chileans." The humorous nature of these texts mitigates the extremity of embedded racial and nationalist ideologies, which are more explicitly expressed in political speech, news media, and quotidian language. This article uses critical discourse analysis to trace ideological formations across multiple online and offline instantiations, making visible a continuum of extreme speech. Through these connections, we see how anti-immigrant discourses position northern residents in a formation of nested marginality. Memes are thus a central way that disenfranchised Chilean citizens reinforce a worldview in which they consider themselves deserving of greater access to resources than Bolivians, precisely because of their marginalized position in relation to the nation.

TI  - An approach to examining performances of cool/hot sources in mitigating/enhancing land surface temperature under different temperature backgrounds based on landsat 8 image
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies on urban heat island (UHI) effects have examined relationships between land use/land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST), while impacts of environmental temperatures on these relationships have received little attention. This paper has investigated how background temperature affects performances of cool/hot sources in either enhancing or mitigating LST in Shenyang, China based on Landsat 8 image. In specific, according to the method of standard classification method with an interval of 1.0 standard deviation, LST was classified into seven temperature levels: highest, higher, high, medium, low, lower and lowest. Afterwards, the seven levels were merged into three temperature zones (TZ), namely cold TZ (CTZ, highest, higher and high), neutral TZ (NTZ, medium) and hot TZ (HTZ, low, lower and lowest), for investigating relationships between LST and LULC (including building (BU), road (RO), bare land (BA), green land (GR), agricultural land (AG) and water bodies (WA)). LST generally follows the order of BU > RO > BA > AR > GR > WA, but temperature differences between cool/hot sources reduce as background temperature increases. LULC-LST relationships vary greatly with background temperature. Overall, BU and RO have significant positive relationships with LST, while negative relationships are found among GR, AR, WA and LST. However, in CTZ, RO is in negative relationships with LST, GR and WA are no longer significant in NTZ, and GR and BA play significant positive roles in aggravating LST in HTZ. Generally, this study can help orientate scientific decisions in urban environmental governance.

AB  - With the rapid development of earth-observation technologies, different kinds of remote-sensing data are available, including SAR, multi-spectral optical data and hyper-spectral optical data. Remote sensing is already in an era of big data, which results in great challenges of information services. On the one hand, the potential value behind remote-sensing data has not yet been effectively mined for the thematic applications; on the other hand, for some emergency applications such as quick response of natural disasters (earthquake, forest fires, etc.), remote-sensing data and its derived information should be instantly processed and provided. However, the traditional data service mode of remote sensing is unable to meet the needs of such kind of applications. This paper proposes a concept of information services for big remote sensing data based on the needs of remote-sensing applications. The challenges of a big remote sensing data service are first discussed, and then the concept, framework, and key technologies of information service for big remote sensing data are also addressed.

With the verification to the real situation, the process of the hurricane rainstorm is well simulated by WRF in this case that it could basically show the hurricane evolution. In order to analyze the inner structure, the nadiral satellite-based observations were matched between the Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) instrument aboard the FY-3C polar-orbiting platform to retrieve atmospheric profiles. Then use the simulation results with high spatial and temporal resolution to do diagnostic analysis on the short term heavy rainstorm caused by Matthew, with a comparison between best track and forecasting tracks using active and passive microwave observations from WRFDA model.

TI  - The impact of the terrain effect on land surface temperature variation based on Landsat-8 observations in mountainous areas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous areas, land surface temperature (LST) exhibits a high spatial heterogeneity due to the influences from the changes in surface topographic factors (elevation, aspect, and slope), vegetation coverage, surface solar radiation, and other factors. Two small river basins located in the northeast and southwest of China were selected as the study areas to perform quantitative analysis and specify the terrain effect on the LST. Both summer and winter images were acquired from Landsat-8 for each study area. The LST variability was assessed by applying a linear regression against the key factors to discriminate the significance of them. The results illustrated the strong inverse relationship between the LST and the elevation for both study areas, with the LST lapse rate ranging from 7.6 to 13.8 degrees C km(-1), and the summer images had a higher value than the winter images. Furthermore, regarding the effects from the changes in surface aspect and slope, the analysis at different aspects indicated a similar directional pattern for the lapse rate and showed that the southern aspect usually had the highest rate in both study areas. In addition, the lapse rate had an obviously negative relationship with the increase in the local solar zenith angle. Moreover, the condition of the vegetation cover was also a key factor that influenced the lapse rate by changing the thermal property of the land surface. Finally, the solar radiation effect on LST was investigated by analysing the relationship between the LST and the cumulative incoming solar radiation (CSR) at different elevation ranges. The average statistics from the linear regression between the LST and the CSR clearly indicated a different function of solar radiation in different seasons. The CSR effect on the LST was stronger in winter than in summer, and its impact decreased with the rise in the elevation according to the changing rate derived by the linear regression. Hence, this study provides valuable insights into the complexity of the spatio-temporal variability in LST and its driving factors, which can be used in future studies to analyse the response of the ecosystem to the changing climate.

AB  - Natural vegetation plays an important role in the ecological environment, because it has become an important indicator to evaluate the status of natural ecosystem. PUE (Precipitation Use Efficiency) has been widely used to evaluate ecosystem by utilizing the ratio of NPP (Net Primary Productivity) to precipitation. Focused on the status of Chinese natural vegetation growth, the precipitation data of 2423 meteorological stations in China from 2000 to 2015 were used to obtain the distribution of regional precipitation by spatial interpolation method. Meanwhile, the NPP spatial distribution data was extracted from MODIS remote sensing data from 2000 to 2015. So, the PUE of national vegetation distribution maps were obtained, and the PUE change trend of six typical natural vegetations was analyzed according to the location in China, which could be applied to evaluate the vegetation ecological status in long time series. The research could be helpful to provide references and evaluation criteria for the spatial-temporal response characteristics of ecological environment.

AB  - Based on the high temporal and spatial resolution of Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary meteorological satellite data and visibility observation data, the band and band combination was selected suitable for daytime sea fog identification in coastal areas of South China, including R-0.(64), NDVI , BT11.2- BT10.4, BT11.2- BT3.9 , BT11.2 etc, and taken into account the influence of solar elevation angle on the reflectivity channel, and constructed a new coastal fog monitoring model (SFM) in the coastal area of South China for the identification of sea fog in the coastal areas of South China And applications. According to the fog judgment standard promulgated by the China Meteorological Administration, the sea fog monitoring model (SFM) was used to remotely monitor the coastal fog events in South China from January to April 2018, and further used the three provinces of South China (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan). Visibility data from coastal and island observatories are verified. The results show that the accuracy of sea fog recognition based on SFM model is about 68.6%, which has a good business application prospect.

AB  - Many researchers focus on the problem of accurately and rapidly classifying regional landslide hazard, whose spectrum and shape are complicated and varied in remote sensing images. A large number of training examples with labels are necessary to construct predictive models in supervised classification, which are difficult to get strong supervision information due to the high cost of data labeling process for rapid regional landslides identification. Our methods use pre- and post-event MODIS NDVI products, and post-event SPOT-5 images to classify the landslide image during the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake based on semi-supervised learning model, which means that only a subset of training data are given with labels to train a good learner. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results are compared with state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is an accurate and rapid way to classify landslide images.

AB  - Surface shortwave albedo plays a crucial role in studying urban heat island, local and global radiation budget balance, and climate change. Through modifying the land cover and consequently surface reflectivity, urbanization may lead to substantial changes in surface albedo. China has undergone rapid and massive urbanization during the past 30 years. In order to explore the change of surface shortwave radiation budget caused by urbanization, an accurate and fine resolution surface albedo dataset is needed. Our previous efforts have been devoted to estimating 30m surface albedo from Landsat data, which has been validated with ground measurements distributed globally. In this study, we first examined the estimation accuracy of surface albedo at sites in China, from which the albedo estimation had a bias of 0.005, R-2 of 0.717, and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.053. Then, our albedo algorithm was applied to Landsat data over a few cities in China at different stages of - economic development, i.e. Shanghai, Wuhan, and Tai'an. The temporal and spatial change of albedo from 1986 to 2015 and its relationships with land cover change in those study regions were studied. The result shows that urban expansion has brought an increase in albedo in most of these cities, especially in the central district. The rate of albedo increase of Shanghai was the highest among these cities, which is 0.007 per decade, resulting in about 4.65 W/ m(2) increase of shortwave upward radiation per decade. Compared to previous research, this study provides more detailed albedo changes of cities at the community scale. The results can also serve as a benchmark for decision-makings to counteract climate change from future land cover changes and to improve urban microclimate research.

AB  - Recently, drought is recognized as a crucial factor on controlling inter-annual variations of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Remote sensing of hydrological and ecological land surface variables offers a very important aid for identifying the impact of droughts on terrestrial ecosystems. GLEAM soil moisture (SM), reconstructed GRACE terrestrial total terrestrial water storage change (TWS), GIMMS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), reconstructed continuous solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) data from OCO-2, and SIF data from SCIACHAMY and GOME-2, in conjunction with multiple carbon flux data and CRUNCEP meteorological data, were employed to study the drought impacts on the terrestrial ecosystems in Europe during 2001-2015. We found GLEAM SM and GRACE TWS can effectively detect hydrological anomalies for four reported strongest drought years on the continental scale, in line with evident reductions of terrestrial carbon uptake indicated by models. Most vegetation products agree well on indicating drought impacts, but with some unexpected inconsistencies. Also, these land products are able to reasonably indicate the spatial patterns of drought impacts on ecosystems. We highlight the importance of ensemble satellite land products in deepening the interpretation of drought impacts on terrestrial ecosystems, and also on examining carbon cycle models and identifying potential gaps in satellite data products within the context of drought-carbon cycle studies.

AB  - In recent years, satellite networks technology plays a more and more important role in military and commercial fields. To meet the different types of applications, a majority of countries and communication companies around the world have launched a large number of LEO satellites to space. For those satellites, the major task is to download their data which is collected from the space to earth stations (ESs). In order to maximize the throughput of data downloading from satellite to ESs, previous research work is extensively focused on how to efficiently allocate download time to satellites according to the contact time between ESs and satellites. However, seldom of them have considered the use of Inter-satellite links (ISLs) to offload data from heavily loaded Satellites to the light ones. In this paper, our goal is to optimize data downloading from satellites to one ES by using our ISLs routing method, which is based on the network flow model to offload data from the satellites that has surplus data to the satellites that has surplus contact time with ES. In our scheme, we allocate the download time to each satellite that has contact time with ES during the orbital period. Then, the satellite-to-satellite graph is constructed basis of the interaction time among satellites. After that, two virtual nodes that are used to avoid transmission conflict and congestion are introduced to each satellite. Finally, a network flow model is formulated based on ISLs among satellites and preflow-push algorithm is applied to find the global optimal solution. Extensive simulations show that our scheme can greatly improve efficiency of data downloading from satellites to ES.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) infection results in high mortality in infected horses and humans. Florida has been identified as an important source of EEEV epidemics to other states in the United States. In this study, we further characterized the epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics of EEEV in Florida. Epidemiological analysis of sentinel chicken seroconversion rates to EEEV infections during 2005-2016 suggested significant seasonality of EEEV activity in Florida. We observed significant annual activity of EEEV in the North and North Central regions, with little significant seasonality in the Panhandle region. Phylogenetic analysis of complete EEEV genome sequences from different host sources and regions in Florida during 1986-2014 revealed extensive genetic diversity and spatial dispersal of the virus within Florida and relatively more clustering of the viruses in the Panhandle region. We found no significant association between EEEV genetic variation and host source. Overall, our study revealed a complex epidemiological dynamic of EEEV within Florida, implicating the Panhandle region as a possible source of the virus with sustained year-round transmission. These findings will help in implementing targeted control measures that can have the most impact in reducing or eliminating EEEV and other mosquito-borne viral infections within Florida and in the rest of the United States.

TI  - Surveillance of animal diseases through implementation of a Bayesian spatio-temporal model: A simulation example with neurological syndromes in horses and West Nile Virus
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A potentially sensitive way to detect disease outbreaks is syndromic surveillance, i.e. monitoring the number of syndromes reported in the population of interest, comparing it to the baseline rate, and drawing conclusions about outbreaks using statistical methods. A decision maker may use the results to take disease control actions or to initiate enhanced epidemiological investigations. In addition to the total count of syndromes there are often additional pieces of information to consider when assessing the probability of an outbreak. This includes clustering of syndromes in space and time as well as historical data on the occurrence of syndromes, seasonality of the disease, etc. In this paper, we show how Bayesian theory for syndromic surveillance applies to the occurrence of neurological syndromes in horses in France. Neurological syndromes in horses may be connected e.g. to West Nile Virus (WNV), a zoonotic disease of growing concern for public health in Europe. A Bayesian method for spatio-temporal cluster detection of syndromes and for determining the probability of an outbreak is presented. It is shown how surveillance can be performed simultaneously for a specific class of diseases (WNV or diseases similar to WNV in terms of the information available to the system) and a non-specific class of diseases (not similar to WNV in terms of the information available to the system). We also discuss some new extensions to the spatio-temporal models and the computational algorithms involved. It is shown step-by-step how data from historical WNV outbreaks and surveillance data for neurological syndromes can be used for model construction. The model is implemented using a Gibbs sampling procedure, and its sensitivity and specificity is evaluated. Finally, it is illustrated how predictive modelling of syndromes can be useful for decision making in animal health surveillance.

AB  - This paper in conjunction with a Taoistic-philosophical world view has for its object an ideal origin of yangmin(養民) based on people’s whole life(全生) and conservative consciousness of life(重生), which is stressed out in the Yulgok’s ideas.In general, appreciations of an ideologic position Yulgok’s philosophical ideas retain can be seen as two perspectives. One the one hand his ideas equate to succession to traditional Confucianism in a process of continuity and development of Confucianism, but on the other, these construe a headstream of Silhak ideas as the ideal foundation to formulate Silhak in the developed Chosun-era.It is, however, possible that such division might lead Yulgok’s philosophical ideas, not only succession to conservative Neo-Confucianism with a focus on Jeongjuhak but also new interpretative as well as practical mechanism for Neo-Confucianism, into fallacy called narrowly dichotomous thinking. Notwithstanding this doubt, two different perspectives of his ideas imply a historical and epistemological question of how to evaluate ideological meanings and positions of Silahk and Donghak thought developed in formation (acceptance and evolvement) process of Confucius philosophy in the Chosun period.In this regard, an Taoistic-philosophical approach to Yulgok’s yangmin idea(養民思想) is to become an attempt to more objectively understand a Taoistic worldview functioning in his philosophical thought. To the extent that this would be a process of trying to pursue new perspective of interpreting his philosophical thought beyond the Taoistic-philosophical understanding centered on Confucianism, the Taoistic-philosophical attempt at his yangmin idea(養民思想) for social reformation of yangmin(養民) on the basis of a convergent worldview of igijimyo(理氣之妙) assumes the form of an inquiring procedure of a post-Neo-Confucian worldview with reference to his.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Freshwater as one of the most relevant resources for life is facing increasing human made pressures. Suitable information about the status of the water quality in lakes and rivers is sparse, although required for environmental assessments and impact monitoring: There is a vast demand on actual data in many countries, where water policies and management decisions are based on scarce and unreliable information. Satellite data with newest data analytics technologies can already contribute to this today with regular mapping and monitoring in freshwater systems: Consistent information of valuable water quality products are derived for single applications in small lakes, covering extended river basins or the whole world, as provided by the UNESCO World Water Quality Portal. A number of examples from this first global water quality portal is discussed, addressing ecological and economic issues in Africa. At the conceptual level, UNESCO and EOMAP advocate the long-term consistency of the data of these new measurement capabilities: Both satellite sensing and data processing technologies are rapidly evolving. Hence, nowadays concepts should already ensure that the data products are globally intercomparable and in future, even if the accuracy of information products become better and better. This ensures that the sustainable development goals can be supported with meaningful, comparable indicators over time.

T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KUNSTGESCHICHTE
M3  - Article
AB  - With his Reverse Perspective (1919) the Armeno-Russian theologian and mathematician Pavel Florensky denounced the monocular, 'cyclopean' vision otherwise seen as the main principle in Renaissance painting. Florensky connected the medieval icon with an 'organic idea' involving 1) binocular vision, 2) the observer's movement in pictorial space, and 3) tactile proximity between observer and image. This article explores how ideas of perception relate to Florensky's cultural criticism. His reverse perspective emerges as a complex controversy, not only between two principles in painting - the icon and the linear perspective. Florensky also challenges himself as a westernized intellectual, who, rooted in Orientalism, fails to defend a Russian Orthodox worldview.

AB  - In the past few decades number of Earth-observing satellites are continuously gathering information and only about 10 percent of the information is utilized by the users. With so much accessible information the researchers have not explored the datasets completely as there is absence of effective tool to process the information. MODIS data sensors have accessible data at various temporal and spatial resolutions. To productively use these datasets in open-source GIS programming like QGIS, there is a need to pre-process the dataset using a plug-in. The plug-in is built using python and PyQt interface for QGIS.The plug-in operates on MODIS Data (Terra/Aqua/Combined) computerizes and process the functionalities for MODIS products like MOD11, MOD09, MOD21. The processed datasets can be largely used in investigation of time series analysis for some earth resource application.

T2  - Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Despite many studies on suicide, the causation remains ambiguous, and there is a necessity for new all-inclusive methodology. Causal layer analysis (CLA) is a relatively new technique to deeply explore the etiologies of suicide in Iran. Methods: Causal layered analysis (CLA) combines empirical, interpretative, critical, and action research methods in comprehensive hierarchical layers of causality, like an iceberg. Layers begin from the first observable layer called litany to the deeper underneath layers, including systemic, worldview, and metaphor. In the litany layer, the general appearance of suicide in Iran was extracted through published evidence. In the systemic layer, observed quantitative results of litany was interpreted based on the short-term historical facts by conducting 30 semi-structured interviews with experts. In the worldview layer, 40 deep interviews with suicide attempt cases, 10 focus-groups among adolescents, and 20 semi-structured interviews with nurses and experts were conducted. In the myth and metaphor layer, the Persian poetry of the last century was studied and suicide notes and stories were reviewed. Results: Three causal models of CLA 1 (self-burning of women as an objection to the closed society), CLA 2 (duality of parent's addiction- divorce), CLA 3 (suicide as a reaction to the identity crisis) were extracted. Conclusion: Macrohistorical changes such as war, urbanization, and modernity have confronted the new the new generation with distinctive and unexpected realities in life, which are not similar to their dreams and old stories. Suicide is a reaction to this silent inner battle between old metaphors and new realities.

AB  - In this study, the viability of assessing drought insurance claims via remote sensing is explored. Time series of satellite images from the Sentinel-2 mission and weather data from the European Climate Assessment & Dataset are used to fit classifiers on historical loss data from an agricultural insurance. Two different approaches for training classifiers are explored, designing neural networks to learn directly on the time series and transforming the data to a fixed-size representation to enable the use of other methods. It is shown that in this case the second approach yields much better results, as careful feature engineering combined with more rigid methods like gradient boosting leads to less overfitting compared to the neural network approach.Compared to existing approaches, the proposed methods allow for analyzing the situation on a per-field level while using high resolution imagery (Sentinel-2) over a large geographic area.

AB  - In this paper, we present how multi-spectral Sentinel-2 satellite images can be used in a machine learning approach based on an encoder-decoder semantic segmentation network to map human settlements. We show the effectiveness of the proposed CNN approach for the mapping of settlements in experiments with 785 European cities. The proposed approach to learn a settlement mapping with noisy ground truth data results in an effective settlement segmentation network with a mean intersection over union of 80.55% and a pixel accuracy of 87.40%.

AB  - NovaSAR-1 is a technology demonstrator by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd, UK (SSTL), and Airbus Defence and Space Ltd, funded by the UK Government via the UK Space Agency (UKSA). The NovaSAR-1 satellite utilises S-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) providing medium and high resolution images of Earth from space. In September 2017, Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) became a partner with the UK and India in the NovaSAR-1 mission through a 10 percent time-share [1]. The agreement allows CSIRO to direct the NovaSAR-1 satellite to collect data imagery on a world-wide basis through a range of observation modes with priority over the Australian region for the duration of the 7 year mission. CSIRO has designed a detailed background-, and foreground acquisition strategy for our share of the NovaSAR-1 satellite. This will provide at least two annual wall-to-wall coverages of Australia's landmass as well as supporting a wide range of existing research and basic satellite data acquisition training, to further develop Australia's Earth observation data analytics expertise, and create new opportunities in the field of remote sensing.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Pittsburgh, PA
AB  - In the western United States, understanding the spatial distribution and magnitude of alpine snowpack is crucial for the prediction of water resources. However, ground observation networks are sparse, and snowpack models are often poorly-constrained by these observations. Spatially-continuous satellite data are available, yet only snow covered area (SCA) is easily monitored through this approach, despite the need for volumetric water content of the snow, or snow water equivalent. In this study, we investigate the potential to create spatially-continuous, computationally-efficient SWE maps that leverages in situ and remotely sensed snow information to improve understanding of spatial snowpack distribution across the West. A statistical model that integrates in situ and remotely-sensed snow disappearance observations for bias-corrected, spatially-continuous estimates of date of snow disappearance (DSD), with in situ peak SWE, distributed meteorology, and terrain data to produce a topographically-aware, annual estimate of peak SWE at a 500-m horizontal resolution. This lightweight, observationally-based snowpack model can be used to generate a high-resolution SWE dataset over large spatial areas useful for the development and validation of large-scale hydrologic models across the snow-dominated western U.S.

TI  - Crop RS-Met: A biophysical evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content model for crops based on proximal sensing and meteorological data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning, particularly in water-limited regions. Here, we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data (Crop RS-Met). The model, which is based on the dual FAO56 formulation, uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions. We tested the Crop RS-Met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat (Tridcum aestivum L. and T. durum) cultivars with diverse phenology. Crop RS-Met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season. The average R-2 of modeled vs. observed soil water content for all cultivars (N = 11) was 0.92 0.02 with average relative RMSE and bias of 9.29 1.30% and 0.13 0.03%, respectively. We found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in Crop RS-Met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions. Currently, Crop RS-Met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile. Thus, efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a Crop RS-Met model driven by high-resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics.

TI  - Which patients with sentinel node-positive breast cancer after breast conservation still receive completion axillary lymph node dissection in routine clinical practice?
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial, patients with 1 or 2 tumour-involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) gained no benefit from completion axillary lymph dissection (cALND). We examined implementation of evidence from this trial into routine clinical management.MethodsData were included from patients diagnosed with primary breast cancer in German breast cancer units between 2008 and 2015 and analysed retrospectively from a prospective maintained database. Descriptive analyses assessed time-trend changes in axillary surgery. Factors associated with cALND in patients with 1 or 2 positive SLNs were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.ResultsOverall, 179 breast cancer units provided data for 188,909 patients, of whom 13,741 (7.3%) had pT1/2cN0M0 invasive breast cancer with 1 or 2 tumour-involved SLNs and underwent breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. cALND use decreased from 94.6% in 2008 to 46.9% in 2015 (p<0.001). In multivariable analyses, the following factors were associated with cALND: fewer removed SLNs; two tumour-affected SLNs; younger age; lower annual case volume per hospital; higher tumour grade and lymphovascular invasion. No statistically significant influence was detected for hormone receptor or HER2 status.ConclusionIn our cohort, 7.3% of patients with primary breast cancer met the ACOSOG Z0011 inclusion criteria and could potentially have been spared the morbidity of cALND. cALND tended to be performed in patients with a higher axillary tumour burden. This study shows a shift towards less extensive axillary surgery through rapid implementation of new clinical trial evidence into routine clinical practice.

TI  - Automated LULC map production using deep neural networks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents an approach to automating the creation of land-use/land-cover classification (LULC) maps from satellite images using deep neural networks that were developed to perform semantic segmentation of natural images. This work is important since the production of accurate and timely LULC maps is becoming essential to government and private companies that rely on them for large-scale monitoring of land resource changes. In this work, deep neural networks are trained to classify each pixel of a satellite image into one of a number of LULC classes. The presented deep neural networks are all pre-trained using the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Competition (ILSVRC) datasets and then fine-tuned using approximately 19,000 Landsat 5/7 satellite images of resolution taken of the Province of Manitoba in Canada. The result is an automated solution that can produce LULC maps images significantly faster than current semi-automated methods. The contributions of this article are the observation that deep neural networks developed for semantic segmentation can be used to automate the task of producing LULC maps; the use of these networks to produce LULC maps; and a comparison of several popular semantic segmentation architectures for solving the problem of automated LULC map production.

TI  - Fire on the Water Towers: Mapping Burn Scars on Mount Kenya Using Satellite Data to Reconstruct Recent Fire History
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mount Kenya is one of Kenya's 'water towers', the headwaters for the country's major rivers including the Tana River and Ewaso Nyiro River, which provide water and hydroelectric power to the semiarid region. Fires affect water downstream, but are difficult to monitor given limited resources of local land management agencies. Satellite-based remote sensing has the potential to provide long term coverage of large remote areas on Mount Kenya, especially using the free Landsat data archive and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products. In this study, we mapped burn scars on Mount Kenya using 30 m Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) derived dNBR (change in normalized burn ratio) and MODIS active fire detection and burned area data for fires occurring from 2004 to 2015. We also analyzed topographic position (elevation, slope, aspect) of these fires using an ASTER global digital elevation model (GDEM v2) satellite-derived 30 m digital elevation model (DEM). Results indicate that dNBR images calculated from data acquired about one year apart were able to identify large fires on Mount Kenya that match locations (and timing) of MODIS active fire points and burned areas from the same time period, but we were unable to detect smaller and/or older fires.

TI  - The Underpinnings of Ageism: Multiple Mediational Model of Epistemological Style, Social Dominance Orientation, Right-Wing Authoritarianism, and Ageist Attitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to understand the psychological factors that may contribute to the development and endorsement of ageist belief systems. Dual process theory is used to examine how one's worldview, beliefs in social hierarchy, authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism predict ageist attitudes. Participants living in the United States (n = 407) in 49 states and territories were recruited through this online national study and completed surveys of their ageist beliefs, epistemological style, social dominance orientation (SDO), and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). RWA, SDO, and naive realism were all positively associated with ageist beliefs. A hypothesized path model and two alternative models suggested the retention of a model whereby naive realism led to RWA, which led to SDO, and finally to ageism. All possible direct and indirect effects were significant within the retained model, suggesting the presence of a multiple mediation. The fit of this model was superior to that of models testing alternative theoretical causal chains. naive realism may lead to authoritarian aggression, authoritarian submission, and conventionalism, which may then increase the value that people place on social hierarchies, and this may influence the development and retention of ageist beliefs. Helping people to understand what their basic beliefs about the world are and how they may play a role in the development of ageism may assist in reducing ageist attitudes.

TI  - Impacts of extreme rainfalls in the year 2006 to the vegetation cover on different geomorphological units of the central Kaukausib catchment, southern Namib Desert (Namibia)
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic and tempo-spatial development of land cover changes focussing on vegetation development as a result of extraordinary rainfalls in the hyper-arid southern Namib Desert in 2006 is analysed through the use of mid-scale remote sensing satellite imagery (Landsat 5) and the derivation of two vegetation indexes (NDVI & MSAVI2). Interpretation is supported by the analysis of morphometric parameters of the landscape derived from a Digital Elevation Model (Aster GDEM v2). Archived climate weather maps provide meteorological information of the synoptic situation of the atmosphere, forcing strong rainfalls in the southern Namib Desert between April 16 to 22, 2006. The results show, that rainfall was triggered by an Cut-off-Low from the temperate climate system of southern Africa reaching unusually far north and a Temperate Tropical Trough reaching unusually far south at the same time. Vegetation density vitality has its maximum three months after the strong rainfall, where in some regions of the study area a rather dense cover of annual and ephemeral grass occurred. In addition to intense changes in vegetation cover, the Anib and Arasab pans as part of the Kaukausib catchment were flooded for several months. The tripartite approach integrating meteorological, morphometric and biological aspects allows us to use this case study as one of the very rare opportunities to study regional scale vegetation changes in a hyper-arid area by the use of remote sensing techniques.Evidences for a recurrence of this phenomenon during the last 30 years in this region based on the study of archived data show that they have an interval between 5-11 years. Although the region gets mean annual average precipitation of less than 50 mm, it shows that these strong rainfalls are a common feature and might have a high significance for the regional and over-regional ecosystems. The understanding of this is very important, as the southwestern part of Namibia marks the critical boundary zone of sub-tropical to temperate frontal zones and is therefore a highly sensitive region with regard to climate changes and past circulation patterns, but also to predict future situations.

AB  - Spectral indices are algorithms performed to improve the signal of certain features, such as vegetation, water and soil in satellite images. The objective of this work was to utilize the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the ratio index for bright soil (RIBS) along with band compositing techniques in order to map and delineate the extent of the coastal ecosystems along the coasts of Oman, in terms of mangrove vegetation, wetlands, sabkhas and coral reefs, respectively. Satellite data were acquired from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) during 2018. Some oceanographic characteristics: tidal range, sea surface temperatures (SST) and the depth of the sea floor of Oman offshore region were also utilized to interpret the spatial extent of these coastal ecosystems. Results showed that the applied indices were efficient to highlight 14 locations of mangroves, 19 locations of wetlands, 2 locations of sabkha and 15 locations of coral reefs. It is observed that mangroves and wetlands are much related to high tidal range coasts, whereas coral reefs are contingent to shallow off-shores with SST of 22-30 degrees C. These corals occur either along the main coast or adjacent to the islands of the country. Sabkha and salt marshes occur along extended coastal flats of low-lying sandy coasts. The present study proved that the spectral indices are good surrogates to map coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Quantifying and contextualising cyclone-driven, extreme flood magnitudes in bedrock-influenced dryland rivers
T2  - ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In many drylands worldwide, rivers are subjected to episodic, extreme flood events and associated sediment stripping. These events may trigger transformations from mixed bedrock-alluvial channels characterised by high geomorphic and ecological diversity towards more dominantly bedrock channels with lower diversity. To date, hydrological and hydraulic data has tended to be limited for these bedrock-influenced dryland rivers, but recent advances in high-resolution data capture are enabling greater integration of different investigative approaches, which is helping to inform assessment of river response to changing hydroclimatic extremes. Here, we use field and remotely sensed data along with a novel 2D hydrodynamic modelling approach to estimate, for the first time, peak discharges that occurred during cyclone-driven floods in the Kruger National Park, eastern South Africa, in January 2012. We estimate peak discharges in the range of 4470-5630 m(3)s(-1) for the Sabie River (upstream catchment area 5715 km(2)) and 14,407-16,772 m(3)s(-1) for the Olifants River (upstream catchment area 53,820 km(2)). These estimates place both floods in the extreme category for each river, with the Olifants peak discharge ranking among the largest recorded or estimated for any southern African river in the last couple of hundred years. On both rivers, the floods resulted in significant changes to dryland river morphology, sediment flux and vegetation communities. Our modelling approach may be transferable to other sparsely gauged or ungauged rivers, and to sites where palaeoflood evidence is preserved. Against a backdrop of mounting evidence for global increases in hydroclimatic extremes, additional studies will help to refine our understanding of the relative and synergistic impacts of high-magnitude flood events on dryland river development.

TI  - Cosmopolitan cultures of childbirth. Contrasting its anthropological bases from the bioethical perspective
T2  - ACTA BIOETHICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this article has been to explore, from an ethical perspective, the main anthropological characteristics and bases of childbirth, trying to elucidate, from a personalist position, which patterns are more consistent with respect for maternal dignity and basic principles of bioethics. The methodology chosen was the documental), analysis, through the use of different databases in the field of medical, social and anthropological sciences. The results show bioethically antagonistic approaches, placing, on the one hand, two ontological reductions of a biological nature: medicalized and natural birth, and, on the other, a holistic approach: humanized birth. The first two break with the principle of autonomy and non-maleficiency, as the fate of the mothers is marked by their physiology, a nature that, from a medicalized perspective, is represented from the notions of "risk" and "fragility", leaving the mothers exposed to multiple iatrogenic clinical interventions; while, from the naturist worldview, it is perceived from the notion of "infallibility", which makes them hostages of their supposed anatomical perfection. Ethical conflicts that do not arise in the humanist model, when it represents mothers as global social subjects, who exceed any atomistic reductionism.

TI  - Family-Centered Culture Care: Touched by an Angel.
T2  - The Journal of clinical ethics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An Asian Indian Hindu family chose no intervention and hospice care for their newborn with hypoplastic right heart syndrome as an ethical option, and the newborn expired after five days. Professional nursing integrates values-based practice and evidence-based care with cultural humility when providing culturally responsive family-centered culture care. Each person's worldview is unique as influenced by culture, language, and religion, among other factors. The Nursing Team sought to understand this family's collective Indian Hindu worldview and end-of-life beliefs, values, and practices, in view of the unique aspects of the situation while the team integrated evidence-based strategies to provide family-centered culture care. Parental care choices conflicted with those of the Nursing Team, and some nurses experienced moral distress and cultural dissonance when negotiating their deeply held cultural and religious views to advocate for the family. The inability to reconcile and integrate a stressful or traumatic experience impacts nurses' well-being and contributes to compassion fatigue. Nurses need to be intentional in accessing interventions that promote coping and healing and moral resilience. Reflection and cultural humility, assessment, and knowledge in context, increase evidence-based culture care and positive outcomes. U.S. society's views on ethical behavior continue to evolve, and some may argue that the law should place more limits on parents' right to choose or to refuse treatment for their infants and children. Moral distress can lead to moral resilience and satisfaction of compassion when nurses provide family-centered culture care with cultural responsiveness and integrate values-based practice with evidence-based care, and aim to first do no harm.

AB  - Satellite imagery was used to assess the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of the plume at the Grijalva river mouth, Gulf of Mexico. The SSC was calculated with the algorithm of Topliss. The algorithm was created for Lansdast 5 MSS. For this study it was validated the results for Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI. The depth of the ocean floor was measured using the speedtech sounder. The spectral response was registered with a GER-1500 spectroradiometer (with a measurement range of 296.71-1092.08 nm). The spectral responses were used to determine the size of the suspended particles and to perform the atmospheric correction. Spectral responses indicate that silt size particles predominate near the river mouth, whereas clay overtakes further towards the open sea. The trend in the river when water meets seawater, means an increase of suspended sediment towards the surface due to the lower density of fresh water, and the amount of sediment rises in the open sea. The correlation between the measurements in situ and SSC values produced by the algorithm demonstrates that the operation is suitable to estimate suspended sediments.

TI  - Assessment of the CLASlite forest monitoring system in detecting disturbance from selective logging in the Selva Maya, Mexico
T2  - SILVA FENNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and monitoring forest disturbance from selective logging is necessary to develop effective strategies and polices that conserve tropical forests and mitigate climate change. We assessed the potential of using the remote sensing tool, CLASlite forest monitoring system, to detect disturbance from timber harvesting in four community forests (ejidos) of the Selva Maya on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Selective logging impacts (e.g. felling gaps, skid trails, logging roads and log landings) were mapped using GPS in the 2014 annual cutting areas (ACAs) of each ejido. We processed and analyzed two pre-harvest Landsat images (2001 and 2013) and one post-harvest image (November 2014) with the CLASlite system, producing maps of degraded, deforested and unlogged areas in each ACA. Based on reference points of disturbed (felling and skidding), deforested (log landings and roads) and unlogged areas in each ACA, we applied accuracy assessments which showed very low overall accuracies (<19.1%). Selective logging impacts, mainly from log landings and new logging road construction, were detected in only one ejido which had the highest logging intensity (7 m(3) ha(-1)).

TI  - Assessing and modeling the impact of land use and changes in land cover related to carbon storage in a western basin in Mexico
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) change in a hydrologic basin in the western coast of central Mexico and its regional variation in carbon storage. Three thematic maps (1986, 2001 and 2017) were produced by using pixel-based unsupervised classification techniques of Landsat images. LULC maps for 2017, 2033 and 2050 were modeled using a Cellular Automata Markov chain, validating their predictive power using Kappa variations. The InVEST software was used to estimate the carbon stored in four reservoirs, analyzing their variations over time (1986-2050). Accuracy assessment for the classifications revealed satisfactory results with an Overall accuracy of 83% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.76. Results show that the main landscape modifier was the exposed soils class increasing by 65% its extent in 1986, with a net increase around 87,900 ha. The evergreen forest (EF) and the tropical dry forest (TDF) classes showed a decrease along the period analyzed, displaying a net loss of 57,200 ha and 47,200 ha, respectively. Projected land cover changes followed the same trend observed, with a decreasing tendency in the EF and TDF coverages as consequence of exposed soil class increase. This change implies a reduction in the estimated total carbon stock, decreasing from 362.9 Tg C in 1986, to 336.2 Tg C in 2017. According to our model, if the trend detected in this analysis continues, it is expected a reduction to 317.9 Tg C in 2050. This approach combining Cellular Automata and Markov chain analysis with the InVEST model provides elements to estimate changes on carbon storage resulting from landscape changes. It also allows the identification of potential changes in the selected land use classes, providing with technical elements that could help to decision makers to better maintain the ecological integrity of the drainage basin.

AB  - Java's North Coast National Road also known as Jalur Pantura is a primary transportation corridor connecting Indonesian capital city of Jakarta and eastern part of Java Island. Interestingly, the road's greenbelt is located in Karawang Regency planted with various trees. From its diameter breast height (DBH) and height, above ground biomass (ABG) from these trees were estimated and then compared with four vegetation indices namely NDVI, SAVI, EVI and tasseled cap extracted from SPOT-7 satellite image. Furthermore, this study used predicted ABG values to generate carbon stock and carbon absorption ability. In addition, data from daily vehicle traffic observation will be employed to predict carbon emission. Estimated vehicle carbon emission then compared with carbon absorption ability for each road segment to observe how big trees can store carbon emission from vehicle. The information of carbon balance in each road segment, in form of comparison between carbon absorption ability with vehicle carbon emission, can be useful for road authority to increase vegetation especially in the areas of low carbon absorption.

TI  - Sea surface temperature, ocean color and wind forcing patterns in the Bay of La Paz, Gulf of California: Seasonal variability
T2  - ATMOSFERA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly climatologies are used to estimate the mean seasonal cycle of MODIS-Aqua satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), surface chlorophyll (Chl-a) and their relationship with surface wind stress curl (from the Cross-Calibrate Multi-Platform, CCMP) in the Bay of La Paz located in the southwestern Gulf of California, a region identified as having high biological productivity and significant seasonal variability. Harmonic fit applied to the monthly climatologies of these variables indicate a best fit with annual and semi-annual constituents. The annual amplitude was the dominant signal in both SST and Chl-a, corresponding to the bay-wide seasonal cycle of warming and cooling associated with the influx of upwelled nutrient-rich coastal waters jointly with the water exchange between the bay and the Gulf of California. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition yielded the annual and semi-annual patterns of the seasonal cycle that respond to wind forcing. The EOF1 explained 93% of the SST variance and 48% of the Chl-a variance, showing a homogeneous variability of both variables across the bay and a strong thermal and biological gradient in the vicinity of the Gulf of California with their corresponding amplitude time series representing out-of-phase annual cycles, which corresponded to the regional dynamics of wind forcing pattern. The EOF2 accounted for 6% of the SST variance and 31% of the Chl-a variance, which reached its peak during winter associated with the high Chl-a anomaly values (>1.5 mg m(-3)) observed along the coast. The intense biological productivity covaried strongly with the wind stress curl annual cycle (R = 0.5, P < 0.05), suggesting that these Chl-a blooms could be associated with coastal currents and upwelling events regulated by the seasonal wind forcing pattern playing an essential role in the modulation of this quasi-permanent biophysical coupling observed in the Bay of La Paz during an annual cycle.

CP  - 14th International Conference on Computing and Information Technology (IC2IT)
CL  - Chiang Mai, THAILAND
AB  - Mangroves are coastal vegetations that grow at the interface between land and sea. It can be found in tropical and subtropical tidal areas. Mangrove ecosystems have many ecological roles spans from forestry, fisheries, environmental conservation. The Indonesian archipelago is home to a large mangrove population which has enormous ecological value. This paper discusses mangrove land detection in the North Jakarta from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. One of the special characteristics of mangroves that are distinguishing them from another vegetation is their growing location. This characteristic makes mangrove classification using satellite imagery non trivial task. We need an advanced method that can confidently detect the mangrove ecosystem from the satellite images. The objective of this paper is to propose the robust algorithm using projection kurtosis and minimizing vector variance for mangrove land classification. The evaluation classification provides that the proposed algorithm has a good performance.

M3  - Journal Article

AB  - Tularaemia is a zoonotic disease, in Europe caused by Francisella tularensis subsp. holarctica. Many lagomorphs and a variety of small rodents are wildlife species prone to develop clinical disease, while predators and scavengers are relatively resistant and may serve as sentinels. Blood samples from 656 Swedish wild predators and scavengers were serologically investigated using slide agglutination and microagglutination. In the slide agglutination test, 34 seropositive animals were detected, and they were found among all species investigated: brown bear (Ursus arctos), Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), wild boar (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus) and wolverine (Gulo gulo). Due to haemolysis the microagglutination test was more difficult to read at low titres, and only 12 animals were classified as seropositive. F. tularensis subsp. holarctica was detected by a polymerase chain reaction in lymphatic tissues of the head in one brown bear, one red fox and one wolf. The significance of this finding regarding possible latency of infection is not clear. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that all predator and scavenger species included in this study may serve as sentinels for tularaemia in Sweden. Their role as reservoirs is unclear.

TI  - The Cyrillo-Methodian Cult and Religiosity in Slovakia from the 19th to the 21st Century
T2  - KONSTANTINOVE LISTY-CONSTANTINES LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper focuses on the significance of the Cyrillo-Methodian cult and it is based on the findings of the long-term research. It deals with the diffusion and maintenance of cultural heritage of Ss. Cyril and Methodius in modern Slovak history. One of the aims of the paper is to study the impact of the Cyrillo-Methodian cult within a wider context of religiosity of social groups and classes in Slovakia. It presents some specific features of the cult of Ss. Cyril and Methodius and their disciples in Slovakia, and highlights the impact of the current church-political situation on the growth of the cult and its influence on political, church and other professional institutions. Synchronic and diachronic approach used in interdisciplinary research allowed a complex view on the spread of the cult in specific historical periods in Slovakia. Historical analysis is followed by the author's reflections on how the Cyrillo-Methodian cultural heritage relates to the religious ethical level. The Solun brothers' mission emphasised piety (and a religious worldview per se) typical for the eastern religiosity. The study tries to define several aspects of the brothers' work; especially those which deal with the growth of the spiritual essence of the society. As the Second Vatican Council and the documents of Pope John Paul II show, these issues remain topical and inspiring even today.

AB  - Squall line is a rare MCS phenomenon happened in Indonesia. In these recent years, radar showed the existence of squall line pattern on 31 December 2017, 25 and 27 January 2018 in disparate spot in Indonesia. This study aims to find the common characteristic of squall lines that occurs in tropical region of Indonesia. The result shows a persistent elongated convective pattern with the trailing stratiform region extends over 100 km in more than 6 hours in all squall line events observed in this study. The average cloud top temperature below -45 degrees C indicates an abundant amount of ice crystals. Radar data analysis shows that reflectivity value and surface rainfall intensity in the core part of the squall system always higher than the outer part, with maximum reflectivity value observed on the lower level of the convective cells. Analysis of the vertical structure of squall system shows that height of convective cells on the first squall system reached 17 km, while on the second squall system reached 12 km. The origin place where the squall line formed determines the structure and character of the squall system. These findings show that updraft mechanism on the continental area is generally stronger than around marine areas.

AB  - Makassar Strait is one of best fishing ground in Indonesia. The distribution of skipjack tuna can be detected with oceanography factor. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of eddies which has a relationship to chlorophyll-a in determining the skipjack tuna habitat. The study used geostrophic current data from AVISO which consisted of U (zonal component) and V (meridian component), chlorophyll-a data with spatial resolution of 4 km together with skipjack tuna catch. This research took place in May - July 2017. We used the satellite data of geostrophic current to identify the eddy fields. The results showed eddy intensity in Makassar Strait took place approximately 6-7 days until new eddy appeared. Two types of eddy (cyclonic and anti-cyclonic) were found in Makassar Strait waters. The cyclonic eddy location was appeared in Barru and Palu waters while the anti-cyclonic eddy was detected in the south of Makassar Strait. In addition, the distribution of chlorophyll-a in cyclonic eddy was higher than in anti-cyclonic eddy fields. We found that the occurrence of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies are an important step toward defining skipjack tuna habitat which in turn, play an essential role for fishing operation and management.

AB  - Flooding is a natural risk, large floods have occurred almost every year. These are major issues that researchers are interested and to identify flooded areas or assess the risk of flooding, the researchers using image LiDAR or image RADAR to flood mapping, flood risk management, observation and change detection in floodable area. However, flood modeling or flood assessment don't solve the problem of flood risks. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new approach of processing methodology based on time series analysis that enables predicting of the floodable areas in the Mekong Delta using new satellite images such as Lansat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI and sentinel-2 MSI.

M3  - Article
AB  - While much has been published on recent rates of forest loss in the Sundaic lowlands, deforestation rates an patterns on Java's endemic-rich mountains have been rather neglected. We used nearly 1000 Landsat images examine spatio-altitudinal and temporal patterns of forest loss in montane West Java over the last 28 years, an the effectiveness of protected areas in halting deforestation over that period. Around 40% of forest has been lo since 1988, the bulk occurring pre-2000 (2.5% per annum), falling to 1% per annum post-2007. Most deforestation has occurred at lower altitudes ( < 1000 m above sea level), both as attrition of the edges of forested mountain blocks as well as the near-total clearance of lower-altitude forested areas. Deforestation within protected areas was rife pre-2000, but greatly decreased thereafter, almost ceasing post-2007 in protected areas I high International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) status. While this trend is welcome, it must t stressed that the area of remaining forest is only 5234 Km(2), that most accessible lower-altitude forest has ahead disappeared, and that the extant montane forest is largely fragmented and isolated. The biological value of the: forests is huge and without strong intervention we anticipate imminent loss of populations of taxa such as the Javan Slow Loris Nycticebus javanicus and Javan Green Magpie Cissa thalassina.

TI  - Sediment Toxicity Testing with the Amphipod <i>Grandidierella Japonica</i> and Effects of Sediment Particle Size Distribution
T2  - Journal of Water and Environment Technology
M3  - Article
AB  - The brackish and marine amphipod Grandidierella japonica is an organism well-suited to sediment toxicity testing in Japan, where no other sentinel amphipod species are found. To provide the application example of toxicity testing using G. japonica in Japan, we performed 10-day whole sediment toxicity tests of six estuarine sediment samples collected from estuaries and tidal rivers flowing into Tokyo Bay. While all the tested sediment samples were not lethally toxic to this species, the body length increment of surviving amphipods was significantly different among sediment samples. To verify that the observed growth inhibition was caused not by large proportions of fine particles but by chemical contamination, additional 10-day tests using formulated sediment with different particle size distributions were performed. As the result, sediment containing more than 25% of < 63 mu m particles could reduce the body length, but the reduced body length in the sediment collected from Heisei bridge (S3) was demonstrated to be due to chemical contamination, not due to fine particles. The species characteristics and test results presented in this study provide fundamental information to interpret the results of whole sediment toxicity tests.

AB  - Urban areas tend to have significant temperature differences with the surrounding area. The city of Bandung is surrounded by mountains and forms the Bandung Basin. Land cover differences between Bandung City and surrounding area caused a temperature differences that can identified with remote sensing imagery. The aim of this research are to analyse the change of land surface temperature and the vegetation greenness level in Bandung Basin using Landsat multi-temporal image also to identify correlation between surface temperature change with greenness level in Bandung Basin. In Bandung Basin, there is an increase in temperature in various land covers (Vegetation in flat areas, Vegetation in steep and high altitude areas, Water, Built-up area, and Open Land area) from 1990-2018. Meanwhile, there is less green vegetation in Bandung Basin from 1990-2018. The results of the analysis show a better correlation between Land Surface Tempertare (LST) and Simple Ratio Index (SRI) than the correlation between Land Surface Tempertare (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The conclution of this research that preservation of vegetated areas can be done in Bandung Basin to address the increasing of Land Surface Temperature.

TI  - Testing for sentinel coordination in Smooth-billed Anis (<i>Crotophaga ani</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORNITHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel behaviour has been widely described, but whether or not it is coordinated among group members requires careful examination. The Smooth-billed Ani, Crotophaga ani, a joint-nesting cooperatively breeding bird, appears to have a sentinel system; however, it is unknown whether that vigilance is coordinated, the defining feature of sentinel behaviour. We followed social groups during two breeding seasons to observe and time their individual sentinel bouts. We then tested for coordination by quantifying the observed and expected proportions of time during which (1) no sentinel was present during observations, and (2) two or more sentinels were present. The majority of social groups spent less time than expected, under the coordination hypothesis, with at least one sentinel, indicating evidence against coordinated vigilance. This was significant for social groups observed in 2015, but not in 2002. Across both years, temporal overlap in sentinel behaviour between two individuals occurred significantly less than expected under the coordination hypothesis. This study contributes to a gap in our knowledge of sentinel behaviour and suggests that Smooth-billed Anis lack organized vigilance, possibly due to low within-group relatedness and group instability.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - An iterative method, namely EM-EOF (Expectation Maximization-Empirical Orthogonal Functions) is proposed for the first time to retrieve missing values in InSAR displacement time series. The method decomposes the temporal covariance into different EOF modes by solving the eigenvalue problem, and then selects an optimal number of EOF modes to reconstruct the time series. After an appropriate initialization of missing values, the proposed method performs (i) a cross-validation error minimization to find an estimate of the optimal number of EOF modes used in the reconstruction and (ii) an iterative update of missing values which gives the best estimate of missing data points according to the cross-validation error. Results on a time series of Sentinel-1 A/B unwrapped interferograms over the Gorner glacier from November 2016 to March 2017 demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method at retrieving missing values and denoising the time series, even in case of time series with limited size and spatio-temporally correlated gaps.

AB  - Maintenances of social infrastructures such as dam, bridge are important subjects. The more aging problem going on, the more the effective inspection methods have been expected. In the inspection of dams, divers observe the conditions of their surface manually, however underwater structure deeper than 30m is limited and their inspections are insufficient. In this paper, we propose the ROV whose functions are video capture, indirect measurement using laser, target depth keeping, heading keeping. The ROV is applied into the dam inspection and showed the effectiveness to find cracks. In this study, The Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) is developed with the aim of practical application of technologies capable of replacing and supporting dam inspection by diver. Using the developed ROV, we conducted in the 'Verification field of the next generation social infrastructure robot' which was publicly offered by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in FY 2015 and examined its usefulness. In the verification on-site, it was able to satisfy about half of the required inspection items.

T2  - DIGESTION

CP  - 14th Annual Meeting of the Japanese-Gastroenterological-Association (JGA)
CL  - Tokyo, JAPAN
AB  - Background: Recently, minimally invasive approaches such as endoscopic treatment or laparoscopic gastrectomy for early gastric cancer have made rapid progress. However, the extent of gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy in laparoscopic surgery is radical, similar to that of open gastrectomy for patients with early gastric cancer diagnosed as not indicated for endoscopic treatment. Since it is well known that lymph node metastasis is an important prognostic factor, the standard procedure of gastrectomy with radical lymph node dissection has been performed for the purpose of curative resection. The frequency of lymph node metastases is relatively low in patients with early gastric cancer; therefore, function-preserving gastrectomy, a solution between endoscopic treatment and standard gastrectomy in terms of invasiveness, could be considered to avoid excessive invasive surgery. Summary: A prospective multicenter trial and meta-analyses of sentinel node (SN) mapping and biopsy for early gastric cancer demonstrated favorable SN detection rates and accuracy of nodal metastatic status. Personalized function-preserving gastrectomy with limited lymphadenectomy using SN theory will positively impact patients' quality of life (QOL). Specifically, a full-thickness partial gastrectomy by laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery with SN basin dissection could become a reliable technique of minimally invasive gastrectomy for treating patients with clinically node-negative (cN0) early gastric cancer. Key Messages: For early gastric cancer, the development of laparoscopic personalized minimized gastrectomy with SN navigation may improve patients' postoperative QOL. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicle - UAV, commonly referred to as drones are vehicles unique in the field of mechanics that can fly in the air without a human operator on board. In recent years, they have become a new interdisciplinary area of science and research. Because they combine photogrammetry, aviation engineering, navigation and automation. Modern UAVs are synchronized with GNSS signals and are remotely piloted or carry out autonomous flights. They can simultaneously perform very complex operations for the implementation of many different civil and military tasks. Currently, drones play an increasingly important role in the modern battlefield and are therefore included in the equipment of all modern world armies. They also find a great potential in civil applications. They are used in many fields of economy, technology and science. Acquiring geoinformation from unmanned aerial vehicles is currently used in the work of many services related to the functioning of the state. In the geomatics, the UAV platforms equipped with specialized sensors, are used to acquire images and photogrammetric and remote sensing data. Photogrammetric projections made by UAV are currently used to generate orthophotomaps, among others for the needs of cadastre. As we know, cadastral measurements, due to their importance, require high accuracy and reliability. They can only be guaranteed by correctly and precisely determined calibration parameters of non-metric cameras. The paper presents a method of determination of the focal length, of a digital non-metric photogrammetric camera. The experimental tests carried out confirmed the usefulness of the proposed calibration method carried out in laboratory conditions.

AB  - Patheingyi Township is located in the eastern part of Mandalay, Myanmar. Patheingyi Township is an area that experienced a fast increase of urban population in the recent decades in Mandalay region. Rapid urbanization has significant effect on resources and urban environment. The remote sensing technique using satellite imagery has been recognized as an effective and powerful tool in monitoring and detecting land use and land cover changes. The aim of the system is to quantify changes in urban area of Patheingyi Township using satellite images. In this study, Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 images are used to study land cover change in study area. Land cover maps of 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 are produced using one of the supervised classification techniques. In this system, Random Forest Classifier model is used to detect the growth of urban area. The system is classified three major land cover classes: built-up, water and other. And then, ArcGIS tool is used to classify built-up area into five classes: urban built-up, suburban built-up, rural built-up, urbanized open land and rural open land. A total of 295 ground check points are used to calculate the accuracy assessment. According to the tested results, built-up area was increased by 285 ha from 2010 to 2015 in Patheingyi Township.

AB  - This paper is to study the evolutionary imagination of Choi In-hoon's literature focusing on Ernst Hekel's evolutionary perspective. Also, I tried to analyze the evolutionary imagination and the evolutionary status of individual life in Choi In-hoon's novels. Choi In-hoon had an expert view on Ernst Heckel's theory of repetition and bioevolution, including DNA, since the 1960s. He was also interested in areas such as computer science and space exploration. Choi In-hoon attempted to explain the biological conditions of humans and the development of civilization based on these scientific perspectives, and to create an evolutionary literary art theory that penetrates creatures, humans, and civilizations. In “Literature and Reality” written in 1965, Choi In-hoon introduces the concept of two species inherent in human beings as “the human being as the unity of biological and civilized species.” Choi In-hoon discusses the characteristics of humans who perform symbolic behavior (literature activities) through the theory that ‘geneticity repeats phylogeny’ and distinguishes biological DNA from cultural (DNA)â€² in Literature and Ideology. Choi In-hoon's evolutionary imagination, starting with Ernst Heckel, extends beyond species evolution, repetitive evolution of the individual and evolution of the mind. This bioevolutionary view reanalyze the scene where Lee Myung-jun seeks the condition of animals and erotic primitive life in Square, or Kim Hak’s biological understanding of the genealogy and countless 'I' in Gray Man, and the scenes that describe mummies and fossils in GeUnMong and SeoYuGi. In particular, HoaDu shows how the evolutionary status of various ideologies (individuals) and individual creatures (humans) are concentrated in the cosmic worldview.This evolutionary imagination is the starting point for reconstructing the evolutionary plot and art theory of Choi In-hoon's literature.

AB  - Tree species classification at individual tree crowns (ITCs) level using remote sensing data requires the availability of a sufficient number of reliable reference samples. Two main issues that affect the classification performance are: a) an imbalanced distribution of the tree species classes; and b) the presence of unreliable samples due to field collection errors, coordinates misalignments, etc. In this study, we present a weighted Support Vector Machine (WSVM) classifier that addresses these problems by considering: 1) different weights for different classes of tree species to mitigate the effects of the class imbalance distribution; and 2) different weights for different training samples according to their importance for the considered classification problem. Experimental results obtained on a study area located in the Italian Alps showed that the proposed method increased the overall and kappa accuracies of about 2%, and the mean class accuracy of about 10% with respect to a standard SVM.

TI  - THE YOUTH POLICY HUMANISTIC RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIETY OF JESUS IN THE EARLY MODERN PERIOD: THE NEWEST NAVIGATION OF FOREIGN HISTORIOGRAPHY
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is historiographic analysis and systematization of the newest narrative of American, Italian, German, English, French and Polish historical, cultural, religious, philosophical and historical-pedagogical studies, which highlighted anthropological intentionality, humanistic and humanistic Catholic Jesuit Order in the early modern period. Due to the historiographical controversy, the principles of scientific, historicist, objectivity, continuity, interdisciplinary, historiographical autopsy are presented in the consideration and evaluation of the sociocultural activity of the Jesuit Order, as well as its confessional affiliation, methodological orientations of the research, denominational neutrality, ecumenism, anthropology, and worldview pluralism. In the basis of the study there is a civilizational understanding of historiogrophy that enables a holistic, systematic, integrated and integrated examination of the contemporary understanding of the humanistic context of early modern Jesuit youth in the humanistic context of European and American scholars. The research novelty, first of all, lies in the field of classification, historiographic analysis and contextual commenting of contemporary foreign studies, whose authors considered the historical and sociocultural aspects of the founding and implementation of Jesuit youth policy, revealed its humanistic content, outlined the subject field for the world. The study deepened the understanding of the civilizational methodology of historiographic research, proposed new approaches to the classification of historiographic narratives of foreign Jesuits, introduced the concept of "conceptual and location historiographic cluster". The Conclusions. Contemporary Latin historiography of the humanistic content of Jesuit youth policy in the early modern period is sufficiently voluminous, large in scope and subject of study, which is connected, first of all, with the broad amplitude of Jesuit activities in the world for almost five centuries. The consideration of the topic is proposed on the basis of the separation of six conceptually-location historiographic clusters, within which historical studies are combined on the basis of geographical and subject-thematic criteria: general historical (foreign studies, presenting the historical panorama of the genesis of early modern Jesuits youth policy, its preconditions are outlined, the content of the Catholic Reform (Counter-Reformation) is clarified in which the Jesuit monks operated); andrologically synthetical (combining basic studies of contemporary American, Italian, Spanish, German, English, French and Polish Jesuits); historical and anthropological (historical studies that of fer a holistic dimension of the humanistic context of the sociocultural activity of the Jesuits); personal (coverage of historical portraits of the founders of Jesuit youth policy, contextual interpretation of their life and creative path); spiritual and theological (analysis of the value, theological and ethical and moral aspects of the Jesuit early modern youth policy); educational and philosophical (review of Jesuit educational practices, their universal system of education and the educational principles of Ratio Studiorum). It is emphasized that contemporary foreign Jesuitism has taken a significant step in refining the false statements and falsifications that were widespread in the previous historiographical narrative regarding the anti-humanistic and feudal-reaction content of Jesuit social activity.The contemporary foreign Latin Jesuitism is characterized by a value approach in covering the socio-cultural initiatives of the Society of Jesus. Foreign authors do not resort to engaged rhetoric, a myth-speculative style of presentation, which prematurely distinguished the positions of grata and non grata in the formation of historical narrative by unjustified criteria. In solidarity, the scholars emphasized the humanistic relevance of the socio-cultural and educational initiatives of the Society of Jesus to the human-creative and social-organizing task, their tutus on the motivation and development of the spiritual, professional and emotional aspects of the individual. Historiographic analysis confirms that modern Latin Jesuitism as a whole reproduces a holistic image of Jesuit humanism, attests to the historical objectivity and social justification of the formation of a modern Jesuit concept of a holistic, complete, solidary and integral humanism as universal holistic understanding.

AB  - Understanding urbanization and planning for the upcoming changes require detailed knowledge about the places where people live and work. Thus, knowing the usage of buildings is inevitable to distinguish between residential and commercial places. Assessing the usage of buildings from an aerial perspective alone is challenging and results in unresolveable ambiguities.As complementary data sources, social media images taken from ground level allow access to the building facades, as well as ongoing social activities around the buildings, which are very valuable information while coming to accessing the building usages. Towards the fusion of social media images and remote sensing data for this purpose, in this work we present a method to assess building usages from social media images taken in their neighborhood. Using a straight forward next neighbor classifier for mapping images to buildings and pre-trained networks for dimensionality reduction we trained a logistic regression classifier to distinguish between five different building usage classes. Applied to a study area of Los Angeles metropolitan area, USA, we obtain an average precision of 0.67. Hence, we show that social media images can be a valuable additional source to remote sensing data.

TI  - Remote sensing of β-diversity: Evidence from plant communities in a semi-natural system
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Question Do remote sensing signals represent beta-diversity? Does beta-diversity agree with community types? Location UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserve, La Palma, Canary Islands. Methods We recorded perennial, vascular plant species abundances in 69 plots (10 m x 10 m) in three pre-defined community types along an elevational gradient of 2,400 m: succulent scrubland, Pinus canariensis forest and subalpine scrubland. The remote sensing data consists of structural variables from airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and multispectral variables from a time series of Sentinel-2 (S2) images. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling was used to assess beta-diversity between plots. K-means unsupervised clustering was applied to remote sensing variables to distinguish three community types. We subsequently quantified the explanatory power of S2 and LiDAR variables representing beta-diversity via the Mantel test, variation partitioning and multivariate analysis of variance. We also investigated the sensitivity of results to grain size of remote sensing data (20, 40, 60 m). Results The beta-diversity between the succulent and pine community is high, whereas the beta-diversity between the pine and subalpine community is low. In the wet season, up to 85% of beta-diversity is reflected by remote sensing variables. The S2 variables account for more explanatory power than the LiDAR variables. The explanatory power of LiDAR variables increases with grain size, whereas the explanatory power of S2 variables decreases. Conclusion At the lower ecotone, beta-diversity agrees with the pre-defined community distinction, while at the upper ecotone the community types cannot be clearly separated by compositional dissimilarity alone. The high beta-diversity between the succulent scrub and pine forest results from positive feedback switches of P. canariensis, being a fire-adapted, key tree species. In accordance with the spectral variation hypothesis, remote sensing signals can adequately represent beta-diversity for a large extent, in a short time and at low cost. However, in-situ sampling is necessary to fully understand community composition. Nature conservation requires such interdisciplinary approaches.

AB  - With remote sensing data and methods we gain deeper insight in many processes at the Earth's surface. Thus, they are a valuable data source to gather geo-information of almost any kind. While the progress of remote sensing technology continues, the amount of available remote sensing data increases. Hence, besides effective strategies for data mining and image data retrieval, reliable and efficient methods of image analysis with a high degree of automation are needed in order to extract the information hidden in remote sensing data. Due to the complex nature of remote sensing data, recent methods of computer vision and image analysis do not allow a fully automatic and highly reliable analysis of remote sensing data, yet. Most of these methods are rather semi-automatic with a varying degree of automation depending on the data quality, the complexity of the image content and the information to be extracted. Thus, visual image interpretation in many cases is still seen as the most appropriate method to gather (geo-) information from remote sensing data. To increase the degree of automation, the application of multi-agent systems in remote sensing image analysis is recently under research. The paper present summarizes recent approaches and outlines their potentials.

T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The study seeks to clarify the preconditions for moral and legal decision-making based on the identification of axiological foundations that correlate with the moral perceptions of good and evil and psychological phenomena such as emotions. Theoretical basis of the study is to apply comparative, axiological, systemic methods. This methodological approach allows us to analyze and disclose the essence of the process of moral and legal decision-making on the basis of certain axiological prerequisites and enables to substantiate the connection between the axiological and psychological aspects of taking moral and legal decisions. Originality of the work is to broaden the perceptions of the processes and mechanisms for making moral and legal decisions, which are based on the axiological dimension, in particular on the system of reference individual and social values. The study shows that every necessary moral and legal decision taken by a person is futurologically balanced in the emotional sense, rationally reasoned and morally perceptible in the context of man's beliefs about good and evil, and realized with necessity in the personal system of reference values that determines the style and manner of individual and social behaviour in the context of material and spiritual values and is an axiological foundation for making all types of moral and legal decisions. Conclusions. Moral and legal decision-making is a social process that is connected with such a social essence of a person as rationality, which gives an opportunity to act axiologically. A person makes moral and legal decisions in a complex way, based on the unity of the moral, axiological and psychological aspects of his worldview, which are grounded on the system of reference values.

AB  - We develop a system for real time forecasting of solar irradiance and PV power for large power plants (> 500MW). Our forecast system is designed to combine numerical weather prediction models with both irradiance and power measurements as well as satellite based irradiance forecasts. Irradiance forecasts are processed with PV simulations to compute PV power forecasts for different sub-plants. Challenges that are typical for large power plants are taken into consideration. We evaluate irradiance forecasts for a site in China and irradiance and PV power forecasts for a PV power plant in Germany.

AB  - With the rapid development of remote sensing satellites and sensors, the higher resolution of remote sensing images can be collected. Comparing with roads of countryside, it is more difficult to extract roads of urban areas from remote sensing images due to various interference factors including buildings and vehicles. There are regional characteristics with specific width and gray levels of the urban road in high-resolution images. In this article, a novel model named FMH is proposed to extract the main road information from the high-resolution remote sensing image in urban areas. After pre-processing of the image, fuzzy c-means algorithm is applied to binary processing, and thus the image is divided into the road part and the non-road part. Then mathematical morphology is used to eliminate more non-road regions. Next the local Hough transform is applied to extracting the road regions. Finally morphological operations are used to modify and refine shapes of roads. This model is tested on the panchromatic image with the resolution of 2m collected by Gaofen-1 satellite, which shows effective and excellent results. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.

TI  - Using photo elicitation interviewing to access the subjective well-being of children from poor families within an affluent Asian society: Insights for service delivery
T2  - CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Incorporating the voice of the child is essential for a holistic assessment that is used to guide social work interventions targeted at enhancing the well-being of children. In order to include children as key participants in understanding their worldview, social workers need to provide a space for children to voice out their subjective assessment of their current life experiences and conditions. This paper aims to bring attention to utilizing photo eliciting interviewing (PEI) as a means to access children's subjective well-being from low-income families.Findings: By utilizing photoraphy and in-depth interviews sequentially to engage and gain access into children's woridviews, this study found that children from low-income families possessed agentic capabilities and are capable of contributing towards their well-being. Despite the financial constraints experienced by their families, children did not perceive their families to be poor. Instead, they took into account the family context and parental efforts in assessing the family's circumstances. Furthermore, children initiated strategies to create opportunities of happiness or to intervene in situations of sadness that stemmed from financial constraints.Application: This study propose social workers to employ PEI as a complement to the objective measurement tools commonly utilized in social work assessments and interventions when working with children from low-income families. Other than constructing a holistic assessment of children's well-being, PEI also allows for the inclusion of children as integral partners in social work interventions and programme designs. Children possess the knowledge and ability to initiate and contribute solutions to problems, which when identified and tapped upon, promotes children's participation as change agents of their own lives.

TI  - Effects of the fungicide ortho-phenylphenol (OPP) on the early development of sea urchin eggs
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we assessed the impact of imidazole fungicide ortho-phenylphenol (OPP) on the early development of a marine invertebrate, the sea urchin, a marine bioindicator. Fungicides are widely used and have been reported to accumulate not only in farm soil but also in freshwater and seawater sediments. Therefore, it is essential to clarify the effects of OPP on marine environments. Toxicity was estimated as the inhibition ratio of the 120 min-embryo and/or the 24 h-embryo development. The addition of OPP to embryos of the two sea urchin species, Scaphechinus mirabilis (S. mirabilis) and Strongylocentrotus nudus (S. nudus), at 0.1 mM or higher, resulted in acute toxicity (cell death). The IC50 value of the 120 min-embryos or the 24 h-embryos for S. mirabilis and S. nudus with OPP was around 0.06 mM, indicating that fertilized eggs and embryos of the sea urchin are more sensitive to OPP than higher vertebrates. In addition, in the presence of OPP (0.005-0.05 mM), the pro-portion (%) of the gastrula keeping the fertilization membrane increased, suggesting that OPP (0.005-0.05 mM) inhibited the hatching process, possibly by affecting the hatching enzyme activity.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - The Water Cloud Model (WCM) has been widely used for estimation of Leaf Area Index (LAI) from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In different studies, it was demonstrated that this model performs well if it is calibrated well. However, calibration of this model requires access to both LAI and soil moisture for the calibration points. An alternative, if the soil moisture data are not available, is Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. However, ML methods are highly dependent on the number of calibration points. In this study, 6 different ML algorithms including Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Ensemble of Trees (ET), Regression Tree (RT), Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Gaussian Process Model (GPM) are used and compared with the WCM model for estimation of LAI over corn fields. This comparison was done using different numbers of calibration points. The results demonstrated that when a lower number of calibration points are used, WCM outperformed some of the ML algorithms including NN, SVM and ET algorithms. But with more calibration points, all machine learning algorithms outperformed the WCM. The highest accuracies were from the GPM model with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.93, Root Mean Square (RMSE) of 0.56 m(2)m(-2) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.38 m(2)m(-2). Theses results were derived using the data collected during the SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) that was conducted in Manitoba, Canada. Further testing and comparison of the ML algorithms and WCM model using data from other Joint Experiment for Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) sites are ongoing.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditionally, the main focus of forestry management has been based on wood production but more recently it is directed at multifunctional forest management. Multifunctional forestry management includes many considerations such as ecotourism, ecology, economic and social issues of forest dwellers as well as wood production. This study aims to design forest roads using GIS and satellite data of SPOT-HRG in the Darabkla forest based on Multipurpose Forestry. The study used the multi-criteria evaluation method bused on fuzzy logic to assess the potential of land area for a road network. Opinions of experts and scholars were used to select four criteria and 18 sub-criteria for road design. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used for weighting factors. Layers were combined using a weighted linear combination (WLC) operator and the map of crossing the road potential was identified and zoned. The road was designed using the PEGGER program. Geographic Information System (GIS) and satellite data of SPOT-HRG were effective tools for improving outcomes. Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) Model for combination-layers was used in this study and recommended the multi object operation (MOLA) in future studies.

AB  - This research inspects the convenience of Landsat-8 imagery in generating Land-use Land Cover (LULC) maps based on RGB and NIR bands dates back to August 8th, 2017, and at the same time to reveal which type of LULC in Tarom basin can be utilized with maximum accuracy considering the comparison of results with ground samples. Besides necessary preprocessing, land-use classification was done after atmospheric corrections (via FLAASH Algorithm). LULC maps were generated using three pixel-based supervised classification methods, Maximum Likelihood (ML), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Results proved that imagery precision based on Kappa statistics and overall accuracy for ML classification method were 0.88 and 91.55, respectively. The acquired outcome indicated that Landsat-8 OLI data, present satisfying LULC classification in the waterbody, mountain and rock, bare land, vegetation, and forest classes. In addition, as the results indicated, it can be stated that all three methods of classification in a region of considerable heterogeneity in terms of elevation (between 280-3000 m), land-use and vegetation such as Tarom, can have significant results. In comparison with the other two methods, classification with the ML method had higher speed and lower complexity for execution in achieving the required maps.

AB  - Lymphatic metastasis is a main pathway of dissemination of malignancies. The diagnosis of metastasis in lymph nodes can help stage cancer or help the surgeons make intraoperative decisions. In addition, lymph nodes are more easily confused with other neck tissues during thyroid surgery. Therefore, identification of lymph nodes is very important. Up to now, the gold standard for identification of metastatic lymph nodes is still histological examination, which can only be performed ex vivo and needs a long time. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, high-resolution imaging technology that is capable of detecting microstructures in bio-tissues in real time. In this study, we demonstrated a method to identify metastatic lymph nodes automatically by intraoperative OCT imaging. With a home-made swept source OCT system, we obtained OCT images of different resected neck tissues, including lymph nodes with and without metastasis, thyroid, parathyroid, fat and muscle, from 28 patients undertaking thyroidectomy. The automatic identification algorithm was based on texture analysis and back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN). 66 texture features of OCT images were extracted and 14 were selected and used for automatic identification experiments. The trained BP-ANN has an excellent performance in identifying OCT images of lymph nodes with the sensitivity of 98.9 % and specificity of 98.8 %. The accuracy of lymphatic metastasis diagnosis is 90.1 %.

TI  - Gap-Filling of MODIS Fractional Snow Cover Products via Non-Local Spatio-Temporal Filtering Based on Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud obscuration leaves significant gaps in MODIS snow cover products. In this study, an innovative gap-filling method based on the concept of non-local spatio-temporal filtering (NSTF) is proposed to reconstruct the cloud gaps in MODIS fractional snow cover (SCF) products. The ground information of a gap pixel was estimated by using the appropriate similar pixels in the remaining known part of an image via an automatic machine learning technique. We take the MODIS SCF product cloud gap filling data from 2001 to 2016 in Northern Xinjiang, China as an example. The results demonstrate that the methodology can generate almost continuous spatio-temporal, daily MODIS SCF images, and it leaves only 0.52% of cloud gaps long-term, on average. The validation results based on cloud assumption exhibit high accuracy, with a higher <mml:semantics>R2</mml:semantics> exceeding 0.8, a lower RMSE of 0.1, an overestimated error of 1.13%, an underestimated error of 1.4%, and a spatial efficiency (SPAEF) of 0.78. The validation based on 50 in situ snow depth observations demonstrates the superiority of the methodology in terms of accuracy and consistency. The overall accuracy is 93.72%. The average omission and commission error have increased approximately 1.16 and 0.53% compared with the original MODIS SCF products under a clear sky term.

AB  - Multi-spectral remote sensing has become a general trend in remote sensing technology. The increasing number of spectral bands on one hand leads to higher data rates and data volumes, bringing unbearable pressure to the data transmission channel. On the other hand, users are often only interested in special information they are interested in, and not in the whole data mass. Concerning these two tendencies, a hot spot processing system on-board is proposed in this paper. Focusing on the water thermal pollution monitoring with anomaly high temperature, the proposed system consists of two stage processes, water temperature anomaly detection followed by downlink information generation. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system not only can greatly reduce the pressure of data transmission channel, but also can meet the emergency response requirements of high temperature events.

AB  - A framework of end-to-end ship detection and recognition for high-resolution Gaofen-3 (GF3) SAR images is proposed. The framework includes three consecutive stages, namely sea-land segmentation, ship detection and discrimination. First, Otsu-based segmentation is used to exclude land areas. Then, adaptive multi-scale constant false alarm rate (CFAR) algorithm is employed to detect candidate ship target pixels. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to filter out false alarms. The CNN is trained by a in-house built GF3 ship dataset, GF3-FUSAR Ships, which is a matchup dataset of SAR and Automatic identification system (AIS).

TI  - Changes in the wetland vegetation growth patterns in large lakes on the Yangtze Plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the vegetation emergence times (VET), an important phenological characteristics, were obtained for 25 large lakes on the Yangtze Plain between 2001 and 2014. This was carried out by extracting the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data using a decision tree method. This is the first comprehensive documentation of the changes in temporal and spatial distribution in wetland vegetation phenology for large lakes on the Yangtze Plain. The results showed that considerable changes in the VET occurred in 25 wetland ecosystems in the Yangtze Plain. Specifically, 76% of the lakes showed delayed trends in the VET, and 32% of them were statistically significant (p<0.05). In contrast, 24% of the lakes displayed advanced trends in the VET and 17% of them were statistically significant (p<0.05) over the past 14years. An analysis of the driving factors of VET revealed that a VET change was more sensitive to temperature and sunshine duration than to precipitation for most of the lakes. The temperature in 1-2months before VET had great effect on the vegetation growth, while such a pattern was not evident for sunshine duration for 5months before VET. Furthermore, the amounts of chemical fertilizers used in nearby farmlands have also played an important role in the vegetation growth for some of the lakes. This record of change in vegetation phenology provides critical information for wetland ecosystem monitoring in the Yangtze Plain.

AB  - Synthetic aperture Radar (SAR) tomography has been widely used in 3D reconstruction in urban area. Nevertheless, how to exactly detect persistent scatterers contained in one range-azimuth resolution pixel still requires further researching. In this paper, a new detection method based on scatterer's characteristics is proposed. The model is built under the hypothesis test theory and determines threshold according to probability of detection and false alarm. In the experiment with SAR images acquired by TerraSAR-X, this method has exhibited good performances in detecting single and double persistent scatterers.

TI  - Study of Erbil Al-Qala citadel time changes by comparison of historical and contemporary image data
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Erbil Al-Qala citadel is located on a distinct hill ("tell") in the foothills north of Iraq, in Kurdistan. The citadel is a historical city centre of presently rapidly growing Erbil, which is the capital city of the autonomous region of Kurdistan. The citadel has been inscribed on the World Heritage List since 21 June 2014. The Erbil citadel dates back thousands of years to the first settlers of Erbil. The resulting shape is a large, oval hill, and is properly referred to as a "tell", which means a large mound created by many generation buildings one on top of another. There are historical aerial photographs of Erbil citadel made by Bradford in 1951. These unique images are taken as a stereoscopic image pair configuration. A digital model and historical orthophoto has been created from this data set. A basic map of the citadel has been created based on modern VHR satellite data and field measurements. Bradford's historical images were processed in Agisoft PhotoScan software. Satellite images taken by Ikonos (2003), QuickBird (2005) and Pleiades (2014) satellites represent the second data sets. The created orthophotos and digital models of the citadel were mutually compared. The result is a map of missing objects that were destroyed during the second half of the twentieth century. Results based on image data processing from a long-term project of the CTU in Prague dealing with Kurdish historical monuments represent the main content of the proposed article.

AB  - We demonstrate an application of the L-band specific Microwave Emission Model of Layered Snowpacks (LS-MEMLS) to snow over the Greenland Ice Sheet to retrieve density and snow wetness from SMOS satellite data. Retrievals of these parameters have previously been demonstrated using ground-based L-band radiometry over snow covered ground in alpine conditions. Existing passive microwave data products over ice sheets include empirical and threshold-based techniques but until recently have not used radiative-transfer physics-based modelling. We discuss the retrieval method based on inversion of LS-MEMLS and present a comparison between our retrievals and in-situ weather station air temperature data. We also mention ongoing work investigating the applicability of the novel retrieval method for mapping the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet.

AB  - Measurement techniques as they apply to agroclimate look beyond conventional instrumentation and methodologies, which are used to derive new data from direct observations of specific agrometeorological variables. They address the integration of the meteorological, hydrologic and biophysical variables critical for understanding the processes governing agricultural production and the agricultural interaction with the environment. Agroclimate measurement techniques also consider the temporal and spatial scales relevant to agriculture.Soil moisture is a key variable for crop productivity, crop management practices, flood and excess moisture risk, and can control greenhouse gas emissions from farming operations. Crop condition and drought monitoring practices have been used as early warning for production and food security issues. Greenhouse gas flux is a critical indicator of the degree to which agriculture is either a source or a sink for greenhouse gases. Within each of these areas are multiple state of the art operational or near-operational techniques for measurement of indices and elements that pertain to spatial and temporal scales that are important for agriculture.In an era of rapidly increasing availability of data, there are opportunities to better describe and measure the complexities of interactions influencing agricultural productivity and the agrienvironmental footprint. Measurement techniques are increasingly relying on sophisticated modeling and analysis techniques that integrate data from several sources to derive new information at the temporal and spatial scales required to support the agriculture sector's needs for science-based early warning and decision support.

Manifestations present among <5% of patients but associated with patient hospitalization included cyanosis (RR = 2.20 [1.17-4.12) and seizures (RR = 3.23 [1.80-5.81).Discussion Among this cohort of CHIKV-infected patients, hospitalization was uncommon, admission to the ICU was infrequent, and death was rare. Risk of hospitalization was higher in patients with symptoms of respiratory illness and other manifestations that may not have been the result of CHIKV infection.Author summary Chikungunya is an emerging infectious disease caused by a virus (chikungunya virus, CHIKV) transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitos; typical symptoms are fever and joint pain. After CHIKV was first detected in Puerto Rico in 2014, an epidemic quickly spread across the island. Because previous reports identified varying frequencies of hospitalization of CHIKV-infected patients, we used an existing hospital-based disease detection system to better understand the frequency and reasons for hospitalization of CHIKV-infected patients in Puerto Rico. Among 1,469 patients with laboratory-confirmed CHIKV infection, 11% were hospitalized, most of whom were infants or elderly. Six CHIKV-infected patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, and two died. Although several illness characteristics were associated with hospitalization, most of these were not typical of chikungunya and instead suggested underlying or concomitant respiratory disease. By enrolling patients when they presented to the emergency department and testing them for evidence of CHIKV infection, we determined that hospitalization in this population occurred in roughly one-in-ten CHIKV-infected patients, one-in-two hundred were admitted to the intensive care unit, and one-in-one thousand died. These findings provide information on the spectrum of disease caused by CHIKV, and identified underlying or concomitant respiratory illness as a risk factor associated with hospitalization.

TI  - Vertical structure and surface patterns of Green Island wakes induced by the Kuroshio
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - When the Kuroshio passes Green Island off Taiwan, well-organized wakes are formed by the interaction between the Kuroshio and the island. The vertical mixing in the wake produces cold water, which entrains from the mixed layer below the surface and results in relatively colder and saltier waters with a higher chlorophyll-a concentration on the sea surface to the lee of the island. The meander of the Kuroshio maximum velocity axis has a major influence on the island wake. The shift of the Kuroshio in front of Green Island not only weakens the flow velocity but also affects the development of the wake. In the Green Island wake, the density overturns with a Thorpe scale between 2.9 m and 20.5 m and the turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate is 0.2 x 10(-6)-8.5 x 10(-5) W kg(-1), which corresponds to an eddy diffusivity in the range of 0.01-0.23 m(2) s(-1). The spatial distribution patterns of the sea surface temperature (SST) in the island wake are classified into four distinct types, as obtained from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST images. The most frequently occurring type is of the wake alone, which accounts for 86.7% of the island wake patterns. The other three types are a wake with a tail stretching downstream (4.0%), a wake with a small cyclonic cold core but no tail stretching downstream (6.8%) and an S-shaped meandering wake (2.5%).

T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land subsidence in response to the construction of underground engineering, e.g., subway, has caused many geological hazards and impeded the sustainable development of urbanization, in particular of China. Analysis of land subsidence with high temporal-spatial resolution is necessary and can help to assess the risk of geohazards. In this study, we apply the SBAS-InSAR technique to monitor the land subsidence in Fuzhou downtown after the program of metro construction. 24 scenes of X-band TerraSAR data from July 2013 to August 2015 and 32 scenes of C-band Sentinel-1 data from July 2015 to February 2018 were used in this experiment. Our results show a maximum subsidence rate of -12mm/yr, and eight subsidence funnels have been found during the observed period. After analyzing the subsidence of these regions in a long time span, it can be concluded that there are three regions which have a relatively stable disastrous subsidence effect, and there is a possibility of further intensified subsidence.

TI  - Monitoring the Thaw Slump-Derived Thermokarst in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Using Satellite SAR Interferometry
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thaw slumps are well-developed within a 10km wide zone along the Qinghai-Tibet engineering corridor, especially along the Qinghai-Tibet highway and railway. Previous studies have focused on thaw slump instability such as its origin development, headwall retrogression rate, failure scale, and thermal regime, yet the intrinsic dynamic process of surface movement is relatively less known. In this study, we used InSAR based on the L-band ALOS PALSAR images acquired from January 2007 to October 2010 to investigate the distribution of thaw-induced slope failures containing retrogressive thaw slumps and active layer detachment failures along the Qinghai-Tibet highway (QTH). Our InSAR analysis reveals that the maximum annual average sedimentation rates are even up to -35mmyr(-1) in the slope direction to the K3035 thaw slump, and the K3035W active layer detachment failure developed on the west side of K3035. The distribution, failure extent, and stability of the slope failures obtained by our InSAR analysis all agree well with the field investigations. Our study illustrates that InSAR is an effective tool for studying the distribution and processes of the thaw slump-derived thermokarst and provides useful references for evaluating permafrost degradation in response to climate warming and external disturbance on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach for the study of ship discrimination in complex sea ice ocean environment using single polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data and sub-spectra strategy. A statistic descriptor related to the signal coherence in the Time-Frequency domain, is proposed to enhance the ship/background contrast and improve discrimination capabilities. Using RADARSAT-2 single polarization data over complex sea ice scenes in Arctic ocean, experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this method in terms of ship location retrieval and response characterization.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - In this paper, an automatic cloud removal algorithm based on Poisson blending is proposed. For Landsat Collection 1 Level-1 surface reflectance products generated from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), the algorithm first builds a cloud mask from the Quality Assessment (QA) band and then reconstructs cloud-contaminated portions based on temporal similarity of multi-temporal Landsat images. A Poisson blending algorithm is used to eliminate radiation differences between cloud-free region and cloud removed/reconstructed region. Besides, a quad-tree approach is used to improve the efficiency of gradient-domain compositing. This automatic cloud removal algorithm yields better results in terms of radiometric accuracy and consistency for experimental images with cloud coverage less than 85%.

AB  - Hyperspectral images and polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data are two important data sources, yet they barely appear under the same scope, even though multi-modal data fusion is attracting more and more attention. To our best knowledge, this paper investigates for the first time semi-supervised manifold alignment (SSMA) for the fusion of the hyperspectral image and PolSAR data. The SSMA searches a latent space where different data sources are aligned, which is accomplished by using the label information and the topological structure of the data. This paper is the first attempt to apply topological data analysis (TDA), a recent mathematic sub-field of data analysis, in remote sensing. It aims to reveal relevant information from the shape of a data in its feature space, and has been proven powerful in medicine. The paper also proposes a novel algorithm, MAPPER-regularized manifold alignment, which embeds the TDA into a semi-supervised manifold alignment for the fusion of the hyperspectral image and PolSAR data. The proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance in fusing a simulated EnMAP data set and a Sentinel-1 data set for an image of Berlin.

AB  - With the development of the urbanization, the impact of urban heat island effect is becoming more and more severe. It is difficult to reveal the evolution of heat island dynamics based on statistical data, while the application of remote sensing data provides an effective method. Beijing City as study area, this paper analyzes the dynamics of summer land surface temperature in Beijing from 2005 to 2015, and reveals the significant urban heat island effect in Beijing based on the evolution law of land surface temperature along urban-rural gradient. After that, the dynamic evolution of urban heat island extent and its influence factors are explored in Beijing. The results show that the summer land surface temperature of Beijing in the past ten years shows an increasing trend, the land surface temperature gradually increases on the urban-rural gradient, indicating an obvious heat island effect. Meanwhile, the extent of urban heat island has expanded rapidly in the past ten years. On the township scale, building area, population and GDP all have significant positive effects on the land surface temperature while on the district scale, these correlations are not significant. This paper reveals the evolution law of urban heat island effect and its influencing factors in Beijing, which has a certain reference significance for the rational planning of urban space.

AB  - This paper presents a new semi-supervised method for land cover classification using Sentinel-2 time-series images, which can deal with the problem of unclear observations. First, the MCCR method, which is constituted by the matrix completion (MC) of unclear observations and feature-adaptive collaborative representation (CR) based classifier, is adopted to handle the data quality problem. Second, by fusing RF, AdaBoost, and MCCR, a tri-training process is proposed to iteratively select the semi-labeled samples, considering the difference of classification certainty in different classifiers and classes. Experiments on two sets of Sentinel-2 images are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised method.

AB  - The deconvolution technique can improve the spatial resolution of Millimeter and Sub-millimeter Sounding/Imager (MMSI) of FY-4 satellite. In this paper, the technique is applied to the simulated brightness temperature image of a typhoon scene, which indicates that the deconvolution technique is feasible to enhance the spatial resolution of MMSI. In the analysis of the antenna temperature of the earth obtained by MMSI, We consider the effect of beam scanning and acquire an accurate estimate of the brightness temperature distribution. The results show that the outline of the typhoon in the enhanced image is closer to the initial image than the non-enhanced image. The correlation coefficient is improved and the spatial resolution is enhanced from 96km to 57km, which indicates the effectiveness.

AB  - In this paper, the reflector antenna of sub-millimeter wave radiometer in large aperture is simulated by using Grasp9. The effects of the displacement of the reflector antenna on the electrical performance of the antenna system are explored. Under the requirement of FY-4 satellite, the range of position and angle changes of the sub-reflectors of the antenna system are obtained, which provides a reference for the performance analysis and prediction of the antenna sub-system in the process of installation and operation. It is concluded that the main beam efficiency and the main beam pointing offset of the far-field pattern of antenna can meet the requirements of the system when the position and angle changes of the first sub-reflector are controlled within +/- 1.5mm and +/- 0.05 degrees respectively, and the position and angle changes of the second sub-reflector are controlled within +/- 3 mm and +/- 0.05 degrees respectively.

AB  - Coastlines on Earth always change due to both natural and human causes. Scientists concerned the position of coastlines as it can provide useful information for coastal zoning plans, coastlines position prediction and environmental managements. Extraction coastlines from remote sensing image became a common and effective method as it can save money and human resources to some extend and provide more accuracy results. DSAS, one plug-in in ArcGIS, is another popular analysis tool to calculate the change rates of coastlines. In this report, the author chose the Pearl River Estuary in China as the study area and analyzed spatiotemporal changes during the past 40 years by using Landsat data. In 1978, total length was 788.13km and increased to 980.57km in 2018. The proportion of artificial coastlines occupied 0% in 1978 and soared to 67% in 2018. The speed of coastlines change rates reached to 13.82 km/yr in artificial ones and nearly stable in natural types.

TI  - Non-Western Epistemology and the Understanding of the <i>Pachamama</i> (Environment) Within the World(s) of the <i>Aymara</i> Identity
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR CRIME JUSTICE AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to understand, from the perspective of the Bolivian Aymara identity of Bolivia, the intrinsic relation these persons have with Nature. This task is developed through the study of what they call Pachamama (sacred Mother Earth), which is part of their identity as an 'all interrelated whole, the Suma Qamana or Good Living', and which can be considered a non-Western epistemology. Their worldview breaks with the Western (anthropocentric) conception of environment that informs European and Anglo-Saxon continental law, and that is currently predominant in international standards of reference. Proponents of this perspective achieved a transformation in the international treatment of Nature, recognised by the United Nations (Resolution 63/278 of 2009, promoted by the Bolivian State), gaining inspiration from the inclusion by Ecuador of Pacha Mama (Nature) as a subject of rights in its constitution (2008).

AB  - Satellite remote sensing data is becoming more and more abundant, In order to realize automatic detection of ships on the sea surface, this paper presents an adaptive intelligent ship detection method, a novel nearest feature learning classifier (NFLC), which combines the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) feature extraction with nearest feature learning classification. Due to the wide variety of detection ships, the NFLC can obtain a better experimental result than conventional detection methods. The detection accuracy is enhanced by the feature training in large databases and the performance of the system can be continuously improved through the target learning. In addition, compared to convolutional neural network algorithm, it can save the computation time by using the nearest feature matching. The result shows that almost all of the offshore ships can be detected, and the total detection rate is 89.3% with 1000 experimental optical remote sensing images from Google Earth data.

AB  - Passive microwave data are much less affected by clouds than TIR data for the retrieval of land surface temperature (LST), providing its unique advantages in global mapping of LST. In this study, a physically-based algorithm for LST retrieval was applied to AMSR2 global brightness temperature data. The performances of this algorithm applied on different land cover types were further evaluated against nighttime MYD11A1 thermal infrared LST products. The results showed that (i) the overall accuracy of the algorithm is about 5.42 K by root mean square error (RMSE) and 2.99 K by bias against MODIS LST during nighttime; (ii) the algorithm overestimates the LST over all land types. The overestimation is most evident over barren/sparsely vegetated surfaces. The algorithm shows that the algorithm has a robust performance comparing with MODIS LST and could be applied to estimate LST effectively.

AB  - The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) is a new generation global observing system designed to replace the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). It has been deployed onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite and the first Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS-1, now renamed NOAA-20). SNPP VIIRS data have been used to derive global annual surface type (AST) products at the 1km resolution for 2012 and 2014-2017. These products use a 17-type global classification scheme developed by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP). Their overall accuracies varied from 77.6% to 78.6%, but the among-year differences were not statistically significant. New AST maps will be produced using future VIIRS observations, with an anticipated release of the 2018 product in late 2019. VIIRS AST products are available from ftp://ftp.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/smcd/JPSS/VIIRS-AST.

AB  - Complete high resolution geochemical maps are strongly needed for mineral exploration; however, the previously proposed methods for making geochemical maps have low accuracy. In this research, we propose a new algorithm called sample density based mixture interpolation (SADBAMIN) for high resolution geochemical map completion using remote sensing data. In the SADBAMIN algorithm, first, according to the measured copper data density on the map, the map is classified into two parts: the area for training (T area) and the area waiting to be predicted (P area). The two areas are classified by the edge of the data point set's alpha shape. In the T area, a triangle area among three neighbourhood points is interpolated by using the kriging model. Then, remote sensing data, including advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data, digital elevation model (DEM) data, and geophysics (magnetic) data, and copper geochemical data at all measured and partial randomly selected interpolated points are applied as training data to construct a random forest regression model. By considering the relationship between interpolation reliability and distance, a penalty on data selection probability of going into training data is given. Finally, by inputting the remote sensing data in the P area to the model, the copper data in this area can be obtained, and the completed map comprises these two parts. We use 16,000 measured points, 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean squared error (RMSE) for model evaluation. We achieved an RMSE of 293 ppm, while the RMSE of the previously proposed method is 347 ppm.

AB  - The OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has recently been introduced for calculation of soil moisture using only optical remote sensing data. Based on shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (STR)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trapezoidal space, the surface soil moisture can be estimated. In this study, Landsat 8 satellite observations were acquired and used for the analysis. The soil moisture during growing season in a semi- arid agricultural region in Songnen Plain, China was estimated based on the OPTRAM. The results may help to retrieval soil moisture and monitor its seasonal dynamics, which are of great significance for water resources planning management, sustainable land use and agricultural production.

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of regional economy in the Pearl River Estuary, drastic change in the content and transport patterns of suspended sediment in water bodies, which mainly caused by variations in land use patterns and bank erosion, imposed a profound impact on the development and evolution of the estuary Delta as well as the coastal ecological environment. In this study, we used the measured spectral data to establish inversion algorithm and to inverse suspended sediment based on CASI hyperspectral data, the accuracy of the inversed CASI and MODIS suspended sediment were verified with in-situ measured data. The results show that: 1) Single-hand exponential model (SSC=4.5e21.922*Rs(622.486)) can well retrieve the suspended sediment concentration in the experimental sea area, and the average relative error is approximately 11.15%; 2) The suspended sediment content lies between 0.45-12.15 mg/L over the study area, and the main input source is land-based input from the west coast of Huangmao Sea, the ecological impact on the dolphin reserve can he neglected; 3) Combined with MODIS-based remote sensing images of suspended sediment in the Pearl River Estuary, it is found that there is an obvious branching phenomena when the sediment is transported from the Huangmao Sea to the outside of the mouth. The main axis of runoff is transported along the northeast direction of Dajin Island to the southeast direction of Dajin Island in the estuary area, while the coastal current is transported along the northeast direction of Dajin Island to the southwest direction of Dajin Island. As a result, there arc low suspended sediment and high transparency sea areas in the north of Dajin Island, which are suitable for aquaculture.

TI  - Evaluation of regional estimates of winter wheat yield by assimilating three remotely sensed reflectance datasets into the coupled WOFOST-PROSAIL model
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - To estimate regional-scale winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) yield, we developed a data-assimilation scheme that assimilates remotely sensed reflectance into a coupled crop growth-radiative transfer model. We generated a time series of 8-day, 30-m-resolution synthetic Kalman Smoothed reflectance by combining MODIS surface reflectance products with Landsat surface reflectance using a KS algorithm. We evaluated the assimilation performance using datasets with different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., three dates for the 30-m Landsat reflectance, 8-day and 1-km MODIS surface reflectance, and 8-day and 30-m synthetic KS reflectance) into the coupled WOFOST-PROSAIL model. Then we constructed a four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) cost function to account for differences between the observed and simulated reflectance. We used the shuffled complex evolution-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm to minimize the 4DVar cost function and optimize important input parameters of the coupled model. The optimized parameters were used to drive WOFOST and estimate county-level winter wheat yield in a region of China. By assimilating the synthetic KS reflectance data, we achieved the most accurate yield estimates (R-2 = 0.44, 0.39, and 0.30; RMSE = 598, 1288, and 595 kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively), followed by Landsat reflectance (R-2 = 0.21, 0.22, and 0.33; RMSE = 915, 1422, and 637 kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively) and MODIS reflectance (R-2 = 0.49, 0.05, and 0.22; RMSE = 1136, 1468, and 700 kg/ha for 2009, 2013, and 2014, respectively) at the county level. Thus, our method improves the reliability of regional-scale crop yield estimates.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the risk factors for axillary metastasis in patients with sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) positive breast cancer (BC). Methods: Pathological data of 192 BC patients with positive results of sentinel lymph node biopsy who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) were analyzed. The predictive model of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) was used to predict the risk of axillary non-SLN metastasis in patients, and the accuracy of the model was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: The results showed no statistical differences in age, tumor type, estrogen receptor expression, tissue differentiation, and the number of negative SLNs (all P > 0.05), but statistical differences in tumor size, tumor number, the number of positive SLNs, and SLN metastasis rates were significant (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that the tumor size, the number of tumors, and positive SLN rates were independent risk factors for non-SLN metastasis. The area under the ROC curve of the MSKCC model was 0.771. Conclusion: Tumor size, the number of tumors, and positive SLN rates are independent risk factors for axillary non-SLN metastasis in SLN-positive patients. If the SLN is positive associated with the presence of these clinical symptoms, ALND is therefore advised. The MSKCC model has a high predictive accuracy for breast cancer patients with non-SLN metastasis.

AB  - In order to resolve the conflict between the temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing, we plan to construct a virtual satellite constellation by combining multiple satellites with high spatial resolution sensors to improve the temporal resolution. By using satellite-land synchronized data obtained in 4 different offshore regions near China between 2015 and 2017, we evaluated the remote sensing chlorophyll inverse algorithms of different sensors, and further determined a remote sensing inverse model, which is suitable for data of multiple medium-high resolution satellites. By using GOMS/GOCI chlorophyll concentration product as reference, we first projected the chlorophyll concentration values inverted from satellites HJ-1A, HJ-1B, GF-1,GF-4, Landsat 5, Landsat 8 to a 50-m grid by applying flux conservation resampling method. We further applied a recalibration method to obtain recalibration equations, which make the chlorophyll concentration values inverted from different sensors comparable.

AB  - Poyang Lake is the largest fresh lake in China, whose wetland ecological environment and water level change are very complex. Its abundant wetland resources make it a habitat for many migratory birds. Therefore, it is of great significance to study water level and morphological changes of wetlands in Poyang Lake. Synthetic aperture radar can penetrate cloud and mist which is different from traditional optical satellites, it can effectively acquire the reflective characteristics of all objects. The key point in extraction of water area and wetland is threshold selection. An adaptively sample selection method is used to find a perfect distribution with two bounces and then the lowest point between two bounces is the optimal threshold. In recent years, satellite remote sensing has been able to monitor changes of wetland water environment and ecology on a large scale. InSAR technique makes up for the shortcomings in traditional hydrological observation of water level such as few sampling points, long observation period, high monitoring cost and unobservable areas. In this paper, the water or wetland area and water level change in Poyang Lake are obtained from two products of Sentinel-1 data separately. Ground range detected (GRD) images were used to get morphological changes of water and wetland with the adaptively sample selection method, it shows a good application: (1) the area covered by water became largest in July and August; (2) the area of wetland decreased gradually from January to June and the area of wetland showed an opposite trend from September to December. Single look complex (SLC) images were used to get water level change with InSAR technique, it also can be concluded that: (1) the biggest water level change is from July to August, and water level changes between other months showed little differences in value but more differences in spatial distribution; (2) the boundary of water level changes is basically consistent with the boundary between water body and wetland. The results are of great significance for the monitoring and regulation of the water ecological environment of Poyang Lake wetland.

AB  - According to the characteristic of different air bubbles and sediments content in the Yellow River ice (YRI), the YRI is classified into three types: thermal ice (TI), frazil ice (FI) and consolidated ice (CI). In this paper, we are modeling YRI firstly, and the backscattering coefficient of the ice cover based on this model is deduced on the basis of the integral equation model (IEM) and the vector radiation transfer theory (VRT). Due to the characteristics of different types of YRI corresponding to different microwave electromagnetic scattering, a method of classification of YRI based on decision tree is proposed. The method uses horizontal polarization backscattering coefficient, correlation coefficient and cross polarization power to classify different types of YRI. Finally, the classification accuracy is evaluated by using the confusion matrix (CM). The results show that the classifier is effective for the YRI classification.

AB  - Based on Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS)/Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)/Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors data (1975-2018), MODIS NDVI data (2000-2018), some average annual precipitation and temperature data of surrounding meteorological stations (1980-2015) and ASTER GDEM digital elevation model data, we carried on the fragmentation degree, spatial-temporal differentiation and correlation analyses on the climate change factors (average annual precipitation and temperature), human activity factors (urban and rural residential land, regional lighting index, land use change) and remote sensing index (normalized differential vegetation index, NDVI) in Zijin Mountain region. The results show that some ecological, cultural and geographical indicators have changed in the Zijin Mountain region for the past 44 years. The study area of urban and rural construction land has increased by 4.29 times. Over the 32 years, the average vegetation index of the whole basin has increased by 35.12%, the area of shrubs has increased to 52.60% of the basin's available area, and the area of forest has increased by about 1.3% The average annual precipitation change rate of 36a (19802015) was +18.7 mm/10a, and the annual average temperature change rate was +0.42 degrees C /10a. Above all, the study area has had a warm-humid tendency to develop. In the past 44 years, the habitat fragmentation index of the ecological environment has increased by 6.04 times. The Zijin Mountain region has been transformed from an original mountain grassland ecosystem to a mountainous dry-farming agricultural ecosystem. Human activities have changed the original ecological structure, accelerated the habitat fragmentation, and become the leading factor in the degradation of ecological structure.

AB  - This study uses the MODIS-Aqua satellite data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and matches with the time and location of the chlorophyll-a concentration data measured by SeaBASS to select the satellite data time and observation area. The number of matched data is 924. Firstly, remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) is used to classify satellite remote sensing data into different water bodies, and then the best chlorophyll-a concentration algorithm is established. The results show that the mean percentage difference (MPD) in Case 2 water is 131.2% through comparing the percentage of chlorophyll-a provided by MODIS with the in-situ observations. In addition, the chlorophyll-a concentration of the new algorithm compared with the in-situ chlorophyll-a concentration are also calculated. The mean percentage difference in Case 2 water is 26.6%, and the average chlorophyll-a is 6.16 mg/m(3), which is much closer to the in-situ value,7.22 mg/m(3) than the average chlorophyll-a of MODIS, 13.7 mg/m(3). The chlorophyll-a concentration deduced by the new algorithm of this study is consistent with the in-situ values in Case 2 water, and it is much more convergent than the data of MODIS. Obviously, the new algorithm established in this study can be used to improve the chlorophyll-a concentration estimation results in Case 2 water. When the new algorithm is applied to calculate the chlorophyll-a concentration of the marginal Northwestern Pacific, the value is still higher than the offshore waters. Additionally, the chlorophyll-a concentration calculated by this new algorithm is lower than the value provided by MODIS, but the difference between them in the offshore waters is small. However, the algorithm of this study can improve the overestimation of the original MODIS value.

AB  - In InSAR time series analysis, persistent scatterers (PS) are pixels that remain temporally correlated even in areas of otherwise high decorrelation. Using these stable pixels as reference points, we can analyze deformation signals on the Earth's surface down to the millimeter scale. PS possess different physical and statistical properties compared to the background, and analyzing the statistical behavior of PS can help to elucidate radar backscattering behavior from different terrain. Here, we propose a new statistical characterization of SAR image power using a mixture distribution of PS and nonPS points, i.e. clutter. We find that a lognormal distribution fits both pixel types, validated by a scattering model that is a function of bandwidth. We present here from C-band RADARSAT-2 data, and will compare these with additional C-band Sentinel data and L-band data from ALOS-2.

AB  - Hurricane is one of the most devastating natural disasters on earth, posing great threats to people living in coastal areas. Thus, a better understanding of human settlement dynamics, especially in hurricane-prone areas, is in great need. This study examines nighttime satellite-derived human settlement in hurricane-prone areas of conterminous U.S from 1992 to 2013. To solve the lack of on-board calibration problem and saturation of luminosity problem, the original DMSP/OLS time series were intercalibrated and desaturated using NDVI products from AVHRR and MODIS. A popular index, VANUI, was derived and was later applied Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen trend test. Four hurricane-prone zones, representing different level of hurricane proneness, were delineated from historical NAB-origin storm tracks using a wind-speed weighted track density function. The dynamic of VANUI in different hurricane-prone zones was finally quantified and analyzed. The result suggests a distinctive discrepancy in settlement intensity between northern and southern study area. It also indicates that the both the extent and the increase rate in settlement intensity positively correlate hurricane proneness in predefined hurricane-prone zones.

AB  - Since 2008, macroalgal blooms of Ulva Prolifera (also called green tide) have occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea (YS), which has caused environmental and economic problems. In recent years, a variety of detection algorithms for green tide have been proposed. However, the extraction thresholds of each algorithm are uncertain because of atmospheric conditions, the distribution of green tides, etc. In this paper, Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and Landsat-8 data were used to explore the threshold stability of some common detection algorithms for green tide, including the AFAI, DVI, EVI, IGAG, and NDVI. Four scenes of GOCI satellite data from 2016 to 2018 were selected for the experiments. The first step was to extract the green tide areas in one region to determine the threshold for each algorithm. In this step, the extraction results of the Landsat-8 data, which has a resolution of 30 m, was seen as the true value of the green tide coverage. Then, we determined the threshold value for each algorithm by visual inspection. The thresholds determined in the first step were used to extract the green tide area in the other three regions, and the extraction results were compared by visual contrast. A comparison of the extraction precision for each algorithm in the other three regions indicated that the threshold stability of the AFAI algorithm was the best among these data in the YS region.

AB  - Tea is a characteristic cash crop native to China, mainly distributed in the south of the Yangtze River. Obtaining the planting area and spatial distribution of tea gardens is of great significance to improve the economic and ecological benefits of tea. In this paper, a method for extracting tea plantation area based on multi-source remote sensing satellite data is proposed. We collect the Landsat8 OLI, Sentinel-2, HJ-1A/B and GF-1 WFV data from 2017 to 2018, and then we do the pre-processing for all the remote sensing data, calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI) of the data, calculate the spectral characteristics of the data and obtain the Gabor textual characteristics after principal component analysis(PCA) of the data. In order to obtain the time-series data, all features of Sentinel-2, HJ-1A/B and GF-1 WFV data are relatively calibrated to Landsat8 OLI data, and finally the tea plantation area is extracted by support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We extract the area of tea garden of Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province, and the result is 235.68 km(2) and the results were verified by precision. The results show that this method can obtain high precision for the extraction of tea garden area, which is of great significance for further production and application.

AB  - Deep learning algorithms are widely used in remote sensing image scene understanding. Generally, a large-scale annotated dataset is essential to train a deep neural network for classification. In practical terms, however, a large amount of unknown remote sensing images obtained from different sensors need to be understood which may vary from resolution, geolocation and imaging conditions compared with annotated datasets. In this paper, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework based on ResNet-18 is presented to transfer the knowledge of an existing annotated land cover dataset to other remote sensing data, decreasing the discrepancy among images across sensors. The results show a significant improvement in scene understanding of new remote sensing images.

M3  - Article
AB  - Enteric pathogens can be transmitted within the household and the surrounding neighborhood. The objective of this study was to understand the effect of neighborhood-level sanitation coverage on contamination of the household environment with levels of fecal indicator bacteria in rural Bangladesh. We conducted spot-check observations of sanitation facilities in neighboring households (NHs) within a 20-m radius of target households with children aged 6-24 months. Sanitation facilities were defined as improved (a private pit latrine with a slab or better) or unimproved. Fecal coliforms (FCs) on children's hands and sentinel toy balls were measured and used as indicators of household-level fecal contamination. We visited 1,784 NHs surrounding 428 target households. On average, sentinel toy balls had 2.11 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.37) log(10) colony-forming units (CFUs) of FCs/toy ball and children's hands had 2.23 (SD = 1.15) log(10) CFU of FCs/two hands. Access to 100% private improved sanitation coverage in the neighborhood was associated with a small and statistically insignificant difference in contamination of sentinel toy balls (difference in means = -0.13 log(10) CFU/toy ball; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: -0.64, 0.39; P = 0.63) and children's hands (difference in means = -0.11 log(10) CFU/two hands; 95% CI: -0.53, 0.32; P = 0.62). Improved sanitation coverage in the neighborhood had limited measurable effect on FCs in the target household environment. Other factors such as access to improved sanitation in the household, absence of cow dung, presence of appropriate water drainage, and optimal handwashing practice may be more important in reducing FCs in the household environment.

TI  - Diurnal pattern of pre-weaning den visits and nursing in breeding pairs of captive dingoes (<i>Canis dingo</i>)
T2  - MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The period before pups are weaned represents a key developmental stage for canids that is directly related to the survivability of the pack. Yet our understanding of the role of the parents during this period when pups are confined to a den is rather limited. We sought further insight into this period by observing diurnal patterns of pre-weaning den visits and nursing behaviour in a captive population of dingoes (Canis dingo). We continuously video-monitored behaviour at dens of four captive, genetically pure, dingo pairs (one litter each) during the first three postpartum weeks just before the start of weaning. Mothers occupied the den almost continuously during the night, but significantly less so during the day, and consistently spent most den time nursing. Fathers were largely absent from inside the den despite lack of apparent aggression from females, low outside temperatures, and space for them inside. They spent a large percentage of time on top of the den, suggestive of sentinel duty, although further experiments are necessary to substantiate this. Although limited to captive animals, our observations are consistent with scant reports of bi-parental care in wild dingoes and with suggestions in the literature that reduced parental care in household and free-ranging domestic dogs might be, at least partly, due to the weakening of bi-parental care during their long history of close association with and dependence on humans.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - This piece takes a comparative perspective to examine the extent to which the Georgian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate (MP) may be seen as 'tools' of Russian soft power in their respective countries. Following a discussion of the concept of soft power and Russian approaches to it, the relationship between the Georgian Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (MP) and Moscow, and the nature of potential influence is queried. In assessing how far the churches serve as a conduit of Russian ideas, values and worldview, the positions and statements of their respective leaderships are studied, particularly in relation to the conflicts involving Russia that occurred in Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine from 2014. Acknowledging the churches' potential in this regard, the study points to the need for nuanced analysis and to significant and sometimes surprising differences between the two country case studies.

TI  - Resisting hostility generated by terror: An agent-based study
T2  - Figshare
M3  - Data study
AB  - We propose an agent-based model leading to a decrease or an increase of hostility between agents after a major cultural threat such as a terrorist attack. The model is inspired from the Terror Management Theory and the Social Judgement Theory. An agent has a cultural identity defined through its acceptance segments about each of three different cultural worldviews (i.e., Atheist, Muslim, Christian) of the considered society. An agents acceptance segment is composed from its acceptable positions toward a cultural worldview, including its most acceptable position. An agent forms an attitude about another agent depending on the similarity between their cultural identities. When a terrorist attack is perpetrated in the name of an extreme cultural identity, the negatively perceived agents from this extreme cultural identity point of view tend to decrease the width of their acceptance segments in order to differentiate themselves more from the threatening cultural identity. We generated a set of populations with cultural identities compatible with data from a survey on attitudes among a large sample representative of the population of France; we then simulated the reaction of these agents facing a terrorist attack from Muslim extremists. For most populations, the average attitude toward Muslims becomes more negative. However, for some specific populations, we noticed the opposite effect as the average attitude of the population toward Muslims becomes less negative. In these populations, the Muslim agents strongly differentiate themselves from the terrorists extreme cultural identity, and the other agents are aware of these changes. These reactions are due to particular properties of their cultural identities that are identified in this paper. Copyright: CC BY 4.0

AB  - Grass pollens are a major source of aeroallergens globally, inducing allergic asthma and hay fever in up to 500 million people worldwide. Pollen forecasting research and methods are site-dependent and tend to be empirically derived composites of expert knowledge and weather data. In this study we utilize satellite-based information of landscape conditions and phenology to better discern and predict grass pollen evolution. We employed machine learning approaches to formulate and better understand relationships between landscape phenology and seasonal flowering-induced pollen concentrations. We show that machine learning approaches significantly improved pollen prediction capabilities and provided key information to better attribute changes in pollen counts driven by shifting ecological landscapes from climate change drivers.

AB  - The automatic matching of corresponding regions in remote sensing imagery acquired by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors is a crucial pre-requesite for many data fusion endeavours such as target recognition, image registration, or 3D-reconstruction by stereogrammetry. Driven by the success of deep learning in conventional optical image matching, we have carried out extensive research with regard to deep matching for SAR-optical multi-sensor image pairs in the recent past. In this paper, we summarize the achieved findings, including different concepts based on (pseudo-)siamese convolutional neural network architectures, hard negative mining, alternative formulations of the underlying loss function, and creation of artificial images by generative adversarial networks. Based on data from state-of-the-art remote sensing missions such as TerraSAR-X, Prism, Worldview-2, and Sentinel-1/2, we show what is already possible today, while highlighting challenges to be tackled by future research endeavors.

AB  - This article introduces one livelihood Hansalim thought of Jang Il-Soon and suggests a comprehensive and ethically conscious understanding of ecosystem integrating natural and religious worldview. A crisis in the ecosystem was first diagnosed as a problem within the ecosystem itself caused by political, economic and social factors. It is now understood that the problem is rooted in the way humans think about nature. The Life Thought of Jang Il-Soon comprises social and spiritual pursuits emphasizing ethical thinking and practice to overcome environmental crisis. One Livelihood Hansalim Movement of Jang Il-Soon integrates Donghak and Christian teachings, and emphasizes that we as human beings have unique rights and obligations, but are a part of all living things where these rights and obligations must be reconsidered through integrated aspects. The main principles of life-centeredness and One Livelihood give us the foundations for ecological awareness and depth of religious mind. These thoughts will allow us to transform ourselves and their practices could be begun in local communities. The Hansalim Movement propose an integrative environmental ethics, and could be used for the base of environmental education toward sustainable future.

AB  - Background: Sentinel surveillance of transmitted HIV drug resistance (TDR) among recently infected populations within a country was recommended by the World Health Organization from 2004 to 2015.Methods: Serum specimens collected as part of the 2010, 2011 and 2012 National Antenatal Sentinel HIV Prevalence Surveys were used to estimate provincial and national TDR prevalence in South Africa.Results: Moderate (5-15%) levels of transmitted non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) drug class resistance were detected in three of five provinces surveyed in 2010 and 2011 (Eastern Cape, Free State and KwaZulu-Natal). Inclusion of all nine of South Africa's provinces in the 2012 survey enabled calculation of a national TDR point prevalence estimate: TDR to the NNRTI drug class was 5.4% (95% CI 3.7, 7.8%), with K103N and V106M being the most frequently detected mutations. TDR estimates for the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) drug class were 1.1% (95% CI 0.5, 2.4%) and 0.6% (95% CI 0.1, 1.6%) for protease inhibitors (PI).Conclusions: These data provide national TDR estimates for South Africa in 2012 and indicate that levels of TDR were low to moderate for the NNRTI drug class and low for NRTIs and Pls in the population surveyed.

TI  - EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE OF ALARM EAVESDROPPING ON AMAZONIAN MIXED-FLOCK FOLLOWERS BY TWO SOCIAL SENTINEL SPECIES: THE DUSKY-THROATED ANTSHRIKE (<i>THAMNOMANES ARDESIACUS</i>) AND THE CINEREOUS ANTSHRIKE (<i>T</i>. <i>SCHISTOGYNUS</i>)
T2  - ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed-species flocks of birds represent an ecological phenomenon resulting from a diversity of complex interactions and evolutionary pressures. Tropical and temperate forests include many examples of passerine birds that interact by forming mixed-species flocks and by eavesdropping on the alarm calls produced by heterospecifics. In the mixed-flock systems of the Amazonia, species of antshrikes (Thamnomanes sp.) have been shown to provide other flock members valuable information regarding threats from predation through their frequent alarm calls. Several species of flock attendees respond to the alarms of antshrikes with predator-avoidance behaviors, but no study has yet shown a reciprocal relationship between flock members and flock-leading antshrikes. Apparently distinct from mixed-flock systems of other forests, there has been little evidence to support that flock-leading species of antshrikes benefit from the alarm signals of other flock members. Using alarm signals recorded during in situ exposures of mixed-flock species to trained raptors, we conducted a playback experiment on 16 different mixed flocks to see to what degree antshrikes may be eavesdropping on the alarms of Myrmotherula antwrens. Eight Dusky-throated Antshrikes (Thamnomanes ardesiacus) and eight Cinereous Antshrikes (T. schistogynus) were presented with i) conspecific alarms, ii) White-flanked Antwren (Myrmotherula axillaris) alarms, iii) Grey Antwren (M. menetriesii alarms), and iv) a control. The results of our experiment support that the alarms of the two species of antwrens elicit a significant response from both species of antshrikes. Our model also shows that the responses of antshrikes to antwrens' alarms are indistinguishable from their response to conspecific alarms, yet different from a control (Marginal R-2 = 0.36, Conditional R-2 = 0.37). This suggests that highly social flock-leading species such as Thamnomanes antshrikes may benefit from the information provided by flock mates regarding predators. Furthermore, these patterns are consistent with eavesdropping interactions observed within mixed-flocks in ecologically similar but geographically distant forests.

TI  - Temperature/emissivity separation using hyperspectral thermal infrared imagery and its potential for detecting the water content of plants
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is among the most effective tools for retrieving land surface temperatures (LSTs) at different scales using remotely sensed data with different spatial resolutions. Significant advancements have recently been made in TIR sensor technology, and hyperspectral TIR images now provide an opportunity to separate temperatures and emissivities with high accuracy. In this study, an experiment is performed to retrieve temperatures and emissivities based on a hyperspectral TIR spectrometer, the HyperCam-LW (Long Wave), and show the potential of this instrument in detecting the water content variations, water deficiencies and health of plants. In this study, a temperature emissivity separation (TES) method based on spectral smoothness is used to retrieve the temperature and emissivity of wheat plants from hyperspectral TIR data. Based on the retrieved temperatures and emissivities, the variations in the emissivity from different wheat plants are observed, and the relationship between the emissivity dynamics and water content is analysed. A comparison of the temperature of different plants was performed, and the results clearly showed the canopy structure of the plants. Subsequently, the health of the wheat was analysed, and the results showed that for water-deficit plants, the emissivity increased in a consistent manner over all spectral bands while the spectral shape remained almost unchanged because the spectral emissivity is sensitive to water content variations in plants. In this paper, the results also demonstrated that it is possible and perhaps reasonable to attribute the overall increase in the emissivity of plants with water deficits to cavity effects resulting from biochemical and structural changes in the leaves caused by water deficits.

AB  - This paper examines the death consciousness displayed by the Maeng Nanja essays and considers that this death consciousness leads to a specific perspective toward life. This perspective understands itself and the world as a whole as well as in the three dimensions, and embodies the Buddhist viewpoint of life and death. A particular theme within the Maeng Nanja essays is death consciousness. A series of works based on death requires an intensive consideration of the ontological significance network of Maeng Nanja’s essays in a world that is continuously acquired. Particularly, for Maeng Nanja, the graveyard was a heterotopia that can be experienced in the utopian reality. As a heterotopic space, the originality of the place created by Maeng Nanja was the author's objection to the cemetery interpretation that has been constructed or adhered to, and corresponds to Foucault's Heterotopia in that it interferes with it and dismantles it. Additionally, Maeng Nanja detects and diagnoses the Buddhist view inherent in the works of the worldwide writer of great literature according to the broad Buddhist theory and reasoning method, and finds a similarity with the Oriental spirit. The Buddhist worldview and philosophical insights are narrative in logical relation, and the apocalypticism of death is presupposed as the principle of life itself through the apolism, which is constructed in this way. The research on differentiated Maeng Nanja essays in terms of the content will expand the diversity of subject, as the theme of essay literature, from among gravitational field and magnetic field essay literary circles, lacks a full discussion about death, as compared to other genres. By confirming Maeng Nanja’s essay writing by the essai spirit, it will become a comprehension of essays on a “cultural level.” The essay work of Maeng Nanja embodying the reflection and the semanticization of human life through death is the search for overcoming the material bias of the essay literature, expanding the possibility of a new narrative method, and the realization of the creative spirit.

Part of the project is a critical reflection on the experience afterwards. Students needed to critically reflect on their learning experience as part of the project assessment to fulfil the required learning outcomes, as constructive learning needs reflection.Findings This project introduced students to practical/applied financial and managerial accounting and sustainability reporting and created an element of cognitive dissonance with regard to their financial reporting-biased prior knowledge. While some students considered the project on financial/managerial accounting and sustainability reporting a beneficial undertaking and felt their disciplinary worldview challenged, others thought it was interesting but still preferred to remain with the primarily financial focus of their discipline.Originality/value The project was undertaken to allow students to engage with their disciplinary material, both conventional and sustainability reporting-related, in a constructive learning manner.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of corporate social responsibility on corporate financial performance based on Christian worldview. Research samples were selected from financial supervisory service DART system(dart.fss.or.kr) during 2014 and 2016. The social responsibility of ESG Index was developed by the Korea corporate governance institute. The samples were 168 firm. 168 companies were able to measure social responsibility index and financial performance.The result of hypothesis testing are as follows. First, we found that the firms good at social responsibility are good at ROA and ROE. Second, the social responsibility index is positively(+) correlated with ROA and ROE. Finally, it is shown that the social responsibility index has a positive(+) influence on firm's financial performance. And it was analyzed to influence the financial performance of the company in the order of social responsibility index, TAT(total asset turnover), and SGR(sales growth rate). This is a result that shows that the general company also considers social responsibility important.Based on the Christian worldview, companies should actively participate in social responsibility. Encouraging these activities would entail sustainable development of the firms.

Using Tolstoy's famous words in writing education can help today's learners to establish the correct worldview, gain wisdom in life, and cultivate humanities. This paper aims to suggest the Habruta-based writing learning method using Tolstoy's words, focusing on the case of writing lessons <Thinking and Expression> in the first semester of 2019. In this study, the Havruta-based writing learning process using Tolstoy’s famous words proceeds to the individual thinking stage, the pair discussion stage, the group discussion stage, the presentation stage, the writing stage, and the evaluation stage. Havruta-centered writing education using Tolstoy's sayings centered on this process makes it possible to carry out the most difficult humanistic thinking and writing processes and also serves as a well-rounded education in charge of liberal arts writing.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate How national/ language identity and Korean culture/ social identity affect the North Korean refugee youths’ psychology and emotion and school life, and to examine the degree of how the education provided in ‘the residential Christian alternative school’ contributes positively to the settlement of North Korean refugee youths in South Korea.This study was conducted with surveying North Korean refugee youths who stayed in two residential Christian alternative schools in Seoul. The questionnaires were distributed to 130 NorthKorean refugee youths selected for the survey. 123 of them were collected and used.For the data analyses, this study adopted Frequency Analysis, Exploratory Factor Analysis, Cronbach’s , t-test, One way AN-OVA, Pearson’s correlation, multiple regression analysis.The results of this study showed that although the education and care are given to North Korean refugee youths through the Christian alternative school program, they still face identity confusion in multidimensional and holistic dimensions. Thess difficulties are due to national belonging sense, language communication problems, cultural maladjustment, questions about their identity in the life cycle development process.As for the establishment of identity, this researcher suggested four mission strategies in order to overcome the crisis faced by North Korean refugee youths. These strategies are to solve practical problems, to improve their adaptability in South Korean society, and to establish a proper system of worldview, country, language, culture and Christian identity. They are ‘Mission to sustain the education,’ ‘Mission to support Cultural Adaptation,’ ‘Mission to support holistic growth (physical, mental, emotional, soul, relationship),’ ‘Mission to develop the Next-generation miss- ion resource for North Korean missions.’

AB  - Through the 〈The Fairy and the Woodcutter〉 in the Naver webtoon <Gyeryong Seonnyeojeon> and the Daum webtoon <Princess Bari>, which use the tale of 〈The Fairy and the Woodcutter〉 as a medium, this article observed how the meaning of ‘deer’, which was a particular facilitator in the worldview of the original tale of 〈The Fairy and the Woodcutter〉 among aspects reattached as cultural contents of the tale, changed as the story was recreated as new contents in the form of modern webtoons.The deer in 〈The Fairy and the Woodcutter〉 in the Daum webtoon <Princess Bari> (a series of 5 sessions published from March 29, 2019 to April 26, 2019) was a servant who was thrown out of the house of Jo Cham Lee after doing wrong and while it was a facilitator in the original tale, it newly appears as the contributor of murder by getting revenge for the house of Jo Cham Lee. This webtoon raises questions about violence that occurs under the name of ‘love’.The ‘deer’ in the Naver webtoon <Gyeryong Seonnyeojeon> is in a love triangle with the protagonist Gyeryong Seonnyeo and Kim Geum and it is set as a character that conflicts and communes with the protagonist. Also, the ‘deer’ is a central role that expands the subject consciousness of reconciliation between the world and the individual through the time and space of a multi-layered cosmology centering on the views of nidana in Buddhism.Fables are narrations that bring about universal emotion through original forms and they construct multi-leveled worldviews. The fantasy and imagination of fable structures themselves become a form of strength to maintain the unrealistic thinking of stories. However, as fables are reproduced as modern stories as the primary sources of cultural contents, they are newly transformed from stories that can be understood from awareness systems of the times in which fables are created to stories that can be understood from cultural awareness systems of the present. In other words, historical changes take place according to social and historical changes of the age in which fable motifs are applied, and this is because projections are made of values and perceptions that fit the age. This can definitely be seen through the meaning changes of ‘deer’ in 〈The Fairy and the Woodcutter〉 recreated as a webtoon.

AB  - Bae Hye-soo’s Ssanggabpocha is a place where people with stories that would be difficult to share with others meet at a stall. There, they meet the woman running the stall, who wears a red hanbok (Moonju-Shin). It is a work of fiction.This work appears to be quite ordinary and commonplace, but it  simultaneously shows unusual phases of various characters in its episodes. What makes this work distinctive is the worldview portrayed in it that is based on mythical imagination. The artist borrows and fuses elements of Korean mythology familiar to the public, such as Lee, Seung, and Samshin. On the basis this communication system of mutual subjectivity, a human-centered fuze is created. The characteristic feature of shaman-haman mythology regarding its worldview-relaxation of Han-up through empathy and coexistence-is found.It is a remarkable work in that it reveals the value of win-win  through the stories of common people who are likely to be all around us. Moreover, it can also be highly regarded owing to its expansion of the popular, traditional worldview represented by shamanism.

AB  - In this paper, I draw upon Vanhoozer for the theological cultural hermeneutics(Vanhoozer et al., 2007/2009) to interpret <Radiant Child>(2016), the painting by Javaka Steptoe, the Caldecott medalist in 2017. Vanhoozer suggested interpreting the cultural text by offering theologically thick descriptions of everyday text and trends. According to his cultural interpretation methodology, <Radiant child> itself was explored in three aspects: writing, picture, and peritext. The text focused on Basquiat’s childhood and the mother’s role and his artistic passion and success. The illustration showed motifs, letters streets, galleries, and his graffiti paintings. The peritext showed his image of success in the title, the front and back cover, and the title page. The world behind the text showed the artist’s intention, the cultural background of Basquiat’s success and the Caldecott Award criteria. Finally, reading the world ahead of the text revealed that the book reviews mostly paid attention to the artistic features of the text. As a result, the world view of this work was revealed as expressive individualism, which was discussed from a Christian point of view. This study contributes by helping Christians to effectively participate as cultural agents in our culture by letting them understand the worldview reflected in this age.

Wepropose a model for estimating the maximum wind speed of typhoons using Convolutional Recurrent NeuralNetwork (CRNN). Compared to the current method in investigating typhoons which is fully subjected to themeteorologist’s analyzing skill and domain knowledge, the proposed model assists meteorologists to obtain theobjective analysis of typhoons. In previous studies, they construct the model utilizing only CNN. However, oursuggested model is built with CNN followed by LSTM to consider the fact that the typhoons occur sequentially.We train the model by using each single channel in COMS satellite data composed of IR1, IR2, WV, and SWIR.As a result, the CRNN model trained on WV shows the lowest RMSE error, which is .

AB  - Various forms of communicative expressions are used in Simchungjeon, including informing in vertical relationship, self-humiliation, exposing the sense of indebtedness from self-pity, and compensation mentality.First, one of the communicative forms of Simchungjeon is informing in vertical relationship. Simchung is a character who crosses over the vertical relationship of celestiality, middle-earth(Mongeunsa), and the world of mortals. It is why her communication in form of informing is naturally embedded throughout the story. The communication in form of informing is not a verbal phenomenon that results from repeated accidents, which are often observed in classical novels. But it shows that there exist various gods in it that govern their own domains, and they communicate favorably with Simchung 'informing' them. Meantime, the process in which human and god, and real world and ideal world confer with each other flows in the story smoothly. The vertical relationship surrounding Simchung shows the method of communication taken by the contemporary people that embrace principle and order(fortunes or retributive justice) rather than symbolizes the life of inescapable fate.Second, self-humiliation and exposing the sense of indebtedness from self-pity are also the forms of communicative expressions often used in Simchungjeon. While they live, Simchung and her father keep communicating their hardship and the sense of indebtedness from it they go through. Her father's sense of indebtedness originates in his exhaustion of real life. It is highly likely that his sense of indebtedness

AB  - The Sentinel-2 mission allows the remote sensing of coastal waters environments with detailed imagery down to 10-m resolutions. In this study we explore different approaches in the retrieval of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) concentrations along the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian coasts in Italy, using empirical and model-based data to develop regressive and neural networks (NN) algorithms. The best performances, for both Chl-a and TSM, are obtained with NN algorithms, better suited in handling the high variance shown by in-situ target data, with a 0.33 mg m(-3) root-mean-square-error (RMSE) for Chl-a and RMSE = 1.95 g/m(3) for TSM. The forward bio-optical model used for the generation of synthetic training data shows inadequacies in modelling the different spectral features characterizing the oligotrophic Tyrrhenian Sea and the eutrophic Adriatic Sea. The suitability of Sentinel-2 MSI products is here confirmed, but further investigation is needed on some critical issues affecting remote sensing of coastal waters, such as the atmospheric correction problem, the analysis of bathymetric effects and the need of a large and reliable in-situ dataset.

T2  - GYNECOLOGIC AND OBSTETRIC INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for endometrial cancer staging is gaining wide diffusion, but there is no definitive evidence on the factors associated with the failure of mapping. Objectives: To analyze the factors associated with the possible failure of bilateral SLN mapping with indocyanine green (ICG). Methods: A prospective observational study without control on 110 patients with endometrial cancer apparently confined to the uterus, underwent laparoscopic surgical staging with SLN mapping with ICG. Results: Possible risk factors associated with bilateral mapping failure were analyzed, and a multivariate analysis was performed. The bilateral detection rate for SLNs mapping was 72.7%, whereas at least one SLN was detected in 79.1% of patients. No SLNs were identified in 6.3%. None of the patients or features related to tumor were associated with a risk of failure of the method. The only factor analyzed that was significantly associated with the success of bilateral mapping was the surgeon (p = 0.003). Conclusions: Neither obesity nor the presence of lymph node metastases was associated with mapping failure. However, there remains a need for further studies to understand all the mechanisms linked to the unsuccessful method results and to reduce the use of systematic lymphadenectomy in the case of mapping failure.

AB  - Marine Energy has been teaching for six years in the University of Basque Country, as an optional subject of the Grade in Engineering of Renewable Energies, in Eibar. Students can take this subject during their last year and the focus is practical. In the last editions hands-on computer exercises and practicals at a research laboratory have been combined to transmit the students the contents of the subject.The whole approach at the different parts of the subject is Project-Based Learning (PBL) and to that purpose, the open source programming language R https://cran.r-project.org/ plays an important role.R is a powerful language that is mainly used for statistical and graphical analysis and we have applied it in the spatio-temporal analysis of wave energy and data processing of lab experiments. For example, students learn how to visualize the potential of wave energy, and temperature or salinity gradient. Students also learn where to extract data from, either reanalysis like ERA5 https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home or different satellite data such as ENVISAT https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/?id=517&L=0.Finally, students are taken to visit operational facilities of wave energy like Mutriku and also do some practicals at a research laboratory specifically designed to carry out lab-scale experiments of waves and wave energy converters (WEC). All these aspects are successfully addressed and solved with R, a most interesting tool for problem solving, self-learning and learning by problems methods. The educational results are most satisfactory and students after finishing their studies, are ready to work in real-life facilities and laboratories in the field of wave energy

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To investigate the relationship between neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and non-sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in early stages of breast cancerMethods: Records of patients with clinically early stage (cT1-T3, N0) invasive breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy in combination with blue dye and lymphoscintigraphy between April 2015 and January 2017 were noted retrospectively. Pre-treatment NLR of the patients with and without non-SLN metastasis were compared.Results: A total of 178 patients with a mean age of 51,65 +/- 10,93 years were included. NLR was statistically significant in the non-SLN positive patients (p=0.011). Lymphovascular invasion and extracapsular extension of SLN were more common in the non-SLN positive group (all p<0.05). The ODDS value was found to be 3,733 (95% CI: 1,05-13,24) and the risk of metastasis in those with lymphovascular invasion was 3.73 fold. The ODDS value was found to be 10,267 (95% CI: 2,6340,12) and the risk of metastasis was 10,267 times greater in those with capsule spread.Conclusion: Lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular extension and NLR are the predictive parameters of non-SLN positivity. Pre-surgical NLR is a useful diagnostic tool for predicting non-SLN metastasis.

AB  - Radar and Optical Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are sources of information that are commonly employed to monitor earth surfaces for tasks related to ecology, agriculture, mobility, land management planning and land cover monitoring. Many studies have been conducted using one of the two sources, but how to smartly combine the complementary information provided by radar and optical SITS is still an open challenge. In this context, we propose a new neural architecture for the combination of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery at object level, applied to a real-world land cover classification task. Experiments carried out on the Reunion Island, a overseas department of France in the Indian Ocean, demonstrate the significance of our proposal.

AB  - In the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) framework many detection algorithms and techniques have been published in the recent literature; however the detection of vessels whose dimensions are in the order of the image spatial resolution is still challenging in rough sea state scenarios. This issue is addressed in the paper presented here by comparing rationale and performance of two detectors developed by the same authors: the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) and the Intensity Dual-Polarization Ratio Anomaly Detector (iDPolRAD). Both detectors are tested on a dual-polarization VV/VH Interferometric Wide Swath Sentinel-1 image acquired over the Suruga Bay on the Pacific Coast of Japan. The theory is presented here and the two detectors are compared against the Cell Average-Constant False Alarm Algorithm (CA-CFAR) showing both better performance than CFAR in terms of false alarms rejection.

AB  - This paper aims at developing a new enhanced algorithm for mapping semi-arid areas based on fusion techniques of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Light Detection And Ranging (LIDAR) datasets. Firstly, both datasets are preprocessed to remove geometric and radiometric errors; then features of interest are extracted from SAR and LiDAR products to build masks and identify meaningful classes. Finally, classification results are refined with morphological filters. The new algorithm has been tested on data acquired by TerraSAR-X and an airborne LiDAR sensor over the Natural Reserve of Maspalomas in Canary Islands. Results show an overall classification accuracy of 85% with an absolute increment of more than 14% compared to a classification in which only LiDAR data are used.

TI  - Assessment of moisture budget over West Africa using MERRA-2's aerological model and satellite data
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assessed the performance of NASA's Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and MERRA-2 aerological (P-E*) model in reproducing the salient features of West Africa water balance including its components from 1980 to 2013. In this study we have shown that recent reanalysis efforts have generated imbalances between regional integrated precipitation (P) and surface evaporation (E), and the effect is more in the newly released MERRA-2. The atmospheric water balance of MERRA and MERRA-2 were inter-compared and thereafter compared with model forecast output of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA-I) and Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55). Results indicated that a bias of 12-20 (5-13) mm/month in MERRA-2 (ERA-I) leads to the classification of the Sahel (14 degrees N-20 degrees N) as a moisture source during the West African Summer Monsoon. Comparisons between MERRA/MERRA-2 and prognostic fields from two ERA-I and JRA-55 indicated that the average P-E* in MERRA is 18.94 (52.24) mm/month which is less than ERA-I (JRA-55) over Guinea domain and 25.03 (4.53) mm/month greater than ERA-I (JRA-55) over the Sahel. In MERRA-2, average P-E* indicated 25.76 (59.06) mm/month which is less than ERA-I (JRA-55) over Guinea and 73.72 (94.22) mm/month less than ERA-I (JRA-55) over the Sahel respectively. These imbalances are due to adjustments in data assimilation methods, satellite calibration and observational data base. The change in convective P parameterization and increased re-evaporation of P in MERRA-2 is suggestive of the cause of positive biases in P and E. The little disagreements between MERRA/MERRA-2 and CRU precipitation highlights one of the major challenges associated with climate research in West Africa and major improvements in observation data and surface fluxes from reanalysis remain vital.

AB  - Satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation index (NDVI) data records offer important sources for long term correlation modelling over West Africa. In this study, we assessed long range correlations in half monthly NDVI records over West Africa from 1982 to 2011 using GIMMS NDVI. In our analysis, we assessed (a) the annual and seasonal trends obtained using Ordinary Linear Regression, (b) the detrended lag-1-autocorrelation C(1), (c) the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) scaling Hurst exponent h and (d) the Multifractal (MF) characteristics of NDVI. Results show that there exist some patterns or trends in the records that persist over time. The value of C(1) for NDVI was obtained as 0.989 is significant at 95% confidence interval. Consequently, the scaling h values of the Hurst DFA showed that about 37.4, 20.5, 41.7 and 0.5% of the vegetated areas are anti-correlated (h < 0.5), un-correlated (h = 0.5), correlated (0 :5 < h < 1) and uncorrelated random walk (h = 1), respectively. The trend analysis from Ordinary Least square Regression (OLR) shows that about 54.3, 0.1 and 45.6% of the vegetated areas are positively, uncorrelated and negatively correlated, respectively. Our findings revealed that the DFA method performed better than OLR and the findings could be useful in identifying areas with improved and degraded vegetation, which cannot be properly captured by the OLR method. Accordingly, the comparison of the MF-DFA results of original data to those of shuffled and surrogate series indicated that the multifractal nature of considered time-series is both from PDF and long-range correlations but arguably, MF due to long range correlation dominates over West Africa. The research is therefore helpful in the formulating crop and environmental management policies that may be used to improve ecosystem management using a long term plan (inter-annual) or short term (inter-seasonal) planning.

TI  - One-step nucleic acid amplification for intraoperative analysis of sentinel lymph node in papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Lymphadenectomy in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is controversial. It is indicated whenever metastases have been proven before or during surgery and as a prophylactic treatment in high-risk patients. However, 30-50% of cNO patients become pN1 postoperatively. In PTC, selective-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy (SLNB) with conventional intraoperative analysis is 8% false negative. One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is a molecular technique which allows real-time detection of mRNA encoding for cytokeratin 19. OSNA has been introduced in intraoperative analysis of several tumors to reduce false-negative rates and distinguish micrometastasis from macrometastasis. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of the introduction of OSNA in the intraoperative evaluation of the sentinel node (SN) in PTC.Design: We analyzed a series of 35 patients subjected to SLNB.Methods: All the dissected nodes, SN and non-SN, were evaluated with OSNA and cytology.Results: We obtained a total of 110 SN. SLNB proved positive in 14 patients (40%) with cytology and in 23(65.7%) with OSNA (P < 0.001). In the 29 patients with subsequent lymphadenectomy we obtained 360 lymph nodes ((52 positive in cytology (14.4%) and 107 in OSNA (29.7%)). Lymphadenectomy proved positive in 16 patients according to cytology (55%) and in 24 according to OSNA (83%) (P = 0002). The majority of patients with micrometastasis in SN showed only micrometastasis in lymphadenectomy.Conclusions: The present study shows selective-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy with one-step nucleic acid amplification technique to be feasible in papillary thyroid carcinoma. The quantitative nature of one-step nucleic acid amplification paves the way toward a more personalized surgical approach, limiting lymphadenectomy to patients with intraoperative evidence of macrometastasis in the sentinel node.

AB  - The availability of various satellite rainfall data potentially be used in monitoring meteorological droughts. In this study, products from the NCEP-CFSR (National Centers for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System Reanalysis) were analyzed to estimate meteorological drought in the Citarum Watershed, West Java, Indonesia. Assessment was carried out using NCEP-CFSR data from 1988 to 2013 and was applied to meteorological droughts using the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) index. The results showed that rainfall products from the NCEP-CFSR were not recommended to use in meteorological droughts because of the low correlation values of around 33%, MAE (Mean Absolute Error) 17.88 and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) 22.73. This research can be utilized as a reference to assess rainfall products from better satellite data in the future to monitor meteorological droughts.

AB  - In this study, land cover in Datca - Bozburun Special Environmental Protection Area was determined and limited changes were analyzed with satellite images and field research. The study area is the two peninsulas at the south west of Turkey surrounded by the Aegean Sea and Mediterranean Sea. The land is generally composed of mountainous and hilly terrains where mesozoic limestones are common. There are many gulfs and bays on the shores of both peninsulas. Mediterranean climate and vegetation are observed in the study area. Although there have been human settlements since ancient times, the land structure and limited agricultural areas prevented the presence of excess population. The port of Knidos on the western end of the Datca Peninsula was an important settlement developed in the past by maritime exportation, especially with the export of wine. Today, it attracts attention with its coastal tourism and some agricultural products (Olive, Almond, Carob etc.). The fact that the research area was announced as a special environmental-protection area prevented the changes in large-scale land cover and use. However, there are some limited changes around the bays and settlements. In this research, LANDSAT 7 ETM +(1997), SPOT 6/7 (2016), SPOT 6/7 (2018) satellite images and topographic maps were used. Satellite images were analyzed with ERDAS imagine software. Land cover was classified according to COME land cover classification system. Supervised classification was applied according to maximum likelihood method in remote sensing systems. Accuracy analysis of the classification was performed with Kappa statistics and it was determined as over 80%. The results obtained were also confirmed by the findings obtained from land studies. Accordingly, a decrease was identified in forests and semi-natural areas and agricultural areas and an increase was identified in artificial surfaces and open space with little or no vegetation.

AB  - The use of artificial satellites, especially from ESA Copernicus program, created new opportunities for sciences geared toward studying phenomena that have a major impact on our planet, especially anthropogenic phenomena. In this way, accurate measurements and predictions could be made regarding the degree of pollution of land and water, the evolution of deforestation and desertification. However, in order to obtain relevant data from satellite imagery, they must be passed through a procedure to remove visual obstacles, such as clouds, shadows, and sometimes snow. An important drawback of filtering algorithms is the extremely low performance that makes some processing last from a few hours to a few days. This paper attempts to eliminate the major disadvantage of extensive data processing time by proposing a much faster and scalable parallel processing solution. The paper starts from the context setting and the theoretical description of the filtering algorithm used and the main optimization technique, then goes on to detail the actual implementation and ends with the exposition of the results obtained from the extensive qualitative validation and the measurement of the performance indices and efficiency.

TI  - WHAT STRATEGIES MAKE COMPATIBLE THE STAKES OF NATURE CONSERVATION AND THE STAKES OF ECONOMIC GROWTH IN PROTECTED AREA? EXAMPLE OF EL KALA NATIONAL PARK, ALGERIA
T2  - GEOGRAPHIA POLONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Public policies to protect natural environments are becoming increasingly integrated in many countries. However, in some countries, nature management policies do not pay much attention to issues raised by local populations, especially development issues. These seem often incompatible with the logic of protection of nature defended by the national administrations. Recent studies show that there are ways to make these issues compatible. The knowledge on this subject is still weak for the southern shore of the Mediterranean region. Our study focuses on the case of a natural park located in the northeast of Algeria: the sector of the El Kala National Park (EKNP). This territory faces a double strategic ambition: to strengthen the protection of nature but also to develop the agricultural economy and tourism. Our method relies on the analysis of 3 types of data: national statistics of Algeria, conservation and development strategy documents and satellite data. Our study shows an increase in the area of EKNP vegetation between 1995 and 2005.

AB  - Deep learning techniques have been leveraged in numerous applications and across different data modalities over the past few decades, more recently in the domain of remotely sensed imagery. Given the complexity and depth of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) architectures, it is difficult to fully evaluate performance, optimize the hyperparameters, and provide robust solutions to a specific machine learning problem that can be easily extended to similar problems, e.g. via transfer learning. Ursa Space Systems Inc. (Ursa) develops novel machine learning approaches to build custom solutions and extract answers from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data fused with other remote sensing datasets. One application is identifying the orientation with respect to true north of the inlet pipe, which is one common feature located on the top of a cylindrical oil storage tank. In this paper, we propose a two-phase approach for determining this orientation: first an optimized CNN is used to probabilistically determine a coarse orientation of the inlet pipe, followed by a maximum likelihood voting scheme to automatically extract the location of the angular feature within 7.5 degrees. We present a systematic technique to determine the best deep learning CNN architecture for our specific problem and under user-defined optimization and accuracy constraints, by optimizing model hyperparameters (number of layers, size of the input image, and dataset preprocessing) using a manual and grid search approach. The use of this systematic approach for hyperparameter optimization yields increased accuracy for our angular feature extraction algorithm from 86% to 94% and can be extended to similar applications.

AB  - In this study, monitoring and investigating the mining activities located in the forestry area and quantifying the environmental effect of these activities were carried out by means of orthophotos and satellite imageries. The study area consists of 4 open pit mines surrounded by forestry area located in the Antalya province which is nearby the Mediterranean Sea known as one of the most popular holiday destinations in Turkey. Opposite to the expansion of the mine areas forestry area decreases in this region. To quantify the decrease in the forestry area multi-temporal satellite imageries were used for 4 open pit mines. Used data were Spot 5 and Spot 6 satellite images with spatial resolution of 5 m and 6 m respectively. Spatial change was determined by applying object-based classification method for all satellite images. Accuracy analyses were made by means of overall accuracy and kappa statistic values. The overall accuracy values of the classified imageries of 2011, 2014 and 2017 were respectively 94.81%, 94.0% and 97.1% with the kappa statistical values of 0.9212, 0.9070 and 0.9538. According to the results of these classifications, the area values covered by the mines in the study area were respectively 55.06, 77.02 and 103.10 hectares in 2011, 2014 and 2017. Additionally, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used in one of the mine areas in order to realistic evaluation of an area by using orthophotos. Two orthophotos with the pixel sizes of 4 cm and 7 cm were produced from multi-temporal aerial photographs. As a result of the study, it can be said that remotely sensed imageries are the main data to temporal follow-up of the mine areas. In this context, UAVs have been shown to be a better option for monitoring the environmental effects of mining areas when criteria such as acquisition of the data, accuracy, speed and time are evaluated. The difficulty of finding an optimal satellite image in terms of cost and different types of resolutions such as spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal make the use of UAVs more prominent.

AB  - Fires associated with land use conversion activities such as agricultural expansion, palm and pulp plantations, peat land alteration, and industrial deforestation are significant in Indonesia (Jerrod & Alex, 2015). Fires season in 2015 is one of the worst incident in Indonesia since 1997, it made Indonesia at the second position as an emitter country, at least 22 days in September 2015, and generated more than the daily average emission of U.S. economic activity. A study from the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas) and Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimated that the amount of land affected by fires reaches 9.75 million hectares. It caused losses reached US$.4.861 or equivalent to IDR711 trillion or even more based on disruption of economic activities, transportation problems, and health problems. Head of Data Information and Public Relations of National Disaster Managemen Agency (BNPB), Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, said the economic impact of smog disasters occurring in several provinces in Indonesia in 2015 could exceed 20 trillion per province. The most widespread forest fire area occurred in South Sumatra Province. BNPB released that during 2015 in South Sumatera Province has 35.008 hotspots and the burnt area is 641.964 Ha. The most affected area is in Ogan Komering Ilir Regency. Landsat 8 OLI TIRS has a 30-meter spatial resolution for each band except TIRS band and panchromatic band (USGS, 2016). TIRS band has a 100-meter spatial resolution but are resampled to 30-meter that can be used to identify burned scars area. By using SWIR bands (TM bands 5 and 7 in Landsat 5 and 7 systems) as a NBR (Normalized burn ratio) composite, can be used to detecting and mapping burnt area. TIRS algorithm which was used to detect fire will be seen red and SWIR which was used to detect water stress in vegetation and burned vegetation will be seen green, both of them will become darker when burn happened. This method modifying dNBR (pre-NBR - post-NBR) composite, which only can be used in oil palm plantations area that has same commodities, so can be used in various type of landuse especially the area that has plantation adjoin with forest area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The status of the cod stock in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps was assessed during a Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Regional Peer Review Process meeting held October 16-17, 2018. Total landings for the 2017-18 management year (April 1-March 31) were 5,031 t or 77% of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC). This marks the eighth consecutive season that the entire TAC has not been taken. Survey abundance and biomass estimates from the DFO research vessel (RV) spring survey were below average during 2016 to 2018. Sentinel gillnet catch rates have been very low and stable since 1999. Sentinel linetrawl catch rates have been below average for the past eight years and the 2017 catch rate was among the lowest in the time series. Spawning stock biomass (SSB) has increased since 2015. In 2018, 71% of the SSB is comprised of ages 6 and 7. Recruitment has generally been at or above the time-series average since 2005, with a particularly strong cohort produced in 2011. Estimated total mortality remains high. Over 2015-17, total mortality averaged 0.61 (54% survival per year); however, the relative contributions of natural and fishing mortality to total mortality are unknown.0 Projection of the stock to 2021 was conducted assuming mortality rates will be within +/- 20% of current values (2015 to 2017 average). All projections show SSB in 2021 to be lower than SSB in 2018. Where total mortality is assumed to remain at or above current levels, projections indicate that SSB in 2020 and 2021 to be at or below Blim.

M3  - Article
AB  - The status of the cod stock in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Subdivision 3Ps was assessed during a Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) Regional Peer Review Process meeting held October 17-18, 2017. Total landings for the 2016-17 management year (April 1-March 31) were 6,282 t or just 48% of the Total Allowable Catch (TAC). This marks the seventh consecutive season that the TAC has not been fully taken. Survey abundance and biomass estimates from the DFO research vessel (RV) spring survey were below average during 2016 and 2017. Sentinel gillnet catch rates have been very low and stable since 1999. Sentinel linetrawl catch rates have been below average for the past seven years and the 2016 catch rate was among the lowest in the time series. Estimates of Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) derived from a survey-based (SURBA) cohort model increased considerably over 2009-12 but have since declined. The stock is currently estimated to be in the Cautious Zone (54% above Blim) as defined by the DFO Precautionary Approach (PA) Framework. The probability that the stock is in the critical zone is 0.03. SSB decreased from 2012, but showed an increase in 2017. However, SSB is concentrated (75% of SSB) in ages 5 and 6, with few older (ages 7+) fish in the population. Estimated total mortality for fish in the age range of 5-10 years is currently very high (three year average Z = 0.70), which is a large concern especially considering that reported landings have been only about half of the TACs over this time period. Short-term projections of the stock were performed to 2020 assuming mortality rates will be within +/- 20% of current values (2014 to 2016 average). Projected SSB shows a continuous decline to 2020 in most cases, with the decrease ranging from 23 to 58% (2017-20). The risk of being below Blim by 2019 ranges from 0.09 and 0.73, and by 2020 from 0.25 to 0.94.

AB  - The article presents an overview describing researches of the 1950s - 70s in China concerning the Confucian patriotic ideology by Gu Yanwu (1613-1682).The value of Gu Yanwu's ideas is determined because of his plural references to the origins of Chinese Five Classics. It is especially important now thatthe President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping reveals a very deep interest in the study of them.The meaning of Confucian pragmatism could hardly been overestimated during the reign of the Kuomintang party. Its main ideologist Zhang Binglin (1869-1936) studied Gu Yanwu's texts for a long time, from childhood considered himself a successor of the Confucian patriotic tradition. As for representatives of the Chinese science of the 20th century, such as Liang Qichao and Hu Shi, Hou Wailu and Qiu Hansheng, patriotic ideology inspired them to develop their own approaches. It was clear that the new Chinese worldview, which also included Chinese Marxism, should be based on Chinese significant accomplishments. In the teachings of Gu Yanwu, they were impressed by the strategy of changing Chinese society. They continued to embody Gu Yanwu's experience, who had an open mind and interpreted Confucianism without cuts.Young Mao Zedong highly valued ideas of Gu Yanwu, especially his idea of uncompromising struggle. Both recognized struggle in a favor of China, which became the meaning of life.After the end of the war in Korea, the Communist ideology needed to adapt to the new conditions. The international isolation could actually destroy the countries of people's democracy.The search for an effective development strategy drew attention to the patriotic ideology, which supported teachings of Gu Yanwu in the 1950s and the first half of the 60s. The "cultural revolution" influenced the scientific community, but researches on Gu Yanwu's heritage continued. The Chinese economic reform and open-door policy, begun by Deng Xiaoping in 1978, finally replaced the policy of condemnation of Chinese civilization history. Proponents of the Confucian revision of Marxism realized that collaboration with the radicalforces is not possible. That is why Chinese President Xi Jinping has adopted some of the time-tested patriotic ideas, offered by GuYanwu.

AB  - The article is devoted to the conceptual core of civilization's comprehension. This core is formed by the concepts of ecology, humanism and safety. Special attention is paid to the issue of humanist attitude to the world that lead to establishing new paradigms and maintaining fragile balance of the anthropo-socio-techno-natural complex. The author of the article reasons the idea of that modern versions of humanism are related to the establishment of environmental thinking, improvement of environmental education and enhancement of environmental safety. The paper analyzes forces and determinants affecting environmental safety. Finally, it is concluded that, firstly, conceptual core of new civilization's consciousness is altered. Secondly, ecology acts as a new form of humanism. The point of humanism intensity had moved from human to the alive space. And thirdly, indefinite existence of civilization is given by the collision of the natural and the artificial in the human habitat. Environmental safety should define the priorities of environmental policy, develop precise principles, means and methods to ensure environmental safety and sustainable development through the analysis and study of all the determinants that allow to predict the future of environmental development and form a new environmental worldview.

TI  - Late Shoulder-Arm Morbidity Using Ultrasound Scalpel in Axillary Dissection for Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: We aimed to assess whether the use of the harmonic scalpel (HS) in axillary dissection would reduce long-term shoulder-arm morbidity compared to traditional instruments (TIs).Materials and methods: A retrospective analysis on 180 patients who underwent standard axillary dissection for breast cancer between 2007 and 2015 was carried out. All patients were evaluated for postoperative pain, impairment of shoulder-arm mobility, seroma formation in axilla, frozen shoulder, and lymphedema.Results: HS procedure on average was 50% shorter compared to the TI technique. HS reduced by 4.5 times the risk of axillary seroma. TIs were associated with 4 times higher risk of developing a painful frozen shoulder.Conclusions: Use of the HS was associated with reduced costs and a positive long-term effect on shoulder-arm morbidity. Axillary seromas are not the only reason of later postoperative shoulder-arm morbidity: other mechanisms are hypothesized in the onset of this very disabling disorder. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The thermocline is a sea layer with a change in temperature to depth quite quickly. We had to study this layer because it had an important contribution to thermohaline flows, upwelling, and fish migration. This paper aimed to map the vertical profiles of temperatures and thermocline gradients in the Andaman waters during the transitional season, October 2017. Analysis of the thermocline layer was based on vertical temperature data from the CMEMS model which were verified with SST from Aqua MODIS 4 km. The thermocline layer was indicated by Delta T / Delta z >= 0.1 degrees C and started from the depth of 40 m. CMEMS SST verification on October 2017 showed good results (MAPE = 0.0188, r = 0.68). The thermocline layer was found thicker off the west coast of Sumatra, the Indian Ocean (Station 1) than in the Andaman Sea. Generally, the thermocline layer was at a depth of 66 -131 meters on October 2017. The thermocline gradients were 0.12 - 0.23. These results indicated that in the transitional season, the thermocline location in the Andaman Sea was shallower or less than 200 m.

AB  - Wet snow is an early indicator of snow melting in an area. Increase in liquid water content in snow pack leads to snow wetness. Synthetic aperture radar bands are highly sensitive to snow wetness due to presence of water on snow surface. Space borne Sentinel-1 data provides the capability to produce snow maps during spring and summer season which can be used in hydrological and watershed studies. Nagler's wet snow algorithm was applied through GEE in Deosai region which has relatively uniform elevation than surrounding areas and it is covered completely by snow most of the year. Downloading and processing of SAR data is laborious and time taking process which brings the need of a modern solution. Google Earth Engine (GEE) is cloud based, planetary scale remote sensing platform which has a wide range of remote sensing data. GEE has ready-to-use Sentinel-1 GRD product with optical remote sensing data and meteorological data. Algorithm was tested on GEE for study area for the month of June against Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Snow Index. Wet snow was mapped with an accuracy of 0.8. Methodology was also applied to generate monthly wet snow maps to understand the snow melting period and snowmelt dynamics. Monthly maps of wet snow were generated and wet snow was detectable from March to July in Deosai region.

TI  - Mastitis and Periareolar Necrosis by 1% Methylene Blue after Axilar Lymphadenectomy and Regional Mastectomy in a Bitch
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIAE VETERINARIAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mammary neoplasms are frequent in dogs, and surgical excision by radical unilateral mastectomy is the first-choice treatment for most cases. Typically, inguinal lymphadenectomy is performed during mammary inguinal excision, whereas axillar lymphadenectomy is performed using dyes to guide surgical dissection and avoid iatrogenic trauma. This study reports the case of a bitch that underwent axillar lymphadenectomy and regional mastectomy. In this way, this work has the objective of reporting the case of a bitch referred to mastectomy and lymphadenectomy, which presented complications due to the use of 1% methylene blue.Case: A 15-year-old female intact poodle weighing 6.2 kg presented with mammary nodules. Cytological examination confirmed malignant neoplasm in the mammary gland classified as Grade II (World Health Organization). Radical unilateral mastectomy and regional lymphadenectomy were performed. The surgical procedure involved intradermic injection of 0.5 mL of sterile 1% methylene blue solution around the right cranial thoracic mammary gland divided in four sites before skin incision. Following right axillar lymphadenectomy, instead of radical unilateral mastectomy, regional mastectomy was performed in two ulcerated nodules at the right cranial abdominal gland to shorten the surgery time after the bitch demonstrated severe trans-operative hypotension. The bitch was monitored during anesthetic recovery and was discharged after stabilization. At fourteen days after surgery, the patient was re-examined. Increased volume and pain in the mammary glands of both chains were observed. In addition, a whitish liquid secretion was noted primarily from the thoracic caudal left and thoracic cranial right mammary glands. The last mammary gland also presented a periareolar black area where the dye was applied. Progressive remission of the clinical signs was observed after therapy with amoxicillin and clavulanate (20 mg/kg/BID/15 days) and meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg/SID/3 days). At 60 days after surgery, the patient presented minor signs of mastitis at the left caudal thoracic mammary gland.Discussion: In humans, methylene blue is avoided because of rapid diffusion after injection, which could be associated with mastitis due to fat necrosis. The risk of this complication is reduced when tissue ipsilateral to the dyed lymph node is completely excised. In this case, the ipsilateral lymph node chain was not completed excised because of anesthetic complication, and periareolar necrosis was observed at the methylene blue injection site. This complication may be the result of methylene blue oxidation, which can produce formaldehyde and deamidated oxidation products. Methylene blue leads to vasoconstriction of arterioles and tissue ischemia when used in concentrated solutions. Furthermore, a 1% solution has a pH of 3-4.5, which increases its cytotoxic effect. Studies suggest that mammary neoplasms may promote local lymphatic alteration, as observed in this case, including inflammatory response at the contralateral chain that receives dye injection. This suggests that the dye is drained by lymphatic vessels and causes mastitis in the remaining mammary glands. Therefore, methylene blue can cause mastitis and tissue necrosis at the injection site, as well as in the contralateral chain in cases where radical unilateral mastectomy is not performed. This complication increases the morbidity associated with the procedure. However, in the present case, the treatment was sufficiently adequate to restore the patient's condition.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This experiment was conducted to reveal the effects of PGPR and IBA on rooting characteristics of Ramsey "Salt Creek" (Vitis champini) under the nursery. Hard wood cuttings of Ramsey were subjected to PGPR (EMA1, EMA6, EMA24, EMA MEDIA, EMA CALLUS, EMA QUICK DIP) with dipping times of 1h, 6h, 24 h. IBA concentration was 25, 2000, 4000 ppm with dipping time of 24 h in the case of long-soak method, and of 4 seconds in quick dip method. Data were recorded on specific rooting and shooting characteristic. Results obtained from treatments showed significant differences at p <= 0.01 for specific rooting characteristic, like rooting rate (%), rooting degree (0-4), root length (cm), root fresh and dry weight (g) under the interaction between PGPR and IBA concentration and dipping time. The rooting rate of EMA1 was 56.7%, and was better than in IBA treatments. Rooting degree (0-4) was 3.5 with EMA1 and 3.3 with EMA MEDIA. The highest root lenght (cm) were obtained in IBA25 (37.6) EMA MEDIA (37.2) and EMA1 (34.1). The best result on fresh root weight (g) was determined with EMA1 (9.8) and EMA6 (9.5). As a conclusion, inspected rooting characteristics generally increased with the EMA1 and EMA6 treatments.

AB  - In this study, we used persisitent scatterer interferometry to monitor surface displacements related to groundwater level changes around the Kumamoto plain. Groundwater has been used for daily purposes in the area, and the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake with a maximum magnitude of Mw 7.0 occurred at the area. The use of ALOS/PALSAR data showed seasonal displacements that correspond to seasonal groundwater flow from January 2007 to January 2011. On the other hand, the analysis of ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data revealed local surface displacements after the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, which were validated by Sentinel-1A and GNSS data. Especially, we found that the local ground uplifts that correspond to groundwater level increase after the earthquake. From changes in skeletal storage coefficient, we interpreted that aquifer properties such as porosity and aquifer matrix compressibility altered by the earthquake. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of aquifer monitoring using persistent scatterer interferometry.

AB  - To maintain sustainability of life on earth, water is an indispensable nutrient and truly a vital resource for aquatic ecosystem. It also plays an important role in the socio-economic development and is one of the key factors for driving the economy of any region. Rapid increase in population and change in climatic patterns has vigorously affected the water resources. The remote sensing is an efficient tool for monitoring of natural resources. This research is focused on spatio-temporal change analysis of Manchar Lake and Keenjhar Lake, Sindh, Pakistan using Landsat multi-sensor data MSS, TM, ETM+ & OLI to analyze land cover from 1972 to 2017 and calculating water indices using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and supervised parallelepiped classification achieving an overall accuracy 98.86% and 0.1 of standard deviation value. The results revealed that the significant changes in land cover due to unusual climatic patterns, significant fall in precipitation rate and multiple anthropogenic activities. These changes had adverse impact on ecosystem of lakes and as well as on public health.

AB  - Spectral reflectance provides a key recognition of an object on remote sensing data. Every surface object has specific spectral reflectance pattern that acts as a spectral fingerprint for object discrimination. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of radiometric correction applied to the WorldView-2 image by comparing the image correction result with the field spectrometer measurement. Some objects were chosen as the basis for spectral reflectance observation, namely grass, non-mangrove vegetation, mangrove vegetation, soil, and asphalt. The WorldView-2 image was radiometrically and spectrally corrected up to the level of at-surface reflectance. As a reference, the spectral reflectance of the selected objects was collected in the field using a portable JAZ EL-350 (340-1028 nm) spectrometer. For a direct comparison and evaluation, the object spectral reflectance measured by field spectrometer was resampled based on the center wavelength of WorldView-2 image bands (i.e. from thousands to eight bands). This study found that the spectral reflectance patterns of all targeted objects were similar. However, the most accurately represented object by the spectral reflectance of the WorldView-2 image was asphalt. Asphalt has high color homogeneity and relatively stable for a long time. This study confirms that the standard radiometric and spectral correction approach is effective in representing the spectral reflectance of objects on the Earth's surface.

AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an effective means of monitoring land subsidence, and differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) is commonly used to acquire the necessary data. In particular, persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) can be used to measure land subsidence accurately over a wide area from multi-temporal SAR images. However, the estimated displacement is obtained only in the radar line-of-sight (LOS) direction, making it necessary to develop a method for measuring three-dimensional displacements by combining multidirectional observations. Therefore, we propose herein a method for estimating three-dimensional displacement velocities by combining the results from PSI and geodetic deformation measurements, namely, Global Positioning System and leveling data. We apply the least-squares method to Kansai International Airport in Japan by using 13 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 ascending images from 2014 to 2018 and 17 ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 descending images from 2015 to 2018. In validation, the root-mean-square errors are 14, 16, and 14 mm/year for the east west, north south, and vertical components, respectively, showing that combining PSI results and geodetic deformation measurements is effective for monitoring land subsidence.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The tectonic setting of the study area, the Osaka sedimentary basin, is described from the viewpoint of changes in the plate motion around the northwestern Pacific that have occurred over the last one hundred million years and a sequence of epoch-making migration and deformation events along the southwestern Japan arc that has been investigated based on paleomagnetism and seismic interpretation. The ongoing active but subtle deformation of the island arc is also evaluated using high-resolution remote sensing data. The considerable diversity in geomorphological features and the uneven development of active faults point to the existence of a buffer zone of strong crustal strain in southwest Japan (i.e., the Kinki Triangle), where the Osaka basin is located. The dimensions of the sedimentary basin were assessed based on the gradient tensor analysis of gravity anomaly data, which revealed a deep-rooted basin morphology controlled by the architecture of major faults. To unravel the paradox of the Osaka basin having developed at a confining bend or the step of an arc-bisecting transcurrent fault, numerical modeling was used to replicate the pattern of uplift and subsidence. Such a simulation is useful for the detection of tectonically significant faults in the basin-forming process.

AB  - To solve the problem of adaptive correction for dispersion distortions of the characteristics of a wideband transionospheric channel, we developed a method of diagnosing frequency dispersion parameters using satellite data on the total electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere developed. It also considers TEC measurement stochastic error. For this reason, we performed an analysis of the limitation of the communication signal bandwidth for the case of dispersion correction with an error. It was found that the TEC measurement error that typically exists in practice allows us to spread signal bandwidth by up to three times.

TI  - Internal Waves on the Black Sea Shelf near the Heracles Peninsula: Modeling and Observation
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The purpose consists in a combined analysis of satellite observations of surface manifestations of internal waves near the Crimean coast and the results of numerical simulation of influence of seasonal thermohaline conditions and the relief on their structure, dynamics and intensification.Methods and Results. Based on the analysis of remote sensing data using high-resolution sensors of the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites and the theoretical estimates, the main spatial and temporal characteristics of the internal waves on the Black Sea shelf near the Heracles Peninsula were determined. According to the temperature and salinity data obtained from the satellite measurements and the research vessels measurements in 1951-2008 from the Oceanographic Data Bank of Marine Hydrophysical Institute, the structure of density stratification was investigated, and buoyancy frequency profiles in the shelf and slope area from Yevpatoria to Yalta were obtained. Vertical velocity profiles of internal waves of the first three modes on the shelf were constructed. It was revealed that phase velocity of the internal waves of the first mode in the deep-sea part varied within the range of 2.6-5 m/s, the waves of the second mode - within 1.1-2.3 m/s, and the waves of the third mode - within 0.7-1.4 m/s. The average length of the waves detected from the satellite data was 0.4 km; the longest waves, about 1.1 km, were observed most often between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol, propagating predominantly to the northeast. Within the same train, wave dispersion occurred resulting in the wavelength diminution to 0.1-0.3 km.Conclusions. The stated assumption on the cause of generation of intense internal waves conditioned by the interaction of the Rim Current jet with the shelf edge was confirmed by the results of numerical calculations. Spatial and temporal characteristics of the internal waves, the integrated data of remote sensing and the modeling results make it possible to estimate vertical exchange at the shelf and to determine the depth of the maximum Brunt-Vaisala frequency.

AB  - The paper considers the internal waves on the shelf of the Crimean coast, their structure and dynamics at the periphery of the Black Sea basin. Manifestations of internal waves were studied by numerical experiments and by processing of remote sensing data from high-resolution data. Maps of the vertical velocity of the first three modes of internal waves on the shelf of the Crimean coast were constructed. The phase velocity of the internal waves in the deep part of the sea for the first mode at the given profiles varies from 2.6 to 5 ms(-1); for the waves of the second mode-1.1-2.3 ms(-1); for the waves of the third mode-0.7-1.4 ms(-1). Wavelengths detected from the satellite data had a mean value of 0.4 km. The longest waves, around 0.8 km, were observed between Sevastopol and Yevpatoria. During June, 2017 the waves of 2nd and 3rd modes were observed in the area of study the most frequently.

AB  - The Malouralsk volcano-plutonic belt (VPB) of the Polar Urals hosts the Toupugol-Khanmeyshorsky ore district and the Manukuyu-Varchatinsky ore cluster. The recent discoveries of the Novogodnee-Monto Au-Magnetite-skarn and the Petropavlovsk Au-porphyry deposits indicate that the belt is prospective for porphyry-style mineral systems. The comparative morphostructural and paleo-facial (paleovolcanic) analysis of Landsat 8 multispectral images demonstrates the relationship of annular and radial structures to gold mineralization. The identification of these structures in underexplored parts of the belt can be used as an aid to mineral exploration in this remote region.

T2  - INDO-EUROPEAN LEGACY IN LANGUAGE AND CULTURE: Selected Issues
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In the V-IV millennium BC the tradition of erecting burial mounds (kurgans) began to spread in various parts of Europe. A wide distribution of this tradition is associated with the tribes of the Yamnaya culture complex (YCC) in the early Bronze Age. An analysis of the main components of the YCC shows that the carriers of the YCC were primarily united by the commonality of the worldview and religious-mythological ideas. Reflected in a unified funeral rite, the "new ideology" became the basis for the formation of a new cultural and historical community, characterized by the bringing together a diverse population based on the reception of an innovative worldview. There are obvious differences between the territorial groups of YCC, which are manifested in ceramics and other artifacts. The data from anthropology and genetics also show the heterogeneity of the carriers of the YCC, at the same time indicating certain similar features that most likely reflect the common origin of the representatives of the YCC from the Meso-Eneolithic Ponto-Caspian populations with the genetic admixture of the farming populations of Anatolia and Iran, as well as hunters and gatherers of northern Caucasus.

AB  - For quick and efficient response, as well as for recovery after any natural or artificial catastrophe, one of the most important things are accurate and reliable spatial data in real or near real-time. It is essential to know the location as well as to track and analyse passive and active threats to quickly identify the possible dangers and hazards. As technology evolves and advances, there is a broader spectrum of sensors that provide spatial data, and nowadays, decision-making processes also include nontraditional, informal sources of information. Apart from the offer, demand for new spatial data is increasing as well. For quicker and enhanced integration and analysis of data, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are increasingly used which, in addition to immediate rapid reactions, can help to make better and smarter decisions in the future. Such software algorithms that imitate human intelligence can help in generating conclusions from natural phenomena presented by spatial data. Using AI in the data analysis can identify risk areas and determine future needs. This paper presents an overview of the use of AI in geospatial analysis in disaster management.

AB  - The Joint Commission in the United States disseminated a Sentinel Event Alert because of the number of adverse outcomes from problems with health information technology (HIT). The HITs were trading off safety and quality against throughput or efficiency. The Alert urged healthcare providers to improve process measurement and provide leadership in mitigating the risks. In order to understand what problems compromise safety and efficiency, this study has accessed, deconstructed, categorized and analyzed Australian patient safety incident reports of the things that go wrong in medical imaging, and their impact on both patients and the medical imaging acquisition and processing systems. Data Sources comprised two sets of voluntary incident reports and convenience samples of interviews with radiology staff. A special targeted search was undertaken for identifying HIT related incidents so that they could be deconstructed with the health information technology classification system. This resulted in 436 HIT related incidents. Within these incidents, 623 HIT related issues were found. These included use or human factor related issues (40%), software and hardware related issues (30%) and machine related issues (30%). Although many technical problems and deficiencies were detected in the reports identified, we did not anticipate that more than half of the incidents would have involved failures of human performance. Identifying and characterizing the things that are going wrong, related to HIT through the lens of medical imaging incident reports can provide a basis for preventing issues and improving clinical practice.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article traces the Council of Europe's work on teaching about religions and non-religious worldviews, regarded as an important contributor to intercultural education. It explains why studies of religions came late in the Council of Europe's educational work and traces the development of a project which led to a Recommendation from its Committee of Ministers on teaching about religions and non-religious worldviews. It summarises follow-up work by the Council of Europe and the European Wergeland Centre, which led to the publication of Signposts. It outlines new research on themes identified in Signposts and discusses the relationship between intercultural education and studies of religions, in the context of the Council of Europe and responds to criticisms of its work. An account of the development of a new teacher training module, based on Signposts, is given. The module can be adapted for use in Council of Europe member states and in different settings, including university and school-based teacher training. An account is given of the work of the module's writing group, its structure and chapters, the piloting undertaken and how it could develop. Finally, this article introduces the concept of dialogical liberalism', aiming to promote dialogue and discussion, rather than imposing equality.

M3  - Software
AB  - This major release of MPAS introduces significant new features in the MPAS-Atmosphere model as well as minor fixes and clean-up to the software infrastructure. Atmosphere Significant new features or changes to MPAS-Atmosphere v7.0 include: The capability to perform limited-area simulations on the surface of the sphere. An update to the physics schemes in the 'mesoscale_reference' suite to match the scheme versions in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v4.0.3; the WSM6 scheme matches WRF v4.1. The addition of two new upper absorbing layer formulations. An initial relative humidity field that is computed w.r.t. ice for temperatures below freezing, consistent with the computation used for the model output files. A fix for the communication of effective radii between the WSM6 and RRTMG schemes when config_microp_re=true. The ability to specify an explicit list of model level heights when constructing the vertical coordinate surfaces in the init_atmosphere core. A change to the default sources of data for terrain height and land use category to GMTED2010 and MODIS 20-class, respectively. Added MODIS-based sources for monthly albedo, monthly vegetation fraction, and maximum snow albedo; these MODIS datasets are now the default. IMPORTANT NOTE: The updated physics schemes require new look-up tables, in particular, for the Noah land-surface model. The checkout_data_files.sh script that is run at build time should correctly update these tables, but tables in other run directories will need to be manually updated. Infrastructure Changes to the shared MPAS infrastructure include: A new build target, llvm, to enable building MPAS with the clang and flang compilers. Updates to the xlf build target to support building on Linux/POWER systems with the XL compilers. Various minor fixes and clean-up. Copyright: Open Access

AB  - The Insect Woman, directed by Shohei Imamura, is a work that depicts the half life of a woman like a worm. The film evolves in juxtaposition with the flow of Japan's modern and modern turbulence and the hero's life. However, as a personal history, the life of the troupe and the history of the country are not in contact and maintain parallelism. And the chronicles of the state and the individual have their own meanings, but portray reality of the innocent Japanese behind history. And Imamura explores the real human figure in their lives and focuses on their sticky vitality and realistically portrays it. However, ‘The Insect Woman' focuses on the dynamism of life in the main domain and does not evaluate good or evil. The director is trying to reproduce through the video that life like the bottom of the Japanese society has led to Japanese society. And suggests that the life force originated from the indigenous nature of traditional society.The reason why Imamura paid attention to the indigenous life of the marginalized life rather than the mainstream is the longing for the vitality of traditional society and the sense of inferiority as a city dweller. There is a sense of criticism about the relationship between human life and the modern and contemporary process of Japanese civilization. Especially, the experience of the war that left deep scars on him, the confusion after the defeat, and the post    war revival became a concrete and solid consciousness, not an ideological hardness of indigenousity. And ‘The Insect Woman' expects the future to be indigenous to traditional society. His artistic worldview is a decision of consciousness, and his visual expression is ‘The Insect Woman'.

AB  - This article aims to examine the life thought of Jang Il-soon. His perception for life initially limited to the Korean Nation and advocated peaceful unification for the symbiosis(相生) of the Korean Nation. However, he is imprisoned for claiming peaceful unification after 5.16 Military Coup. After he was released from prison, Cooperative Life movement was developed the goal of coexistence(共生). It was a time when we were seeking coexistence in the affairs of human beings. In 1977 his thought is changed. He looks at the death of the farmers and the land collapsed with agriculture poisoning, crosses human and human affairs, comes to think of human-nature affairs, and new thoughts with the universe. It is the so-called holistic worldview(全生). In the background of the converted thinking, there was a fundamental problem recognition of Western style modernization. That is, it is not anthropocentrism but ecocentrism. It built a spiritual worldview based on the indigenous thought of the Donghak (東學). After all, Jang Il-soon’s thought begins with Peaceful Unification, reaching the spiritualization of everyday. Jang Il-soon regarded the life of the universe as one grass and adjusted the revolution in everyday with the holistic worldview as a base.

The Regional Copernicus aims at providing local and regional authorities a framework and a support to become active agents of earth observation-based innovation. It relies on geomatics community, already well-structured in Brittany through the GeoBretagne partnership. An expected result of this approach is to produce and make available new Copernicus-based products and services, co-designed by all the actors of the added-value chain and consistent with INSPIRE requirements. For now, the ongoing approach brought together actors of the public sectors and the private sector to build a first local demonstrator on land cover. In the future other demonstrators should be implemented and this experimental approach should be widespread at Regional level.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of coordinates determination for some satellite laser ranging (SLR) stations in the new ITRF2014 system based on LAGEOS-1 and LAGEOS-2 satellite data. The analysis was conducted in two variants. In the first one, coordinates of the SLR stations were estimated with the use of the nominal values of the tidal parameters: h(2) = 0.6078 and l(2) = 0.0847 (i.e. the standard International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service recommended values). In the second, coordinates of the SLR stations were calculated with the use of values of the tidal parameters estimated in the author's previous paper: h(2) = 0.6140 and l(2) = 0.0876 (determined from the LAGEOS-1 and LAGEOS-2 data). The influence of the tidal parameters changes on the computation of the stations' coordinates was investigated. The maximum differences (X, Y, Z(Variant 1) X, Y, Z(Variant 2)) of about 4 mm, were achieved for Z component for Yarragadee (station ID 7090) and Monument Peak (7110) and of about 3 mm for Y component for Yarragadee (7090) and Changchun (7237) stations. All calculations related to determining the satellite orbits and the SLR stations' coordinates were carried out with the use of the GEODYN II NASA/GSFC software.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION ASSURANCE AND SECURITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a highly approved, widely deployed and one of the most important security mechanism, firewalls have an essential role in setting up powerful, trustworthy and reliable security policies to ensure the protection of private and sensitive applications, services, systems and infrastructures. This importance given to firewalls as a key security mechanism for protecting sensitive resources has been well justified in literature and nowadays several open source and commercial firewall solutions exist. The primary feature of this fundamental security component is to enforce access control policies. It provides a rules based filtering service that acts as a sentinel for a gateway via blocking, dropping or authorizing access to specific areas and segments of a network with regards to a set of filtering rules. Hence, it is commonly agreed that the efficiency of a firewall protection depends mainly on the correctness, reliability, efficiency and coherence of its configuration.We address in the current paper, the thematic of improving and enhancing the quality of firewalls filtering service. We introduce our concept of a novel firewall filtering technique based on a rules and policies trust-risk assessment approach. By evaluating and analyzing the risk associated to firewall rules, we aim, via our proposal, to strengthen the quality of the firewall filtering service. These pertinent information relative to rules trust and risk values help primary in tuning and adjusting the access control policy via: (i) deactivating or changing the actions associated to critical rules (evaluated as risky rules) in specific/critical contexts; (ii) injecting (in a dynamic manner) new rules in the policy that refine existing rules (via giving more precision about or reducing domains) in order to reduce the corresponding risk; (iii) modifying the firewall behavior via changing its configuration (the base of rules) in order to avoid or prevent malicious scenarios.

AB  - Rice crops is a crucial commodity for Indonesian because most Indonesian people consume rice as a staple food. With the rate of population growth that continues to increase, the demand for rice also increases. Rice crops Monitoring needed in ensuring national food availability. This paper presents a new method for predicting the growth phase of rice crops with a rice field area approach and identifying patterns of vegetation index from Sentinel 2A satellite image data series from May to September 2017. The study was conducted in Sukamekar Village, Karawang District, West Java, Indonesia from June to August 2017. Polynomial regression models used to identify the relationship between rice crops growth phase and NDVI. In determining the vegetation index in the rice field two methods are obtained, first calculating the average value of the vegetation index on the pixels in each rice fields area. Second, by removing the pixels that contact with the border of each rice field area, then calculate the average value of the vegetation index on the pixel of the rice field area. From both of methods, an algorithm was developed to get the rule base to determine the phase of rice growth based on the value of the vegetation index in each field area. The model developed was implemented in the same location in January 2019 using Sentinel-2A Image. Based on field validation in February 2019, the accuracy of the first method was 70% while the second method was 75%.

TI  - An evaluation and implementation of the regional coupled ice-ocean model of the Baltic Sea
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional, regional coupled ice-ocean model based on the open-source Community Earth System Model has been developed and implemented for the Baltic Sea. The model consists of 66 vertical levels and has a horizontal resolution of approx. 2.3 km. The paper focuses on sea ice component results, but the main changes have been introduced in the ocean part of the coupled model. The hydrodynamic part, being one of the most important components, has been also presented and validated. The ice model results were validated against the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and satellite data, and the method of validation based on probability was introduced. In the last two decades, satellite and model results show an increase in the ice extent over the whole Baltic Sea, which is an evidence of a negative trend in air temperature in recent decades and increasing of winter discharge from the catchment area.

AB  - A 43-year-old woman with a positive family history of breast cancer presented with a painless lump in her left axilla for 2years. Clinical diagnosis was a left axillary sebaceous cyst as the lump was inseparable from the skin. The lesion was excised under local anaesthesia and reported as breast tissue widely infiltrated by an invasive ductal carcinoma (grade 2). The malignancy was not involving the epidermis but <1mm away from deeper margins. Re-excision of the deeper tissue with an axillary sentinel lymph nodes biopsy was performed and deep margins were reported to be tumour-free with no nodal involvement.

AB  - Due to concerns of recent earth climate changes such as an increase of earth surface temperature and monitoring its effect on earth surface, environmental monitoring is a necessity. Environmental change monitoring in earth sciences needs land use land cover change (LULCC) modelling as a key factor to investigate impact of climate change phenomena such as droughts and floods on earth surface land cover. There are several free and commercial multi/hyper spectral data sources of Earth Observation (EO) satellites including Landsat, Sentinel and Spot. In this paper, for land use land cover modelling (LULCM), image classification of Landsat 8 using several mathematical and machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and a combination of SVM, ML and RF as a fit-for-purpose algorithm are implemented in R programming language and compared in terms of overall accuracy for image classification.

AB  - This study aims to assess the correlation between the satellite radar altimetry derived water level heights and in-situ gauges on the Indus River. The in-situ gauge data at Guddu Barrage was acquired from the Sindh Irrigation Department and its outliers were removed using the interquartile method. Altimetry derived water levels near the Guddu Barrage in Sindh, Pakistan were taken from various databases such as Database for Hydrological Time Series of Inland Waters (DAHITI), Hydroweb from 17 July 2008 to 20 Nov 2018, and SARvatore (SAR Versatile Altimetric Toolkit for Ocean Research & Exploitation) for Sentinel-3. The altimetry datasets were plotted against the in-situ gauge data and analysed visually as well as statistically. The regression analyses run yielded an R-2 value of around 0.6 for DAHITI and Hydroweb whereas for SARvatore it was 0.1. RMSE values produced were 0.5m, 0.6m and 0.9m respectively for Hydroweb, DAHITI and SARvatore.

AB  - This article discusses how Korean Protestant fundamentalism has been formulated and developed within the historical context of Korean society. First of all, fundamentalism is distinguished from evangelicalism. Then it is characterized in terms of two aspects; internal and external. Then, some social, historical, and cultural factors are discussed. These are the process of modernization biased to capitalistic economic development, the Korean War, multi-religious culture, and the influx of American Protestant fundamentalism. These factors had effects on the formation and development of Korean Protestant fundamentalism. Korean Protestant fundamentalism justified modernization while failing to promote modern values such as rationality. It has fortified a strong anti-communism fever that has developed into a red complex due to the tragic experience of the Korean War and the residual fearfulness of another war. Also, it has procured privileges in religious competition with other forms of Christianity by gaining influence with political powers such as Presidents. Furthermore, Korean Protestant fundamentalists keep founding Christian parties and demand to be members of the National Assembly. These political attempts result in social conflicts rather than social integration. This is because they have chosen struggle and contestation as the base of their dualistic and eschatological worldview.

AB  - Historically the concept of sustainability has existed in a variety of forms in civilization. However, it is urgently required to formulate a conceptual framework for a sustainable future by clearly organizing the current concept of sustainability as a national development standard in consideration of the ecological and social crisis all over the world today. The cause of the conceptual ambiguity of sustainability can be defined as the lack of common values that mediate the worldview and action standard of sustainability, and therefore, it would be a meaningful approach to supplement the concept of sustainability for both the present generation and future generation by extracting the conceptual meaning of sustainable values that has appeared historically through civilization. Mankind had lived in a small group, constantly moving, for the most part of the millions of years. Nomadism is an example of lifestyle where human beings had been able to obtain the necessary resources for food and shelter in a sustainable way from the environment and it has an important implication for sustainability in terms of a relationship between nature and human society. In this study, the main concepts of nomadic values that were examined by comparing the characteristics of nomadism and settlement are 'possession and richness', 'nature and civilization' and 'equality'. This paper attempts to present the critical implications of the Nomadic values on the sustainability of modern society at the economic, environmental and social levels.

AB  - This study is to estimate the spatial soil moisture using Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data and machinelearning technique. Using the 3 years (2015∼2017) data of MODIS 16 days composite NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and daily LandSurface Temperature (LST), ground measured precipitation and sunshine hour of KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration), the RDA (RuralDevelopment Administration) 10 cm∼30 cm average TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) measured soil moisture at 78 locations was tested. For dailyanalysis, the missing values of MODIS LST by clouds were interpolated by conditional merging method using KMA surface temperature observationdata, and the 16 days NDVI was linearly interpolated to 1 day interval. By applying the RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network-Long Short TermMemory) artificial neural network model, 70% of the total period was trained and the rest 30% period was verified. The results showed that thecoefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency were 0.78, 2.76%, and 0.75 respectively. In average,the clay soil moisture was estimated well comparing with the other soil types of silt, loam, and sand. This is because the clay has the intrinsic physicalproperty for having narrow range of soil moisture variation between field capacity and wilting point.

AB  - DSM (Digital Surface Model) is a digital representation of ground surface topography or terrain that is widely used for hydrology, slope analysis, and urban planning. Aerial photogrammetry and LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) are main technology for urban DSM generation but high-resolution satellite imagery is the only ingredient for remote inaccessible areas. Traditional automated DSM generation method is based on correlation-based methods but recent study shows that a modern pixelwise image matching method, SGM (Semi-Global Matching) can be an alternative. Therefore this study investigated the application of SGM for Kompsat satellite data of KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute). Firstly, the sensor modeling was carried out for precise ground-to-image computation, followed by the epipolar image resampling for efficient stereo processing. Secondly, SGM was applied using different parameterizations. The generated DSM was evaluated with a reference DSM generated by the first pulse returns of the LIDAR reference dataset.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Unlike aerial images covering small region, satellite data show high potential to detect urban scale geospatial changes. The change detection using satellite images can be carried out using single image or stereo images. The single image approach is based on radiometric differences between two images of different times. It has limitations to detect building level changes when the significant occlusion and relief displacement appear in the images. In contrast, stereo satellite data can be used to generate DSM (Digital Surface Model) that contain information of relief-corrected objects. Therefore, they have high potential for the object change detection. Therefore, we carried out a study for the change detection over an urban area using stereo satellite data of two different times. First, the RPC correction was performed for two DSMs generation via stereo image matching. Then, D-DSM (Differential DSM) was generated by differentiating two DSMs. The D-DSM was used for the topographic change detection and the performance was checked by applying different height thresholds to D-DSM.

AB  - In comparison with autobiographical works produced by other writers, Lee Yangji’s Kazukime has a notably strong flavor of fiction in the overall structure of the novel. This flavor of fiction lend the work a unique worldview, distanced from Lee herself. This feature contrasts with her other literary works, which are ultimately reduced to her character.In Kazukime, “she” lives alone with her Korean-Japanese mother. After the death of her mother, the concept of Chosun is only internal to her and no longer serves as a point of connection with the outer world. The notion of Chosun represented inside her is expressed through her body in the novel. It is a distinctive feature of Kazukime that this notion of body is manifested in the body of a woman isolated from mainstream society.In the present work, I attempt to provide a new perspective from which the literary works of Lee Yangji can be studied without merely examining them in terms of the writer. To this end, I shall analyze the expressions of body used in Kazukime in light of the history-engraved woman’s body.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the nutritional status of Lake Jinyang using Landsat 8 satellite image band correlated with chlorophyll-a, which is also related to algae proliferation. We selected 20 Landsat 8 images dating from 2013 to 2017, taken close to water quality measurement date when the cloud cover was less than 20 %. Based on the results of the previous studies, analyzing the correlation between chlorophyll-a, and Landsat 8 satellite image band, we selected near infrared wavelength, band 5 which is closely related to the population of algae. The nutritional status was classified using the Aizaki trophic state index (TSIm). The results of the regression equation between band 5 and the observed chlorophyll-a data was used to calculate chlorophyll-a for the image data from 2013 to 2017. The concentration of chlorophyll-a ranged from 3 to 16.1 mg/m3. To illustrate the spatial distribution of chlorophyll-a within the lake, the chlorophyll-a concentration was divided into five grades. The images on October 14, 2014 and April 10, 2016 showed relatively high value of chlorophyll-a, while January 18, 2015 and December 6, 2016 chlorophyll-a value were below 5. The images on October 14, 2014 and April 10, 2016 were rated as eutrophic status in most areas. The results of simulating water quality for the day when the water quality was not measured resulted to an approximate value for the Panmun station while the Naedong station needed some corrections

AB  - Sentinel-5 is an Earth atmospheric monitoring mission developed within the Copernicus program. The mission objective is to monitor the composition of the Earth's atmosphere on a daily basis. TNO is developing the UV1 spectrometer subsystem as well as the two telescope subsystems. In this paper, the design of the UV1 spectrometer is described and its major design and verification challenges are discussed.The UV1 optical design is based on a classical Offner-type spectrometer which has been adapted to employ freeform optics and an aspheric off-axis grating. It generates a magnification of 0.4. A structural, monolithic housing has been designed that is optimized for stability, accessibility and integration of optical components. To realize a thermo-mechanically stable construction, both housing and mirror bodies are built from aluminium. Four out of five mirrors have a dedicated black coating for absorbing out-of-band light. For further stray light suppression, a graded short-pass filter is employed on the last optical element just in front of the detector.Performance verification of a standalone spectrometer without telescope, entrance slit, limiting aperture stop and flight detector is a major challenge. For this verification TNO developed dedicated ground support equipment that will be used under both ambient and vacuum conditions; a dedicated optical stimulus that mimics the illumination from the telescope in terms of pointing and NA, a Slit Assembly that mimics the homogenizer entrance slit and a Test Detector to determine the image plane and to measure the optical performance with high accuracy.At the time of writing this article, the first (proto-flight) model has been aligned and performance verification is about to start.

AB  - The delineation of water bodies plays a vital role in the study of surface rivers. The objective of this paper is to propose a new method for accurately extracting water bodies from Landsat 8 OLI. The proposed method is implemented by generating two water indices which are the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) and the Automated Water Extraction Index (AWEI) from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). The two water index was employed because of its proven capacity to address challenges in discriminating water bodies with high levels of turbidity and those with high correlation with dark pixels (e.g., from shadows). We then classified the combined input images using the Minimum Distance classification method. The method was tested in three test sites and was compared to other water extraction methods using various water index combination. The experimental results showed that the average overall accuracy of the proposed method is 97%, higher than other methods using a two-band water index combination or a single water index.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF DEGRADATION PROCESSES IN RESERVOIRS BASED ON REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-FORMATIO CIRCUMIECTUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of the studyThe primary objective was to assess spatio-temporal changes of the vegetation occurring in 12 reservoirs located in the Odra River basin. The analysis was made for reservoirs of different constructions, i.e. single stage, two-stage and lateral. The second purpose was to analyze possibility using remote sensing data to monitor the dynamics of the vegetation processes.Material and methodsMonitoring and mapping of spatio-temporal changes of the vegetation occurring in the reservoirs was analyzed on the basis on Sentinel-2 data. The analysis was based on the NDVI and the WAVI indices. To specify spatial changes of vegetation, the reservoirs were split into zones equals to 250 m. The statistical analysis was aimed at comparing the NDVI and the WAVI values between designated zones. In turn, Cluster analysis (CA) was used to group reservoirs into clusters on the basis of similarities between the NDVI and the WAVI values.Results and conclusionsCluster analysis (CA) showed that each reservoir is separate water body where decisive impact on degradation process could have different factor. There was observed that two-stage construction focuses degradation processes in pre-reservoir and protect water resources in the main part. Additionally, relatively new solution - lateral reservoirs seems to be alternative preventing degradation processes. Taking into account possibility of using satellite imagery, there was observed that resolutions of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery allow to monitor vegetation processes in terms of time and space. The major limitation of using remote sensing data is high cloud density, which significantly reduces the number of observations during most of the year.

TI  - Assessing Spectral Indices for Detecting Vegetative Overgrowth of Reservoirs
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main problem related to exploitation of reservoirs is the overgrowth of aquatic vegetation, which leads to the gradual disappearance of water bodies. Currently, satellite imagery data are an advantageous source for monitoring aquatic vegetation. The main goal of this study was to assess different spectral indices (ARVI, NDVI, NDCI, NDAVI, WAVI) for detection of the overgrowing process in reservoirs. Three reservoirs located in the western part of Poland were selected for analysis: Przebedowo, Jezewo and Jezioro Kowalskie. The analysis was carried out on the basis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. All calculations were performed in ArcGIS 10.5 and Quantum GIS software. Results obtained for each of the spectral indices were verified on the basis of high-resolution color orthophotomaps. The results show that selected indices detect different overgrowth areas. The WAVI index shows the strongest agreement with reference data. The agreement between reference data for each pixel was calculated on the basis of the Kappa coefficient. Regardless of analyzed reservoir, the WAVI index has the highest value of the Kappa coefficient. Additionally, the analysis suggests that Sentinel-2 data can be used to identify emergent plant areas for reservoirs characterized by elongation ratio, width and inundation area. The highest uncertainty of results is shown by emergent plants characterized by small, dispersed areas and located near the banks of the water bodies.

TI  - Analysis of Selected Physicochemical Parameters and Degradation Process Assessment in a Two-Stage Reservoir Jezioro Kowalskie Using Field and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ROCZNIK OCHRONA SRODOWISKA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of changes of water quality parameters in a two-stage reservoir, observed in the period 2015-2016. The primary objective of the study was to analyse the spatial changes of the water quality parameters in the two-stage reservoir Jezioro Kowalskie. The second purpose was to assess the dynamics of the vegetation process on the basis of Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study adopts the following research hypotheses: 1) the pre-reservoir limits the inflow of the biogenic compounds to the main reservoir, 2) the vegetation process in the pre-dam reservoir is greater than in the main reservoir.The Jezioro Kowalskie reservoir has two-stage construction - the main and the pre-dam zone. The main role of the pre-dam reservoir is to store sediments and water pollutants.In this study, 13 water quality parameters were analyzed: electrical conductivity (EC), chlorides (Cl-), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), iron (Fe3+), hardness (Hard), pH, total alkalinity (TAl), total acidity (TAc), ammonium nitrogen (N-NH4), nitrate nitrogen (N-NO3), nitrite nitrogen (N-NO2), phosphate (PO43-). The samples were collected from 4 points, including two points in the pre-reservoir and two points in the main part. In order to determine parts of the reservoir which are exposed to the degradation process, the spatio-temporal changes were analyzed on the basis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spectral index. The analyses showed that the NDVI values in the period 2015-2018 in the pre-dam reservoir were higher than those recorded in the main reservoir. In the main reservoir, NDVI values were lower and characterized by similar variability.The study confirms the research hypothesis: the pre-reservoir protects the main part, limiting inflow of biogenic compounds which have an impact on the degradation process (overgrowth, eutrophication). The obtained results confirm that Sentinel-2 satellite imagery allows analysis of the vegetation process in retention reservoirs in terms of time and space.

TI  - Object Based Classification for Land Cover Mapping using Sentinel-1A in Yogyakarta
T2  - SIXTH GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE SYMPOSIUM
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th Geoinformation Science Symposium
CL  - Yogyakarta, INDONESIA
AB  - Information on the latest land cover can be obtained from remote sensing data processing, but many do still use optical imagery. In fact, Indonesia is the next country tropical so that the possibility of disrupted cloud cover throughout the year is enormous. Therefore, it is necessary that imagery can penetrate the cloud cover of the radar image. Behind the excess, there is a weakness of radar imagery is a salt and paper disorder that appears bitnik-black and white spots on imagery. This Salt and paper can have a pixel value that is therefore less precise when a pixel -based classification is performed. It is necessary to do a classification that not only considers the pixel value of object-based classification. This research aims to segment objects in the form of land cover and calculate the accuracy of the segmentation results.This research was conducted using a radar image, namely Citra Sentinel -1A with 10mx10m resolution. The segmentation process carried out using a multiresolution segmentation algorithm. Based on the results of the study, the best segmentation has an input channel parameter weight of 1, 0.5, 1, output parameter weight 25, shape parameter weight 0.3 and compactness parameter weight 0.9. The value of segmentation accuracy produced by considering five parameters in the shape of oversegmentation (OSeg), undersegmentation (USeg), root mean square error (D), area fit index (AFI), and quality rate (Qr) is 57%. Low accuracy value because radar images focus on object morphology in the shape of altitude and surface conditions. Whereas in a land cover the object's morphology can vary and surface roughness can vary.

AB  - The building change detection, which is important for monitoring human activity in urban and sub-urban area, can be done by the using of remote sensing data. To overcome the cloud cover problem that cause the limited utilizing in optical images which is repeatedly occurred in tropical areas, we decided to use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, a kind of remote sensing data that does not get affected by weather condition, to fulfill this change detection purpose. In this study, Bangkok, Thailand were selected as our study area in order to demonstrate that the SAR data can be used in the area that optical data cannot be used such as tropical areas like in Thailand. As our target is to detect changes of buildings, so we have to consider separating the change that cause by seasonal and other non-target objects. To complete this purpose, we decided to use one of the deep learning techniques called U-net which is created for the image segmentation task. We have created the ground truth and used one portion for training the network and another portion for validate the result. Finally, the model that trained by our training data was able to provide promising results.

AB  - Over the past two decades, malignant melanoma incidence rate has dramatically risen but melanoma mortality has only recently stabilized. Due to its propensity to metastasize and lack of effective therapies for most patients with advanced disease, early detection of melanoma is a clinical imperative. Thickness is one of the most important factor in melanoma prognosis and it is used to establish the size of the surgical margin, as well as to select patients for sentinel lymph node biopsy. However, little work has concentrated on the evaluation of melanoma thickness both from the clinical as well as computer-aided diagnostic side. To address this problem, we propose an effective computer-vision based machine learning tool that can perform the preoperative evaluation of melanoma thickness. The novelty of our approach is that we directly predict the thickness of the skin lesion into one of three classes: less than 0.75 mm, 0.76-1.5 mm, and greater that 1.5 mm. In this study, we use transfer learning of the pre-trained, adapted to our application VGG-19 convolutional neural network (CNN) with an adjusted densely-connected classifier. Due to the limited data we investigate the transfer learning method where we apply knowledge from model trained on a different task. Our database contains 244 dermoscopy images. Experiments confirm the developed algorithms ability to classify skin lesion thickness with 87.2% overall accuracy what is a state-of-the-art result in melanoma thickness prediction.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This study aims to identify the implication of Hyo in the life of Christians in the Christian worldview, clarify the fact that the practice of Biblical Hyo based on the Christian worldview becomes the life of social participation, and explore it. biblical Hyo creates meanings through reflective equilibrium by formulating itself through religious faith such as belief and conduct and becomes a connecting point between religion and life or social participation in the course of exploring the coherence of moral judgment performed in principle and reality.Therefore, biblical Hyo responds to God the Father as children and participates in the life of parents. The perspective that 'solidarity of reflective equilibrium and social participation through mutually required attention, caring, and filling in the reliable relationship of love' is significant. This can be biblical Hyo or modern Hyo given that it has access to relational life and its problems through theological solidarity and social participation.Micro solidarity in the proximity of the society, meso solidarity through spatial cultural empathy, and macro solidarity by accepting time culture and generational empathy are needed to do it. This union of three solidarities is likely to expand Hyo from private ethics to social ethics and refers to harmonious Co-maturity between time and spatial balance through Hyo of reflective equilibrium and generational notion.

T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - First release of E3SM v1.1 DO NOT download the .zip or .tar.gz files included here. They do not contain all of the code. Use "git clone --recursive" instead. This release includes scientifically-validated tunings of the E3SM Land Model (ELM) and E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM) for coupled simulations with active land, ocean, and sea ice biogeochemistry, for ELM configurations using the CTC approach to representing nutrient competition. Additional diagnostic variables have been made available as history variables from the ELM, and from the MPAS-Ocean and MPAS-Seaice biogeochemistry modules, in order to improve consistency with the output variable requests of the Coupled Climate Carbon Cycle Model Intercomparison Project (C4MIP), and to support improved analysis of the land, ocean, and sea ice carbon cycles. The atmosphere models prognostic CO2 code has been updated to enable regridding of anthropogenic CO2 emission files to the E3SMs native spectral element grid. Note that (1) the prognostic CO2 configuration of E3SM has not been scientifically validated, and (2) the regridding of emission files as currently implemented is not mass-conserving and is intended as a temporary workaround. We do not advise using E3SMv1.1 for fully-coupled carbon cycle simulations where mass conservation is critical, but it is suitable for enabling use of the 3D CO2 tracer for diagnostic and testing purposes. Several bugs found after v1.0 have been fixed in this tag and changes made to default settings, including: EAM: adding limiters to avoid bad extrapolation in RRTMG, fixing an error in the calculation of NIR reflectance that affects cloud fields derived from MODIS simulator. ELM: fixing surface water and lakes, increasing the land field name size, fixing a memory leak in ELM CNStateType, fixing a snow compaction bug that was resulting in sporadic unphysical snow depths, adding a water budget in the land model (and fixing a water conservation error) MPAS-O: preventing thermo energy conservation errors by lowering the permitted surface flux error in the mushy layer picard iteration to 0.9*ferrmax, fixing a small bug in marine BGC, MPAS-SeaIce: Turning off mpas-seaice history files by default MOSART: Replacing the low-res (half-degree) MOSART file In addition, the budget output has been turned on by default for any fully coupled case, and CIME was modified to remove a bad term from E3SM water budgets. The CCSM_CO2_PPMV is now set correctly in BGC cases. A bugfix for the IEFLX output is included and the timestep for the EC60to30 mesh has been updated. Finally, a number of minor bugfixes and technical improvements have been introduced in the EAM, ELM and MPAS-Ocean models. Machine updates for cascade, edison, eos, cori are included.

AB  - Land use land cover dynamics is a widespread phenomenon in many parts of Ethiopia and in Ribb watershed. The main objective of the research was assessing land use land cover dynamics and its implication to the sustainability of Ribb Dam in 1973, 1986, 2001, and 2016 by using Landsat image and household questioner. During the last 44 years, cultivated and settlement land and forest cover showed an increment from 26.29% to 54.89% and 9.45% to 12.86%, respectively. The bush land, grazing land, water body, and wetland, however, showed a relative decrement from 29.48% to 17.09%, 21.45% to 12.70%, 4.64% to 2.39%, and 8.70% to 0.08%, respectively. Population pressure, poverty, weak policy and institutional enforcement, and tenure insecurity revealed as a major cause of the change in land use land cover. Soil erosion, lack of fuel wood, and impact on livelihood are major consequences of land use land cover change.

AB  - Belitung Island is one of the biodiversity hotspots in Indonesia that is best known for its multi-use landscape, tourism, large agricultural land, tin mining and all other activities. The main earning possibility of local people of the island is most efficiently lies in coastal activities and tin mining. Main challenges are persistent cloud cover over the steep and vegetated terrain that creates a problem in forest change mapping. This research was conducted to identify and visually analyse the forest loss or gain due to tin mining activity and settlement along with the consequences of illegal logging using the Google earth engine application. Furthermore, this study will also help to understand the areas of water bodies filled after mining making it inactive. Therefore, NDVI and MNDWI analysis have been conducted to calculate the index values using the (GEE) Google earth engine and graphically presented. Landsat +ETM, MODIS global land cover, Hansen global forest change and other remote sensing data applied to conduct this research. The results obtained from this study shows that the width of forestry land cover is decreased gradually from 2012 to 2017 and the active tin mining, agricultural land, and settlement are widely increased. The inactive tin-mined areas are filled with water that can be well understood from the elevation modelling. Furthermore, the forest gain is also increasing mildly as per the results of change detection in forest gain analysis from 2012 to 2017. This clearly indicates the change of forest resulting due to the active tin mining and inactive tin-mined water filled land as well as the human settlement.

AB  - The main aim of this research is to examine the interpretation possibilities of images from the constellation of Sentinel satellites, i.e. Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, and to assess their suitability for the analysis of objects from category 01 Airfields according to the standardisation document STANAG 3596. In the presented research analysis of chosen airbases in Europe was presented. In the course of the research, image data, both electro-optical and microwave data, were pre-processed appropriately, i.e. radiometric and geometric corrections, and filtrations were applied, in order to finally analyse and evaluate interpretations. In the research radar images in the C band, which are recorded by sensors placed on the satellites of the Sentinel-1 constellation, as well as electro-optical images acquired by multispectral sensors placed on the satellites of the Sentinel-2 constellation, were used. In addition, the fusion of microwave and electro-optical data was made to verify the usefulness of data integration for reconnaissance purposes. Then the Sentinel data was combined with high-spatial-resolution data from Google Earth, in order to improve the quality and to verify the usefulness of the integration of multi-temporal data in the process of imagery interpretation and object detection. The analysis consisted of assessing the interpretability of images by the possibility of distinguishing specific objects on it. The results were next evaluated using high-spatial resolution open-source imagery data from Google Earth, and open source GIS data. The conducted analyses showed that the use of Sentinel image data in recognising objects at airports seems to be justified due to their availability, although these should be objects of considerable size. In order to detect smaller objects, multi-resolution data integration should be applied, as showed in the research.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing Technologies and Applications in Urban Environments IV held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - In the presented research, the change detection of the urban area in Poland was conducted. Due to the lack of availability of multi-temporal data from a similar sensor, the multi-sensor change detection was applied. For the research purpose data from low-resolution Landsat satellites, medium resolution Sentinel, along with high-resolution WorldView, Spot, and Pleiades satellites were used. In order to perform change detection, all data were preprocessed with radiometric calibration and geometric correction. The analysis of changes for the urban area was carried out for three dates. Because for each of the dates various sets of data were available, i.e. for each date, there were imagery data acquired with at least two different sensor-low and high-resolution data, and for different dates, the sets varied, in the first place data fusion for each date was conducted. For data fusion, pan-sharpening was applied. Thanks to this process, images with a similar spatial resolution for three dates were obtained. After such data preparation, the process of detecting changes was started. For change detection, both pixel and object-based change detection techniques were used, i.e. image differencing, image transformations, pixel-based and object-based classification, vegetation indices differencing, and image regression, were applied. As a result of the conducted analyses, many changes were noted in the analysed urbanised area, including changes in land use and changes in vegetation. In order to get complete information about the changes, basic detection techniques were integrated. The accuracy of the obtained results of change detection was affected by the accuracy of data integration for the different dates. In spite of several errors, the use of multi-sensors would enable the analysis of changes in a wider scope.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to understand students’academic performance facing a youth ministry focusing on the reformed worldview in the local church. In addition, it presents the practical tasks of Christian education in light of this reformed worldview perspective. The human work created in the image of God and having God's good purpose and plan. However, The purpose, direction, and culture for the academic performance was distorted by fallen man. Nevertheless, this academic performance reveals that, through the redemptive ministry of Jesus Christ, youth in the local church have been restored to performing the work of “the called”. The restored academic performance is understood as a integrated life that includes ‘being’ and ‘doing’ in a Christian manner. That is, it allows one to participate in the works of God by living life as one of the called. As those who have been called, youth in the local church must establish a calling identity in order to participate in the works of God via their studies. Therefore, this study presented two concrete, structured tasks of Christian education necessary for young people to establish a calling identity in the local church. Simply put, young people must absorb the same purpose, direction, and attitude toward life as those who are called. The first task presents discerning the purpose and direction of one’s calling to the academic performance. This takes place using the model of God’s “Vision Window” for His Kingdom. The second task requires an integrated life posture in order to establish one’s calling identity as an object of academic performance.This study presented the problem of future-oriented calling concepts focusing on career or job selection. It emphasizes that the concept of a calling to the academic performance should be understood as the “now” and “here”. According to the reformers, this newly-defined perspective on calling should be present in today’s “integrated life.” Furthermore, the congregation’s role was emphasized in order to help the identify establish as the called for the young members in the local church.

AB  - Celtic Christianity is not a familiar period in Christian history. It was rather hidden and disappeared when the Roman Catholic Church defeated Celtic Christianity after the Synod of Whiteby in 664 AD, which is considered to be the first conflict between Celtic Christianity and Roman Catholicism. Though Celtic Christianity has officially disappeared throughout the two thousand year history of modern Christianity, the Celtic tradition has experienced an unlikely revival through popular culture in the last few decades. This is evidenced in the resurgence of novels, movies and computer games that use Celtic mythology, characters, images and arts as their main source of inspiration. Moreover, some scholars argue that Celtic tradition can be considered an alternative worldview and a remedy for people who suffer from problems of modern society including environmental issues, individualistic ideologies that elevate the self above others, and the suppression of women’s rights in a patriarchal society. Celtic Christianity contextualised within the traditions of the past reveal different values and attitudes that go beyond those of Roman Catholicism that have been strongly influenced by Augustine’s theological doctrine of Original Sin. This article argues that Celtic Christianity has unique spiritual inclinations that are sympathetic towards the environment, community life, women and art. These four features will be significant for Christianity in the future.

AB  - As the advanced satellite network can serve extremely diverse information data to different types of users, it is of a vital interest to achieve data security using encryption over satellite channels. However, because the avalanche effect makes encryption techniques vulnerable to bit errors in the wireless channel, a more powerful encryption technique is required. In this paper, we propose a novel method of joint encryption and channel coding, called CFB-AES-TURBO, by combining advanced encryption standard (AES) encryption and turbo coding. As we introduce turbo coding in the cipher feedback (CFB) mode with AES, our scheme can protect bits and also correct bit errors. We control system parameters of the encryption block size and the code rate, tailored to the channel state information (CSI). As a result, we can achieve processing time gains, security enhancement, and bit error rate (BER) performance improvement at the same time.

AB  - This study focused on Hwanwoong and Unnyeo the main characters of Dangun mythology, who are very close to the ideal characters of Buddhism, Confucianism. Therefore, I would like to reinterpret Dangun myth as a human view of Confucianism and Buddhist thought, and draw out literary educational significance of it. Until now, there have been many studies that have interpreted the Dangun myth of Samguk-Yusa as Confucian and Buddhist. However, there is no study that reinterprets the meaning of Dangun myth based on the common meaning of Confucianism and Buddhism. The author of the book "Samguk-Yusa" was a Buddhist monk representing Goryeo Period, which was designated as a national honor at that time, but he also closely socialized with the scholars who had mastered "Hundred Schools of Thought". Also, the late Goryeo Dynasty, where he was active, was closely intertwined with the Confucian scholarship due to the specificity in the domestic and foreign era. The Dangun myth, in which Il-yeon, who lived as a leading intellectual in the 13th century, embellishes the first head of the Samguk-Yusa, compiled over 20 years, is highly likely not to represent the ideas of either side. Confucianism and Buddhism have much in common with human and world view. The Dangun myth, which we have seen through the Confucian Buddhist thought, is a story that reveals the commonality of Confucianism and Buddhism more than any stories in the Samguk-Yusa. This shows not only Buddhism but also a series of writers who have mastered various disciplines. Also, Dangun Myth is one of the vast traces of Confucianism and Buddhism that have been introduced to the Korean peninsula for many years. Therefore, this study aims at extracting the common human and world view of Confucianism and Buddhism as a method of analyzing the works of Dangun mythology in Samguk-Yusa. This proves the hypothesis that Dangun Myth will have a common sense of humanity and worldview pursued by Confucian Buddhist thought. And it derives literary education and personality education significance of this interpretation. Modern learners should cultivate diverse competencies based on fusion thinking. The content of this study is meaningful for the contents of education for these learners. In addition, I think that our people also have an opportunity to remind the true meaning of Dangun myth.

AB  - Copernicus is the World's largest single Earth Observation (EO) programme, whose satellite constellations are planned to be launched between 2014 and 2025. Among the constellations, Sentinel-1 (S-1) is a C-band SAR able to support land cover mapping. Although optical data are commonly used for land cover monitoring, the low availability of cloud-free scenes along the year hinders the mapping process. In such a way, S-1 presents an important source of data, able of providing all-weather and day-and-night imagery of EO. In this study, we investigate the potential of using S-1 data to distinguish targets in Remote Sensing images in three different Brazilian biomes, Amazon, Cerrado, and Atlantic Forest. Based on that, we proposed a methodology to classify SAR images, which was validated considering a different area from the ones used for sampling purposes. The results showed that through S-1 data, it is possible to detect mainly water and urban area targets, with overall accuracy of 0.90, evidencing that our approach is reproducible in other regions.

TI  - Fully Convolutional Networks for Multisource Building Extraction From an Open Aerial and Satellite Imagery Data Set
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of the convolutional neural network has shown to greatly improve the accuracy of building extraction from remote sensing imagery. In this paper, we created and made open a high-quality multisource data set for building detection, evaluated the accuracy obtained in most recent studies on the data set, demonstrated the use of our data set, and proposed a Siamese fully convolutional network model that obtained better segmentation accuracy. The building data set that we created contains not only aerial images but also satellite images covering 1000 km(2) with both raster labels and vector maps. The accuracy of applying the same methodology to our aerial data set outperformed several other open building data sets. On the aerial data set, we gave a thorough evaluation and comparison of most recent deep learning-based methods, and proposed a Siamese U-Net with shared weights in two branches, and original images and their down-sampled counterparts as inputs, which significantly improves the segmentation accuracy, especially for large buildings. For multisource building extraction, the generalization ability is further evaluated and extended by applying a radiometric augmentation strategy to transfer pretrained models on the aerial data set to the satellite data set. The designed experiments indicate our data set is accurate and can serve multiple purposes including building instance segmentation and change detection; our result shows the Siamese U-Net outperforms current building extraction methods and could provide valuable reference.

TI  - Retrieval of Ionospheric Faraday Rotation Angle in Low-Frequency Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A low-frequency spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) working system, e.g., operating at the L-band or P-band, has great advantages of military target detection and biomass monitoring. Nevertheless, it is more susceptible to ionospheric effects compared with the higher frequency system. A transionospheric wave propagation model is established in this paper to incorporate ionospheric effects on SAR signals. As one of the significant distortion sources for the polarimetric SAR (Po1SAR), Faraday rotation (FR) is mainly imposed by background ionosphere, and its spatial variation is discussed. FR estimators have been devised in succession to estimate FR angle (FRA), and various potential novel estimators can still be derived. But, from a viewpoint of theoretical expressions, the earliest estimator is bound to be the optimal one. Based on Po1SAR real data, this mathematical conclusion is further validated via comprehensive performance analysis as to estimation bias and standard deviation rather than the existent root-mean-square principle. Finally, a step-by-step procedure of the FRA map is proposed and operated with an application of the airborne P-band Po1SAR data. In particular, the ambiguity error of FRA estimates within a SAR observation is simulated and resolved. By processing the ALOS-2 real data, the spatial distribution of FRAs is retrieved and used to operate ionospheric total electron content soundings.

AB  - Landslide, the main geological hazards, needs to be periodically monitored for disaster forecasting and prevention. An effective method to do this is to apply the offset tracking technique on SAR satellite data. Successful applications of this technique depend on the appropriate estimation window. However as a shortage, the selection of estimation window often relies on rich processing experience or multiple attempts. In this paper, we proposed an optimal estimation window offset tracking (OEW offset tracking) technique. As an improvement, this technique provides a theoretical basis and a work-flow to design the optimal estimation window for offset tracking, considering both measurement accuracy and processing efficiency. This technique was applied to the Baige landslide, based on GF-3 data and achieved successful results.

AB  - Live fuel moisture (LFM) is a key fire risk indicator and is commonly used in fire behavior models. We compared eight widely used vegetation indices derived from MODIS reflectance and SMAP soil moisture on their capability to estimate LFM at 38 sites in Southern California, USA, a fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystem. Seasonality, inter-annual variability, or both were considered in our multivariate regression model construction. We found that VARI, a vegetation index calculated utilizing the reflectance from blue, green, and red bands performed the best among all remotely sensed moisture level indicators. SMAP soil moisture did not yield a good model performance mostly due to the great number of missing soil moisture retrievals in the data series. Frequency of LFM sampling also affected the model performance. The time lead of SMAP soil moisture to vegetation response can be a potential remotely-sensed predictor of LFM or an input to biophysical process model to retrieve LFM.

AB  - In order to understand the spread process of mulberry looper Apocheima cinerarius, the ENVII-IDL was used to extract the MODIS 13Q1 data to obtain A. cinerarius occurrence area in the distribution area of P. euphratica forest in Xiahe of Bachu County in Xinjiang from 2001 to 2016. The CLUE-S model was used to analyze and predict the distribution of pest occurrence, inversion and verification of the distribution of pests in 2006, and then predict the spatial distribution of various grades in 2020. The results showed that the occurrence range of A. cinerarius was gradually spread from 2001 to 2016, and the spread was obvious. The area of insect pests increased gradually, and the proportion of extremely severe, severe, moderate, and mild occurrence increased by 4.98, 11.36, 19.52, and 24.62 percentage points, respectively, while the proportion of pest-free area decreased by 59.48 percentage points to 37.18%. Through inversion and verification of the distribution of A. cinerarius in 2006 by using the CLUE-S model, the correct rate of simulation results reached 88.85%, and the Kappa coefficient of consistency test was 0.86. The spatial distribution simulation of pests in 2020 showed that the spatial pattern of the distribution of various grades of A. cinerarius was relatively obvious; the area of pests increased at various levels, and the proportion of pest-free area dropped to 30.57%. It indicated that the occurrence of A. cinerarius was very serious. It is necessary to give special treatment to the extremely serious regions. The use of CLUE-S model to invert the pest occurrence area is an efficient method to accurately predict the occurrence of pests. The simulation results can guide the implementation of aerial control operations.

AB  - Effective and timely monitoring of croplands is critical for managing food supply. While remote sensing data from earth-observing satellites can be used to monitor croplands over large regions, this task is challenging for small-scale croplands as they cannot be captured precisely using coarse-resolution data. On the other hand, the remote sensing data in higher resolution are collected less frequently and contain missing or disturbed data. Hence, traditional sequential models cannot be directly applied on high-resolution data to extract temporal patterns, which are essential to identify crops. In this work, we propose a generative model to combine multi-scale remote sensing data to detect croplands at high resolution. During the learning process, we leverage the temporal patterns learned from coarse-resolution data to generate missing high-resolution data. Additionally, the proposed model can track classification confidence in real time and potentially lead to an early detection. The evaluation in an intensively cultivated region demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in cropland detection.

TI  - Geographic space as a living structure for predicting human activities using big data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Inspired by Christopher Alexander's conception of the world - space is not lifeless or neutral, but a living structure involving far more small things than large ones - a topological representation has been previously developed to characterize the living structure or the wholeness of geographic space. This paper further develops the topological representation and living structure for predicting human activities in geographic space. Based on millions of street nodes of the United Kingdom extracted from OpenStreetMap, we established living structures at different levels of scale in a nested manner. We found that tweet locations at different levels of scale, such as country and city, can be well predicted by the underlying living structure. The high predictability demonstrates that the living structure and the topological representation are efficient and effective for better understanding geographic forms. Based on this major finding, we argue that the topological representation is a truly multiscale representation, and point out that existing geographic representations are essentially single scale, so they bear many scale problems such as modifiable areal unit problem, the conundrum of length and the ecological fallacy. We further discuss on why the living structure is an efficient and effective instrument for structuring geospatial big data, and why Alexander's organic worldview constitutes the third view of space.

AB  - Understanding suspended sediment concentration (SSC) distribution is of great significance to the comprehensive management of offshore engineering, structure safety and land sea interaction material flux. Combing satellite remote sensing, which has the advantage on quickly and dynamically obtaining the spatial distribution of sea surface SSC with high spatial resolution and large scale spatial coverage, with the acoustic based method, which is able to obtain high temporal and spatial resolution data along the vertical water column profile, has been proved as promising in obtaining three-dimensional SSC distribution in the target area.In this paper, based on the sea surface SSC map inversed from GF-1 satellite data, we intend to design optimal sampling route for acoustic-based in-situ measurement to maximize the environmental information with the least experiment cost. An optimal shipping path planning algorithm is proposed, in which the Kriging variance is utilized as a reward function to find the most informative sampling points, and the optimal sampling path is then planned to bring the ship as close as possible to those sampling points concerning the cost constraint. Meanwhile, we also use Voronoi polygon to accelerate the operation. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the in-situ measurement near Zhoushan island. A 3D SSC map is then produced with satellite inversed surface SSC and subsurface SSC along the depth profile measured by acoustic based in-situ measurements in the planned optimal sampling routine. We also test the algorithm in a wider sea area with more complicated hydrodynamic environment based on the satellite SSC and proved to be suitable for supplementation of large-scale measurement network.

AB  - Green Area Index (GAI) and Leaf Chlorophyll Content (LCC) are key variables that reflect the potential growth of the canopy. In the past decades, the retrieval of these variables from remote sensing data to generate operational products at high spatial resolution (lower than decametric) was mainly based on 1D radiative transfer model inversion. However, due to the recent advances in computational facility, it is now possible to invert 3D radiative transfer models to improve the operational product accuracy. The use of 3D models allows taking into account more realistic canopy architectures than when using the turbid medium assumption from the 1D radiative transfer models. In this study, we demonstrate the gain in accuracy when inverting crop specific using 3D radiative transfer models as compared to a generic algorithm based on 1D model. We investigate two crops characterized by contrasted architectures along the vegetation cycle, e.g. wheat and maize.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters of land-atmosphere energy exchange. The LST measured by thermal infrared remote sensing has a large directional difference between different viewing angles over urban areas with complex 3-dimensional urban surface structure; this phenomenon is the urban thermal anisotropy. In recent years, some kernel-driven models have been used to model the thermal anisotropy of urban surfaces, but a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the published kernel-driven models is lacking. Consequently, based on the simulation and the satellite datasets, three one-kernel models and eight dual-kernel models are comprehensively evaluated. The results show that: (1) the dual-kernel models are better than the one-kernel models. The average RMSE of the dual-kernel models is smaller than that of the one-kernel model by about 0.30 K. (2) The dual-kernel models with the solar kernel K-rou are better than those with solar kernel K-vs, because the solar kernel K-rou can simulate hotspots more accurately. (3) Urban geometric structure and solar radiation will affect the modeling error of the kernel-driven models, but basically do not affect their performance ranking. The optimal kernel-driven model is the RVI model. The modeling error of this model is minimal (RMSE is about 0.49 K) and its performance is stable. The optimal kernel-driven model recommended in this paper is expected to be used for the angular normalization of urban satellite LST products and remote estimation of complete urban surface temperature, which improves the thermal remote sensing of urban climates and environment.

TI  - Decreasing Rice Cropping Intensity in Southern China from 1990 to 2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing changes in rice cropping systems is essential for ensuring food security, greenhouse gas emissions, and sustainable water management. However, due to the insufficient availability of images with moderate to high spatial resolution, caused by frequent cloud cover and coarse temporal resolution, high-resolution maps of rice cropping systems at a large scale are relatively limited, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. This study combined the difference of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI) method and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold method to monitor changes in rice cropping systems of Southern China using Landsat images, based on the phenological differences between different rice cropping systems. From 1990-2015, the sown area of double cropping rice (DCR) in Southern China decreased by 61054.5 km(2), the sown area of single cropping rice (SCR) increased by 20,110.7 km(2), the index of multiple cropping decreased from 148.3% to 129.3%, and the proportion of DCR decreased by 20%. The rice cropping systems in Southern China showed a double rice shrinking and single rice expanding change pattern from north to south, and the most dramatic changes occurred in the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain. This study provided an efficient strategy that can be applied to moderate to high resolution images with deficient data availability, and the resulting maps can be used as data support to adjust agricultural structures, formulate food security strategies, and compile a greenhouse gas emission inventory.

AB  - Homogeneous transformation receives considerable attention in recent years as it is essential for change detection in heterogeneous images. However, most existing methods perform the homogeneous transformation based on low-level features. It leads to inaccurate homogeneous representations of the heterogeneous images and accordingly causes unsatisfied performance of change detection. To solve this problem, this paper presents a new model that utilizes deep-level features for homogeneous transformation instead of low-level features. Experimental results on real remote sensing data show that, the proposed method achieves an overall change detection accuracy of 95.91%, providing better performance than the existing methods based on low-level features.

TI  - MODELING DISTRIBUTION OF ECOSYSTEM CARBON IN ALPINE GRASSLANDS ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN MARGIN OF THE QINGHAI-TIBETAN PLATEAU USING MODIS NDVI DATA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining precisely the soil organic carbon (SOC), below-ground biomass carbon (BGC), and their spatial distribution and influence factors is a prerequisite for accurately estimating the function of ecosystem carbon sequestration in alpine grasslands. Normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), meteorological data and field investigation data from 2013 were used to determine the SOC, biomass carbon allocation and spatial distribution of alpine grassland in the upper reaches of the Shule River Basin, northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results indicate that a linear relationship between NDVI and biomass carbon can be used to accurately determine regional biomass carbon, particularly for below-ground biomass carbon (BGC) (BGC=16.11 NDVI-2.65, R-2 =0.59, P <0.001). The BGC is a significant resource of soil carbon, accounting for approximately 93.72% of the total carbon biomass. BGC can be used to explain most variations in SOC density at different soil depths (55% for 0-10 cm, 44% for 0-30 cm and 62% for 0-50 cm). The distribution of BGC and SOC had spatial heterogeneity across the study region, being greater in the south and east, and less in the north and west. A liner relationship between BGC and NDVI was found, which could be used in future prediction models and carbon budget assessments of the study area and vicinity.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is widely considered as one of the key parameters in a variety of practical applications. However, because of the contamination of cloud cover, the retrieval of daily ET from optical remote sensing data under cloudy sky conditions is full of challenge. In this paper, we reconstructed daily ET on cloudy days using the relationship between the potential evapotranspiration ratio (RPET) and the available water fraction (FAW). The field data from 8 Ameriflux sites were chosen to explore this relationship and applied for gap-filling of daily ET at these sites at first. Then MODIS data and meteorological data from Yucheng site in China were used to estimate daily ETs on clear days, and daily ETs on cloudy days at this site were reconstructed using the explored relationship between the RPET and the FAW, as an application of this reconstruction method. The results from 8 flux sites showed that daily ET reconstructions had good agreement with ET measurements, with the root mean square error (RMSE) less than 31.25 W/m(2). Based on MODIS and filed data from the Yucheng site, the reconstructed daily ETs under cloudy sky conditions were also consistent with measured daily ETs, with a bias of 2.62 W/m(2) and an RMSE of 35.21W/m(2).

TI  - Impact of clouds on the estimation of daily evapotranspiration from MODIS-derived instantaneous evapotranspiration using the constant global shortwave radiation ratio method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Upscaling instantaneous evapotranspiration (ET), retrieved at a specific satellite overpass time, to a daily scale is a key issue in drought monitoring, water resource management, and climate change study. The constant global shortwave radiation ratio method, which maintains a constant ratio of incoming global shortwave radiation to ET during the diurnal cycle, is reported to be robust when temporally upscaling instantaneous ET. However, this temporal upscaling method is typically used on clear-sky days. This study aims to evaluate cloud effects on the constant global shortwave radiation ratio method for extrapolating instantaneous ET from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and ancillary data to daily scale at the Yucheng station in China. Partly cloudy-sky (clear during satellite transit) and clear-sky days were selected using measured downward global shortwave irradiances; each partly cloudy-sky had a hypothetical clear-sky counterpart. Then, daily ET was estimated by extrapolating the instantaneous ET using the constant global shortwave radiation ratio method under clear-sky, partly cloudy-sky, and hypothetical clear-sky conditions. The results showed that (a) upscaled ET for clear-sky days had a bias of -4.3 W m(-2) and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14.5 W m(-2), and upscaled ET on partly cloudy-sky days had a bias of -7.8 W m(-2) and an RMSE of 18.9 W m(-2), with more serious underestimations under partly cloudy-sky conditions and (b) daily ET obtained under partly cloudy-sky conditions were reduced due to cloud effects comparing with that under hypothetical clear-sky conditions.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Geo-positioning accuracy improvement is one of the most important step of remote sensing image preprocessing. Traditional methods require a large number of ground control points(GCPs) which consuming lots of manpower and financial resources. With the resolution up to 0.8m, the original geo-positioning accuracy of the Chinese Gaofen(GF-2) multi-angle imagery is about 90m which means a limited application in geometric processing. In this paper, we propose a new method to improve the geometric performance of the multi-angle satellite imagery based on the geometric error sources of this experimental dataset without GCPs. Under the condition of weak intersection of our test dataset, we use a DEM-assisted approach to acquire a more accurate initial position accuracy of all tie points, and all extracted data is clustered by the Density based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN) algorithm in order to eliminate points or impages with large positioning error automatically. Then, the error-based block adjustment model are proposed and investigated to improved the geometric performance of the experimental dataset. Based on our proposed method, 142 multi-angle GF-2 satellite images covering the western Beijing area are experimented and the root mean square error(RMSE) of the geometric accuracy is improved up to about 12m in plane and 6m in height, which shows a significantly improvement in geo-positioning accuracy of these multi-angle GF-2 remote sensing imagery.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine how ‘l'alterite’, a core concept of interculturalism that can be expressed in English as ‘otherness’, emerged in the development of the ideology of a French second language as an education policy and to examine how ‘l’alterite’ is reflected in educational materials. ‘L’alterite’ aims to achieve new self-understanding through ‘the other’, As Paul Ricoeur points out, the subject acquires ‘l’ipseite’, or selfhood, through narrative identity and becomes ‘soi-meme’, or oneself, through the mediation of ‘l’alterite’. TV5MONDE’s website provides educational materials such as ‘Les Haut-Parleurs’ which aim to supply an intercultural perspective. However, some of the materials published need to be modified in terms of ‘l’alterite’. For example, in the ‘Culture’ section of the site, the history, literature, and characters provided remain French-centered. This finding reveals that the TV5MONDE website still maintains a France-centered worldview. In conclusion, TV5MONDE’s website has to change to reflect the number of diverse French users in order to succeed in embracing interculturalism, since the concept itself refers to the coexistence of different languages and cultures.

AB  - Just as most religions have a mythical worldview behind them, so new religions formed in modern East Asia seem to have been formed in connection with mythical worldviews. A mysterious story tries to convey something to people while embracing transcendence and reality. There is a ‘center’ in the representation of this transmission, and this center has a symbol system. This mystery has always been with religion, whether it is fiction or any other form of expression of fact. Through the new religions formed in the modern era, we can see the mythical world view that implies ‘the symbolism of the center‘ and ‘the tradition of fantasy’.Although new religions may be understood as a different aspect of the legitimacy of traditional religions, it is important that they present a clue to solve the problem of reality facing the ‘symbolism of the center’ and ‘fantasy tradition’ The fantasy tradition in the two new religions formed in the modern era, today shows the transformation of the awareness that welcomes the modern by the religious experience and awareness of the two doctrines.

AB  - Long-term relationships of forest growth with climatic variables across the North Hemisphere were investigated over eight IGBP transitions using remote sensing vegetation index during the past thirty years. We found that for evergreen forests, the positive correlations between forest growth and temperature dominated in the cold and dry areas, whereas the negative ones mainly exhibited in the warm and wet regions. The relationships of forest growth with precipitation mainly weaken with increasing MAP. For deciduous forests, the growth mainly positively correlated with temperature and the response of correlations to MAT was more obvious than that to MAP. However, the correlation between forest growth and precipitation exhibited insignificant variations along the climatic gradients. For mixed forest, the spatial pattern of climatic relationships was similar to that of DBF. Additionally, the correlations between forest growth and climatic variables obviously varied with local climate regimes, which is important to future climate change.

AB  - Asakawa Takumi’s knowledge of how to observe the mountains, learn how to follow nature’s principles, and enter people’s lives and become interested in their lifestyles and tools is very important. The exact understanding of nature’s reason and the quality of the household goods is the world of Intimacy, which was discovered by the eyes of the living. The world of Intimacy may have been the value that Asakawa Takumi wanted. It is his diary that his vision of the world came out in detail, dreaming of a Christian community that would adapt to nature’s principles and respect for others rather than prioritize difficult doctrines.Takumi was either a “heart to stick to across the Korea-Japan Channel” or a “close and warm” heart that crossed the boundary. It is not enough to describe craftsmanship as a great man who has practiced universal and humane ideas and worldview. He has a good sense of balance in thinking and acting from the other person’s point of view through the concept of love for humanity, which is acquired through intense religious awareness of the relationship between himself and God, and through everyday dialogue with Koreans. Takumi also had a kind of severity in which he always doubted and corrected his own judgments and thoughts.In this paper, the art education of the Shishu Shirakaba schools, including Yanagi Muneyoshi in the 1920s, and the art education of the Shishu Shirakaba schools, including Akahane Ohuro. I summarized the activities of the Asakawa brothers in Korea, such as collecting folk crafts. In conclusion, it has been revealed that idealists who belonged to the Shirakaba magnetic field in the 1920s were recognized as spaces where their dreams and ideals were put into practice, assuming that Korea was a kind of utopia.

AB  - Global remote sensing image data retrieval is enabled through metadata search. Traditional spatiotemporal indexing mechanism involves time-consuming spatial operations. In this study, a novel coupled spatio-temporal data retrieval method is proposed. It focuses on the repeat sun-synchronous orbiting satellites (RSSOs) that are widely used in Earth observation. The spatio-temporal indexing mechanism is the key to ensure the efficiency when retrieving image of interest. Landsat 8 historical scenes are used as experimental data. By exploring the correlation between temporal and spatial information, a spatio-temporal LookUp Table is built. This allows to reduce the search space from the whole data set to only one orbit cycle and keep on a constant level. This method greatly reduces the complexity of the image retrieval algorithm for RSSOs image data. They can notably improve the efficiency of remote sensing image retrieval.

Our methods seek to connect large-scale statistical analysis with individual case studies and thus provide the computational framework or connecting theoretical models with potential terabytes of remote sensing data. Based on individual ion populations as the basic unit of observation, we provide data-driven results of applying our method over representative energy spectrograms generated from the NASA Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission data from the Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) instniment.

AB  - This paper examines the nature of the religious interests that led to the adoption of Buddhism during the Eastern Jin Dynasty(東晉) by looking at Xi Chao(郗超), who was one of the most prominent Buddhist scholar-officials(奉佛士大夫 feng fo shi dafu) of the era. In addition to being tasked with overseeing culture, scholar-officials(士大夫) were also politicians. As such, they were not allowed to be negligent of real-world problems. As a scholar-official, Xi Chao served within the royal court while observing his Buddhist faith in pursuit of utopia.Xi Chao was influenced by Wang Dao(王導 276-339) and Yu Liang (庚亮 289-340), who had contributed to the founding of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, in that he carried on the belief that there was no contradiction between conduct - the pursuit of fundamental truth - and tending to real-world issues. He also appears to have believed that adopting Buddhism as a path for the pursuit of profound truths, via the study of xuanxue(玄學), did not lead one astray from matters of reality.Xi Chao is regarded as having integrated idealism(觀念論) and realism(現實論) in this theory of identification of Confucianism with Buddhism(儒佛一致論), wherein he inserted Confucian(儒家) teachings into a Buddhist worldview. Not only did he pursue utopia along with the idealistic aspects of Buddhism, but he also had a strong conviction that utopia had to be realized in actuality. From the perspective of the religious interests among the Buddhist scholar-officials of the Six Dynasties era(六朝時代), Confucianism was embraced via religious interests from a Buddhist worldview, such that the matters of pursuing deep truths and tending to real-world matters were seen to be compatible.The scholar-officials of the Six Dynasties era are characterized by the fact that they took the teachings of Confucian sages(聖人) to be truths, while requiring consistency between the detailed words of the Buddhist and Confucian sages. Ever since the theory of identification of Confucianism with Buddhism was propounded, there was a need to assert that Buddhist teachings could also help secure order within the state, and that it merited a movement no lesser than Confucianism in terms of practical considerations. Buddhist scholar-officials, such as Xi Chao, appear to have believed that Buddhism and the exposition of its vast worldview had the ability to bring peace to the real world.The thoughts and actions of Xi Chao may also serve to explain the history of Buddhism during the Eastern Jin Dynasty. That is, Xi Chao observed that there was a lack of ideological and methodological sufficiency in traditional Chinese thought, and felt the need for Buddhism in order to address this issue. In view of this, it appears that he sought to pursue an actual utopia by combining idealism and realism by appealing to the theory of identification of Confucianism with Buddhism. While the Buddhist code of conduct itself was not manifested in the sphere of political practice, Xi Chao’s worldview sought principles of conduct in Buddhism, in that he regarded it as the base(本) and Confucianism as the branch (末), thus deeming it to be closer to the ideal even in the realm of reality.

AB  - We hope that more diverse interests will arise in the novels by Park Gye-hyeong By looking at writers and works in time, we identified the key element of Park Gye-hyeong’s novels as ‘romantic’. Romantic nature of this time is lyrical, sentimental, spiritual, unrealistic and idealistic. Based on a romantic understanding of the world, the core sanction of the novel is love, focusing on feelings of sadness, and on the aspects of joy, separation, and pain that arise from loving relationships rather than the aspects of joy. Based on the feelings of grief, the novels end with failure, death and betrayal, thus embodying tragic romanticism.Before her marriage, Park Gye-hyeong’s novels were love stories that revealed her longing for beautiful love based on sensibility. The idyllic world and longing for nature reveal a romantic world-view. Ultimately, it is a fictional worldview that the author seeks to despair and long for, and to find the sincerity and morality of love in an environment that does not. Park Gye-hyeong, who became a housewife, expressed that she wanted to write a piece that can give readers a sense of nostalgia by embodying “romance at a high level,” not “sentimental.” In subsequent works, physical relationships are treated as failures of love and spiritual relationships as the fruit of love, revealing the lofty spirituality, idealistic longing and religious nature of love.Park Gye-hyeong confessed her shame about her previous work when she published a new one after more than two decades of writing. And after more than two decades of reflection, her new novel had a new theme of “recovering destroyed humanity.” However, the search for “humanity” in the two novels released after the write-off tends to be somewhat hasty at the end of the novel. The question of human nature, sin and forgiveness, is the next best thing to save as a way of life, rather than as a result of the intense inner agony and behavior of the characters within the narrative, and this also shows a sudden shift in religiousness at the end of the novel. Therefore, the romantic meaning of the superficial is superficial.

TI  - Cloud Types Identification for Meteorological Satellite Image Using Multiple Sparse Representation Classifiers via Decision Fusion
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Meteorological satellite can monitor the weather conditions in large scales effectively; some solutions and researches have been raised for cloud types identification in satellite cloud image analysis. Extracting the features of the satellite image and designing effective classifier play important roles in implementing cloud types identification system. Since different features describe the characteristics of the cloud image in different perspectives, the collaborative utilization of the different features help to improve the accuracy of cloud classification. This paper proposed a new method to identify cloud types from meteorological satellite image using multiple sparse representation classifiers via decision fusion. First, followed by different types of features extracting, multiple sparse representation-based classifiers were trained respectively. Then, the strategy of decision fusion was introduced to fuse the outputs of multiple classifiers. In order to bring about a reasonable fusion rule, the fusion weights were determined by an adaptive iterative procedure, and the iterative procedure was constructed according to the performance of each sub-classifier. Finally, an adaptive weighted fusion was implemented to determine the cloud type according to the outputs of sub-classifiers and their corresponding weights. The experimental results on FY-2G satellite data demonstrate that the proposed method gains higher recognition accuracy than each separated sub-classifier, which suggests that the strategy of decision fusion can take advantage of each sub-classifier. Moreover, the proposed method achieves competitive results when compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. The computation efficiency of the proposed method is also analyzed briefly.

TI  - Radiometric Quality Assessment of Multitemporal Optical Images In High Latitudes Considering seasonal Influence
T2  - 2019 10TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON THE ANALYSIS OF MULTITEMPORAL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES (MULTITEMP)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th International Workshop on the Analysis of Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images (MultiTemp)
CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - This paper presents an assessment method for radiometric quality of multitemporal optical remote sensing images in high latitudes. In high latitudes, some indicators of radiometric quality assessment are greatly affected by seasonal factors, specifically the ice and snow. The quality of images among the multitemporal series cannot be well distinguished because of the high reflectivity of ice and snow. The proposed method includes two main parts: (1) The multitemporal optical images are firstly divided as two groups automatically based on the calculated ice-snow index, one with snow and ice and the other group without ice and snow. (2) Evaluations are derived for the two groups of images based on selected different references, which are determined according to the indicator changing tendency among the series of multitemporal images. Furthermore, a weighted integration method is introduced to calculate the quality indicators for each image from its composite bands. The proposed method is tested in the assessment of a series of Landsat-5 multitemporal images. By comparing with the traditional methods of image quality assessment that did not consider the seasonal influence, the method derives assessment result that was closer to the real quality status of the images. And therefore, it can provide consistent evaluation results among the multitemporal images.

AB  - 'Ziyan' is a new variety of dark purple tender shoots tea tree which is rich in anthocyanins. ZY-1 and ZY-3 were two natural hybridized offspring of 'Ziyan', which were cultivated by single plant selection. 'Ziyan' is as the female parent, whereas the male parent has yet to be determined. In this study, we try to investigate cytological parameters of the three kinds of tea plants, and analyze the chromosomal karyotype differences among them. The results showed that the max arm ratio of 'Ziyan' was determined 2.50, and relative length was between 3.56% and 5.39%. The karyotype asymmetry index was 59.920%, and the karyotype formula was 2n=2x=30=22m (2SAT)+8sm. The max arm ratio of ZY-1 was 2.50, and relative length was between 4.80% and 8.69%. The karyotype asymmetry index was 60.307%, and the karyotype formula was 2n=2x=30=20m+10sm. The max arm ratio of ZY-3 was 2.77, and relative length was between 3.95% and 8.70%. The karyotype asymmetry index was 58.679%, which was lower than 'Ziyan' and ZY-3, and the karyotype formula was 2n=2x=30=24m+6sm. Although 'Ziyan' was significantly different from its two offspring, the karyotype characteristics of three varieties of tea plants were all type 2B. 'Ziyan' had a pair of satellites, but neither ZY-1 nor ZY-3 had a satellite. According to the karyotype asymmetry index and average arm ratio, the hybrid progeny ZY-3 was the most primitive, followed by the female parent 'Ziyan', while the hybrid progeny ZY-1 was the most evolutive.

AB  - ZY, HYZ and CH-1 are three characteristic tea varieties with different shoot colors. However, there is a lack of karyotype analysis of these characteristic tea varieties. In this experiment, the differences of cytological parameters of three characteristic tea varieties, and the control variety FDDB, were analyzed. The results showed that significant differences of the average arm ratio, relative length, karyotype asymmetry index and the karyotype formula were found among the three characteristic tea varieties as well as the control variety FDDB. Moreover, only ZY's karyotype type was 2B, while the three other varieties all were 2C. Among them, HYZ was the most evolved and closed to FDDB, while CH-1 and ZY were very different from FDDB and evolved more primitive than HYZ. HYZ was the most evolved, and ZY was relatively primitive. PCA analysis indicated that the notable differences were found between FDDB and two characteristic tea varieties (ZY and CH-1), while HYZ is relatively close to FDDB. This findings revealed the variation of chromosomes among different color varieties at the cytological level, and provided a certain theoretical basis for the study of genetic variation and diversity of tea resources.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple parameters (brightness temperature, soil moisture, surface latent heat flux, surface air temperature and carbon monoxide) before and after the 2015 Nepal M7.8 Gorkha main earthquake and M7.3 Dolakha aftershock were analysed using satellite observation data. The thermal anomalies from optical and microwave data appear about two months prior to the 2015 Gorkha earthquake. Some of the parameters show anomalous changes at different altitudes about 20 days prior to the main earthquake event and 10 days prior to the strong aftershock. Our results show that pre-earthquake anomalous signals propagate from the in situ to the top of atmosphere, and the anomalies in the atmosphere often observed prior to an impending earthquake. The changes on the land surface and corresponding changes in meteorological and atmospheric parameters show existence of strong coupling during the seismogenic period, although the transfer mechanism of seismic/electromagnetic is still has to be investigated and understood.

AB  - The local climate zone (LCZ) classification divides the urban areas into 17 categories, which are composed of 10 man-made structures and 7 natural landscapes. Though originally designed for temperature study, LCZ classification can be used for studies on economy and population. In this paper, we achieve a LCZ classification with convolutional neural networks based on the multi-source remote sensing data, including the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data and the corresponding multi-spectral imagery (MSI). Through experiments we attempt to reveal the contributions of the SAR data and the MSI to the classification performance. Furthermore, we emphasize the crucial importance of the preprocessing on the training data to derive a balanced dataset. We are ranked second in the Tianchi competition rankings when we submit our results.

AB  - The snow distribution on the Korean Peninsula in winter is closely related to the spring drought and forest fires, so continuous observation is needed. However, due to limited location and number of weather stations on the Korean Peninsula, direct acquisition of data from North Korea, highlands and mountainous areas is difficult. Therefore, in this study, we tried to examine the spatial characteristics of snow distribution on the Korean Peninsula using MODIS snow data. The local Moran’s I index was used to identify snow distribution characteristics in winter and compared them with topographical factors such as altitude and forest rates. The analysis revealed a wide snow distribution in highland and high forest rates, as generally expected. In particular, despite the lack of snow on the Korean Peninsula during summer, it was confirmed that the MODIS snow data produced errors in areas with high altitude, forest rate and slope. Through this study, we were able to confirm that there was a wide snow distribution in mountainous regions in the mid and northern part of the Korean Peninsula during the winter. If we continue to observe snowy distribution and changes on the Korean Peninsula, it will be very useful as a basis for estimating regional drought and fire outbreaks in spring.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the multicultural awareness development stages of youth mentors in storytelling programs and to explore the changes of multicultural mentality found in mentoring experiences. It has been confirmed that multicultural mentoring can contribute to the multicultural sensitivity development of mentors and the development of competencies beyond the educational alternatives for merely mentees. We also confirmed that mentoring experience has great influence on the formation of multicultural sensitivity. those who participated in multicultural mentoring had diverse cultural experiences that change the multicultural perception through their experience with mutual cultural exchange, which is a meeting with a mentee. youth Mentors have developed multicultural sensitivity though the process of overcoming the limits of their cultural identities. They have also been able to develop a sense of 'prejudice and unfamiliarity', 'communication and understanding', 'understanding and recognition' And a change in multicultural awareness. Participants will expand their worldview based on the expansion of their cultural capabilities and experience new changes in their intercultural competencies. Therefore, expanding opportunities to experience multiculturalism can be a crucial element for enhancing an individual's multicultural competency. In conclusion, it was confirmed that by expanding multicultural mentoring for youths, it is possible to suggest an educational alternative to enhance an individual's multicultural sensitivity and cultural competency.

TI  - Potential Applications of HyspIRI for the Observation of Sea-Margin Processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission will observe the effects of future environmental changes upon the world's ecosystems. Among other applications, this paper reviews three different sea-margin processes that can be monitored by the HyspIRI spectrometer, i. e. groundwater and surface-water discharge, meltwater-pond formation, and shoreline delineation. Groundwater and surface-water discharge to coastal regions affects local ecological conditions through changes in the local temperature, salinity, and nutrient load. Water-quality changes and temperature variability resulting from such discharge can be estimated from observation in the visible-to-shortwave-infrared (VSWIR) and the mid-and thermal-infrared (TIR) regions, respectively. The processes of meltwater forming ponds and entering the sea have unique ecological characteristics and are of additional interest because they are also highly subject to climate change. HyspIRI can use TIR to observe the spatial distribution of meltwater, whereas its VSWIR spectrometer can be used to quantify the changes of phytoplankton pigments (e. g., chlorophyll a). Quantifying seamargin changes requires accurate delineation of margin positions wherein tidal influence is minimal. Since the HyspIRI VSWIR data cover a wide spectral range and offer high spatial resolution, they are particularly suitable for shoreline delineation/change detection, as well as flood mapping. The signal-to-noise ratio of HyspIRI is expected to be comparable to that of the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean and much higher than that of Hyperion and Landsat Enhanced Thermal Mapper Plus, making it suitable for studying optically complex coastal aquatic environments. Herein, using examples from existing satellite sensors, HyspIRI's potential to study these complex sea-margin processes is presented and discussed.

AB  - Maritime activities in the Arctic Ocean is increasing and consequently the risk for an oil spill there is rising. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is used operationally to detect and monitor oil slicks and for sea ice monitoring and observations. Leads are often used for ship routing and within the leads newly formed sea ice is often present. Separation between the low backscatter areas that constitutes oil slicks and newly formed sea ice is therefore important. Here we compare fully polarimetric L-band SAR images overlapping both oil slicks and newly formed sea ice. For the oil slicks airborne Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR (UAVSAR) images are used and for the newly formed sea ice an ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 image is used. Using a set of multi-polarization features we observe that the coefficient of variation of the polarization difference can be used to separate the two.

T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - High latitude seas will be among the first marine systems to be impacted by ocean acidification (OA). Previous research studying the effects of OA on the pteropod, Limacina helicina antarctica, has led this species to be identified as a sentinel organism for OA in polar oceans. Here, we present gene expression data on L. h. antarctica, collected in situ during the seasonal transition from early spring to early summer. Our findings suggest that after over-wintering under seasonal sea ice, pteropods progress toward full maturity in the early summer when food becomes increasingly available. This progression is highlighted by a dramatic shift in gene expression that supports the development of cytoskeletal structures, membrane ion transportation, and metabolically important enzymes associated with glycolysis. In addition, we observed signs of defense of genomic integrity and maturation as evidenced by an up-regulation of genes involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and gametogenesis. These data contribute to a broader understanding of the life-cycle dynamics for L. h. antarctica and provide key insights into the transcriptomic signals of pteropod maturation and growth during this key seasonal transition.

AB  - Continuous land development and urbanization highlights the importance of improved surface water management to avoid flooding and delayed drainage. Thus, several cities around the world have used variations of the blue-green factor (BGF), a policy instrument to attain desired levels of vegetation and water surfaces in new property developments. However, estimating BGF for existing infrastructure is equally important in order to ensure proper water management of the entire city. The presented work shows a possible workflow to estimate BGF semi-automatically from remote sensing hyperspectral and lidar data in Norway. A set of urban features and areas were detected and analyzed for individual properties affecting the BGF, along with corresponding estimation accuracies. The results demonstrate the potential to extract information and calculate BGF automatically. Lastly, it is pointed out that the models used for BGF estimation need to be further investigated and developed to enhance the estimation accuracy.

TI  - Progress in the HIV epidemic: Identifying goals and measuring success
T2  - PLOS MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial progress has been made towards the goal of ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic due to advancements in both prevention and treatment of HIV. However, major challenges still remain. We describe basic principles of epidemic control in the context of HIV and identify a number of attainable goals in terms of control and elimination of HIV in specific populations and risk groups, given currently available HIV prevention and treatment methods. Currently available HIV prevention methods make it a feasible goal to eliminate HIV transmission attributable to mother-to-child transmission and blood transfusions. Reductions in transmission attributable to sexual behavior and injection drug use are feasible, but elimination of these modes of transmission will require further advancements in behavioral and biomedical HIV prevention. With regard to HIV-related mortality, we argue that elimination of death due to HIV-related causes is a feasible goal. HIV-related deaths should be treated as sentinel events triggering epidemiological investigation into the breakdowns in the HIV care continuum that led to them. We briefly discuss additional considerations that will affect the success of HIV prevention programs.

AB  - The modified Kling-Gupta efficiency fusion method to merge actual evapotranspiration was proposed and compared with the simple Taylor skill’s score method using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), MODIS Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16), and the flux tower on three different land cover types over the Korean peninsula and China. In the results of the weights estimated from two actual evapotranspiration merging techniques (i.e., STS and KGF), the weights of reanalysis data (i.e, GLDAS and GLEAM) in cropland and grassland showed similar performance, while the results of weights are different according to the merging techniques in forest. Both two merging techniques showed better results than original dataset in grassland and forest. However, there were no improvement in cropland compared to the other land cover types. The results of the KGF method slightly improved compared to those of the STS in grassland and forest.

AB  - In his late works, Michel Foucault delved into the Ancient Greek-Roman ethics as a practice of self-constitution of the subjects, to investigate the genealogy of the ethos of both the modern criticism and autonomic subjectivization. Foucault calls their ethical practices of self ‘the aesthetics of existence.’ I critically analyze his last project of the aesthetics of existence from the sociological perspective of technique, repetition, and the social ontology of force. I pay attention to the following two aspects. First, social conditions of the modern society much differ from those of Ancient times. Second, the Ancient ethical practices of the aesthetics of existence are based on the quasi-magical worldview. In this line of thought, I argue as follows: the fundamental source of force is in social relation to others, not in the relation to the self; the actualization of force is possible by technique while a technique can be repeated insofar as it satisfies felicitous conditions of a society. Therefore, I conclude that Foucault’s last project of the aesthetics of existence should be situated within social horizon for it to be executable and effective.

AB  - Data Level Parallelism has been improving performance-energy tradeoff of current processors by coupling SIMD engines, such as Intel AVX and ARM NEON. Special libraries and compilers are used to support DLP execution on such engines. However, timing overhead on hand coding is inevitable since most software developers are not skilled to extract DLP using unfamiliar libraries. In addition, DLP detection through compiler, besides breaking software compatibility, is limited to static code analysis, which compromises performance gains. In this work, we propose a runtime DLP detection named as Dynamic SIMD Assembler, which transparently identifies vectorizable code regions to execute in the ARM NEON engine. Due to its dynamic fashion, DSA keeps software compatibility and avoids timing overhead on software developing process. Results have shown that DSA outperforms ARM NEON auto-vectorization compiler by 32% since it covers wider vectorized regions, such as Dynamic Range, Sentinel and Conditional Loops. In addition, DSA outperforms hand-vectorized code using ARM library by 26% reducing 45% of energy consumption with no penalties over software development time.

TI  - Colonial Bodies in Display Cases and Spectating Bodies <i>A Contemporary Art Critique</i>
T2  - EXPLORING THE BLACK VENUS FIGURE IN AESTHETIC PRACTICES
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Through readings of artworks by Iranian Fariba Hajamadi, South African Tracey Rose, and Americans Coco Fusco and Guillermo Gomez-Pena, Ulla Angkjaer Jorgensen examines how contemporary visual arts have brought into play European museums' ways of exhibiting the black body as a sign of otherness since the start of colonization. She argues that the traditional museum exhibition requires the viewer to adopt an aesthicizing and exoticizing gaze, closely associated with masculine agency and superiority, and epitomized by the display case. By practicing a tracing of learned habits and prejudices akin to what Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak has described as 'unlearning,' contemporary visual arts make use of the display case in order to provoke a feeling that the object is looking back at the spectator, and thereby expose the colonial worldview written into the western mindset through centuries of education and institutionalization. The trope of Black Venus is thus inscribed into the very form of these artworks, through the way in which visual and bodily aesthetic practices either enhance or abolish the air-less, time-less bubble that separates the spectating body from the displayed body.

AB  - The use of the metaphor "canary in the coal mine" was originated to provide early warning of the occupational health hazards generated by toxic gases in the mines. Under this premise, the use of dolphins as a sentinel species of the Ecuadorian continental coast emerged as a novel idea to strengthen and stimulate the advancement of marine eco-toxicology in Ecuador. Thus, the project "Study of Population Ecology, Persistent Organic Pollutants, mercury and diseases of the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) in the El Morro Mangrove Wildlife Refuge, Gulf of Guayaquil" was recently undertaken in Ecuador.

AB  - This is a R data file of reference SVM model for STmask.It can be loaded in R as: model = readRDS("mymodel.rds").The feature prediction can be obtained as: predict(model,xtest), where xtest is a 2 element vector [SWIR2,TC4] calculated using Top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectances measured by satellite such as Landsat, Sentinel, etc.The output features from model are: 1 (ground/clear), 2 (cloud), 3 (shadow), 4(snow (snow biomes)/cold cloud), 5(water). It is developed as cloud mask and isn't optimized for features other than clouds. So, we recommend using it as a reference specifically for filtering clouds (as a preprocessing step for hyperspectral satellite images). The model can be retrained by users using their own training data. The model details and application is described in the 2019 journal paper first authored by Pratik Joshi, titled "Cloud detection algorithm using SVM with SWIR and tasseled cap applied to Landsat 8" in the International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation".

TI  - A semi-empirical approach for the estimation of land-surface emissivity from satellite data based on spectral index fusion using ensemble regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) is a key parameter in the thermal remote sensing, with several important applications, most notably in Land Surface Temperature (LST) estimation. This paper presents a semi-empirical method of LSE estimation from remote sensing data based on a fusion of spectral indices using the ensemble regression methods. The performance of the proposed method for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data was evaluated and compared with other semi-empirical methods developed for these sensors. The proposed method was designed in four stages. In the first stage, the reflectance of non-thermal bands and emissivity of thermal bands were simulated for different classes using the ASTER spectral library and the spectral response function of each sensor. In the second stage, the dataset to be used for the training of ensemble regression was arranged by calculating a number of spectral indices, which constitute the feature space along with non-thermal bands. In the third stage, the regression between emissivity of thermal bands of each sensor and the features extracted in the second stage was derived by the use of bagging, boosting and Random Forest (RF) regression methods. In the final stage Using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values, the image was categorized into three classes including vegetation, non-vegetation and mixture areas using conditions NDVI > 0.5, NDVI < 0.2 and 0.2 NDVI 0.5, respectively. The non-vegetation class was then categorized to soil, rock, and man-made classes using land use map. The spectral indices of these classes were then calculated, and the corresponding model trained in the third stage was used to estimate the LSE for that band. The results of LSE estimations were compared with the standard product of each sensor. Due to the lack of standard product for Landsat-8, the ASTER product was used as a substitute. For better analysis, the proposed method was also evaluated with other semi-empirical methods developed for MODIS, ASTER and OLI/TIRS sensors. This evaluation showed that the lowest Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values for OLI/TIRS bands 10 and 11 are 0.0070 and 0.0075 obtained, respectively, by bagging and RF regression methods. For ASTER bands 13 and 14, the lowest RMSE values of 0.0078 and 0.0077 are both obtained by RF regression. For MODIS bands 31 and 32, the lowest RMSE values are 0.0053 and 0.0049 and obtained by boosting method. A comparison between the proposed method and other semi-empirical methods provided for these sensors demonstrated the ability of the method to improve the RMSE by up to 0.5%. Regarding the higher accuracy and applicability of the proposed method, it can serve as an effective and efficient means of estimating LSE using remote sensing data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the assessment of the ecological integrity of streams in Bregalnica River Basin with emphasis on river Bregalnica as the biggest and most important watercourse in Eastern Macedonia. The results have principally been derived from remote sensing data and set up in a model build up on Watershed Habitat Evaluation and Stream Integrity Protocol (WHEBIP). WHEBIP effectiveness in predicting ecological integrity of streams has been assessed by correlation analyses derived upon data on macroinvertebrate biotic indices and physico-chemical parameters on 35 localities throughout the basin. The statistical analyses confirmed the capacity of WHEBIP to predict stream site-specific features with great accuracy in the case of Bregalnica.The results obtained in this study contribute towards the improvement of the WHEBIP protocol and in general, promotes applicability of stream integrity assessment tools in setting priorities for integrated watershed management.

AB  - Artificial intelligence has a lot of influence in the art field, and its value is recognized as the works of art are sold in the auction market. There is the deep learning method which has been recently used in AlphaGo, and it is a system that mimics the process of human’s perceiving the world and recognizing the object. As AI begins to use this deep learning method, artificial intelligence wrote jazz music, completed the work of Rembrandt by learning the styles of famous artists, and produced Chun Lian(春聯). Such artificial intelligence is expected to have an influence in the field of calligraphy and painting. In this study, thus, to evaluate and diagnose such phenomena aesthetically, I investigated the unique worldview of calligraphy and painting and examined the possibility of artificial intelligence in realizing the spirit in the worldview.The aesthetic consciousness of calligraphy and painting can be examined through the Book of the Changes which tries to clarify the origin of life and the principle of life through which all things are made. The correlative relationship of yin and yang is a life principle of all things and embraces the aesthetic possibility as a principle of change and creation of art. That can be confirmed through the theory of calligraphy and painting of Kim Jeong-hui, Bu Yantu(布顔圖), and Shao Meichen(邵梅臣). They said that the vitality of the nature could be reproduced when understanding the creating principle of the universe based on ‘the Way that yin and yang successively move[一陰一陽之謂道]’. In addition, they decided that the artistic creativity, which had ‘the Spirit that they cannot assess yin and yang[陰陽不測之謂神]’, could emerge when they understand and express the principle of change which yin and yang complement and embrace each other.On the other hand, until now, the driving system of deep learning basically finds the correct answer by recognizing the small unit in the lower level and the higher unit as it goes up. In this process, the answers found by the neurons in the lower level are often inaccurate. Therefore, because of its narrow view, it causes distortions like they perceived Michelangelo’s <The Creation of Adam>. As such, at the current level of artificial intelligence technology, it seems to be difficult for AI to recognize the significance of ‘stroke’, which is important in calligraphy and painting, and to expect a form that is full of vitality. In addition, because the calligrapher’s or painter’s love for life is not based on a copy and a logical understanding but a stage of experience and inspiration, there is a limit to make the machine learn it. Ultimately, even if artificial intelligence can reach a level that mimics an artist’s consciousness, so that fundamental learning about East Asian art becomes possible, it still remains a question of judging whether or not it is merely the manifestation of an artist by AI.

AB  - This paper researches aspects of the fourth industrial revolution in Geumosinhwa and how these aspects may be used in writing education to reimagine classics in line with the changing times. In essence, Geumosinhwa was written in such a way as to make the fourth industrial revolution popular with regard to Artificial Intelligence (AI). At the time of Kim Siseup’s writing, there was no AI (with a computer process or memory). Consequently, there was no AI automation or connectivity, which are key aspects of the fourth industrial revolution. However, the people of those times did not lack imagination, which can be used in writing education. Geumosinhwa is written skillfully enough to describe the process of the fourth industrial revolution. Four keywords associated with the fourth industrial revolution can be applied to Geumosinhwa. The super intelligence, which uses vast data, is analogous to the role of the spirits; super connectivity is related to the contents and its context; automation is comparable to the earnestness of humans; and the creation of value corresponds to enlightenment and healing. At that time, although the materialistic culture was underdeveloped, the ideas of the fourth industrial revolution can be seen in the writing. It is based on a liberal artistic imagination and the creativity of convergence and integration. It expands emotional expression in timespace and creates contemporary value. The liberal artistic imagination and the creativity of convergence and integration are bases of the fourth industrial revolution. The view of the world is expanded, and diverse values are expounded in writing education. The expansion of the worldview leads to emotional expansion, in terms of real/super-real world and timespace. Contemporary values can be engendered in the form of a philosophy or can be used for healing. The characteristics of Geumosinhwa and the fourth industrial revolution are very similar. The timespatial expansion of emotional expression and the creation of contemporary values are enabled by these tendencies in writing education.

AB  - Henry James, a cosmopolitan, is not an indifferent and ignorant of Christianity though he is known as a writer who is unrelated to Christianity. James is not a devout Christian but as part of his identity, his values and worldview are deeply rooted in Christian culture. Among his many works, his Christian worldview is evident in The Ambassadors. He implicitly depicts the Christian worldview by figuratively portraying the characters of the Bible. In particular, he associates Jesus Christ and his crucifixion with the main character Strether who reflects the suffering of self-denial and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, which constitutes the main frame of the Christian worldview. In doing so, James criticizes the collapsed morality and duality of the Newsomes and Waymarsh like Pharisees, pointing to the limits of the value of the dualistic, narrow-minded Wollett, which is dominated by moral absolutism. Finally, he emphasizes the necessity of moral relativism, not the absolute moral standard, by suggesting the necessity of flexible way of thinking through Strether’s final decision which is different from Jesus.

AB  - Park Wan-seo's novels on old age are summed up into an inclusive worldview of symbiosis and coexistence, focusing on research on dementia in old age, which focused on early works, or works that gained public popularity in the 2000s. In the gap between timely and content studies, her later work "Ppalgaengi Virus" was classified as a study of war novels, and the late-life history of the novel was not properly evaluated. Therefore, this study aims to examine new aspects uniform to Park Wan-seo's novels on old age while referring to Edward Said's lateness.The process of searching for differences from existing novels by analyzing them in the same order as the novel reveals the political nature of the differences contained in the present. This means that there is the (im)possibility of resolution of the subject represented by each person.In Park Wan-seo's later work, the characters representing women, motherhood, and old age have broken conventional wisdom to go against readers' expectations with a realistic and self-centered attitude. In their confessions, issues of reconciliation, forgiveness and sensation exist as impossible conditions for possibility. Finally, the narrator who remembers the memory of the murder of the family due to war realizes the weight of the historical wound that has the same identity as the three characters and the social other but cannot be connected with anyone.As such, Park Wan-seo's “Ppalgaengi Virus” is outside the conclusion of a positive synthesis, consistent with the expectations that the reader has because of her lateness. Above all, this novel portrays the dissonance of life, representing the unreasonable and difficult events of everyday life and death. Accepting continuous change as a writer, like life in old age, is the reason Park Wan-seo's “Ppalgaengi Virus” should be accepted as a late style.

AB  - Land cover classification plays a crucial role in the detection of changes (such as cities, forests, vegetation changes) and the extraction and analysis of information. However, traditional land cover classification methods always spend a lot of time on data processing, which leads to inefficient production of classified products. Furthermore, most of the existing methods rarely consider the application of the sample in time, especially the lack of basic data for building long time series. In this study, we used historical high-precision classification data to create a sample set to train the classifier on the Google Earth Engine, we applied the classifier to other years in the same region. To some extent, the classifier's expansion in time is realized. The classified data mainly comes from the Landsat satellite series data available by Google Earth Engine. The classification effect is evaluated by the confusion matrix, and the results show that the overall accuracy exceeds 93.0% and kappa coefficient is 0.9.the accuracy of other years is also higher than 85% it shows that we have a better and stable realization of sample migration and the expansion of classifier in time.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Land Cover Change Detection of Bostanlik District, Uzbekistan
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the change detection analysis of two multispectral datasets for the Bostanlik District of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, using Landsat-5 TM data for 1989 and Landsat-8 OLI for 2017. Both supervised classification and maximum likelihood algorithms were utilized for the change detection analysis. Six land use classes were identified: snow cover, bare soil/rock, forest, waterbody, built-up areas and agriculture. The change detection technique showed that within 28 years, significant changes occurred in the classes of the forest, built-up areas, bare soil and snow cover. The presented results might be valuable for the government authorities and stakeholders for future land use planning activities.

AB  - DEMNAS is a combination of multi DEM from TerraSAR- X, IFSAR, ALOS PALSAR, and mass point. It has a spatial resolution 8 m. The problem that arises now is whether the DEMNAS is in the form of DSM or DTM. This study aims to obtain information related to whether the DEMNAS is in the form of DSM or DTM. This research involved data from DSM LIDAR, DTM LIDAR, and DSM SRTM to see comparisons with DEMNAS in the South Kalimantan region. In addition, it also examines the comparison of DEMNAS with DSM IFSAR, DTM IFSAR, and DSM SRTM in the Central Java region. The way that is done is that all these DEMs are equated with height reference fields to EGM2008. The next process is to extract height points on the polygons created in each DEM used in this study. After that, it is done profiller in the form of making a height profile pattern for each DEM. The results obtained were in the form of known DEM that had height errors, height differences in reference fields, and the form of DEMNAS. The form of DEMNAS in the South Kalimantan region is dominated by DSM rather than the DTM. In the Central Java region, the form of DEMNAS is not in the form of DSM and DTM. The use of DEMNAS for certain applications should be considered in the form of DEM whether in the form of DSM, DTM, or not both of them.

AB  - Time-series of satellite images have been used to identify and monitor land cover change. Long-term datasets are very useful to examine an area over a period and see what changes have occurred. It is not an easy task to develop satisfactory change detection algorithms due to the processing complexity and extraction of meaningful change pattern of interest. In an effort to find an appropriate approach for this challenge, this paper presents a harmonic model-based change detection method using time- series of satellite images. The proposed algorithm is based on the temporal profile over time for the long-term change rather than a temporary change. A harmonic model can characterize the temporal variability of land covers whose signatures exhibit seasonal trends since components of the harmonic function inherently contain temporal information about seasonal changes. Several experiments were conducted on a multi-temporal dataset of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) over the Korean peninsula, in the time interval of 2012-2016. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm has a great potential for monitoring land cover condition and annual long-term land-cover change over large regions.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The present study attempts to shed new light on Wang Yang-Ming’s(王陽明, 1472-1528) Mind-Heart Learning(心學) by using “empathy” as a key word.In order to review Wang Yang-Ming’s Mind-Heart Learning with the keyword of “empathy,” the study will first examine the empathetic nature of “Liang-zhi(良知)”, which is the essence of Wang Yang-Ming’s Mind-Heart Learning. The concept of “Liang-zhi” is closely related to Wang’s organic worldview, in which he sees the entire universe as one whole organism.In Wang’s philosophy, “Ren(仁)” means the the will to life : the virtue of nature that provides the basis of the unimpeded communication of life force among all beings in the universe. Thus, his philosophy emphasizes that “Ren(仁)” is the ceaseless and dynamic life-generating foundation that serves as the fundamental life force and principle that pervades nature and human beings. According to Wang, Ren(仁), which is the principle of life that creates and nurture the whole universe of sky, earth, and nature, is an innate quality of all human beings who exist as part of the nature. In this context, empathy can be seen as an essential feature that characterizes Wang’s Mind-Heart Learning(心學). According to Wang, there is a close relation between human nature and various emotional states or feelings which modern psychology or counseling psychology mainly deals withanxiety, worry, pleasure, enjoyment, and sense of security. By making a close connection between the realization of good nature and emotion, Wang can be said to have integrated The essence of human nature and the essence of heart. In this way, his philosophy argues that people are led to act morally not by obligation or enforcement imposed on them by others but by vitality and joy belonging to the innate quality of human heart.Based on this basic understanding of “empathy” in Wang’s Mind-Heart Learning(心學), the present study will bring to the fore some aspects of empathy such as moral sensibility, driving force for self-fulfillment, integrated intelligence, and practical ways to realize innate goodness.

AB  - This research is the way in which the Art Deco period reflects the Aesthetic in Taoism and verify that the Art Deco fashion represent the Taoistic physical and spiritual world view. The research demonstrates that the Art Deco style from the interaction Taoistic artistic spirits occurring a century ago and suggests another view of analyzing Art Deco fashion. The research through fashions in 1920s and 1930s when Art Deco style flourished and the methodology includes both literature search and case study. Reviewing related books, relics and preceding researches, I described the concept and origins of Art Deco, defined the concept and scope of the modernism and concluded that the Aesthetics of Art Deco connects to the Taoistic philosophy. The Art Deco style which widely flourished between World War 1 and World War 2 was actively accepted among styles which were broad and diverse due to the historical reasons of the time. The Art Deco style was the major design trend in European and American art and architecture for 10 years between two World Wars. The name "Art Deco" has been used since 1960s when the style was first revived. Art Deco style was known as the Modern style in its golden days in 1920s and 1930s. The practical, broad and popular style spreaded to every life in European countries especially in France, focusing on the practical aspect rather than the aesthetic aspect. The decorative art movement succeeding and developing Art Nouveau style when the massive system evolved began at the international exhibition held in Paris in 1925 and reached its zenith at the time when it widely spreaded in various ways influencing as far as America. The art trend in Europe becoming popular in the 20th century such as Jugendstil in Germany, Art Nouveau in France, Modern style in UK and De Stijl in Netherlands have a common feature as follows. Since text, painting and graphic designs are created in one decoration, literature and formative art are combined in the new way and are given as a decorative totality which cannot be separated to spectators and readers. In this period, the art feature of the turning point of a century transcending the nation used decoration as the universal means of forming organized totality. The decoration combined individual, the power and strength of lines embedded in the Taoistic art around Japan motivated the European art creating the new aesthetic. The aesthetic of line existing in Japanese art was enough arise the new awareness of the beauty for the Western artists of the time and provides the recognition of returning to the nature to the Western people losing the humanity in the industrial society which are exactly the same as the Taoistic art spirit. Art Deco means the practical, broad and popular style focusing on the practical aspect rather than the aesthetic aspect, and many scholars define the "simple and functional articles" of the Art Deco style as modernism. Modernism is the cultural variant secondarily created by the introduction of value of relative philosophy of the Eastern culture into the West. In addition, modernism makes the expression by the means of reduction. The purpose of expression of the design aims to the immaterial, paradox and converging properties which can be explained with the Taoistic worldview.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to find out how to change the perception of death of modern Koreans through the historical view of ancient Koreans in ancient Korean history books. Ancient history books for review are Samguk-Sagi(三國史記) and Samgug-Yusa(三國遺事). As a methodology, I examined ‘sasaeng(死生)’, the use of ‘saengsa(生死)’, the ideology of the soul and the afterlife to recognize the state after death and where the soul lives.As a result, the term ‘sasaeng’ is used more frequently than ‘saengsa’ in ancient Korean times and preceded the era. The idea of ​​the soul after death is divided into ‘yeong(靈)’ and ‘hon(魂)’, ‘gui(鬼)’, ‘sin(神)’ etc. In the case of the afterlife, the Confucian and Buddhist post-mortem worldview prevailed more than ideas such as shamanic otherworld and Taoist fairyland. In other words, Samguk-Sagi emphasized the temporal view of Confucian scholars, and Samgug-Yusa reflected Confucian view with the rebirth and paradise of Buddhism. Therefore, it can be seen that there are complex aspects of ancient Korean thinking that are stratified and stratified by the difference in the perception of the Confucianism and Buddhism.

AB  - Recent concerns of the global system have focused on climate change and rising sea levels directly related to glacier loss from global warming. Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations enable us to provide dramatic changes over a very wide swath of the glacier. Although differential radar interferometry (DInSAR) can estimate very accurate glacier movement, it is often suffered from a loss of coherence due to significant temporal and volume decorrelation. Hence, we used intensity offset tracking, which is capable to apply even if the displacement is large, using estimation of the displacement between the two adjacent areas determined by the cross-correlation of the amplitude between two SAR images. In this study, ice velocity of Narssap sermia was observed by using TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X X-band SAR images. We acquired 39 images which were collected in the stripmap mode at ascending direction, VV polarization, and incidence angle of 21.4 degree. The multi-temporal observations of the ice velocity changes using SAR data collected over about a year will be presented. These estimated ice velocity maps, obtained with the almost 11-day temporal baseline, are used to examine the effect of seasons and locations.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Understanding on Saṁkya philosophy over Indian ideas is very important second to Vedanta. If the real features of the human-beings are atman with eternity and ultimate existence, atman which is a nature of personal existence should be pure mind like brahman and vimoka state without changing all the times. To answer these questions, the structure of personal existence should be analyzed and the nature of atman should be understood. The interest of Indian philosophy is in ‘self.’ There is a mind which is a center of everything in the human mind, and this can be the fundamentals of Psychology and Ethics.The Saṁkhya philosophy, like Buddhism, sees the world as suffering. The primary purpose of Saṁkhya philosophical thinking is to overcome this suffering. Like Buddhism, this world view tends to grasp the world by focusing on the observation of human psychological phenomena, a psychological worldview based on the experience of yoga like Buddhism.At the same time, Saṁkhya recognizes triguṇa, the reality of being an everlasting self, indicating the decisive difference from Buddhism. And to understand the fundamentals of Saṁkhya, this is explained by the two metaphysical principles of triguṇa and prakriti. Prakriti consists of three kinds of triguṇa. Skhandha of Buddhism represents our body and mind, or any material or spiritual things that contain them, in five bundles. It is the view of Buddhism that all living things, especially the human beings, are composed of these skhandha. This is a physiological classification and psychological classification at the same time.

T2  - Korean Language and Literature in International Context
T2  - 국제어문
M3  - research-article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to clarify how the early literary criticism of Yum Sang-sup is perceived. The discussion is divided into three parts. First, following the Gaesong theory, Yum Sang-sup can be seen agonizing at the end of various investigations into the art problem of his ambivalent times. The extreme and idealistic theory of personality creates a great disparity between reality and an uncompromising world view. The individualistic pursuit of art against the backdrop of a logic crisis and the dualistic circumstances created by colonial limits to individuality forms the main theme of his early criticism. Individualism becomes a paradoxical contradiction, but ambivalent perception helps to overcome the situation imposed by colonization. Second, he tries to integrate nationalism and socialist literary theory, but the alliance between nationalism and socialism is ironic. If the two are allied, they will result in ambivalence. It was necessary to embrace socialists in the interest of the purity of national literature, which includes anti-Japanese sentiments. On the level of integration, however, Yum Sang-sup, who stood in the position of the subject’s existence, is on the side of pure literature advocating literature itself, and as such, he looks for a solution for an ambivalent situation that involves political tendencies in fine arts.Third, following realist theory, he is in a dualistic position. The realist worldview constitutes a literary world in which the interests and representative events of the whole society are shaped through the personal experiences and trivial affairs of all people. It denotes realism in the sense that society as a whole is revealed through personal life. His logic emphasizes the transformation of the world into the union of. It is in agreement with seeing the reality of the present times as the ethics of the artist. However, in a free state, the ethics of the writer are in conflict with the Japanese ideology of empire. Therefore, in the Japanese colonial period, the literary theory of Yum Sang-sup takes an ironical view of colonial knowledge. In the end, the ironic perception of the initial criticism of Yum Sang-sup attempted to break through a dualistic situation. The process has evolved into a theory of individualism, compromise, and realism, while maintaining a dualistic perception.

AB  - NDSM (Normalized Digital Surface Model) is key information for the detailed analysis of remote sensing data. Although NDSM can be simply obtained by subtracting a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) from a DSM (Digital Surface Model), in case of UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data, it is difficult to get an accurate DTM due to high resolution characteristics of UAV data containing a large number of complex objects on the ground such as vegetation and urban structures. In this study, RGB-based UAV vegetation index, ExG (Excess Green) was used to extract initial seed points having low ExG values for region growing such that a DTM can be generated cost-effectively based on high resolution UAV data. For this process, local window analysis was applied to resolve the problem of erroneous seed point extraction from local low ExG points. Using the DSM values of seed points, region growing was applied to merge neighboring terrain pixels. Slope criteria were adopted for the region growing process and the seed points were determined as terrain points in case the size of segments is larger than 0.25 m2. Various slope criteria were tested to derive the optimized value for UAV data-based NDSM generation. Finally, the extracted terrain points were evaluated and interpolation was performed using the terrain points to generate an NDSM. The proposed method was applied to agricultural area in order to extract the above ground heights of crops and check feasibility of agricultural monitoring.

AB  - The article investigates the assumption that there is a correlation between the individual's psychological setting and political attitudes and the individual's attitude toward scientific information and the scientific community. In other words, the issue is whether the approvability of scientific data by the individual is essentially a subjective and ideological relationship between distinct scientific problems and relevant evaluative directives. I propose the following research guidelines: a) that the division of the political worldview into the conservative and the liberal reveals a propensity to explain away the political discourse as a set of opposites, and could be fine-tuned by means of neurophilosophical scepsis; b) wonders if there is a representation of science that could contribute to effective science policy-making c) also investigates if the intolerance to various political and scientific views in Western universities is solved by the considered correlation.

TI  - Identification of erosion-prone areas using modified morphometric prioritization method and sediment production rate: a remote sensing and GIS approach
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds from semiarid zones are sensitive to land degradation processes wherein the morphometric investigation is an important aspect to unwrap the susceptible areas. Hence it is a prerequisite for the assessment of erosional pattern of the watershed. Thus, based on the response to erosional processes, prioritization task has been undertaken for fourteen sub-watersheds from basaltic region of Western Ghats of India. A morphometry-based framework using weighted sum analysis (WSA) coupled with the remote sensing data, field data and topographical maps were generated on geographical information system (GIS) platform to estimate the soil erosion susceptibility. The study also evaluates the performance of this new methodology by considering the sediment production rate (SPR) of these sub-watersheds. The resultant WSA-SPR model has prioritized the study area into high, moderate low and very low categories. The high and moderate priority areas lie in the proximity of outlet, upper elevated and undulating terrain of the watershed. It represents 41.38% of the total area covering SW1, 3, 13 and 14 sub-watersheds. This study proposes a useful tool to define areas for planning the strategies to control soil erosion and promote soil conservation.

AB  - Precise quantification of land surface dynamics finds its way in various applications ranging from hydrological modeling to disaster management studies. The elevation accuracy of global DEMs generated though stereo images and interferometric techniques are prone to bias due to vegetation and built-up structure. Thus, the global elevation models depict the surface elevations rather than bare earth elevation. Recent advancement in point cloud processing from LiDAR has paved way for isolating ground points i.e., bare earth points from non-ground points, thus improving bare earth model generation. Point clouds generated through photogrammetric techniques from very high resolution stereo images has been a promising alternative to LiDAR data. The objective of this study is to understand the capability of point cloud data from spaceborne LiDAR and high resolution stereo images for creating accurate bare earth models for Indian region. This study employs point cloud obtained from ICESat mission and point cloud generated from high-resolution satellite stereo images from Cartosat-1 mission. Various parameters extracted from ICESat waveform were used to extract the bare earth footprints. Filtering techniques were used to extract ground points from photogrammetrically derived point cloud. The bare earth points were interpolated to generate DEM. Resultant DEM were compared to global DEM for elevation changes with respect to different land cover classes.

AB  - Land cover change detection is an important application of remote sensing data. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) image offers increased potential to detect and monitor changes in land cover over multitemporal images. This paper explores the use of unsupervised Normalize Difference Ratio (NDR) as the change index (CI) followed by supervised thresholding to extract binary mask for changed and unchanged areas. The datasets used for this experiment are UAVSAR fully polarimetric L-band images acquired on two different dates over Hayward, California, USA. The proposed change detection technique is compared with standard supervised techniques. The result indicates that the proposed NDR technique has a higher detection rate than the traditional Differencing techniques and PCCD techniques.

TI  - SHORELINE CHANGE MONITORING IN ATIKHISAR RESERVOIR BY USING REMOTE SENSING AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS)
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this study is to monitor shoreline changes of Atikhisar Reservoir in Canakkale, Turkey. Geographic information system (GIS) and remotely sensed multispectral Landsat satellite images for the period of 1975-2017 were used to determine the shorelines. Satellite imageries were processed and analysed by remote sensing and GIS software. Then satellite images were imported into GIS software and the shorelines were manually digitized by using visual interpretation techniques for evaluating temporal changes in the shorelines. As a result, total length of the perimeter was calculated 18.8km in 1975 while 23.1km in 2017. The shoreline has reached the minimum perimeter in 1985 and the maximum perimeter in 1998. Shoreline has fluctuated during monitoring period and maximum decrease has been observed in 1985 with 35.3% decline while maximum increase has been observed in 2009 with 55.6% increase. The shoreline presents a trend that has complex non sinusoidal waveform between the periods 19952000, 2002-2007, and 2009-2014. In the monitoring period, the shoreline has reached the negative peak in 1985, 1986, 2001, 2008, and 2014. It can be concluded that the shoreline has a trend that 6-yearly circle to reach positive and negative peaks. In conclusion, significant variations were detected in the shoreline. These variations could be affected by climate change, anthropogenic/agricultural activities, and sediment transportation. This paper provides the first knowledge and the most temporally rich assessment of shoreline changes in Atikhisar Reservoir. Therefore, continuous monitoring is vital for taking due precautions to support sustainable management of water resources in the future.

AB  - With the growing number of open source satellite image time series, such as SPOT or Sentinel-2, the number of potential change detection applications is increasing every year. However, due to the image quality and resolution, the change detection process is a challenge nowadays. In this work, we propose an approach that uses the reconstruction losses of joint autoencoders to detect non-trivial changes (permanent changes and seasonal changes that do not follow common tendency) between two co-registered images in a satellite image time series. The autoencoder aims to learn a transformation model that reconstructs one co-registered image from another. Since trivial changes such as changes in luminosity or seasonal changes between two dates have a tendency to repeat in different areas of the image, their transformation model can be easily learned. However, non-trivial changes tend to be unique and can not be correctly translated from one date to another, hence an elevated reconstruction error where there is change. In this work, we compare two models in order to find the most performing one. The proposed approach is completely unsupervised and gives promising results for an open source time series when compared with other concurrent methods.

TI  - Mapping Mountain Permafrost Landscapes in Siberia Using Landsat Thermal Imagery
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive development of South Yakutia, a mountainous area in the Russian sporadic permafrost zone, must be founded on knowledge about regional permafrost conditions. New permafrost maps for mountainous areas in South Yakutia (the Elkon Mountains and the Olekma-Chara Upland) are presented that provide a more detailed and updated description of permafrost distribution in the area than those that were hitherto available. These maps are based on the previously-developed and tested method of detecting permafrost and unfrozen ground using Landsat-5/TM satellite data with relatively high resolution. The method represents a scheme for permafrost identification based on a set of landscape indicators: terrain elevation, slope angle and exposition, vegetation, snow cover, and land surface temperature (LST). A correlation analysis of satellite data to full-scale field data has been carried out for the two areas under consideration. Indicator properties of LST obtained by Landsat-5/TM Band 6 Infrared have been characterized in detail for detection and regional mapping of permafrost. The effect of landscape factors (landscape cryo-indicators) on ground temperature and condition, frozen or unfrozen reflected in LST intensity, is demonstrated.

AB  - This paper demonstrates an approach to develop a prediction based model for forecasting Boro rice areas in the haor region of Bangladesh. Forecasting the rice areas can contribute in creating a centralized monitoring system for planning efficient storage and proper utilization methods. This leads to the development of proposing a new vegetation index (VI). The approach considers a new vegetation index combining NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI2 (Enhanced Vegetation Index 2) and OSAVI (Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index) for latest version MODIS (version-6) data. The method will forecast total Boro rice areas at the beginning of the Boro season (Dec-Jan) which is more than 3 months earlier from harvesting time without using any ground truth data. 3 Dimensional plotting method and k-Nearest Neighbor classifier have been used on only sowing period (Dec-Jan) data to predict Boro rice pixels. Our new VI has achieved an accuracy of 72%, recall 0:7020, precision 0:4183 and F-1 score 0:5175.

AB  - Remote sensing satellite images have not been thoroughly studied in agricultural sector of Bangladesh. This study demonstrates a rice model using the vegetation index (VI) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for predicting Boro rice areas in the Haor region of Bangladesh. Existing rice models are not compatible for the latest version of MODIS data. A new rice model with a better range of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) threshold has been proposed for MODIS version 6 and 5 data which provides better results of Boro rice area calculation also when evaluated with ground truth area the error rate reduced from 8.85% to 7.58% on version 5 and from 27.70% to 4.98% on version 6 estimation respectively.

AB  - During satellite data transmission, several schemes of unavoidable errors may be experienced by the ground receiver. In the case of LAPAN-A2 imagery, those errors account for the presence of byte-missing effect disordering the position of pixel location on received raw data. Processing raw data contaminated by the byte-shifting effect will produce a line-drop pattern covering the original image on a particular line. This work is aimed to develop line-drop correction algorithm applied on three different levels of LAPAN-A2 microsatellite imagery data. A quantitative analysis was also performed on corrected images to determine the most suitable correction method for LAPAN-A2 imagery. In the end, a comparison between the developed method and an existing method has been demonstrated. It is confirmed that the developed method is better than the existing method in terms of producing a better quality of corrected images and performing a faster computational task. The developed method can be used as a solution to avoid data re-transmission to recover clear image data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Space imagery provides a unique resource for addressing environmental challenges associated with land cover change, land use, disaster relief, deforestation, regional planning and global change research. At Ball Aerospace, we are developing the Compact Hyperspectral Prism Spectrometer (CHPS) as a candidate imaging spectrometer technology for insertion into future Sustainable Land Imaging missions. The 2013 NRC report Landsat and Beyond: Sustaining and Enhancing the Nations Land Imaging Program recommended that the nation should "maintain a sustained, space-based, land-imaging program, while ensuring the continuity of 42-years of multispectral information." In support of this, NASA's Sustainable Land Imaging-Technology (SLI-T) program aims to develop technology for a new generation of smaller, more capable, less costly payloads that meet or exceed current Landsat imaging capabilities. CHPS is designed to meet these objectives, providing high-fidelity visible-to-shortwave spectroscopic information. CHPS supports continuity of legacy Landsat data products, but also, provides a path to enhanced capabilities in support of land, inland waters, and coastal waters science. CHPS features full aperture full optical path calibration, extremely low straylight, and low polarization sensitivity; all crucial performance parameters for achieving the demanding SLI measurement objectives. In support of our space-borne instrument development, we have developed an airborne instrument to provide representative spectroscopic data and data products. Now in the final year of this 3-year development program, we have completed our initial engineering airborne flights and are beginning science flights. We present initial results from laboratory characterization & calibration and from our engineering flights and close with an overview of instrument performance.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SENSOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the spatiotemporally continuous distribution of PM2.5 concentration is of great significance for the research on atmospheric pollution. The effect of aerosol characteristics such as aerosol types was seldom considered in PM2.5 estimation in previous studies. In this manuscript, authors applied an aerosol classification-based method to generate ground-level PM2.5 concentration datasets in Xuzhou from 2014 to 2017. The coefficient of determination (R2) of aerosol classification-based model increases from 0.57 to 0.61 verified by ground station measurements, comparing to the empirical model. The results of spatiotemporal analysis show that the PM2.5 concentration has a slowly decreased trend in last three years, despite has an extreme high value in the winter of 2016 due to the heavy haze pollution occurred in Xuzhou. With regard to the spatial distribution of estimated PM2.5 over Xuzhou, there is a high-PM2.5 area anchoring over the urban district, while low concentration occurs in county town.

TI  - The Comparative Analysis of the Buddhism and Ancient Chinese Culture Principles
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The current paper elaborates the author's research of the Chinese classic philosophy by the means of the contemporary Epistemology language. It represents the comparative analysis of the principles of the Buddhism and the Chinese philosophy. Relative completeness of the Buddhism worldview and scholar systems before its spreading across the China allows to review only its key notions: causality (karma), discrete description of perception (dharma), the non-presence of the Self (anatma), the non-duality of illusion (samsara) and awakening (nirvana). The author argues the common idea that the principles of the Buddhism were radically different from the previous Chinese philosophical tradition. The argumentation grounds on the analysis of the classical Confucian texts that originated before the spreading of the Buddhism: "Zhou Yi", "Da Xue", "Zhong Yong". Such choice of the sources is because Confucian philosophy was the main opponent for the Buddhism in centuries, and such comparison is optimal to reveal their differences and similarities. The paper provides the analysis of the changes cycle (zhou yi), the investigation of things (ge wu) and sincerity (cheng yi). The result is revealing essential similarity of the ancient Chinese philosophy principles with the main ideas of the Buddhism. Thus, it is claimed that the spreading of the Buddhism across the China was not the alien worldview invasion, but the renewing of the culture in accordance with its foundational principles. The research is supported by the Sun Yat Sen University, Guangzhou, PRC.

TI  - SPECT-CT visualization of sentinel lymph nodes and lymph flow from tongue cancer
T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of the study was to determine distribution of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with tongue cancer. SPECT-CT visualization of sentinel lymph nodes was performed in 19 primary patients with clinically T1-2N0M0 tongue cancer. SPECT-CT acquisition started 60-120 min after peritumoral injections of 99mTc-nannocolloids (100-150MBq in 0.3-0.4ml). Finally we analyzed lymph flow patterns and localization of lymph nodes with radiocolloids uptake.Bilateral lymph flow from the tongue cancer was detected in 9 (47%) of 19 patients. In 6 cases bilateral pattern was associated with tumors less than 5mm from medial sulcus of the tongue. On the contrary, in 9 of 10 patients with lesions more than 4mm from medial sulcus we detected monolateral lymph-flow.In 4 (21%) of 19 patients SPECT-CT visualized sentinel lymph nodes only in groups Ib-Ila. Modeling of radiotherapy with with standard and lymph-flow guided radiation fields was performed on Eclips treatment planning station. It demonstrated that with lymph-flow guided strategy irradiated volumes can be reduced from 1224 cm(3) to 367 cm(3), dose to spinal cord can be reduced from 24,7Gy to 14.3Gy, medial dose to contralateral parotid gland - from 24,6Gy to 12,4 Gy.SPECT-CT with radiocolloids can be successfully used for visualization of lymph flow from the primary tumour and subsequent radiotherapy planning.

TI  - Preoperative SPECT-CT visualization of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with cervical cancer: preliminary analysis of the data
T2  - Voprosy Onkologii (St. Petersburg)
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: to determine preoperative SPECT-CT localization of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in women with cervical cancer.Materials and methods: SPECT-CT visualization of SLN was performed in 44 women with clinical stage IB-IIB cervical cancer. SPECT-CT examinations started 120-240 min after peritumoural injections of 99mTc-radiocolloids (200-300MBq in 0.4-1ml). All visualized LNs with uptake of radiocolloids were regarded as SLN. In all women we determined topography of SLN and lymph-flow patterns.Results: SLN were successfully visualized in 93.1% cases (41/44 women). The bilateral pattern of lymph flow was mentioned in 26 (63.4%), monolateral - in 15 (36.5%) cases. SLN localized in external iliac region in 25 (60.9%), internal iliac - in 14 (34.1%), obturator - in 22 (53.6%), presacral - in 1 (2.4%), common iliac region - in 21 (53,8%) cases. Uptake of radiocolloids in paraaortal lymph nodes was mentioned in 14 (34.1%) womenConclusion: SPECT-CT visualization of SLN can give important information for surgery and radiotherapy planning.

TI  - Carcinosarcoma of the breast: A case of breast conservation surgery and breast reconstruction.
T2  - SAGE open medical case reports
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Breast carcinosarcoma is an extremely rare, clinically aggressive tumor, and no standard treatment has been established. We report about a 34-year-old woman presenting with a 2.5-cm-sized carcinosarcoma in her right breast. She presented to our hospital for examination of this mass. Ultrasonography showed a hypoechoic mass with partially irregular margins. Fine-needle aspiration cytology indicated malignancy. No enlarged lymph nodes or distant metastases were detected. We diagnosed right breast cancer and performed partial mastectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and latissimus dorsi muscle flap transfer. Histological findings revealed that the tumor consisted of a mixture of an epithelial component and a mesenchymal component. The final diagnosis was carcinosarcoma. After undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the patient has had no recurrence, and her cosmesis is maintained. Clinical data of carcinosarcoma are insufficient. Breast conservation and reconstruction for carcinosarcoma may be suitable as local treatments; however, the most appropriate treatment method has not been established.

TI  - Speckle Noise Pedestal In The Spectra Of SAR Imagery Of The Ocean
T2  - OCEANS 2019 - MARSEILLE
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS - Marseille Conference
CL  - Marseille, FRANCE
AB  - The shape of the speckle noise pedestal inherent to the spectra of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery of the ocean is being analyzed on the basis of Canadian satellite RADARSAT-2 data as well as with numerical modeling. It was shown that in centrally symmetric SAR image spectra the pedestal is on average close to an elliptical cone with a slightly smoothed apex at the origin and a base with semi-axes lengths inversely proportional to nominal sizes of SAR resolution cell. This shape is retained both for longitudinal and transverse probing with respect to the direction ocean wave propagation. With increasing ocean wave intensity, the height of the speckle noise cone increases and, thus, the speckle noise energy is mostly concentrated in the low frequency region of the image spectrum, i.e. in the field of large ocean waves.

AB  - This article is aimed at forecasting the nature of the transition period of the international order, examining the intention of the Trump's “America First” policy on the backdrop of weakening of the “liberal international order(LIO)” and the position and status of Russia's sovereign internationalism emerging as an alternative to LIO and as a response to the transition period. Trump's “America First” policy is likely to be the product of strategic planning that inherits the traditional wisdom and strategic culture of “conservative internationalism,” one of the major trends in the history of US foreign strategy. The model of order that Russia has pursued as a response to the unilateral behaviors of the LIO is sovereign internationalism. It is closer to a partial revisionism rather than a “full-fledged” one in that it does not challenge the basic principles and core norms of the LIO, but insists on changing the way of its application and practice, claiming greater authority, leadership, and its share within LIO. The worldview and approach of sovereign internationalism are shared with BRICS, SCO countries, Iran and others. However, it is mainly limited to the spheres of international politics and security, and the role maintaining the norms and institutions in international trade, investment, and finance remains to be the share of the LIO. With this LIO playing a major role, it is expected that the transition period in which the alternative models of international order such as sovereign internationalism, mercantilist nationalism, and conservative internationalism would compete, conflict and coexist might be continued for a long time.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging plays an important role in surgery of patients with breast cancer andmelanoma. In this study, avidin (Av), a tetrameric protein glycosylated with mannose and N-acetylglucosaminemolecules, was labeled with 64Cu and then evaluated for LN imaging. 64Cu-Labeled NeutrAvidinTM (NAv), a nonglycosylatedform of Av, was used for comparison. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraaceticacid (DOTA)-conjugated Av and NAv were prepared from the corresponding proteins and DOTA-NHSester, which were then labeled with copper-64 and purified using PD-10 columns. The numbers of DOTAmolecules conjugated to Av and NAv were 4.9 and 3.3, respectively. [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-conjugated Av andNAv were prepared in 93% and 73% radiochemical yields, respectively. In vitro serum stability study showedthat copper-64 remained stable on all radiotracers for 24 h (>97%). MicroPET/CT images showed that highradioactivity was accumulated in LNs within 15 min after footpad-injection of radiotracers. Tissue distributiondata of mice demonstrated significantly higher uptake in the popliteal (PO) LN than lumbar (LU) LN for 64CulabeledAv (relative % ID/g excluding the injection sites: 66.2% and 26.0%, respectively) compared withthose of 64Cu-labeled NAv (43.0% and 49.2%, respectively). The results of this study suggest that mannosemolecules on Av enabled the radiotracer to retain in the first LN after mouse footpad-injection.

TI  - Receipt of sentinel lymph node biopsy for thin melanoma is associated with distance traveled for care
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is not routinely recommended for thin melanoma. However, it is considered when high-risk features, clinicopathological, or sociodemographic, are present. It was our objective to evaluate the impact of travel distance on decision-making for SLNB in thin melanoma. Methods We used the National Cancer DataBase (1998-2011) to identified patients with thin melanoma (<= 1 mm thickness). The primary exposure was distance traveled for care, categorized as short (<12.5 miles), intermediate (12.5-49.9 miles), or long (>= 50 miles). The primary outcome was receipt of SLNB. Results We identified 21 124 cases of thin melanoma; 48.8%, 38.2%, and 13.0% traveled short, intermediate, and long distances, respectively. Overall, SLNB was performed in 32.8% of patients. Traveling farther was associated with a step-wise increase in the likelihood of undergoing a SLNB (P-trend < 0.001). Even after adjusting for patient, disease, and facility factors, we found that patients who traveled an intermediate distance were 18% more likely to undergo a SLNB (OR:1.18; 95%CI: 1.10,1.27), and those who traveled a long distance were 24% more likely (OR:1.24; 95%CI: 1.11,1.39) compared with those who traveled a short distance. Conclusions The distance patients travel for surgical care appears to be an independent factor influencing the receipt of SLNB.

T2  - 한국지적정보학회지
M3  - research-article
AB  - The issues of invasive disturbance species are growing concern, however little is known about the distribution characteristics of invasive disturbance species in urban forests. In this study, we used Maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling with GIS layers and a time-series of Landsat 8 satellite imagery data to analyze the distribution pattern and potential occurrence of four invasive disturbance species, Ageratina altissima, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Bidens frondosa, and Pueraria montana, in Mt. Umyeon in the metropolitan area of South Korea. These plants have different species traits. The Maxent model performed well for the four species with an average test AUC value of 0.91 for A. altissima, 0.86 for A. artemisiifolia, 0.86 for B. frondosa, and 0.88 for P. montana. Distance from trails had the greatest effects on the occurrence probability of all four invasive disturbance species, and it exerted a negative influence, indicating that urban forest trails help spread invasive disturbance species. Of the remote sensing-based predictors used, Aug 7 2016 Tasseled-Cap soil brightness index was an important variable for A. altissima, which showed the largest potential distribution area in the study area. In addition, the occurrence probability of A. altissima had high and moderate correlation with those of other species (r=0.59–0.82), indicating niche overlap. These results can be useful for understanding and mapping invasive disturbance species for the management of natural resources and biodiversity conservation.

AB  - In this article, I would like to trace the process in which personal consciousness came into being in the Chosun society before and after the opening of ports under the influences of western thoughts inclusive of Catholicism and Protestantism. In the birth of personal consciousness the intensive process was reflected in which the status-based Chosun society had been stirred and in which the people had begun to claim more rights for freedom, equality, property, etc.I think it is crucial to simultaneously grasp two aspects in the process of shaping personal consciousness in the following: 1) the neo-Confucian ideology that had supported the status system in the Chosun society was criticized from the inside, so that the platform could be prepared on which all people should be regarded as equal; 2) the consciousness appeared that each person should be respected as the subject of independent judgment and action. In order to analyze these two inter-related sides of personal consciousness, I make an intellectual-historical approach to the thoughts of the intellectuals in which they have articulated their own concepts of personal consciousness.Even before the opening of ports, personal consciousness sprouted in the thoughts of Jung Yak-Yong, Choi Han-Ki, Choi Je-U, etc. They felt themselves challenged by the Catholicism and western civilization. They implicitly criticized the neo-Confucian worldview and attempted to settle new philosophical or religious basis for understanding a person and reforming the Chosun society. Jung Yak-Yong interpreted the concept of perseverance in Zhongyong in his own singular way, so that he could grasp a person as the autonomous subject of ethical judgement and action. In his own Qi-based philosophy Choi Han–ki interpreted Qi as communicating and life giving power and presented ethics of community in which all people are equal and cooperative. The founder of Donghak religion, Choi Je-U, embraced the profound thought that each person bears and serves to Got in his heart and that he should carefully see into his own heart. In this way he established a very high level of personal consciousness and gave a solid ethical foundation for respecting human dignity.After the opening of the port, western ideas and civilization were introduced in earnest. Young generations of elites who had studied and observed western thoughts and institutions in overseas wanted to reinforce national sovereignty through establishing civil rights. Yu Kil-Chun, who had developed systematic discourses on freedom and equality of individuals, demanded that individual rights be guaranteed by laws. According to him it must be the greatest responsibility of the state to protect individuals' body, life and property by laws. The Christian converts and intellectuals like Soh Jai-Pil and Yun Chi-Ho insisted on that the ruling ideas and institutions should be radically changed in order to strengthen the country. For them it must be the starting point of all reforms to recognize and guarantee individual freedom and rights. Even the lay people, who had converted to Protestantism, showed deep consciousness of innerness. They felt themselves as persons standing before God (person coram Deo). As such a person everyone should make a right relationship with God and his neighbors. In this respect, the meaning of repentance and confession of sin and guiltiness at the times of the great revival must be newly illuminated.

AB  - In South Korea, forest fire occurrences are increasing in size and duration due tovarious factors such as the increase in fuel materials and frequent drying conditions inforests. Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the damage caused by forest fires byappropriately providing the probability of forest fire risk. The purpose of this study isto improve the Daily Weather Index(DWI) provided by the current forest fireforecasting system in South Korea. A new Fire Risk Index(FRI) is proposed in thisstudy, which is provided in a 5㎞ grid through the synergistic use of numerical weatherforecast data, satellite-based drought indices, and forest fire-prone areas. The FRI iscalculated based on the product of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code(FFMC) optimized forKorea, an integrated drought index, and spatio-temporal weighting approaches. In orderto improve the temporal accuracy of forest fire risk, monthly weights were appliedbased on the forest fire occurrences by month. Similarly, spatial weights were appliedusing the forest fire density information to improve the spatial accuracy of forest firerisk. In the time series analysis of the number of monthly forest fires and the FRI, therelationship between the two were well simulated. In addition, it was possible to providemore spatially detailed information on forest fire risk when using FRI in the 5㎞ gridthan DWI based on administrative units. The research findings from this study can helpmake appropriate decisions before and after forest fire occurrences.

TI  - Weekly Wage Exploration of Vocational Rehabilitation Service Recipients: A Quantile Regression Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earnings of people with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) in a labor market can be a useful indicator of the quality of employment, economic mobility, and the quality of life of people with disabilities. To develop a more complete picture of employment outcomes for people with disabilities, weekly wage was examined applying quantile regression technique. Rehabilitation Services Administration Case Service Report (RSA-911) data from FY 2014 was used for both Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and quantile regression analyses. Quantile regression technique allows us to analyze a set of exploratory variables at different quantiles of the weekly wage distribution in comparison with OLS estimation. Results suggest that the income disparity is significant, particularly at more extreme ends of quantiles, which is the lower or higher weekly wage distribution. Findings indicated that males earned more than females, individuals with no significant disability earned more than individuals with the most significant disability, individuals whose primary source of financial support is public support or family/friends/ other support earned less of their own income, and people with cerebral palsy or epilepsy earned more, and people with multiple-disabilities earned less than people with IDD. Moreover, the results indicate that the quantile regression estimates of demographics, disability types, significant disability status, and primary sources of financial support show different patterns of changes and consistent upward or downward trends across quantiles of weekly wage distribution in comparison with the OLS estimates. This study provides additional insight into the importance of understanding earnings and the variability that may be able to be addressed by targeted approaches by rehabilitation professionals and policymakers.

AB  - Earth's ionosphere responds dynamically over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales to changes in the magnetosphere and solar wind from above, and to neutral atmospheric dynamics from below. Determining the dynamics and coupling of Earth's magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere by vector magnetic field measurements at all altitudes is essential, as the field plays a major role in controlling the distribution of ionospheric plasma. It is difficult to measure the magnetic B-field, either locally or globally, at the altitudes of the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere (UMLT) where the transfer of energy and momentum between the plasma and neutral components of the system occur. The 118-GHz imaging magnetometer will measure all four Stokes parameters as a function of frequency about the Zeeman-split center of the 118-GHz molecular oxygen line. We are developing an array of fully-polarimetric millimeter-wave radiometer/spectrometers operating near 118 GHz. These low cost, low power, low mass polarimetric 118 GHz millimeter-wave array receivers do not require cooling to meet the sensitivity requirements. With digital spectrometers we will be able to integrate the complete end-to-end system. This work will enable a second generation small satellite mission with an off-nadir viewing instrument comprised of 120 such receivers (arranged so that each spot on the Earth is observed simultaneously by four receivers each) that will globally map the magnetic field in the mesosphere at 42-76 km altitude at a horizontal resolution similar to 100 km with 1-sigma error of 40-120 nT, in typical mesospheric temperature conditions.

AB  - In Big Gut, Jeju Island, many bonpul-i (shamanic myths) exist, wherein flowers are the core of the narratives. These bonpul-i share a structural typology that may be called the “mythology of flowers.” Cheonjiwangbonpul-i is the starting point of the “mythology of flowers,” which forms the narrative backbone of Jeju's shamanic mythology. Flowering is a representation of the order of world operations (i.e., the maintenance and preservation of life phenomena). The mythical events, the Daebyeol-wang who flourished flowers that took the otherworld and the Sobyeol-wang who changed the flower bowl that took this world, form the basis of the worldview of the shamanic myths in Jeju Island.Occupying the human world of Sobyeol-wang implies the mythical meaning of renewing the declining human world by utilizing the vitality represented by the flourishing flowers. The acts of mythical figures related to flowers are largely divided into the groups of 'producers and creators' and 'users and operators.' The decline and renewal of life phenomena, established by Sobyeol-wang (users and operators) who brought flowers that were made to bloom by Daebyeol-wang (producers and creators), are common themes that flow through the myth system of shamanism in Jeju Island.Such a pattern has been confirmed not only in the case of people who brought reincarnation flowers from the Seocheon Flower Field to revive life and settled as Godheads (e.g., Yigongbonpul-i, Sekyungbonpul-i, Munjeonbonpul-i, etc.), but also in the type of bonpul-i that is unrelated to flowers. The Chasabonpul-i and Menggambonpul-i are bonpul-i that deal with the beginning of another life beyond the phenomenon of death. Shamanism in Jeju Island expresses the recognition that the otherworld is the gateway to a new life through ritual procedures and bonpul-i. The precedent that rituals enable the renewal of life phenomena is provided in Chogongbonpul-i.The flower-life-world shows the same meaning orientation in the shamanic mythology of Jeju Island (i.e., the flower mythology). Flowers are a symbol of life. Life phenomena show different shapes according to world space, but the reality is that it is in a continuous line. Flowers are the essence of life. Flowers disappear, leaving fruit, and the seeds bloom again into life. The imagination that borrows from the plant ecology embodying the mystery of life, which is revived into countless lives by death, is the most specific way of showing the permanence of existence. Through the flowers that represent life phenomena, this world and the otherworld communicate, and life and death form a cyclical relationship. This imaginative structure convincingly suggests a way beyond life's finiteness, the way from death to life. The mythology of flowers is the mythical system of the bonpul-i, a tribute to life and a hymn of life embodied by bonpul-i's worldview.

TI  - Detection of forest fire in Menderes district using a superpixel segmentation based search method
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are one of the most affected natural disasters in our country. According to the forest statistics shared by the Ministry of Forestry and Water Management of Republic of Turkey, 3188 forest fires are occurred just in 2016 [1]. After each forest fire, detection of affected regions is crucial with regard to land management and fast planning. In this respect, remote sensing technologies have become a popular topic. In this work, detection of forest fire regions are investigated using multispectral images which are acquired by Sentinel-2A satellite. For the detection of forest fire regions, classical spectral indices are used. Additionally, a novel method with coarse-to-fine search strategy is proposed. Firstly, forest fire regions are coarsely detected, and detailed regions are detected efficiently using a fine search step. In order to evaluate spatial and spectral information together, a superpixel segmentation based approach is used for both coarse and fine search step. The experimental results of proposed method and other methods are obtained for the forest fire located in Izmir-Menderes region in 1 July 2017 [2]. Obtained results are compared using receiver operating characteristics and the proposed method is found to provide better detection performance than the other methods in the literature.

AB  - Introduction: Concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has been discussed during several last decades, because this idea seems perspective in terms of modern minimally invasive and organ-preserving era. However, this method has several limitations including complicated anatomy of gastric lymph nodes distribution and presence of skip-metastases.Materials and methods: 66 Patients with early gastric cancer, intermediate risk of lymph node metastases and technical possibility of ESD were included into our investigation. Patients were assigned to either ESD with sentinel lymph node biopsy (54 patients), or underwent distal gastrectomy or total gastrectomy with D1+/D2 lymphadenectomy (12 patients) by chance.Results: 56 (84,6%) Patients had at least one sentinel lymph node. 11 (16,7%) Patients with T1a-T1b had metastases in regional lymph nodes, 9 of them in sentinel lymph nodes (2 false-negative result). So, we calculated sensitivity of 84,6%. In one case, the metastasis was located outside the sentinel lymphatic basin, and in the other case, metastasis was detected in a patient with unlit lymph nodes.Conclusion: Today sentinel lymph node biopsy thechnique is considered as a well investigated and widly used method. The concept itself is promising for organ-preserving gastric cancer surgery.

TI  - DETECTION OF WATER BODIES USING OPEN ACCESS SATELLITE DATA: THE CASE STUDY OF KASTORIA LAKE IN NORTH-WESTERN GREECE
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Water bodies play an important role in the environment as their variations impact other natural resources and human assets. Particularly the study of inland lakes is a challenging task since it requires the involvement of various scientific principles. Remote sensing techniques and satellite data could provide valuable information regarding detection and monitoring of water bodies in the study of lakes and their surroundings, contributing to environmental and development issues. This paper concerns the wide area of Kastoria Lake (Lake Orestiada) in north-western Greece, an area of particular interest as the lake is included in the Natura 2000 network and is surrounded by diverse landcovers. Optical, open access satellite data derived from Sentinel-2 are being used and digital image processing techniques are applied in order to detect the water surface. The data are initially resampled to an identical resolution. Two water indices are calculated in order to delineate open water features eliminating the presence of soil and vegetation, as well as to enhance their presence in the optical imagery highlighting the water surfaces (even those of smaller size). Further digital processing concerns the creation of a water mask to extract the water information. Visual interpretation of the area using various band combinations and applying enhancement techniques is also being done, contributing to the detection study. Due to the spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 data, the water surfaces are discernible and the coastal areas around the water body are well delineated. Open access satellite data offer the ability to detect and map water surfaces effectively, which may be essential to a variety of scientific and civil applications. In general, the results are satisfactory at this stage and can be used for further monitoring of the lake with possible extensions to a wider region.

M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMicrosatellitosis (mS) in melanoma has been considered a marker of unfavorable tumor biology, leading to the current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging of IIIB/C/D disease, despite few investigative studies of this entity limited by the small sample sizes and incomplete nodal microstaging. We sought to better characterize outcomes and prognostic factors in a multi-institutional cohort of patients with mS and nodal microstaging.MethodsThe Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group cohort included 414 mS patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic significance of established clinicopathologic characteristics. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) of patients with mS was compared with 3002 similarly staged patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registry.ResultsThe median age of the mS cohort was 64.9years; 39.6% were female. Median thickness was 3mm, 40.6% of cases were ulcerated, and the SLN positivity rate was 46.7%. Increasing thickness, male sex, and SLN positivity were significantly associated with poorer MSS. Stage IIIB/C/D 5-year MSS rates were 86.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 79.4-93.3%), 54.1% (95% CI 45.4-59.7%), and 44.2% (95% CI 25.4-63.0%), respectively. MSS survival for the stage IIIB mS cohort was significantly better than a similarly staged SEER cohort (5-year MSS of 70.1%, 95% CI 66.0-74.2%), while no significant difference was observed for the stage IIIC or D cohorts.ConclusionsSLN metastases are common and are a significant prognostic factor in patients with mS. Survival in stage IIIB patients with mS was considerably more favorable than their stage would otherwise suggest, which has important implications for decisions regarding adjuvant therapy for patients with mS.

AB  - Ship wakes have crucial importance in the analysis of SAR images of the sea surface due to the information they carry about vessels. Since ship wakes mostly appear as lines in SAR images, line detection methods have been widely used for their identification. In the literature, common practice for detecting ship wakes is to use Hough and Radon transforms in which bright (dark) lines appear as peaks (troughs) points. In this paper, the ship wake detection problem is addressed as a Radon transform based inverse problem with a sparse non-convex generalized minimax concave (GMC) regularization. Despite being a non-convex regularizer, the GMC penalty enforces the cost function to be convex. The solution to this convex cost function optimisation is obtained in a Bayesian formulation and the lines are recovered as maximum a posteriori (MAP) point estimates with a sparse GMC based prior. The detection procedure consists of a restricted area search in the Radon domain and the validation of candidate wakes. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated in TerraSAR-X images of five different ships and with a total of 19 visible ship wakes. The results show a successful detection performance of up to 84% for the utilised images.

AB  - An estimated 1.5 trillion tons of methane (CH4) and CO2 are trapped underneath permafrost. Effective large-scale quantification of permafrost degradation is critical to characterizing permafrost melt risk. Thawing permafrost results in thermokarsts that contribute to surface roughness. This study investigated the potential of using fractal analysis of landsat images to quantify surface roughness of the image, to rapidly characterize and identify permafrost regions undergoing critical melting. Data and remote sensed images from the Anaktavuk river tundra fire of 2007 was used to establish baselines The study evaluated fractal dimensions of annual Landsat pictures of permafrost regions (n=62), and performed linear regression against the region's average annual thaw temperature. The results showed that fractal dimension correlates inversely with average thaw temperature (p-value = 0.006). The results reveal that surface roughness derived from remote sensed image analysis is a potential indicator of permafrost degradation. This approach presents the prospect to perform large scale permafrost monitoring.

AB  - Soil moisture is one of the most important components of ecological and hydrological models at different scales. This variable plays a key role in the exchange of water, energy, and carbon between land and atmosphere, and can be evaluated in order to examine the long-term impacts of climate change. Also, soil moisture is one of the factors affecting the formation of floods and is used to predict and monitor droughts. Soil moisture conservation is vital for increasing irrigation efficiency and protecting the vegetation. In spite of the great importance and high value of soil moisture data, it is not widely available because its field sampling is relatively expensive and it does not have a custodian in many developing countries that water and soil management are handled by different agencies. Field measurements have been subjected to many constraints. These limitations result in inaccessibility of data with acceptable accuracy and appropriate spatial distribution. The necessity of paying more attention to utilizing available technologies and tools to offset the traditional methods of collecting soil moisture data, is more pressing with increasing concerns about climate change. The objective of this study is to use a range of available tools from citizen science to satellite technology to generate soil moisture data with acceptable accuracy. Data provided by the first method has high spatial distribution and temporal variability, but it is suffering from subjectivity. Satellite data has high accessibility at no cost to the users, but its spatial resolution is not high and has to be downscaled. In this study, initial steps are taken to show how to deal with subjectivity errors, use of ground-based, and satellite data to provide soil moisture information for engineering applications.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mainstream treatment of breast cancer is radical mastectomy accompanied with Axillary Lymph Node Dissection (ALND). Lately, more conservative methods accompanied by adjuvant radiotherapy have been gradually replacing radical modalities. The Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) has been considered such a valuable alternative to surgery conservative approach.OBJECTIVE: To assess the agreement between SLNB in breast cancer patients and pathology results following ALND and to provide correlation between the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) anatomical topography and biopsy positivity according to SLNBs.METHODS: Two hundred female breast cancer patients (31 to 83 years of age) underwent partial or simple mastectomy with or without subsequent ALND. All patients were randomized against selection criteria and underwent SLNB.RESULTS: In a set of 200 patients, 96.3% presented identical results between SLNB and pathology. 36% of them were confirmed with positive SLN through both approaches. Regarding the SLN topographic anatomical position, 67.3% of samples were located in the front axillary position, 24.5% in the front thoracic position, whereas 6.1% was located in the central axillary position.CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the SLN topographic anatomical position and the pathology results, revealed that the majority of the SLN accumulates in the front axillary region. A larger patient population will statistically support this association.

AB  - Internal wave (IW) is a mesoscale phenomenon that has a significant role in the mixing and turbulent process in the ocean. Lombok Strait is well-known as a generation source of IW. Characteristics of IW in the Lombok Strait has been studied using satellite data, especially radar sensor or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Although the IW parameter well extracted and described from SAR imagery, however, the information related to the frequency of occurrence and its temporal distribution remains unclear because of the limited spatial and temporal resolution of SAR data used in previous studies. The unprecedented availability of SAR C-band images provided by the Sentinel-1A (S-1A) constellation offers the opportunity to propose a new approach of IW occurrence frequency in the Lombok Strait. In this work, 4-year consecutive period SAR images from S-1A satellite examined. IW occurrence frequency in the Lombok Strait has been distributed monthly and yearly. It is found that the yearly distribution of IW occurrence frequencies observed by S-1A images varies each year with the maximum frequency of 33% in the year 2015, implies that the large-scale processes can affect IW occurrence on S-1A images. The monthly distribution of S-1A observed IW occurrence frequency show the monthly variability with the high frequency occurs in March to September with the maximum frequency of 55%, and the low frequency occurs in October and February with a minimum frequency of 30%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality in large dams is becoming a necessity for protecting stored water from various forms of pollution. This process requires analysis of several samples on a weekly or monthly basis. Our study aims to determine the relationship between water quality parameters (WQP) and digital data from the Sentinel-2 satellite to estimate and map the WQP in the Bin El Ouidane Reservoir. The in situ sampling was carried out in the Bin El Ouidane Reservoir (Azilal Province), followed by analysis of physicochemical parameters in the laboratory. These measurement results were compared with the reflectance in each sampling location to investigate the correlations between bands and laboratory chemical analysis results. The correlation results showed that all studied parameters have an R-2 greater than 0.52, and they can be transformed to predictive models by stepwise regression. The accuracy of our proposed models was tested using the Oum Er-Rbia Hydraulic Basin Agency data, and the results showed that only three parameters yield admissible verification results (Chlorophyll A, dissolved Oxygen and Nitrate). Those models were then used in geographic information system software to produce a thematic map of each parameter over the entire surface of the reservoir. As a conclusion, the Sentinel-2 images could help indicate the eutrophication stage in the Bin El Ouidane Reservoir, which is a major risk in major Moroccan reservoirs.

AB  - ALOS-4 succeeds the concept of ALOS-2 and hence the system design of ALOS-4 satellite basically follows on that of ALOS-2, except for improvements in mission performance. The swath width is drastically improved in ALOS-4 by applying DBF (Digital Beam Forming) technique.DBFU (DBF Unit) is newly designed for ALOS-4 SAR sensor. In ALOS-4 system, receiving channels are divided into 6 sub-arrays in elevation, and received signals are converted into digital data independently by ADCs for DBF processing.In conventional radar systems, high frequency signals, such as L-band signals, are down-converted by local and COHO (COHerent Oscillator) signals by mixers in RF front-end to make sampling frequency lower. In DBF systems composed of multiple receiving channels, the number of local and COHO signals must be increased to match the number of channels.To overcome this issue, under sampling technique is applied. This technique allows band-pass filtered signals to be sampled at a rate below the Nyquist frequency of the target signal. With under sampling, COHO signals can be eliminated, so downsizing of H/W scale of DBFU can be achieved.This paper describes the under sampling system design result for ALOS-4.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with a conceptual representation of interrelated notions conscience and conscientiousness in the Russian language and culture that are viewed as interrelated cognitive phenomena reflected in the Russian verbs znat' - vedat'. Each concept is observed within a set of notions, images and values. Conceptualization of conscience is defined through self-evaluation of actions regarded as required and prescribed; its image is encoded in conceptual and biomorphemic metaphors that establish either moral or utilitarian rules of behavior by pointing to their correlation with an ideal judgment about personal relations. The notion of consciousness is described as meaningful existence, its worldview perception is associated with a container, a mirror or a living being, the value is referred to identification of personality. Conscience and conscientiousness are discourse specific, their moral-and-ethical aspect is discussed in everyday conversations, fiction, religious and mass-media spheres whereas rational-and-philosophical issues are predominantly touched upon in scientific and pedagogical communication. From the perspective of rationality conscience is explained in terms of consciousness, moral awareness, a logical system of concepts viewed as a fragment of the world perception. Contradiction between two concepts under study is characterized in terms of antinomy "Mind :: Heart", it strengthens the inner personality by language conceptualization of conscience and conscientiousness.

TI  - Assessment of water body change and sedimentation rate in Moulay Bousselham wetland, Morocco, using geospatial technologies
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal lagoons have significant biodiversity and ecologic and socio-economic interest. Several resident and migratory birds live in coastal lagoons as well as fish and other aquatic biota. Over the years, lagoons worldwide have been subject to considerable sediment deposition coming especially from soil erosion due of agricultural activities, and the lagoon's inflows have resulted in an accelerated sedimentation which can drastically affect the aquatic ecosystem balance. A new, fast, and cost-effective approach was developed, using water surface change as a proxy, to evaluate the sediment deposition rate. In the current research, this methodology was applied in the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon in Morocco, and a combination of Landsat 8 and Landsat 5 imagery acquired at four points in time over 30 years (1985-2015) was used. Following geometric correction and enhancement, the interpretation of the acquired images provided important insight on the current conditions of the water surface change using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Several iterations were done to determine a suitable threshold for effective water surface detection. In order to validate the automatically extracted water surface features, many band combinations of Landsat and Sentinel 2 were used as references to run the accuracy assessment. The results show that the Moulay Bousselham Lagoon lost 17.60% (106 ha) of its water surface area, and 530,000 m(3) to 1,060,000 m(3) of its water volume during the last three decades. Converting water surface loss into sedimentation returned a rate of 0.58 cm/yr. These results have been confirmed by previous field work using sedimentological approaches. Proper management should be applied to sustain the vitality of this lagoon environment.

TI  - Satellite Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll and Secchi Depth for Monitoring Lake Water Quality - A Validation Study

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Satellites that capture large areas with high spatial and temporal resolution allow extensive analyses of water bodies and thus represent an ideal supplement to existing in situ point measurements. In the joint project WasMon-CT (Water Monitoring of Chlorophyll and Turbidity) the usability of satellite data for official monitoring of flowing waters and lakes was examined. The subproject at the Institute for Lake Research of the LUBW focused on satellite-based monitoring of chlorophyll a, an important indicator for water quality, in lakes.Freely available data from spatially reasonable high-resolution satellites, e.g. Sentinel-2, open up new possibilities for monitoring the water quality of a larger number of small lakes. The aim of the comprehensive validation study presented here was to get information about applicability and potential limitations of remote sensing techniques for different types of lakes. EOMAP processed the satellite data used in the validation (Sentinel-2/3, Landsat 7/8 and MODIS) by applying its Modular Inversion and Processing System MIP.Results extracted from satellite data between 2000 and 2017 were compared with in situ measurement data of about 20 lakes in Baden-Wuerttemberg, including Lake Constance, for water quality parameters such as chlorophyll a and Secchi depth. First results of the validation study show that in general the statistical values, e.g. annual mean values of in situ and remote sensing retrieved chlorophyll a and Secchi depth data, agree well, but some systematic differences occur. Further validation and data interpretation steps take into account methodical differences as well as time differences between in situ and satellite measurements.

AB  - One of the troubles that often arise at processing raw satellite data is the appearance of stripes on the received image. The presented paper regards the sources of the stripes and analyses some possible ways of stripes correction. A new method based on statistical compensation of brightness shifts is suggested. The suggested method does not take into account the nature of the reflecting objects, but allows fast and easy correction of striped raw data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Yokohama, JAPAN
AB  - This paper presents a fusion method generating unobservable sharpened hyperspectral remote sensing data with high spatial and spectral resolutions. This method, related to linear spectral unmixing (LSU) techniques, and based on nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), introduces Joint-Variables NMF (JVNMF) for fusing observable low spatial resolution hyperspectral and high spatial resolution multispectral data. It optimizes a joint-variables criterion that exploits spatial and spectral degradation models between the two considered images, and therefore considers a reduced number of unknown variables. This approach, called Grd-JVNMF, is a gradient-based method and uses iterative update rules. The proposed method is applied to realistic synthetic and semi-real data, and its effectiveness, in spatial and spectral domains, is evaluated with established performance criteria. Experimental results show that the proposed Grd-JVNMF method yields multi-sharpened hyperspectral data with good spectral and spatial fidelities. These tests also show that the proposed method outperforms tested literature ones.

TI  - ORGANIZATION OF THE SYSTEM OF GEOINFORMATION MONITORING THE LAND RESOURCES IN NOVOSIBIRSK BASIN SHORE ZONE
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Relevance of the research is caused by the fact that modern organization of infrastructure objects, industrial and economical complexes must be secure, ecologically and economically efficient. The article states the problem of system organization in rational use and control for water reservoir conditions applying geotechnologies and Earth's remote sensing systems. The territory of the Novosibirsk Basin (Russia, the Novosibirsk region) is considered as the object of the research. On the territory under investigation there is the deterioration of ecological situation as a result of wind-and-wave erosion of shore lines and intensive wash-out of soils, vegetation, trees and chemical agricultural fertilizers etc. into the water. The article substantiates the introduction of the term - technogenic natural territorial complexes. The Earth's remote sensing data define soil erosion velocities along the whole length of the water basin shore line. On the basis of the research we made a forecast model of shore line destruction. The spots of geodynamic monitoring are settled and the observation frequency is determined. The authors drawn the conclusions on the necessity of shore line stabilization, as well as more intensive involvement of the water basin territory into recreational activity.The aim of the research is to develop the geoin formation system for monitoring land resources of basin shore zone, on the example of the Novosibirsk water basin territory.Objects: land resources of the Novosibirsk water basin shore zone.Methods. When solving the tasks we used both general research methods (system analysis, synthesis, observation, comparison, measurement, generalization), and special research methods (monitoring of environment and land conditions with the use of Earth's remote sensing data, digital cartography method and geoinformational analysis and modelling).Results. The authors developed technological scheme of geoin formational monitoring the system organization for technogenic natural territorial complex - water basin. The authors built the forecast gradient model of water basin shore line displacement velocities. On the basis of the analysis of this model the authors determined the list of real estate objects which will be destroyed in the result of wind-and-wave erosion development.

AB  - This research aims to evaluate a histogram matching based custom mosaicking process on different land cover land use characteristics using multi-temporal satellite images. Three different study regions located in different parts of Turkey are selected and SPOT 6/7 satellite images belonging to these regions are used in analysis. Reference histogram data obtained from 2018 dated Sentinel 2 mosaic of Turkey. This dataset is used for histogram matching after conducting post process to enhance the visual representation of the study region. Feathering effort is operated on the target images after histogram matching step in order to eliminate dissimilarities between geometric shapes and introduce seamless transition in overlapping areas. Accuracy assessment is performed both by visual interpretation and by calculating the weighted average of differences between reference and matched histograms. Results proved that, histogram matching based method proposed in this study provides practical and efficient mosaicking approach, which can be used for producing high-resolution and large coverage satellite image dataset.

TI  - Assessment of chlorophyll and water quality using remote sensing and GIS imagery in the Cauvery watershed of Karnataka, India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - India has vast inland water resources having immense potential for aquaculture. Assessment of water quality parameters is a pre-requisite to any scientific intervention as they are of prime importance in fisheries perspective. However, monitoring water quality parameters of such vast area is not an easy task with the conventional tools and methods. In the present study, water quality parameters and chlorophyll pigment concentration were assessed using IRS P-6 remote sensing imagery in the Cauvery watershed of Karnataka State, India. Images captured by optical satellite sensors are often obscured by atmospheric effects. Hence, the images were rectified by Dark pixel subtraction method before analysing data in order to extract useful information from the imagery. The study revealed that there was significant correlation between spectral reflectance and in situ water quality parameters. Near infra-red band (0.77-0.86 mu m), was useful to assess the water quality parameters like depth, specific conductivity, total alkalinity, chlorinity, salinity and turbidity. Similarly, short wave infrared band (1.55-1.70 mu m) was useful for assessing chlorophyll-a. However, the models were found to be region specific and they appear to have potential for monitoring water quality of large water bodies at regular intervals.

TI  - Impact of parity and litter size on dairy traits in Istrian ewes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CENTRAL EUROPEAN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the influence of parity and litter size on dairy traits in Istrian ewes. The following traits were analysed: lactation milk yield, daily milk yield, fat yield, fat content, protein yield, protein content, lactose yield, and lactose content. Lactation records (n = 6,481) collected on 2,786 ewes were analyzed using a statistical model adjusted for unbalanced data structure accounting for all the available sources of phenotypic variability. Parity had a statistically significant effect on all the investigated traits (P<0.01, P<0.001). Lactation milk yield, daily milk yield, protein yield, and lactose yield peaked in 3rd , fat yield, fat content, and protein content in 4th, and lactose content in 2nd lactation. Litter size had a significant effect on all the investigated traits (P<0.01, P<0.001) except the fat content (P<0.05). Multiple litters led to higher yields of milk and all the examined dry matter components. The results of the study should contribute to better understanding of the phenotypic variability of some economically very important dairy traits in ewes.

T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article proposes a reflection on the content of a new popular science publication in philosophy, a book by A.L. Nikiforov entitled "Philosophy for the curious". The main philosophical problems obtaining the coverage in the book are: philosophy, its features and categories, types of world view, argumentation theory, being and cognition, man and society, the meaning of life, death and immortality. The book expresses A.L. Nikiforov's original author's philosophical position, uses language accessible for a wide range of readers, and calls for reflection on the most important issues of human existence. The particular role of popular philosophy consists in the endorsement of an intellectual public space - the social environment maintaining human development, independent thinking, engagement in dialogue and responsibility for personal decisions. In this regard, the popularization of science and philosophy as its part plays an important cultural function, contributing to raising the general level of education of the population, creating conditions for self-realization of personality creative potential.

T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 10th WESTPAC International Scientific Conference
CL  - Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Better forecast of tropical cyclone (TC) can help to reduce risk and enhance management. The TC forecast depends on the scientific understanding of oceanic processes, air-sea interaction and finally, the atmospheric process. The TC Viyaru is taken as an example, which is formed at the end of 11 May 2013 and sustains up to 17 May 2013 during pre-monsoon season. Argo data are used to investigate ocean response processes by comparing pre- and post-conditions of the TC. Eight oceanic parameters including the sea surface temperature (SST), the sea surface salinity (SSS), and the barrier layer thickness (BLT), the 26 degrees C isotherm depth in the ocean (D-26), the isothermal layer depth (ILD), the mixed layer depth (MLD), the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) and the effective oceanic layer for cyclogenesis (EOLC) are chosen to evaluate the pre- and post-conditions of the TC along the track of Viyaru. The values of the SST, D-26, BLT, TCHP and EOLC in the pre-cyclonic condition are higher than the post-cyclonic condition, while the SSS, ILD and MLD in the post-cyclonic condition are higher than the pre-cyclonic condition of the ocean due to strong cyclonic winds and subsurface upwelling. It is interesting that the strong intensity of the TC reduces less SST and vice versa. The satisfied real time Argo data is not available in the northern Bay of Bengal especially in the coastal region. A weather research and forecasting model is employed to hindcast the track of Viyaru, and the satellite data from the National Center Environmental Prediction are used to assess the hindcast.

T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) are malignant tumors that most often occur in the salivary glands and bronchi, with occurrence in the breast being rare. ACCs of the breast reportedly give rise to few lymph node metastases or distant metastases and have a favorable prognosis. A 56-year-old woman with a left breast mass identified by mammographic screening was examined at our institute. Breast ultrasound revealed a sharply marginated, hypoechoic mass 12.7 x 9.4 x 8.7 mm in size in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast, and a vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) was performed at the mass site. Pathological examination of the VAB specimen revealed atypical cells with a cribriform growth pattern, and mucosal fluid surrounding tumor nests and within tumor ducts. The area around the tumor nests and inside of tumor ducts were also positively stained with alcian blue. These findings, we reached a pathological diagnosis of ACC. The preoperative diagnosis was stage I (cT1N0M0) triple-negative left breast cancer. Surgery consisted of breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy. The excised specimen was a 15.0 x 12.1 x 9.7 mm mass with a greyish white cut surface. Pathological examination of the excised specimen revealed a so-called adenoid cystic pattern. Results from immunohistochemical staining were identical to those from a VAB specimen, as they were estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptors-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, with low Ki67 expression. The final diagnosis, given the above findings, was left breast cancer (ACC) pT1N0M0 stage I triple-negative subtype.

AB  - Satellite data were used to study changes in the Antarctic ozone hole (AOH) in 2014 and 2015. The formation of AOH is probably caused by the ozone mass transport from the polar areas to the mid-latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere. In November-December, the AOH is filled with the ozone moving from the mid-latitudes. In 2014, the ozone masses moving from the Polar region to the mid-latitudes and back were equal to each other, reaching over 70 million tons. No signs of ozone destruction were found in September-December 2014. In 2015, the difference between the ozone masses reached 70.9%. The most likely reason for this was the destruction of the stratospheric ozone by the products of the eruption of Calbuco Volcano in Chile.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: migration of the Ob Ugrians in the territory of their residence, in particular, to the Lower Ob Region, is closely connected with women's mythological images. Study of the way of migration of the most revered goddesses reflects the historical development of events in the territory. The subjects of the analysis are folklore texts that confirm migration of the female deities. The theme of the article is relevant due to the lack of a special comprehensive research about the female deities of the peoples of the North in the scientific literature, and is also determined by the increased interest in the spiritual culture of the Ob Ugrians.Objective: to identify and describe the "wandering" female deities on the basis of historical sources and analysis of folklore texts.Research materials: folklore texts published in different collections, historical sources of famous Russian and foreign ethnographers, and field materials of the author.Results and novelty of the research: the article analyzes historical sources and folklore texts about the movement of patron spirits, reflecting the process of development of new territories, which allowed to confirm the "nomadic character" of the female deities. The novelty of the article lies in the fact that using own field materials the author introduces in scientific use something new related to the female deities of the Ob Ugrians in the concept "nomadic".

AB  - I found that V507 Cyg, IM Eri, and FY Vul are Z Cam-type dwarf novae and they showed sequences of standstill terminated by brightening, in contrast to fading as ordinary Z Cam stars do, followed by damping oscillation. These sequences are characteristic to IW And-type objects (also known as anomalous Z Cam stars). New additions to the IWAnd-type objects suggest that the IW And-type phenomenon is more prevalent among Z Cam stars. I suspect that the regularity of the pattern of the IW And-type phenomenon suggests a previously unknown type of limit-cycle oscillation, and I suggest that the standstill in these objects is somehow maintained in the inner part of the disk and that the thermal instability starting from the outer part of the disk terminates the standstill to complete the cycle.

AB  - Remote sensing techniques have been widely used for spatial assessment of soil properties. Traditional techniques involving soil sampling and laboratory analysis are expensive and labour intensive for large areas.High resolution remote sensing data and geographic information systems (GIS) were used for spatial characterization of soil properties in southeast Nigeria. Thesoil parameters investigated include soil texture, pH and drainage pattern. Thetexture, which indicates the sand, silt and clay content in the soil, showed that sandyclay and loamy sand are predominant for the areas investigated. The soils pH ranged from slightly acidic to strongly alkaline. The study has been specifically conducted to making adequate soil data available and acts as a reference for improving soil quality within the area.

Abstract Large herbivores influence ecosystem functioning via their effects on vegetation at different spatial scales. It is often overlooked that the spatial distribution of large herbivores result from their responses to interacting top-down and bottom-up ecological gradients that create landscape-scale variation in the structure of the entire community. We studied the complexity of these cascading interactions using high-resolution camera trapping and remote sensing data in the best-preserved European lowland forest, Bialowieza Forest, Poland. We showed that the variation in spatial distribution of an entire community of large herbivores is explained by species-specific responses to both environmental bottom-up and biotic top-down factors in combination with human-induced (cascading) effects. We decomposed the spatial variation in herbivore community structure and identified functionally distinct landscape-scale herbivory regimes (&ldquo;herbiscapes&rdquo;) which are predicted to occur in a variety of ecosystems and could be an important mechanism creating spatial variation in herbivory maintaining vegetation heterogeneity.

TI  - Malama na makua i na keiki me ka hano: Native Hawaiian Parents Caring for Their Children with Asthma (Part 2).
T2  - Asian/Pacific Island nursing journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: Native Hawaiian children have the highest prevalence of asthma among all ethnicities in Hawai'i. Malama Part 2 describes continuing research, exploring contemporary native Hawaiian parents' perspective, and experience of caring for their children with asthma in the context of uncertainty while living on the islands of Hawai'i, Kaua'i, Maui, Moloka'i and Lana'i. Design: Descriptive qualitative approach by means of directed content analysis using focus groups was applied to this study. Eight open-ended questions elicited asthma history, asthma management, and how the Hawaiian culture affects parents' health practices. Directed content analysis applied Mishel's Uncertainty in Illness Theory (UIT) to guide data collection, organization, and analysis. Sample: Thirty-three native Hawaiian parents with a child with asthma met in 9 separate focus groups during 2012-2015 on the islands of Hawai'i, Kaua'i, Maui, Moloka'i, and Lana'i. Results: The study's findings were congruent with the first Malama study results of focus groups on O'ahu. Contextual influences including indigenous worldview, cultural values, history, and assimilation and acculturation factors affected native Hawaiian parents' perceptions and experiences with conventional asthma care. Moreover, Hawaiian parents living on islands outside of metropolitan O'ahu reported geographic barriers that contributed to their uncertainty. Conclusion: Political action is required for comprehensive medical care, health education, and nursing services to be delivered to families living on all islands. Integrating Hawaiian cultural values, involving 'ohana, and applying complementary alternative therapies as well as standard asthma management will strongly support native Hawaiian parents caring for their children with asthma.

TI  - A sense of an ending: late-generation ethnicity and Irish America
T2  - IRISH STUDIES REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Irish America today is at a stage of "late generation ethnicity," designating an ethnic formation that reaches back many generations in the US and is not being significantly replenished from the country of origin. This is not necessarily a terminal state of ethnic affairs, but it is a transitional one, and the analytical challenge is to identify and understand the features and implications of "lateness," what the sense of an ending means in the Irish American case. This essay will explore this question, drawing on field study among Irish communities in Chicago, and also consider some of the differences in worldview among Irish-Americans, particularly as these pertain to matters of immigration reform and undocumented Irish in the US.

CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Semantic segmentation of remote sensing data such as multispectral imagery has been boosted recently using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, segmentation of multispectral images using supervised machine learning algorithms such as CNN requires a significant number of pixel-level annotated data, often unavailable, making the task extremely challenging. To address this, this paper puts forward a semi-supervised framework, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN). The proposed solution consists of a generator network to provide photo-realistic images as extra training data to a multi-class classifier acting as a discriminator and trained on a small annotated dataset. Performance of the proposed semi-supervised GAN is evaluated on two benchmarks multispectral semantic segmentation datasets collected from urban scenes of Vaihingen and Potsdam. Results indicate that the proposed framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods and show the potential of GAN-based methods for the challenging task of multispectral image segmentation.

AB  - This research focuses on the development of a computational data-driven modeling method to be used in the dengue outbreak surveillance system. The outbreak-level forecasting is based on the estimation of dengue fever cases in Thailand using both statistical and data mining techniques. Major statistical techniques used in this research are linear regression and generalized linear model. The data mining algorithms used in our study are chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID), classification and regression tree, artificial neural network, and support vector machine. The input data are from four sources, which are remotely sensed indices from the NOAA satellite to represent vegetation health and other related weather conditions, rainfall, the oceanic Nino index (ONI) for justifying climate variability affecting amount of rainfall, and historical dengue cases in Thailand to be used as the modeling target. In the modeling process, these data are lagged from 1 up to 24 months to observe time-series effect. On comparing performances of models built from different algorithms, we found that CHAID is the best one yielding the least error on estimating dengue cases. From the CHAID models to forecast dengue cases in Bangkok metropolitan and Nakhon Ratchasima in the northeast of Thailand, the high level of ONI is the most important factor. The large amount of rainfall is significant factor contributing to dengue outbreak in Chiang Mai in the north and Songkhla in the south.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the results of a three-year sociological study of the causes of social tension among the youth in Kuban as a polyethnic region. Based on the results of the survey of high school students, university students and young workers, the authors consider the youth's attitudes to the current government, priorities of state policy, events in Ukraine and Syria, assess the state of interethnic relations in the North Caucasus and the role of Cossacks in Kuban. The article emphasizes that the inconsistency of worldviews and attitudes of the Kuban youth to these issues increased in 2017, i.e. the potential for conflicts on national and political grounds increased, which lead to the growth of social activity of participants in both patriotic actions and social protests. Today, the rejuvenation of social protests is obvious for more and more schoolchildren and teenagers take part in them. There is a growth of both the youth support for state patriotism and radical anti-state protests, and in general the number of the youth indifferent and detached from social processes declines. There is a danger of polarization and radicalization of the youth and accumulation of latent conflict potential. The state patriotic education aiming to ensure the traditional value of sacrifice for the country is eroded by the propaganda of liberal individualism and consumerism which deny such a value; the promotion of volunteerism and mutual aid comes into conflict with the ideas of leadership and competitiveness, and the values of interethnic and inter-religious friendship and respect with the ideas of interethnic and interfaith tolerance. The return to traditional values proclaimed by the state faces the westernization trends, which determines the youth's worldview inconsistency.

AB  - Myanmar is known as a rich land and it is an agriculture-based country. Rice is the staple food of Myanmar and Irrawaddy delta is the main source of rice production in Myanmar. And there was a Nargis Cyclone hit that region in the early May, 2008 and it was extremely severe caused the worst natural disaster in the recorded history of Myanmar. So it is necessary to be a lot more attention on that region in order to analyze the change in environment to support decision making, urban development and planning. The aim of this study is to analyze the environmental changes in Irrawaddy Delta using Landsat satellite images between the years 2000 and 2017. Collection of Landsat images for the years, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2017 is used to determine changes of environment. Images are classified into five types: water, forest, buildup, fields and others. For land cover index classification, two supervised classification algorithms: Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are utilized and compared the results of classification using producer accuracy and user accuracy. According to the experimental result, the result of RF is more precised than that of SVM for environmental change detection.

AB  - The Cidanau watershed is the only watershed in Indonesia that implements Payment for Environmental Services (PES) for farmers who can maintain tree/stand density of 500 trees/hectare on their land. Payments are made upon the verification on the field by the project supervisor. This method requires a lot of time and costly, so it is necessary to build more efficient indirect methods, including using satellite imagery or camera data. The aim of this study is to understand Landsat OLI 8 and hemispherical photo can estimate tree density in the farmer's agroforestry stand. To obtain tree density, the number of trees with diameter more than 10 cm in 50 plots (50 m x 50 m) were counted. Some predictor variables were utilized, such as Leaf Area Index (LAI) based on hemispherical photos, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Forest Cover Density (FCD), as well as NDVI and FCD which were enhanced with topographic correction. The imagery used was Landsat 8 OLI acquired on July 5, 2015, with Path/Row 123/64. The relationship between tree density and predictor variables was done using linear regression analysis. Prior to regression analysis, normality (Kolmogorov Smirnov/K-S), heteroscedasticity (Glejser test) and auto correlation (Durbin Watson) test were performed. The results of the analysis showed that tree density was estimated better with hemispherical photos-based LAI, with determination coefficient of 80.6%. Meanwhile, estimation using NDVI and FCD has lower determination coefficient. Even though, the use of topographic correction had been able to increase the determination coefficient of the regression relationship between tree density and FCD, from 4.64% to 35.18%.

TI  - Noosphere Concept Implementation in Methodology of Modern Ecologically Oriented Higher Education: Theoretical Aspect
T2  - EKOLOJI
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the development of human civilization has reached a stage of a qualitatively new state of global economic, political and social processes caused by the threat of local and global environmental disasters, the cause of which lies in the negative consequences of the existing ill-considered nature management and development of the techno-sphere on the basis of the worldview of the industrial revolution and the consumer society. The third Millennium should be the Millennium of the entry of the biosphere and human civilization into the noosphere to ensure the conditions for their preservation and further development on the principles of ecological and cultural consistency. Moreover, the most important role in the success of this process is the modernization of the system of higher education based on the noosphere concept. Purpose of the study: this article is aimed at theoretical analysis of the features of the noosphere concept implementation in the methodology of modern environmentally oriented higher education. The study results: it is established that the modern ecologically oriented higher education from the point of view of the noosphere concept is a natural, socially and culturally oriented system of obtaining, accumulation, transferring and updating of knowledge, skills and abilities of interaction in the system man -society -environment. Its content should integrate knowledge from various scientific fields: philosophy, ecology, psychology, biology, physiology, history and cultural studies. The methodology of such education should be based on the principles of greening, systematization, harmonization, humanization, instrumentality, personal orientation, and advanced development, simplicity of knowledge, efficiency and potential intellectual security. Practical significance: the Materials of the article are of theoretical and practical value for the development of educational and methodical complexes in various disciplines of higher education, taking into account the noosphere concept, teachers' training and retraining programs, as well as programs aimed at the formation of new environmentally appropriate worldview and value-based attitudes among the contemporary youth.

AB  - The post-Soviet "evangelical revival" in Russia has clearly revealed itself in religious and social life of national regions, in the Republic of Dagestan in particular. The ensuing crisis in society provoked the "influx" of Western missionaries into the multi-confessional space of Dagestan. Protestants did not have any kind of religious, religious-national or any other restrictions for conducting missionary activity. Gradual transformations of the post-Soviet social space cause recession in the missionary activity of neo-Protestants of Dagestan. In this regard, this study attempts to analyze the chronological dynamics of the evangelical mission from its rise to gradual decline.As a result, the sociological survey of the religious well-being of Protestant followers shows their commitment to missionary activities and their focus on spreading their dogma among adherents of a different religion. The study results demonstrate a positive assessment of proselytism by Dagestan Protestants who advocate for its non-violent. It is established that the missionary and social success of the Protestant doctrine made its followers a part of the religious society of the post-Soviet Dagestan society with simultaneous negative perception of the Eastern Orthodox by the mass consciousness of the Dagestanians. It is revealed that the respondents have different attitudes to the spread of their religion among those who profess other religious doctrine. The proclamation of principles of free choice of one or another religious worldview and the emphasis on exclusivity of one's dogma, its " perfection and correctness" allow concluding about contradictions in opinions of the respondents.

M3  - Article
AB  - The transformation in Protestants' and neo-Protestants' values in their missionary practices in the modern Dagestan is discussed. It is noted that the processes of globalization caused by the international situation, the unfolding socio-economic, political and spiritual depression in the country contributed to the "influx" of Western missionaries and the emergence of new non-traditional charismatic churches, allowing them to occupy its niche in republic religious structure for some time. On the basis of sociological survey the analysis of value views of the Dagestan Protestants in their Evangelical mission is carried out. It is shown that the religious well-being of the adepts of the studied communities is focused on proselytizing and missionary activity among the carriers of the other worldview. It is established that the Dagestan Protestants positively evaluate proselytism with the motivation for its non-violent and peaceful propagation while simultaneously ignoring the possibility of aggravation of inter-religious and inter-ethnic relations. It is revealed that the respondents have different points of view on the promotion of their faith among representatives of other religions. The authors conclude that, on the one hand, the proclamation of the principles of freedom of choice of a religious worldview, on the other - the aim to emphasize the exclusivity of their beliefs with the motivation of its "perfection and correctness" allow to make conclusion about the contradictory nature of the respondents' opinions.

AB  - It is crucial for Indonesia as an agricultural country to have its own satellite image to be utilized in Indonesia's resources monitoring. LAPAN-A3 satellite data has been studied for earth observation and can be utilized for monitoring paddy fields, built-up areas, forests, rivers, fishponds, shrubs, sea, agricultural lands, and bare soils. But, as a sun-synchronous satellite, LAPAN-A3 has demerit of little revisit time for one specific area. Therefore, off-nadir imaging becomes one essential trait of the satellite to increase target monitoring from 17 times to 71 times in a year. This paper aims to organize the development process of off-nadir strategy in acquiring target image in Indonesia. With two kinds of off-nadir maneuver, inertial pointing maneuver and wheel speed maneuver, LAPAN-A3 satellite can conduct off-nadir imaging up to 34.5 degrees roll angle maneuver. Furthermore, wheel speed maneuver with roll angle and roll rate approach presents the improvement in time efficiency of the maneuver, from 1 hour and 35 minutes executing time in inertial pointing to 25 minutes in wheel speed maneuver, making it become promising candidate for time-constraint off-nadir imaging.

TI  - Invasive carcinoma in accessory axillary breast tissue: A case report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Accessory or ectopic breast tissue is an aberration of normal breast development. It is known to be a rare entity present anywhere along the embryologic mammary streak or milk line but more common in axilla.PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of 36 year old female with accessory breast carcinoma who presented with a progressive lump in her left axilla for 1 year. On examination a 2 cm solitary mass was palpable in axilla. Ultrasound confirmed a 19 mm mass with no other lesion in breast and axilla. Core biopsy showed invasive ductal carcinoma. She was discussed in multidisciplinary board meeting and was offered upfront surgery with excision of accessory breast tissue and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Axillary lymph node dissection was omitted following ACOSG Z0011 criteria. She was offered adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation post operatively along with endocrine treatment as she was hormone receptor positive.DISCUSSION: Accessory breast development is hormone dependent just like normal breast. Breast cancer in accessory breast tissue is very rare. The incidence is around 6%. Most common pathology is invasive ductal carcinoma (50-75%). The most common location is axilla (60-70%) although it can present in other less common locations like infra-mammary region (5-10%) and rarely in thighs, perineum, groin, and vulva.CONCLUSION: Since accessory axillary breast tissue is out of the image of screening breast examination, it is necessary for the oncologists to be aware of this entity and associated pathologies. Their preventive excision in high risk women can also be considered. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IJS Publishing Group Ltd.

AB  - Space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar has the ability to estimate directional ocean swell spectra globally and help answer scientific questions in the understanding of swell systems, cross seas as well as improve sea-state forecasts. However, it is still an open question how well such observations represent the actual spectra. We aim to address this question in the Southern Ocean by comparing these satellite measurements with reference data: wave model spectra and in-situ buoy observations, where available.

TI  - Sea Ice Albedo from MISR and MODIS: Production, Validation, and Trend Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) sensor onboard the Terra satellite provides high accuracy albedo products. MISR deploys nine cameras each at different view angles, which allow a near-simultaneous angular sampling of the surface anisotropy. This is particularly important to measure the near-instantaneous albedo of dynamic surface features such as clouds or sea ice. However, MISR's cloud mask over snow or sea ice is not yet sufficiently robust because MISR's spectral bands are only located in the visible and the near infrared. To overcome this obstacle, we performed data fusion using a specially processed MISR sea ice albedo product (that was generated at Langley Research Center using Rayleigh correction) combining this with a cloud mask of a sea ice mask product, MOD29, which is derived from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which is also, like MISR, onboard the Terra satellite. The accuracy of the MOD29 cloud mask has been assessed as >90% due to the fact that MODIS has a much larger number of spectral bands and covers a much wider range of the solar spectrum. Four daily sea ice products have been created, each with a different averaging time window (24 h, 7 days, 15 days, 31 days). For each time window, the number of samples, mean and standard deviation of MISR cloud-free sea ice albedo is calculated. These products are publicly available on a predefined polar stereographic grid at three spatial resolutions (1 km, 5 km, 25 km). The time span of the generated sea ice albedo covers the months between March and September of each year from 2000 to 2016 inclusive. In addition to data production, an evaluation of the accuracy of sea ice albedo was performed through a comparison with a dataset generated from a tower based albedometer from NOAA/ESRL/GMD/GRAD. This comparison confirms the high accuracy and stability of MISR's sea ice albedo since its launch in February 2000. We also performed an evaluation of the day-of-year trend of sea ice albedo between 2000 and 2016, which confirm the reduction of sea ice shortwave albedo with an order of 0.4-1%, depending on the day of year and the length of observed time window.

AB  - Accurate and up-to-date monitoring of forests at mountainous regions at regular time interval is a challenging task. Remote sensing derived metrics such as vegetation indices are the most widely used tools for the estimation of forests phenological attributes and ecosystem monitoring. Thus, in this study, assessment of spectral traits has been carried out using satellite RS sensors derived information. In this study, the assessment was carried out from 2013 to the mid-2015 using Landsat-8 to understand NDVI phenology and modeling of phenology trends using temporal normalized phenology index (TNPI) and remote sensing derived variables such as land surface temperature (LST), elevation, aspect and slope within moist deciduous forest (MDF) of Doon valley of Western Himalayan of India. Results indicated that variations in topography and LST showed strong associations (p<0.001) with Landsat-8 derived TNPI. We observed that NDVI changed in lower elevation areas due to maximum change in LST. In conclusion, cross-validated statistics confirmed that TNPI was tested successfully for another MDF test site using Landsat-8 derived NDVI for two time steps of maximum and minimum vegetation growth period.

TI  - Social and Demographic Characteristic of Ulyanovsk Region at the Second Half of 1940-ies: Problem Statement in Domestic Historical Science
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - Various theoretical and conceptual approaches allowing to reconstruct demographic processes in the post-war Ulyanovsk region are considered. The author believes that in modern historiography there is no data on the demographic results of the Great Patriotic war, as well as the consequences that were caused by military aggression. It is argued that the dynamics of demographic processes in the post-war Ulyanovsk region was determined not only by direct military consequences, but also by general civilizational trends. It is pointed out, in particular, that the changes in the social space caused by modernization transformed the scale of values of a Soviet man, changed his attitude, worldview, family traditions. It is shown that the demographic transition, which ended in the USSR, was marked not only by an increase in life expectancy, but also by a decrease in the birth rate, which did not fully compensate for the demographic losses of the Soviet people. The author believes that an objective analysis of demographic processes in the post-war Ulyanovsk region is possible only in the framework of an integrated approach, namely, using the theoretical attitudes of supporters and opponents of the theory of "demographic transition." It is noted that in this historical period the demographic processes depended on the state social policy.

AB  - Pan-sharpening (PS) is fusion of the low-resolution multi-spectral (LRM) image with the corresponding high resolution panchromatic (HRP) one, which aims to reach the high-resolution multi-spectral (HRM) image. Due to the importance of designing well-adapted dictionaries for the pan-sharpening problem as the fundamental challenge in the pan-sharpening methods utilizing sparse representation, we present a novel strategy to tackle this issue. Our method takes the image formation model into account in a patch-based strategy and exploits local spectral-spatial information. To make a fair tradeoff between spectral and spatial information of each patch, some local parameters are considered and estimated adaptively. In addition, the energy ratio between LRM/LRP patches is considered to locally reconstruct the same ratio for the corresponding HRM/HRP patches. This model-based pan-sharpening strategy led to a closed-form solution, which results in precise HRM dictionary atoms. To obtain the unknown HRM image, after designing the HRM dictionary from input Pan and multi-spectral images, sparse representation over LRM and HRM dictionaries will be conducted in the sparse coding stage. The proposed method has been applied to two different datasets collected by WorldView-3 and GeoEye-1, and then compared with some popular and state-of-the-art methods, qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB  - Stock volume is an important forest inventory parameter. In case of agro-forests and plantation forests, stock volume estimates are important as they provide reliable indicator of the productivity of these species. In this study stock volume loss due to harvest of polar plantations between 2017 and 2018 are estimated using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 backscatter data. Using simple linear regression models the AGB of the plantations before and after harvest are estimated. These are converted to stock volume loss per hectare. From field inventory, the actual stock volume during harvest are measured. These are validated against the estimations using two models - M1 and M2. Model M1, utilizes only HV-pol backscatter data and provides a lower accuracy with r(2) = 0.46. Model M2 utilizes HH- and HV-pol backscatter and provides stock volume loss estimation with r(2) = 0.51.

AB  - For accurate cloud ceiling information, a data fusion approach is proposed that utilizes satellite data to extend surface station information to much wider areas. Cloud base height (CBH) retrieved from satellite observations provides for much larger spatial coverage and higher resolution. The direct comparison of GOES-16 CBH with surface station ceiling yields a local bias that has to be corrected for in the initial GOES-16 cloud base information. This sparsely sampled bias correction presents an irregular 2D mesh of control points, which is then interpolated by constructing a continuous smooth field using polyharmonic splines. The influence of remote stations is restricted by grouping the control points into clusters depending on an effective distance. This cluster-based approach allows for constructing separate spline surfaces corresponding to physically different clouds. The obtained continuous bias correction function is then applied to the entire GOES-16 pixel level CBH except for areas far away from surface stations in data sparse regions such as offshore. The described method is currently being tested using daytime-only observations over the central and eastern United States. Overall, this approach has potential to provide more accurate, high spatial resolution cloud ceiling information for the aviation community.

AB  - The main aim of this paper is to measure land displacements, as a result of fluid overextraction, and evaluate the impact of measured deformation on the groundwater quality in the Inglewood region, Los Angeles. Therefore, persistent scatterer interferometry (PSInSAR) technique was applied on a set of Sentinel-1 radar images to monitor the subsidence rate in the interested area between June 2017 and May 2018. Then, groundwater data were used to assess the variations in water parameters affecting its quality. Changes in the concentration of the studied parameters including total dissolved solids (TDS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), arsenic, and lead were investigated. The PSInSAR outputs demonstrated a high-rate of subsidence in the Inglewood field (30 mm/year). The results showed that uplift as a result of water injection lead to significant increase in TDS, arsenic, and lead, diminishing the water quality and exceeding quality limits and standards. Water injection does not enhance water quality, only preventing the subsidence in this area.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyses the approaches to the problem of theodicy which have been developed by proponents of the reconciliation of Christian worldview and evolutionism. Theistic evolutionists regard the evolution as a medium by which God created the world and, in contrast to traditional theology, cannot consider the Fall to be the primary cause of the universal evil. Therefore, in order to reconciliate the fact of the existence of evil and the concept of the omnipotent and loving God, they have recourse to the two alternative explanations. According to the first, evolution was the only possible way of creating the world, and, consequently, evil, which accompanies it, is an unavoidable condition to achieve the good aim, such as the emergence of man and of other living creatures. According to the other explanation, which often complements the former, evil, which is intrinsic to the developing world, is necessary to prepare human souls to eternal life in the kingdom of God (the so-called Irenaean theodicy). This article shows that both these explanations are contradictory and combine badly with the idea of the eschatological recompense, to which theistic evolutionists also have recourse. Namely, if God were to recompense man and other living creatures for the suff ering they have experienced in the course of the evolution, why would He not have created the world in such a shape that it is going to acquire at the end of history. The article also looks at the alternative version of theodicy which is based on the idea about the pre-world Fall, due to which the original perfection of the world was distorted.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses a poorly known source on the history of the Crimea ca. 1800. Its author is Edward Daniel Clarke, who published famous Travels to influence much the Western mind. Clarke made an important contribution to the shaping of some stereotypes on the Crimea and Russia keeping their topicality to these days. Nevertheless, his letters to his mother and best friend escaped researchers' attention, despite their reflection of Clarke's immediate apprehension and reflections upon Russian realities. His letters uncover that Clarke got many negative evaluations to be developed later in the travelogue immediately when in the Crimea. The first part of the article has analysed the formation of the Clarke's worldview and his ways of thinking on uncommon realities. It has established that the Englishman's appraisals were far from being objective, that he was prejudicial and got a loose tongue, knew nothing of Rusian, and was not ready to get accustomed to different cultural norms, viewing other countries from the position of British cultural superiority. The second part presents the first Russian translation of Clarke's letters from the Crimea.

The database is created by the synergistic use of satellite data of spectral and microwave radiometers and scatterometers implemented in the Arctic portal allowing most reliable PL and MC identification. This database presents a complicated structure of PL and MC parameters for the whole period of their lifetime. The database is of particular interest as it covers not only the Northern seas, but also the Eastern sector of the Russian Arctic, where PL events are poorly investigated, and where the formation of the MCs has become possible due to recent sea ice retreat.

AB  - The work presents a verification of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations of the surface wind speed (SWS) and track for the eight Polar lows (PL) observed in the Nordic seas in 2009-2010. As compared to the measurements of satellite Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer (AMSR-E) the model reproduces well the occurrence and general direction of the PL propagation, but systematically underestimates the mean SWS. Besides, the simulated PL tracks often deviate from those observed from the satellites by up to several hundreds of kilometers. A number of numerical experiments have been conducted to analyze the effect of using different resolutions, parameterization schemes, and dates of the simulation start.

AB  - In the 21st century, a significant increase in the duration of the navigation period on the Northern Sea Route is expected. This is due to the stronger warming of the climate in the Arctic. Current climate models are characterized by considerable uncertainty in the sensitivity of the characteristics of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean to current climate changes. In order to take into account, the uncertainty of the results of numerical calculations for models, together with the uncertainty of the observational data, Bayesian analysis methods are used. This paper analyzes the changes in the duration of the navigation period (NPD) on the Northern Sea Route (NSR) for the Coupled Models Intercomparison Project, phase 5 (CMIP5) climate model ensemble under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) anthropogenic scenarios using Bayesian statistics. For various scenarios of anthropogenic impact, it was found that the expected duration of the navigation period on the Northern Sea Route will be 2-3 months by the middle of the XXI century and 3-6 months by its end.

AB  - Users of satellite Earth observation data typically invest a large amount of effort into data preparation which is a major barrier for many global users and limits the impact and utilization of this data around the world. The Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) has initiated an effort to define and promote the production and use of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) to lower the burden on global users and increase the use and impact of its data. Through the Open Data Cube (ODC) initiative and its demonstration in Africa, ARD is making an impact on this developing region of the world. This paper discusses how this data and the associated ODC tools are being used to address water extent, land change and urbanization, which are key application areas aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Through the ODC, the impact of ARD is growing rapidly around the world and our ability to address local and national decision-making needs will continue to improve.

AB  - This study starts with the problem that two dominant strands of research regarding Lee Tae-jun's literature have been treated as mutually exclusive discourses. In particular, although traditionalism and syntactic theory are building their own realm of each other, enough points can be found. Therefore, this study attempts to clarify the linguistic attempt of Lee Tae-jun's novelism from a stylistic viewpoint.In "Paeganglang" and "Sunset," the author was found to have used color schemes, paradigm vocabulary, and negative sentences, and to have described the opposing worldview based on the image of the straight line and the curve. In particular, the stylistic features that describe the present visual image that reveals the anti-modern worldview, and reveals the value of tradition therein, make the present and the past parallel to understand, and eventually seek to enjoy traditionalism as an object of description. I tried to find out that it was the self-rescue of the bay. On the basis of these points, it is hoped that the gap between Lee Tae-jun's theories of literature with exclusivity can be bridged.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to grasp the current status of intangible cultural heritage in thefield of dance in North Korea, and to examine the actual status of dance designated as folk andintangible cultural properties that are considered important in North Korean national culture.The research method was inferred based on the literature review, the testimonies of Korean-Japanese dancers, and the researcher's experience of North Korean dance.North Korea's dance cultural heritage is divided into classical cultural heritage, revolutionarycultural heritage, and socialist dance reconstructed after 1946. Among these, classical danceheritage was designated as the target of intangible cultural heritage. North Korea has adheredto its principles to inherit intangible heritage. It must be critically inherited by popular andprogressive folk dances, the analysis and evaluation of folk dance should be conducted in asubjective perspective in accordance with the domestic situation and the national emotion, inaddition, there may be limited personalities due to the socio-historical conditions of the period,creator's worldview, aesthetic view and artistic hobbies.Intangible heritage of dance in North Korea has been designated 11 works including sworddance, Nongak dance, eight monks dance, Buk cheong lion-mask dance, Gangryeong maskdance, Bongsan mask dance, drum dance, four monks dance, Haeju mask dance and Eunyuldance. All of them have a long history. Like South Korea, there is no tradition preservationsociety, Nongak , dondolari , sword dance, and eight monks dance are variously performed inthe central and local art troupes and dance groups, while the rest is only a documentary record.In North Korea, tradition is handed down to the socialist system based on party, workingclass, and people, not the original. This is different from South Korea. In other words, unlikethe cultural traditions of South Korea, which is based on the “main archetype,” it has been intentionally transforming traditional culture in accordance with the times by selecting classicalcultural heritage according to policy intent and purpose.

TI  - Qoheleth’s Impact on the Qumranic Presentation of the Eschatological Worldview (4QMysteries and 4QInstruction)
T2  - Journal of Biblical Text Research
T2  - 성경원문연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This article examines the critical reception of Qoheleth’s skepticism by two Qumran documents (4QMysteries and 4QInstruction). Both Qumran wisdom texts demonstrate that a sapiential text can combine elements from apocalypticism and traditional wisdom. Qoheleth’s skepticism goes so far as to cancel the advantage of life and divine retribution. The sapiential texts of the sectarian community directly reacts to Qoheleth’s thoughts in order to resist and transform them. Qoheleth bears witness to the problem of death, which is the ultimately dehumanizing power. 4QMysteries, however, translates the destroying power of death into the theophanic knowledge which executes an inevitable elimination of folly and evil. The community behind 4QMysteries eagerly anticipates that the eschatological embodiment of the knowledge will fill all the world at the expense of the personification of deified Death, which Qoheleth identifies with the insatiable rich.4QInstruction’s version of eschatological future is a powerful reaction to Qoheleth’s daring implication that God does not treat benevolently the wise and the righteous. 4QInstruction modifies, with apocalyptic way of thinking, such motifs as reward, reputation and portion, all of which are in the service of Qoheleth’s description of death. Qoheleth’s judgment of a single fate that levels the wise/righteous with the fool/wicked is born again as the theme of divine predestination, which determines the inherent disparity of the human spirits as well as their distinct destinies. These points of analogy between Qoheleth and the sapiential texts demonstrate that the sage’s words about death carry sharp barbs that prick those who dare to think radically like him. Thus, some evidence for the literary dependence of both Qumran sapiential compositions on Qoheleth throws a precious light on the stimulating debate about the relationship of the apocalyptic tradition with biblical wisdom at an earlier stage.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference

AB  - In this study, we investigated different optical properties between severe versus moderate visibility marine fog using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) visible band measurements. Severe and moderate visibility marine fogs are best distinguishable with the criteria of visibility as 500 m. Using this, we developed an algorithm that classifies severe visibility marine fog based on Decision Tree (DT) method. Calibration and validation data were constructed for 2016 and 2017 marine fog cases, respectively, through match-up between satellite and in-situ data. In general, marine fog region has differences of textural and optical properties with cloud. The GOCI 412 nm Rayleigh Corrected Reflectance (R-rc) reveals small spatial variability in fog than in cloud. Also, it is notable that some distinction exists in R-rc magnitude between severe and moderate visibility marine fog region. Using this feature, we have developed a satellite marine fog detection algorithm with severe/moderate visibility classification. R-rc and Normalized Local Standard Deviation (NLSD) of R-rc were determined as primary input. However, visible channel alone cannot completely distinguish marine fog from cloud because it does not provide cloud height information. Here, we used cloud top height data from Himawari-8 as a supplementary data to remove cloud that was mis-classified as fog. Hit Rate (HR) and False Alarm Rate (FAR) for moderate (severe) visibility marine fog were 0.96 (0.86) and 0.31 (0.12), respectively.

TI  - The topography of classic novels in the Late Joseon Dynasty period looked at by the Taoist magic motif
TI  - 도술모티프를 통해 본 조선후기 고전소설의 지형도
T2  - 한국학논집
M3  - research-article
AB  - Cho Dong-il believed that the ancient Korean founding myth, Honggildongjeon, and hero stories of the late Joseon Dynasty share the same type of structure as “hero's life,” and wanted to identify them as a literary and historical structure. This is widely accepted today as the right theory, but there is room for reconsideration in that it is intended to create a hypothetical structure that transcends the wide space-time gap.This paper focused on the Taoist magic motif and tried to redraw the topography of the classic novel. Various classical novels of the late Joseon Dynasty can be arranged in three main types, depending on the characteristics of the Taoist magic motif. First, in some of the Korean novels, including Sohyunseongrok and Wanwolhoenangyeon, the main character is born with a natural magical ability. Second, in the type of war novels, including Jowoongjeon and Yuchungryuljeon, the main character has been taught magic by his master over the years, which gives him magical powers. Third, in works such as Jeonwoochijeon and Choigowoonjeon, the main character learns magic through learning, but the role of the teacher is not noticeable in the process, and the main character's efforts and self-directed learning are emphasized.These differences are likely to be closely related to the worldview of the class, which used to read each novel mainly. The Taoist motif in the Sohyunseongrok and Wanwolhoenangyeon correspond to elitism that must have been held by upper-class readers, such as the royal family and aristocrats. Interest-centered magic in Jowoongjeon and Yuchungryuljeon fits the character of the works, which was commercially published and became very popular with the general public. The magic motifs of Jeonwoochijeon and Choigowoonjeon are closely related to the theme of the works, which show a strong sense of criticism of the governing ideology. According to this point of view, Korean literary history is not a single-track history, but a dynamic process in which different types of classical novels have been competing against each other.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index(NDVI) and land surface temperature(LST) in the sites of public residential development in Seoul. The scope of the study was analyzed based on the residential development projects that took place between 2007 and 2017 in Seoul. Seven residential development areas were included in this study such as Sinae 3, Sinjung 4, Naegok, Segok 2, Gangnam, Ogum, and Wirye. Landsat TM and OLI satellite images were used to derive NDVI and normalized LST(zLST). The results showed that most of the residential development projects showed a decrease in NDVI during 2007~2017. There were strong negative correlations between NDVI07 and zLST07, NDVI17 and zLST17, and △NDVI and △zLST. Especially, the correlation between △NDVI and △zLST was high in the districts of Sinnae 3, Ogum, and Wirye. This study highlights the important role of environmental-friendly development in public residential development project.

This study showed that advertisers are the senders and consumers are the receivers for both advertisings. Specifically, this study looks at the subject who has desires to pursues something that she does not have. For NEPA, the subject one wants to acquire, is Jun Gi-Hyun and the object Jun Gi-Hyun pursues is an image of a leading and sophisticated woman. On the other hand, for K2, Su Zy is the subject and the object Su Zy pursues is the picture of a warm and delightful woman. Finally, this study examines the relationship between a helper and an opponent. For NEPA, the helper for the subject Jun Gi-Hyun to become the leading and sophisticated woman is NEPA, the product itself, and the opponent can be a competitive brand. For K2, the helper for the subject Su Zy to become a warm and delightful woman is the product itself K2, and the opponent is the competitive brand.

T2  - Journal of Korean Society of Forest Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the long-term area changes in the subalpine coniferous forests in Korea in order to understand the changes in the subalpine forest ecosystems vulnerable to climate change. We analyzed 20 years of time-series Landsat satellite images (mid 1990s, mid 2010s) for change detection of coniferous forests and compared with the long term changes of climate information to identify their relationship in the study area. As a result, the area of coniferous forests in the study region decreased by 25% over 20 years. The regions with largest changes are Seoraksan, Baegunsan-Hambaeksan-Jangsan, Jirisan, and Hallasan. The region with the largest decrease in area was Baegunsan (reduced area: 542 ha), and the region with large decrease in area and the largest rate of decrease was Hallasan (rate of decrease: 33.3%). As the Jeju region has the most rapid temperature rise, it is projected that Hallasan is the most vulnerable forest ecosystem affected by climate change. The result of this study shows that from a long-term perspective the overall coniferous forests in the subalpine region are declining, but the trend varies in each region. This national and long-term information on the change of coniferous forests in the subalpine region can be utilized as baseline data for the detailed survey of endangered subalpine coniferous trees in the future.

AB  - In modern and contemporary history, mankind has made tremendous developments in civilization and marvelous science that we have never experienced before. However, the development of civilization and science inevitably brought environmental pollution and damage to the ecosystem. Mankind today has nuclear weapons that can destroy the earth at once, and the problem of ecosystem is now a global problem, not a country or region. In this irrational reality, We are faced with a fundamental question, "what is the value of the development of civilization, science and technology to us?" Based on these fundamental questions, this study attempted to study the relationship between “God's Creation Order and Nature” from an ecotheological point of view.Humans have Imago Dei, distinct from other creatures, even though they are part of the creature that God created with nature. However, even though God's permission for man, “Imago Dei,” presupposes man's special responsibility and commitment to creation, humans have recognized nature as the object of destruction and of conquest. The reason is first that nature has fallen as a result of human sinfulness. All the ecotheological claims that the author make in this study are developed with these presuppositions. Originally God's creation was a creation order based on love and peace. But God's creation order is broken by the sinful nature of man and results in man being expelled from the Garden of Eden. In particular, modern and contemporary human‐centered worldviews that contain the fallen sinfulness of man more than ever strengthened the “dichotomous” theology that divides man and nature created in God's order of creation, and man did not justify man's dominion over nature and care for nature. As a result, the first cause of the destruction of mankind today is no longer nuclear weapons, but the destruction of the earth that will result from the destruction of ecosystems. This is a product of the result of not being able to afford the stewardship of nature that God has given to man.Through the ecotheological examination of God's creation order and nature, this study discovered the problems of a human‐centered worldview based on fallen sinfulness, and presented a scholarly study to restore the stewardship of nature God has entrusted to man through the transition from a “human‐centered worldview” to a “God‐centered worldview” and to the ultimate goal of “trinitarian ecological theology”.

AB  - While many suggest that a nation’s merits and demerits are directly linked to its ruler, Takizawa Bakin’s theory of ethics directly connects the merits and demerits of a nation to life and death itself. Theories that try to confirm the dominance of Japan through its merits and demerits suggest that Japan is simply a foreign nation that is in the background, while the Chinese empire is at the center of the world. Some even suggest that Japan is a nation of uncivilized barbarians. Bakin, however, uses the term “barbarians” to describe the great Western powers, suggesting that the quality of being barbaric lies in the limbs. Despite having a similar cultural background as China, Japan is often considered to be a foreign, barbaric nation. Bakin recognized the discriminating structure of Western powers as their core, and implied that civilized societies were also discriminated against by the superior consciousness of the Chinese, who discarded them as inferior barbarians. Upon re-examining this notion, Bakin frees Japan from this structural discrimination by attaching significance to the Sinosphere of Japan, his homeland, which shares a rich culture with China, particularly in terms of kanji, the traditional script. If being uncivilized stems from the limbs, Bakin views Japan at par with China, or focused detachment-in this case, from the traditional concept of China. In this way, Bakin describes China as an abstract, intellectual, and cultural concept, and by this logic, places Japan at par with China, conquering the traditional worldview.

AB  - Recently, researches that claim that the modern civilization got started from the sea are gaining attention when it comes to the West and East Asia. As such, such researches are actively underway. In particular, study of history is focusing on the view of history centered on sea that considers the sea as the center of start and spread of modern civilization whereas view of history centered on land was commonplace. Likewise, this movement of perceiving the sea as the start of the civilization and its eventual spread is not limited to the study of history. Instead, this view is affecting other fields of humanities as well. This kind of sea centered viewpoint can be applied to literary works as well. In other words, it may be possible to examine new aspect of literary works with the sea centered perception, casting away land centered perception.Even during the Edo era when Japan carried out closed-door policy, there were many works related to ocean. Among these kinds of works that depicted ocean, this paper examined Ryukyu symbol centered on the Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki authored by Kyokutei Bakin. In addition to this work, this study focused on the data such as books on the history of premodern society, literature and ideology related to Ryukyu. Perception on the outside of Japan depicted in the works was examined as well, through the island, Ryukyu that is not the land called Japan. In particular, this study sought to examine how the sea of Japan including Ryukyu during early 19th Century is depicted with which viewpoint and ideology in case of the novels on the premodern society.Ideology of governance for the island that is faraway, Ryukyu shows the Sinocentrism that had become a part of Japan at the time. Sinocentrism that claims that China is the center of the world affected perception of Ryukyu as well. In case of the work, Chinsetsu Yumiharizuki, Japan centered viewpoint leads to the governance of the Genji samurai family on the Ryukyu. Ryukyu’s historical traditional value is denied, and it was being re-created as a different nation of Japan. Likewise, it is possible to know that the China centered perception which is China/barbaric outlander was changed to perception to Japan/nearby ocean and island in case of Japan in the 19th Century.

AB  - Although limited to relevant knowledge and skills as trainees of purpose of study method of this study result of study to repattern effective body movements, it is an opportunity to organize and record a structured physical/psychological experience through training to develop harmonious and integrated physical/psychological movements during classes and supervision. Stephen Pores's "Immobilization," Thomas Hanna's physical and physical functions of " Soma bias," which means lost the function of moving both sides due to the bias mentioned by him, and Wilhelm Reich's "muscle armor" have the same effect on the psyche and personality structure. It is that physical and physical functions affect a person's worldview, lifestyle, and emotional life. In order for an individual to escape the body's immobilization, Soma's deflection and muscular armor, the body must restore the "basic biological function of contraction and expansion." When its function completes the tension-energy charge-energy release-the satiation cycle, an individual can exist as a living Soma capable of responding appropriately and flexibly to momentary new environments and stimuli. This study seeks to understand warm up theories of body movement that can restore the basic biological function of contraction and extension through consideration of the main theories of dance/movement psychotherapy.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The 1930s was both the unhappiest period in modern Korean history and, paradoxically, the richest period in the history of Korean poetry. It was at this time that Japanese fascism reached a peak, causing an extreme contraction in the literary world and making it hard for many writers to produce work. These historical and literary-historical contexts enabled a sharp awareness of the times and literary response to them; Oh, Jang-hwan frequently used images of nature to compare it with the corruption of civilization, which was seen as its polar opposite. This study begins from an awareness that nature in realism has until now been excluded from the scope of studies of contemporary poetry. At the same time, it explores the meaning of nature as manifested in Oh’s poetry in the 1930s, given that criticism of modernity in Oh’s poetry uses nature as a vehicle. In Oh’s poetry, nature is given two layers of meaning: nature as the world and nature as a symbol of existence. Nature as the world manifests itself strikingly through images of the sea. In Oh’s poetry, harbors, part of land and spaces of modern dilapidation, exist in a relationship with the sea; the fate of a sailor, forced by fate to sail the sea, must be seen as symbolizing, in a higher dimension, the people of that time, who had to live through the 1930s. Images of the sea, which enriches all beings, give visual form to the modern world and its lack of solidity. Additionally, the contemporaries who had to live through the period are represented as a sailor who floated in the ‘sea,’ unable to settle. Meanwhile, through “nature as a being,” Oh embodies beings living in colonial modernity. When he calls the domination of nature by humans a worldview inevitably intertwined with modernity, we know that this worldview is juxtaposed in three dimensions in his works with oppression by colonial capitalism in colonies and with the oppression of women by men, with nature mediating effectively in criticism of modernity. First, in 「Hwawon」 (“Flower garden”) and 「Dokcho」 (“Poisonous herbs”), Oh gave form to the values of nature polluted by humans and civilization. This structure of dominance of nature by humans is given varied embodiments through goldfish and flowers, both confined beings, thus specifically symbolizing modern individuals living in oppression by colonial capitalism. What they have in common is the way they have lost their original, basic vitality and are becoming sick. Images of flowers are connected to sex with women, commodified in 「Oncheonji」(“Hot spring”) and 「Maeeumbu」(“Prostitute”). These images of women are expanded to encompass reptiles, a criticism of modernity, in which sex has been degraded to the value of a commodity. Oh further extends his criticism by also portraying men who consume sex that has been degraded into a commodity as consumers and isolated agents, sidelined by modernity. This indicates that, in the works of Oh Jang-hwan, nature and colonies, and modern people and women, are placed in relationships of equivalence. By juxtaposing the suppression structures of such beings in three dimensions, Oh transcended the boundary between a macroscopic world view and the embodiment of specific beings, delivering effective criticism of colonial modernity. In view of this, nature as manifested in the poetry collections of Oh Jang-hwan can be seen as a vehicle for effectively showing criticisms of modernity, which functioned as a key element of his poems.

TI  - The Meaning of Individuals in Kim Choon-soo’s Poems
TI  - 김춘수 시에서 개인의 의미
T2  - The Korean Poetics Studies
T2  - 한국시학연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - Kim Choon-soo was, among other things, a poet who was clearly aware of the inherent limitations of language but constantly tried to overcome it. And for Kim Choon-soo, the limit of this language was also the limit of the world. He was pushed to the edge of reality by history and ideological violence, but finds forgotten individuals in this tragic world and returns to the center of painful history with them again. This study analyzed this world by applying Jacques Ranciere’s concept of ‘part des sans parts’. This concept is a principle and a process of realization that reconstructs those who have nothing to make up the majority of society into political entities.Kim Choon-soo, who had passed the turbulent times of the Korean War and the liberation period, shows various aspects of the world under the context of violence in history and ideology. First of all, his early poems adhere to the double-contradictory state and tragic worldview. During this period, his poetry uses a tense confrontation between the two poles to create cracks in the existing symbolic order and discover the ‘personal’ hidden in it.Kim Choon-soo then goes through one change, which is important in reaching out to the universals through the “world of his own,” or inner side. This interior is not a combination of the self and the world that could be seen in existing lyric poetry, or through the notion of impermanence, transitory. Through the tragic worldview, we were able to discover the “personal” hidden in it, but it was too much to move on to a “new history”(the universals). Therefore, he is not just calling out the marginalized who are moving away amid the tension of confrontation, but realizing the limitations of such language and accepting its grief, creating an existential space for the others(individuals) to stay intact. What’s notable then is that these things are being done within “the world of oneself,” or within the poet’s. To remember those excluded from reality and stay with them, Kim Chun-soo is similarly excluded from history, opening up his own inner side, which has no effect.The second change is the meaningless poetry. Kim Choon-soo says, “The meaningless poetry is realism, and further realism, which is to reconstruct landscapes and objects to create a space to relate to the others by excluding ideas.” The violence of ideology and history, which Kim Choon-soo has consistently rejected, dissolves individuals’ voices. In this situation, meaningless poetry excludes ideology and reconstructs the existing order that supports the landscape and the object to see what had been hidden. What is not heard, what is intertwined with noise, makes it sound as the language of the poem. In other words, Kim Choon-soo did not flee from the center to the edge of the political one, but returned from the edge to the center again. A meaningless poetry’s space is a place where the concealed one is trimmed into a visible shape, which foretells the arrival of the others. We can only face the incoming the others after going through the process of being conceived through the senses inside my body. Now his poems are directed at individuals, the others. Thus, history as the universals is transformed into a history of individuals.

AB  - Since the introduction of Buddhism to China, Confucianism and Buddhism have undergone a number of theoretical changes in the course of debating and turning each other. The controversy and convergence between Confucianism and Buddhism begins at the end of the East Han and ends in the Song(宋)Â·Meyng(明) Dynasty through the Wei(魏)-Chin(晉), North and South(南北) Dynasties, Sui(隋) and Tang(唐) Dynasties. This paper examines the controversial dispute of the East Chin and North and South Dynasty era, the first major debate between Confucianism and Buddhism, focusing on the discussion of Confucianism. The first issue of the Confucian debate was various, but what was noticed in this paper is that the Buddhist saṃsara(reincarnation)Â·retribution, and it is a critique of Confucianism on the theory of immortality. These are the three core doctrines of Chinese Buddhism, and the confrontation between Confucianism and Buddhism surrounding it is presumed to be the opposite difference between the world view and human view of India, represented by Buddhism, and the worldview and human view of Chinese tradition. And these problems include the problems of philosophical theories such as substantiation and epistemology. This paper focuses on Hechengtian's(何承天) and Fanjin's(范縝) Buddhist rejection of Confucians(排佛論), whose Buddhist rejection of Confucians criticizes religious theology as a philosophical theory. The more thorough was Shenmielun(the theory of divine destruction, 神滅論) of Fanjin's. After Hechengtian and Fanjin, Confucianism and Buddhism enter into a convergence stage, and India's view of the world and humanity are absorbed by theology. The three core tenets of Buddhism persisted in Chinese Buddhism but existed only as a part of religious theology. Based on this fact, I would like to argue that the impact of the India view of the world and humanity on Chinese thought was not so great. This is a preliminary consideration when discussing the mutual influence of Confucianism and Buddhism.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Louise Erdrich’s The Painted Drum is peculiar in the creation of a mythic painted drum and the story’s focus on young children in tragic but respectful elements. The novel reflects the author’s notion of her responsibility as a Native American writer to tell Natives a way to survive and preserve their traditional culture in white society. Especially, the American government’s boarding school policy was fatal in the transmission of cultural heritage to the next generation. Faye’s feeling of living a meaningless life and having no particular interest in her Native cultural heritage, has to be cured through her journey to the reservation in order to find the rightful owner of the painted drum. Bernard’s storytelling is a catalyst in dissolving her hardcore westernized view of life and death. Armed with Ojibwe belief and her new vision, Faye can revitalize her latent identity as a Native and pursue a harmonious life with nature. The ending of the novel shows the manifestation of Erdrich’s wish for the preservation of Native tradition and culture, providing Faye a new perspective on life and a worldview which enables her to heal by promising a hopeful life.

AB  - In this paper, we report the results of the experimental analysis observing the actual pixel variation properties in PolSAR data having various resolutions. Present PolSAR has reached a decimeter-level high resolution. In general, the resolution of PolSAR data is lowered down to 10m-20m in the real space by performing the multi-look process to reduce noise in the pixel values widely for land classification. However, lowering resolution prevents us from discovering new land classes potentially enabled by the resolution enhancement. Through our experiments, we aim to confirm whether it is really meaningful to utilize the respective pixel signals of high-resolution PolSAR data for land classification without any lowering resolution. Although the main cause of the pixel variation occurring in the actual PolSAR data has not been elucidated yet in this letter, we would like to show this experimental results as a material for discussion.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to clarify that character education, based on Taoist philosophy, should be developed into holistic character education. The perennial philosophy that provides the philosophical foundations of holistic education and holism reveals that both Taoist philosophy and holistic education are based on a common worldview. The concept of human character according to <The Promotion of Character Education Law Act> denotes an acquired habit. However, when we consider the cultural traditions of our society, it is necessary to reflect and consider these ideas in relation to character education concerning strong human centrism, humanity established through an atomistic world view, and the acceptance of the self-esteem of an independent society in overlooking the features of an interdependent society. The key to achieving co-existence, which is the aim of character education, was defined as co-esteem, which was found in Taoist philosophy.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Over the last few years, air pollution (PM10, PM2.5) in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) has emerged as one ofthe most concerned and threatening environmental issues among the residents. It brings about various harmful effects on human health, as well as ecosystem and industrial activities. Governments and individuals pay various costs to mitigate the level of air pollutants. This study aims to empirically find the willingness to pays (WTP) among the parents from different socio-cultural groups - international and domestic groups to mitigate air pollution (PM10, PM2.5) in their residential area. Contingent Valuation Methods (CVM) is used with employing single-bounded dichotomous choice technique to elicit the respondent’s WTP. Using tobit (censored regression) and probit models, the monthly mean WTP of the pooled sample for green electricity which contributes to improve air quality in the region was estimated as 3,993 KRW (3.58 USD). However, the mean WTP between the international group and domestic group through a sub-sample analysis shows broad distinction as 3,325KRW (2.98 USD) and 4,449 KRW (3.98 USD) respectively. This is because that socio-cultural characteristics of each group such as socio-economic status, personal experience, trust in institutions and worldview are differently associated with theWTP. Based on the results,the society needs to raise awareness of lay people to find a strong linkage between the current PM issue and green electricity. Also, it needs to improve trust in the government’s pollution abatement policy to mobilize more assertive participation of the people from different socio-cultural background.

AB  - A wildfire could significantly alter the local hydrological regime, depending on the area and severity, and thus it is critical to understand its effect and feedback using data and simulation. For the wildfire in Gangwon-do on April 4-5, 2019, South Korea, we retrieved the Normalized-Burned Ratio (NBR) index using remote-sensing data (500-m 8-day MODIS surface reflectance data), and detect the damaged-area based on the difference in the NBR (dNBR) before and after the fire. The damaged area was 29.50 km2 in total, taking up 1.00-6.19% of five catchments. We then used remote-sensing data (500-m 8-day MODIS evapotranspiration data) and estimated that annual evapotranspiration (AET) would decrease as 0.05-1.56% over the five catchments, as compared to the pre-fire AET (2004-2018). This study highlights the importance of improving our understanding about the impact of wildfire on the local hydrological cycle.

Using Landsat satellite images, it compares NDVI and LST changes between the years of 2008 and 2018. The results of the study are as follows. First, the NDVI has decreased by 0.07 and the zLST has increased by 0.85Â°C over the past 10 years. Second, districts with lower NDVI and higher zLST were concentrated with infrastructure with impermeable materials. Districts with higher NDVI and lower zLST were utilized urban design techniques such as permeable parking lot, green roof, and permeable pavement. Third, districts with higher NDVI and lower zLST were applied eco-friendly planning items properly by district unit plan guideline. It is meaningful to suggest planing directions and urban planning elements considering the environmental friendly development.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to provide a method to apply re-authoring conversation of narrative therapy in the context of Christian counseling. To achieve this goal, it first reviews previous studies on Christian counseling’s application of narrative therapy, and explores the possible ways to apply narrative therapy to Christian counseling. It then analyzes key concepts and therapeutic process of re-authoring conversation by investigating Michael White’s “Liam’s case,” which may be considered one of the best examples of re-authoring conversation. Based on the reviews on current Christian counseling’s approaches to narrative therapy and characteristics of re-authoring conversation, the study suggests four principles for using re-authoring conversation in Christian counseling context; it should be  consistent with christian worldview, needs to focus on client’s problems in making an alternative narrative, should consider the level of client’s Christian faith and biblical knowledge, and should master biblical themes related presenting problems. Guided by these principles, the study provides Christian perspectives on each step of re-authoring conversation, by employing biblical stories, God’s attributes, and God’s divine plan. Finally, it provides the implications of Christian counseling approach discussed in the present study,  which focuses on clinical invervention to solve presenting  problems, and suggests empirical studies in future on the clinical effectiveness of this approach.

AB  - Literature has changed its existence over time. This changes the way in which literary works are educated.Literary works were created to embody the artist's worldview as a whole.In literary education, in order to teach the concept of literature, only part of the work is used as the content of education or other elements of the work are not dealt with.Partially citing a work or emphasizing only certain elements in education to increase literary abilities hinders the correct appreciation of literature.Therefore, there is a need for educational works created for educational purposes to increase literary ability.Educational work is the most typical example of the principles of literature that must be acquired to cultivate the ability to appreciate literature.Educational works are educational texts that use literary concepts as educational contents, thereby creating educational discourses. This makes it possible to teach uniformly the concept of literature that is intended to be an educational content as a work.In this paper, the concept of educational works was established and the ways to use them in the educational field were examined.This attempt points out the limitations of existing educational texts and creates a framework for studying literature's expressions and components in more detail.

AB  - This study was conducted under the judgement that there was a need to make several mentions by reference to studies about the spatial composition of the traditional village. The judgement was not about the dimension that there was a problem about the spatial composition of the existing village but that it would be effective to make a fresh reorganization of it in a little more detail. As a result, this study presented seven spaces in the spatial composition of the traditional village. It attempted to analyze it by dividing it into four spaces such as ① natural space, ② residential space and work space, ③ moving space and boundary space and ④ play space and ritual space to fit its basic nature.First of all, it made a pictorial presentation of the basic form of the spatial composition of the traditional farming village in the late Joseon Dynasty which was most general and whose form has been handed down up to the present. And it described the composition of each space accordingly. It was not intended for a specific village. So it presented the historical change, the behavior of the members surrounding the village and a difference according to the nature of the village, which were judged to be very important in explaining the items of the composition of each space.As a result, it was found that the spatial composition of the traditional Korean village well embodied the framework of their life in terms of their view of nature, lifestyle and worldview. The view of nature acted on the spatial composition of the village as a whole and is well reflected in the natural space in particular. Their lifestyle is reflected in the residential space, farming space, moving space and play space, and their worldview is spcifically mirrored in the boundary space and ritual space. In particular, this study focused on how to take a look at the element of Feng-Shui in discussing the spatial composition of the village.

AB  - The paradigm of missional church emerges in this age of changes, when the traditional ecclesiological paradigm seems to globally persist no more. Such missional ecclesiology also influences Korean churches to contribute to shape Korean contextualization of missional churches. This article is for the evaluation of missional church paradigm of Alan J. Roxburgh, who is one of the well-known experts on missional church, in order to comprehend the strengths of the latest Western understanding of missional church, and to critically reflect its weaknesses. Roxburgh and his co-authors are regarded as the leading professionals who radically challenge the innovation of the traditional church models, and suggest the new North American model of missional church.On one hand, this article tried to explain Roxburgh’s contributions by evaluating his model of missional church through his significant recent writings as follows: the appropriateness of missionality of the future churches, the creative imagination of missional church, the challenge of the concept and application of new place and space, the necessity of the new organization, and the practical action plans of doing missional church. On the other hand, the problems are suggested as the ambiguity of the definition of missional church paradigm, the dualism of attractionality and missionality, the extreme negative approach for the traditional paradigm, and the extreme generalization of missional paradigm, etc.Moreover, this article suggest some solutions as follows: the continuity between the traditional church structures and the missional church models, the pastoral applications by critical contextualizations, the dialectical development of attractional missionality, etc.Consequently, it is significant to attempt the contextualization as well as the proper maintenance of the traditional pastoral model in addition to the missional one, rather than the radical discontinuity of the past models, for the development of missional church paradigm in the future. It should be dealt with the worldview of both/and rather than either/or. Additionally, the issues of place, space, and structure of the missional churches are expected to be researched further in the future context.

AB  - Open Data Cube (ODC) is an open source platform that allows analysis experts to easily and quickly access and process satellite information that observes the earth. The platform is stored and managed in the form of a data tube based on image and time series information including geographic locations. ODC offers modules to ingest a number of free satellites. Data ingestion means the process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database. Developing and providing an ODC-applicable ingestion module directly from the country that owns and operates the satellite increases the value of its use. Korea possesses and operates the multiple KOMPSAT series, a high-resolution optical and SAR satellite images related to Earth observation. Technical methodologies for processing satellite data are important because it is significantly larger as it is collected. ODC is basically a project designed with these considerations, and it is possible to apply the latest technology in how it operates, as well as highly scalable cloud computing technology. Not only is there a commercial, ready-to-use cloud computing services, but there are many technologies that have been released as an open source. With all these aspects, the processing modules to ODC for applying KOMPSAT images to open source cloud computing services were developed in this study. It is expected that KOMPSAT data will be useful to the users of ODC using these scripts and that this case can be referenced by users to build their own cloud services and operate ODC.

TI  - The Characteristics and Implications of Comenius' Notion of Education from the Perspective of Reformed Theology
TI  - 개혁주의 기독교교육관의 관점으로 본 코메니우스의 교육특성과 시사점
T2  - faith & scholarship

M3  - research-article
AB  - The following research explores the impact of John Amos Comenius and his theory on education on contemporary Christian education by evaluating it through the lens of Reformed theology. To this end, it first investigates his theory on education and proceeds to evaluate it from that of Calvin and the followers of New Calvinism.Conclusions that can be drawn from examining Comenius' theory on education include the purpose of education, that all are called by God to learn thoroughly about everything within God's creation. All are especially called to learn about the truth so that they are able to glorify God in not only this life but the next. A comprehensive look at the content of education reveals that one needs to be instructed in the areas of creation, the human, and the kingdom of God. Therefore, an integrative and complex methodology on education is suggested, one that analyzes, synthesizes and compares such concentric theory on nature and sense.When one evaluates Comenius' theory on education against that of Calvin and other Reform theologians, it can be discovered that the purpose of Calvin's theory on education focuses on all being instructed in the ways of faith so that they are led to a confession of faith, salvation, and true sanctification, glorifying God in all they do. When one compares such theory with that of Comenius, who asserted that all are called to glorify God through instruction, it is apparent that both agree on the glorifcation of God as being the end-goal of all education. However, it must be noted that Calvin's undertanding on the purpose of education at once focuses on the instruction of theology for the congregation within the church while the subject of Comenius' theory is education for all of the creation. Therefore, Comenius' comprehensive purpose of education falls more in line with the New Calvinists of the 20th century.The content of Comenius' understanding of education can be said to be a holistic and complex approach to spirituality, virtue, and intellect. This content reflects a reformist worldview that covers all aspects of the created world as Calvin's understanding of education also included spirituality, virtue, and intellect, one that did not neglect all aspects of creation as well as those of the spiritual world. The new Calvinists are also similar in that their education seeks to encompass all aspects and cultures of the created world in accordance with the Christian worldview. The difference between them may be that Comenius had a deep interest in the created world while the reformist New Calvinists had a deeper interest in culture.What Comenius has suggested in terms of the method of education include those of the natural and sensory, concentric, analytic, synthetic, and comparative. Calvin, on the other hand, focused on the methods of the spiral, three-dimensional, and the iterative, aiming at a complete learning experience. The concentric method of Comenius and the spiral method of Calvin can be understood in the same context. However, Comenius' teaching method was more developed in that it was more natural and psychological that can align more effective with modern education. Twentieth-century reformist educators also regarded the teaching methods that match the principles of nature that Comenius discussed as the principle of creation. Therefore, it must be concluded that the methods of education and psychology as outlined by Comenius' theory are in tune with that of Calvin as well as the New Calvinists.Even in the midst of the 4th Industrial Revolution, which is predicted to undergo rapid changes, once one clarifies one's purpose in life as well as the purpose of education through the lens of Reformist worldview, one will be able to acquire a holistic understanding of a biblical worldview in all aspects of education. As the Cultural Mandate is still valid in the age of change, all aspects of the created world must be present in the content of education. Spiral, stereoscopic, and perfect learning methods are useful in that they can lead one to understand the core of the Gospel even before the present epochal change.

This study reveals North Korea’s psychological goal of “Revolutionary talent of knowledge economy possessing logical thinking ability and ability to work with people” and searched for North Korean psychology.Psychology emerged in 1953, abolished in 1954, and reopened in 2003 in accordance with the North Korean Education Act enactment and amendment. Since 2000, North Korea has emphasized globalization and scientific development and suggested the need for psychological education. As a result, the authorities in North Korea introduced psychology to the entire curriculum, attempted to establish a psychological system of ours, and revealed the will to build a tool for thought verification through psychological evaluation beyond understanding the mind of a person. In addition, we pursued logical thinking and education programs that strengthened the revolutionary worldview.

To this end, the research trends between 2013 and 2017 were used. Especially, I put a significant value on understanding the ecological education of children based on passage rites. As result, the three main findings were found in this study.First, 23 practical study (92.3%) are higher than basic study (7.69%). Second, the objects in the literature (10 with 38.46%) had 10 cases. Third, the studies on the ecological education of children still remain among the fields of philosophy or thought. Fourth, other fields of studies showed the following: Literary study (10 with 38.46%) >interview study (5 with 19.23%) >case study (3 with 11.53%) >referential study (1 with 3.84%). Among those, the literary study proved to be the mail study. Lastly, in terms of the passage rites, we know that the change in the social and ecological worldview is not supported in the maturing period. Therefore, a change in the paradigm is not encouraged and we do not expect the possibility of durable development through policies for solutions to social problems.

AB  - This study looks at the significance of the African worldview by finding the central features of the African tribal society and focusing on the human-centered worldview of small-scale tribe. The African tribal worldview, for example, is aptly manifested in the spirit of Ubuntu. Some distinct characteristics in a group-oriented society have a lot to do with human beings, ancestors, gods, spirits, animals and nature, which lead to an animistic worldview. The evaluations of the African tribal worldviews should be accomplished through biblical worldview. The four highest virtues of the tribe Wolof in Senegal, jom, mun, kolere and teranga, as well as the cultural concept of mbongui by the Congolese Brazibille theological seminary students, are presupposed to be evaluated and transformed through biblical contextualization.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influence of Western knowledge, ideas, beliefs and religions on the Chinese knowledge society in the 16th century.China in the sixteenth century was exposed to various problems, and the surrounding nations were growing as potential threats by building up their powers and forming an unstable political state by losing control of civilization in politics, economy, knowledge, ideas and ideas. .Ideologically, at that time, China began to take notice of Yangming, which acknowledges individual freedoms, denying strict bondage and suppression as an alternative to mannersism and negative tendencies in the neo-Confucianism.This situation was to create a free atmosphere that would allow us to find interesting ideas and ideas out of a strict ideological atmosphere, and Mateo Ricci's knowledge and ideas were enough to attract the Chinese knowledge society.In the case of astronomy, the notion of heaven and earth in the Chinese tradition(天圓地方) was the worldview of the Chinese tradition and the foundation of all knowledge systems and powers.When Western astronomy showed that "the sky is not round and the ground is not square", the Chinese who had been confident in the center of civilization had to experience (or worry) the collapse of all values and knowledge.In the case of world maps, on the western world map, China is not a central country that occupies most of the world, and the surrounding ethnic groups are not a small country located at the end of the world but a huge nation with a width equal to or greater than that of China, Empires have been shown to exist.In terms of space, the relationship between 'center and periphery', 'civilization and barbarians' could not be established, and the title of Chinese as a unique and exclusive civilization could no longer be maintained.The influx of Western astronomy and world maps was not only a substitute for the notion of heaven and earth of Chinese tradition, but it destroyed all the knowledge and ideology of China, the foundation of political power and knowledge power.It transformed China in the center of the world into China in some parts of the world. It also brought about a great change in the civilization map of culture and savagery. There is no place under the king's kingdom, It was also breaking down on the notion that there is no one.

AB  - This thesis examined the social influence of knowledge centering on Buddhist criticism and mind theory of Sambong. Knowledge is not inherited or created by itself, but always created and handed down by intellectuals. Therefore, the mode of social existence of knowledge is intellectual. This study selected Sambong as a representative of these intellectuals, and discussed the significance and purpose of Buddhist criticism, the structure of Sambong's Mind theory, and the characteristics of Sambong's Mind theory. As a result of this discussion, the following reason could be derived.First, socialization of knowledge has its own contradictions. Knowledge power is caused by the imbalance of knowledge, and ideal of knowledge socialization destroys the knowledge power itself by offsetting the imbalance of knowledge itself.Second, Buddhist criticism of Sambong provides ideological legitimacy of reform in that it takes rationality and objectivity. In order to correct corrupt power in Sambong's view, it was not a purification of Buddhist ideas but a new objective idea. The worldview of neo-Confucianism was to meet such a demand.Third, the core of the history perspective planned by Sambong is 'rationality' and 'development'. Revolution of Goryeo and the establishment of a new country ultimately means to carry out 'the development of society by rational ideology'. In this respect, neo-Confucianism  could be the ideological motive for the construction of a new dynasty pursued by Sampong.Fourth, the relationship between knowledge and society is not new. The eight items of <Great Learning> show already a series of processes in which personal knowledge spreads to society. The Confucian tradition implies that the ethical cultivation of individuals given to intellectuals can not be different from the principle of state operation. In this context, it is reasonable to conclude that the structure of Sambong's mind theory and the structure of the political system that he plans are equal.

AB  - This paper offers a comprehensive examination of how affect and affective languages work in the poetry of Joy Harjo, particularly focusing on her 1990 poetry collection, In Mad Love and War. After briefly summarizing important concepts of affect theory, this paper presents affect as closely associated with bodily functions that influence and produce emotional responses of a subject who interacts with other subjects and particular circumstances. Many poems in In Mad Love and War such as “Grace,” “Deer Dancer,” “Bird,” “A Hard Rain,” “City of Fire,” “Nine Below” represent various aspects of affective functions that include the encounters and collisions between the individual subjects, the interactions between the individual subject and the collective subject, and the relationship between the subject and language. This work, however, is not intended to support a simplified analysis or easy application that fits the poetry of Harjo with the particular identity of Native American into the framework of the mainstream theory of affection. To avoid such a one-side approach, this paper specifically examines the intersections between important concepts of affect theory and Harjo’s poems in the context of feminist perspectives, Native worldview and colonial history.

AB  - Classification of a ship based on satellite imagery usually results differently depending on the type of polarization used in image generation. Also, the different ship's orientation in each image degrades the performance of image-based classification. Given these points, Sentinel-1 data also needs some methods to classify the type of ship. For the classification, we have produced a ship dataset, KIOST-OpenSARShip, which was modified from the OpenSARShip dataset. We compared the brightness of each pixel of ship images generated by different polarizations. Based on this, we created a new image dataset. Then, we increased the similarity between ship images of the same type by aligning the heading direction in the ship images. As a result, our new datasets improve classification performances in some cases compared to using the OpenSARShip. The results of composite images from the VV- and VH-polarized images show up to 19.34% higher accuracy than those using only the one polarized images. In the future, we will improve the performance of the ship classification method considering various characteristics of the ship.

AB  - This study used satellite image and topographical data simultaneously to identify and verify the areas flooded in Yeongdeok-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Korea, as a result of Typhoon Kong-Rey. The satellite image data were obtained from ESA Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and PlanetLab's PlanetScope optical imagery. The topographical data used to identify the depth and extent of the flooding was Digital Surface Model (DSM) data obtained through drone surveying, with resolutions of 0.02 m, 0.1 m, 0.5 m, 1 m, 3 m, 5 m, and 10 m. The area with a large color difference before and after the flooding was designated the primary flooded area. The area that was identified as lower than the primary flooded area, according to the topography data, was determined as the final flooded area. The accuracy was calculated by the intersection versus union method. It increased as the resolution of the topographical data increased and ranged between 62 and 97 percent, depending on the analysis area. In the case of flat areas of land, SAR images showed high accuracy and in the case of areas with densely-placed buildings, optical satellite images showed high accuracy.

AB  - This essay deals with the problem of evil in Pierre Bayle’s philosophy, which motivated Leibniz’s Theodicy, which is represented as a book on evil in Western modern philosophy. Bayle claims the impossibility of theodicy or defense and sees the existence of evil as a real human condition. Bayle shows that we cannot accept the problem of evil by reason and accept it as faith.From this point of view, criticism of metaphysical, moral, and physical evils is made according to the distinction of evil that is generally dealt with in Bayle. Bayle confines the problem of being to human beings with respect to metaphysical evils, and emphasizes the omnipresent evil of the human world throughout human history. In regard to the moral evil, sin, which deals with the problem of the acceptance of sin, Bayle sees the acceptance of sin as divine will. But it does not turn the problem of human sin into God’s responsibility. For Bayle, the problem of sin is a matter of the individual, summed up as a matter of conscience. With regard to physical evil and suffering, Bayle thoroughly criticizes theories that try to deal with individual suffering and view it as a greater good. Bayle has questioned human conditions through insightful perceptions of reality in times of optimistic worldview.

AB  - This paper aims to examine two plays from the National Theater Company's ‘Samkukyusa(三國遺事) Project’ focusing on the intertextuality with myths, the reinterpretation of myths, the rewriting of myths, and the the presentization of myths.What is special about the myth rewriting of Dream is Lee Kwang-Su's dream scene. It uses a fragmentation strategy that overturns the ‘Josin’s dream’ and weaves figures and quotes from different levels. This dream scene connects myths and history, and uses them as a symbol of the real world and history and as a symbolic model of the main narrative. However, Josin's plot and Lee's plot have the commonality of 'dream', but they are more heterogeneous than the allegorical analogy of the two. Myths and historical life clash, and mythical worldview antagonizes the historical perception of pro-Japanese activity. The extremely sensitive issue of ‘pro-Japanese’ overwhelmed the multi-layered semantic structures and mythological symbols.Lost in Namsan consists of metaphorical overlaps between ancient and modern life, trying to give the mythical aura and poetic symbolism to the familiar narrative of sacrifice and frustration of dreams of workers in the age of industrial capitalism. This play presents the dialogue of myth and modern age in which the past and the present refer to each other, reality and fantasy, and the play and reality stare at each other. However, in the way of accepting myths, rather than reinventing mythological motifs and main narrative into organic structure, it used a simple way of connecting the narratives with modern narratives through the subtitles describing myth.Taking motifs from a myth and writing a work does not simply use the myth as a material or an idea, but requires an in-depth analysis of the meaning, structure, and worldview of the myth. It is to recreate the story.The presentization of myth goes beyond the simple acceptance or transformation of myths, and includes the mythical symbols, allegory, mythological narrative structure, cyclical worldview, and archetypes in the context of narrative, so that they can be appeared in modern everyday life. It shows that myths still persist.Just as Samkukyusa contains myths, histories and fantasies, history is born from myth, history creates myth, and present life becomes one of myth someday.In other words, the presentization of myth is achieved when the work embodies that modern life is equivalent to the mythical world.

AB  - There are few reports on the field of adjuvant radiotherapy in thymic tumors. We evaluated the clinical outcomes of local radiotherapy and elective nodal irradiation in 47 patients with stage Ill to IV thymomas or stage II to IV thymic carcinomas. The benefit of elective nodal irradiation seemed not to be predominant over local radiotherapy, so elective nodal irradiation should not be recommended routinely.Introduction: We evaluated the clinical outcome of patients with stage III to IV thymomas (Ts) or stage II to IV thymic carcinomas (TCs) treated with complete thymectomy and local radiation therapy (LRT, targeting the tumor bed and anterior mediastinal areas only) or elective nodal irradiation (ENI, targeting the entire mediastinal and supraclavicular regions). Materials and Methods: Data from 47 patients diagnosed with Ts or TCs and treated with surgery and adjuvant RT from May 2002 to May 2015 were analyzed. The standard RT dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions; patients with a positive resection margin received a further 4 to 10 Gy. Survival outcomes determined at 5 years included local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival. Results: Five-year local recurrence-free survival was similar in both groups (LRT, 94.7% vs. ENI, 96.2%; P = .849). Significant differences were seen in 5-year regional recurrence-free survival (LRT, 55.1% vs. ENI, 83.7%; P = .006); however, tumor size was seen to be a significant factor (< 7 cm, 95.2% vs. >= 7 cm, 48.9%; P < .001), and the LRT group contained a greater proportion of patients with >= 7-cm tumors (70% vs. 33%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor size was the only significant prognostic factor (P < .001). No differences in 5-year overall survival were seen (LRT, 91.7% vs. ENI, 100%; P = .106). Conclusion: ENI may not be indicated in all cases, as additional benefit in reducing recurrence or improving survival was not predominant. LRT seems to be a feasible option with favorable patient outcomes. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Derald Wing Sue proposes a world view schema with two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates around the control and responsibilities. Control is composed of internal control and external control, and responsibility is internal responsibility and external responsibility. Through this, he presents four types and types of counseling strategies. In particular, this focuses on multicultural counseling.David W. Augsburger introduces Sue's world view schema and introduces the two continuums of control and accountability as important pairs for healing, growth, and functioning as healthy human beings. In this context, we propose additional value and identity materials. I can see that the value material and the identity material added by Oxberger can be reduced to autonomous reaction and dependent reaction in terms of reaction.This study proposes world view coordinates using three dimensional Cartesian coordinates by adding a reaction material modified by Oxberger's proposal to the world view schema of the number using two dimensional Cartesian coordinates. Coordination of world views is an extension of the world view that eliminates misunderstandings about clients in the context of mutually subjective counseling and enables correct understanding. The world view coordinates extend the four worldview types proposed by the world view schema into 8 world view types by using the three dimensional Cartesian coordinates. The world view coordinates not only the type of world view of the client, but also the counseling strategy for each type as well as the view of the world view.

AB  - Monitoring land subsidence is important to prevent and manage disasters. The extent of land subsidence can be measured by various ways and one of them is PSI technique. Guatemala City has geologically weak structure and suffered from disasters such as sinkhole and landslide. The purpose of this study was to measure wide range of relative movement in Guatemala City and to analyze obtained values. C-band Sentinel-1 A/B data during November 2014 to March 2018 were used in this study. By gathering information from both ascending and descending paths, relative movements were decomposed from line of sight of each path to vertical and horizontal component. As a result 4 regions in Guatemala City showed significant subsidence patterns with average vertical movement going down with a scale of 14 mm/year.

AB  - Remote sensing is a means to gather information about distant objects without directly being in contact with them. The development of artificial satellites in the 20th century allowed remote sensing to progress to a global scale and to be utilized for broader goals, especially commercial ones.As remote sensing imaging and distribution technology advances, commercial users will be choosing from arrays of precise, geographically-accurate imagery. The imagery will be less expensive and delivered in digital formats that are easier to use and duplicate. Undoubtedly, as the accessibility increases, the likelihood that commercial satellite imagery will be used in unsanctioned military or terrorist operations also increases.Satellite remote sensing has evolved from being an activity restricted to a limited number of states, which operated remote sensing satellites and benefited from the resulting data, to a present environment characterized not only by an increasing number of states operating remote sensing satellites and benefiting from their products, but also by the active role played by intergovernmental organizations and private companies.The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the complicated legal issues surrounding satellite remote sensing, especially focusing commercial legal issues. This paper analyzes relevant international and national rules and policies with respect to satellite remote sensing. Also, this discusses some legal issues of commercialization in satellite remote sensing systems by comparing international and national regimes. Ultimately, it supposes that new legislation of satellite remote sensing is necessary for effective operational management and appropriate regulation of satellite remote sensing systems in Korea.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to measure the cooling effect of forests on the surrounding areas using GIS analysis techniques. To achieve the research purpose, I selected the area surrounding Cheongju Industrial Complex in Cheongju city and downloaded Landsat 8 data for this area. First, the LST (Land Surface Temperature) value and the UCI (Urban Cool Island) value were obtained using Landsat 8 images. Also, several geospatial analysis techniques were used to measure the cooling effect of forests on the surrounding areas. 3D visualization, profile analysis, and Valley Depth techniques have been found to be very useful in vividly expressing the cooling effect of forests on the surrounding areas. As a result of the analysis, the size of the wood, the distance to the forest, the vegetation density of the woods, and the distance between forests were proved to be the factors that greatly influenced the cooling effect of the wood on the surrounding areas. In particular, the distance between forests can be used as an essential indicator for understanding the synergistic cooling impact of neighboring forests on the surrounding areas. The result of this study can be used as valuable reference material for managing forests and green spaces in the future.

M3  - Article
AB  - The implementation of mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns of albendazole (400 mg) and ivermectin (150-200 mu m/kg) since 2001 has helped to change the epidemiological profile of lymphatic filariasis (LF) in many health districts in Burkina Faso. From 2002 to 2016, 14 rounds of MDA have taken place in the Central East zone, with therapeutic coverage exceeding 65%.The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of MDA in the fight against LF at 12 sentinel and spot-check sites. This descriptive cross-sectional study surveyed subjects aged 5 years and older between April and July 2017 at these 12 sites. The blood smear performed on nocturnal samples was used to diagnose Wuchereria bancrofti infection.The study included 4364 subjects. Their mean age was 20.55 years with a standard deviation of 14.22 and a range of 5 to 96 years. The overall prevalence of microfilaremia was 0.62% (27/4364), with rates exceeding 1% at three (3) sites. The average microfilaremia density was 106 mu f/mL. The overall prevalence of morbidity was low (0.91%), predominantly lymphedema (0.60%).The MDA strategy has helped to reduce the prevalence of LF significantly in Burkina Faso, but some outbreaks still have microfilarial prevalence greater than 1%. Continuation of the additional 2-year strategy with improved adherence to treatment and vector control would help break LF transmission.

AB  - This paper considers how concepts drawn from scientific inquiry inform our understanding of history, and more specifically, the discourse of civilization. Its intent is to explore how terms with origins in Early Modern and Enlightenment era scientific thought became part of the lexicon which we still use to describe social, political and economic conditions. Words like Power, Force, Mass, and Energy are integral to our understanding of the world and the idea of civilization that frames our impressions of it. Similarly, concepts like Order and Chaos also have a profound impact on our worldview, and are fundamental to our perception of civilization as a concept. By exploring how these words came to be used to describe society as it was developing in the 16th-19th centuries, we can better appreciate how our present understanding of the world is shaped by the historical forces that were unleashed during this important period. Through an examination of the words we use to explain the world we live in, and inquiring as to how their origins inform and shape our perspectives of it, we can begin to appreciate how truly subjective our understanding of the world really is. In doing so, we can more fully understand a historical past before such language was prevalent, and also begin to conceive of a future which moves beyond it.

AB  - This study performed to simulate the watershed storm runoff using data of S-band dual-polarization radar rain, GPM (Global Precipitation Mission) satellite rain, and observed rainfall at 21 ground stations operated by KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration) respectively. For the 3 water level gauge stations (Sancheong, Changchon, and Namgang) of NamgangDam watershed (2,293 km2), the KIMSTORM2 (KIneMatic wave STOrm Runoff Model2) was applied and calibrated with parameters of initial soil moisture contents, Manning’s roughness of overland and stream to the event of typhoon CHABA (82 mm in watershed aveprage) in 5th October 2016. The radar and GPM data was corrected with CM (Conditional Merging) method such as CM-corrected Radar and CM-corrected GPM. The CM has been used for accurate rainfall estimation in water resources and meteorological field and the method combined measured ground rainfall and spatial data such as radar and satellite images by the kriging interpolation technique. For the CM-corrected Radar and CM-corrected GPM data application, the determination coefficient (R2) was 0.96 respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) was 0.96 and the Volume Conservation Index (VCI) was 1.03 respectively. The CM-corrected data of Radar and GPM showed good results for the CHABA peak runoff and runoff volume simulation and improved all of R2, NSE, and VCI comparing with the original data application. Thus, we need to use and apply the radar and satellite data to monitor the flood within the watershed.

Two results have good agreement in general. The PO measurements with very high cross correlation coefficients agree well with the MAI measurements. The PO method probably performs as good as the MAI, if the cross correlation coefficients are well considered.

M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) performance may get degraded due to component degradation, aging, thermal variations of the environment and so on. Performance degradation should be corrected when the spaceborne SAR is in orbit. Calibration is implemented on the radar imagery by radiometric calibration which gives the relationship between digital number and backscattering coefficient. Radiometric calibration gives calibration constant, which is the key parameter to convert the SAR digital numbers into backscattering coefficient. With radiometrically calibrated image, the performance of one sensor can be compared with other sensors through multiple acquisitions to improve quantitative analysis of SAR performance. Radiometric calibration is done by ground deployed corner reflectors (CR). CRs have well-known radar cross sections, and hence, the derived radar cross sections from the SAR image are compared with the theoretical RCS to characterize the SAR sensor. An attempt is made to study the effectiveness of calibration, using different combination of CRs (various sizes and shapes) by deploying CR's in the Jain Global institutionsJGI global Campus, Jakkasandra, Bangalore, and average sigma-naught (sigma(0)) is estimated through multiple acquisitions of Sentinel-1A. Sentinel-1A was launched by European Space agency in 2014, having SAR as a payload. Sentinel-1A is an open source system which operates in four different modes with different resolution schemes. In this paper, Interferometric Wide swath mode of Sentinel-1A is used as that particular mode of acquisition is available over Jain Global campus. This paper presents the general criteria for selection of CRs and the measures taken during deployment. Integral method is used to estimate the calibration coefficient of Sentinel SAR data with different interpolation factors.

T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the study resides in certain aspects of a creative history of Lermontov's poem "Demon" in their accordance with the whole idea of the author. The emphasis of the article is placed on Demon's song "as soon as the night with veil her...", Tamara's portrait given in the 6th and the 8th editions, an episode of salvation of her soul. The poem "When the flavescent fields swing in the wind..." is seen as a contrasting allusion to the seductive song of the Demon. God's all-presence in the poem is contrasted to the conformity and limitations of existence and the demon's promises. The comparison of the Demon's song with the poem allows revealing an artistic and conceptual discrepancy between the editions of 1838 (the 6th) and of 1839 (the 8th). The Demon's song appeared in the 6th edition of the poem made it necessary to change the ending of the plot, which was proposed in the 8th edition. As a result, the change of the ending of the plot conditioned the essencial editing of the portrait of Tamara in the 8th edition compared to that one in the 6th edition. 'the passion of the character was replaced by the image of an infant soul the beauty of which is seen through the earthly image of Tamara, as an example of the created perfection. The poem of M. Yu. Lermontov "Angel" (1831) used for the analysis of the Demon, the periphrasis of which is most clearly seen in the ending of the 8th edition, is considered as a part of the poem's conception. It is concluded that the 8th edition reflects in a comprehensive and consistent way the worldview of M. Yu. Lermontov, his belief in the omnibenevolecence of the Creator and the Supreme intelligence of the universe.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article gives a holistic understanding of Lermontov's poem "Dispute" (1841) in the dynamics of its birth from conception to publication in the journal of Slavophile orientation "Moskvityanin." Creative history of the poem for the first time is fully reconstructed. The results of a comparative analysis of the draft and two finishing manuscripts of the poem having minor discrepancies between are presented. The reasons and mechanisms of Lermontov's text corrections, which help to understand the movement of the author's thought, are indicated. The conclusion is made about the peculiarities of artistic imagery of the poem. The process of Lermontov's work on the text is associated with the saturation of specific images with symbolic sound. The artistic image created by the poet is the bearer of the pan-Slavic concept. The novelty of the study is associated with the clarification of the features of the birth and impact of poetic imagery of Lermontov's poem significant for understanding his worldview. The urgency of the problem is associated with the need to clarify the features of Lermontov's thinking; his work, being a reflection of the real pictures of his time, has a visionary potential. The question of Lermontov's historiosophy is raised, his views on the role of Russia in the world historical process are clarified. Russia is portrayed by Lermontov as a great empire which power is likened to elemental force, exceeding capacity of once historically significant states.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cervical sarcomas are extremely rare neoplasms associated with younger age, advanced stage, and poorer prognosis relative to cervical carcinomas. Carcinosarcoma is the most frequently observed cervical sarcoma subtype, while leiomyosarcomas are exceedingly rare subtypes, with only a small number of cases reported in the English language literature. Cervical leiomyosarcoma patients present most commonly with abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, and/or abdominal and pelvic pain. Due to their rarity, data regarding these tumors typically come from case reports and small case series, and treatment strategies are often adapted from data for uterine sarcomas. Here the authors report the clinical findings from a case of unusual asymptomatic leiomyosarcoma arising in the uterine cervix and treated with a laparoscopic approach.

AB  - The assessment of the vegetation growth rate given remote sensing data is a challenging task in the Earth Observation sciences. LiDAR data acquisition is commonly used to extract height information at a given moment in time, however, the associated cost and complexity restrict continuous acquisitions. Frequently captured aerial imagery can be used to identify and separate vegetation from bare land, water, impervious surface, or built infrastructure. A combination of LiDAR data with aerial and radar imagery allows to track dynamic seasonal growth of vegetation around critical infrastructure such as power lines. We present a general framework that integrates tree identification and growth assessment around power lines with the goal to identify locations of high risk where trees potentially cause power outages.

AB  - The article analyses the current state of Russian scientific economic periodicals, defines the purposes of scientific journals publishing articles on Economics and Economic Sciences, in light of the problems of the Russian economy development. The role of "packaging" the scientific articles in the form of journal issues, which facilitates the reader's orientation in the world of scientific publications, is shown. The necessity of maintaining and expanding the populations of specialised and general economic journals as a kind of intermediary between readers and authors is substantiated. Particular attention is paid to the mission of the economic journal as a carrier of reliable knowledge. The necessity of demythologisation of the Russian economic discourse, i.e. the rejection of a number of popular theoretical concepts that are uncritically and extensively used to solve practical economic problems is one of the tasks of the scientific periodicals. The expediency of coordinating the activities of the leading domestic economic journals and the creation of an association of such publications is explained. The functions of such an association may include: coordination of the activities of Russian economic journals in the field of preparation of publications on Economics and Economic Sciences; development of recommendations on changing (expanding or narrowing) the composition of journals publishing articles on Economics and Economic Sciences, taking into account the classification of journals; development of recommendations on determining the quality of publications and the quality of journals; improvement of the quality of articles' review by creating a single base of reviewers, etc.

TI  - Child Maltreatment Red Flags: Two Cases of Bruising in Premobile Infants
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Child maltreatment is a serious public health concern in the United States. Young infants and children younger than 3 years are at the highest risk of being abused and can experience both acute injuries and long-term developmental, behavioral, and mental health problems. Health care providers are mandated reporters of suspected abuse but may misdiagnose potentially abusive injuries because of lack of knowledge in recognizing maltreatment. Premobile infants rarely have bruising or intraoral injuries without a reported accident or underlying systemic disease and should raise concern for abuse. It is not uncommon for an abused child to present with an injury that at first glance may seem trivial but is actually suspicious for physical abuse and later be found to have abusive fractures or head trauma. The following case presentations show the importance of recognizing sentinel injuries and red flags for maltreatment in young, premobile infants with unexplained bruises.

TI  - An evaluation of remotely sensed indices for quantifying burn severity in arid ecoregions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is sometimes assumed the sparse and low statured vegetation in arid systems would limit the effectiveness of two remote-sensing derived indices of burn severity: the difference Normalised Burn Ratio (dNBR) and relativised difference Normalised Burn Ratio (RdNBR). Wecompared the relationship that dNBR, RdNBR and a ground-based index of burn severity (the Composite Burn Index, CBI) had with woody cover and woody density 1 year after burning in five fires that occurred in the Mojave Desert during 2005. Data were collected within 437 plots spanning geographic and elevation gradients representative of vegetation associations in low- (,1200 m), mid- (1200 to 1700 m) and high-elevation (.1700 m) zones. Statistically, dNBR and RdNBR were both effective measures of severity in all three elevation zones; woody cover and density had steep exponential declines as the values of each remote-sensing index increased. We found though that dNBR was more ecologically interpretable than RdNBR and will likely be of most relevance in the Mojave Desert. It will be necessary though to test these, as well as other remote-sensing burn-severity indices, across more desert regions before inferences can be made of the generality of the patterns we observed.

TI  - The Materiality of Myth: Divine Objects in Norse Mythology
T2  - TEMENOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vivid presence of material objects in Scandinavian cosmology, as preserved in the Old Norse myths, carries underexplored traces of belief systems and the material experience of Iron Age Scandinavia (400-1000 CE). This paper proposes an archaeological reading of Norse mythology to help explain how ancient Scandinavians understood the presence and role of deities, magic, and the supernatural in everyday life. The Norse myths retain records of material objects that reinforced Scandinavian oral traditions and gave their stories power, memory, and influence. From Thor's hammer and Freyja's feathered cloak to Sigyn's bowl and Ran's net, such materials and the stories they colour are informed by everyday objects of Iron Age life - spun with the magic, belief, and narrative traditions that made them icons. The mythic objects promoted a belief system that expected and embraced the imperfections of objects, much like deities. These imperfections in the divine Norse objects and the ways in which the gods interact with their materials are part and parcel of the Scandinavian religious mentality and collective social reality. This work ultimately questions the relationship between materiality and myth, and seeks to nuance our current understandings of the ancient Scandinavian worldview based on the available textual evidence.

AB  - Urban green spaces, as a means to mitigate social problems and environmental risks, are getting more attention in evaluating urban environment. The inequity of green space distribution is becoming a major issue in urban planning and management. This study investigated the characteristics of green space in 3 districts (Jung-gu, Dongdaemun-gu, Seongdong-gu), that are composed of 46 administrative divisions in central Seoul, to analyze the environmental equity of urban green spaces. The correlations between the amount of green space, including the coverage of street trees, and the socioeconomic status of each administrative division were analyzed. To deduce the effects of plant coverage on the urban temperature regime, the relationship between the normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) was analyzed. The research revealed that the mean NDVI of an administrative division was negatively correlated with the percentage of basic living recipients and disabled people. The LST of a division with low NDVI was higher due to the lack of green coverage. Such environmental inequities were closely related to residential building type, which was strongly affected by the economic status of residents. The LST of an apartment area was 2.0Â°C lower than that of single-family houses and multi-housing areas. This is expected as the average NDVI of the apartment area was more than twice as high as the other environments considered in this study. The inequity can be exacerbated without urban planning which is deliberately designed to reduce it.

TI  - Characteristics of Subpatent Malaria in a Pre-Elimination Setting in Southern Zambia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve and sustain malaria elimination, identification and treatment of the asymptomatic infectious reservoir is critical. Malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are frequently used to identify asymptomatic, Plasmodium-infected individuals through test-and-treat strategies, but their sensitivity is low when used in low transmission settings. Characteristics of individuals with subpatent (RDT-negative but polymerase chain reaction [PCR]-positive) Plasmodium parasitemia were evaluated in southern Zambia where malaria transmission has declined and efforts to achieve malaria elimination are underway. Simple random sampling based on satellite imagery was used to select households for participation in community-based, cross-sectional surveys between 2008 and 2013. Questionnaires were administered to collect information on age, gender, recent history of malaria symptoms, and recent antimalarial drug use. Blood samples were collected by finger prick for Plasmodium falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 RDT, blood smears for microscopy, and dried blood spots for molecular analysis to detect malaria parasites and their sexual stage. Of 3,863 participants with complete data, 102 (2.6%) were positive by microscopy, RDT, or PCR. Of these, 48 (47%) had subpatent parasitemia. Most individuals with subpatent parasitemia were asymptomatic (85%). Compared with individuals without parasitemia, individuals with subpatent parasitemia were significantly more likely to be aged 5-25 years. Approximately one quarter (27%) of those with subpatent parasitemia had detectable gametocytemia. These findings suggest that strategies based on active or reactive case detection can identify asymptomatic individuals positive by RDT, but more sensitive diagnostic tests or focal drug administration may be necessary to target individuals with subpatent parasitemia to achieve malaria elimination.

AB  - A combination use of multiple SAR satellites can achieve frequent monitoring. This paper exemplified a combination use of ALOS-2 and other satellites for observation of volcanic activities in Japan. SAR data analysis for the 2015 Hakone volcano eruption showed that the time evolution of a local ground deformation could be achieved by combining ALOS-2 observations with those of RADARSAT-2. On the other hand, monitoring lava growth inside the crater of Shinmoedake volcano during its eruption in 2018 was realized by combining the intensity images of ALOS-2 and COSMO-Skymed (CSK) to provide high temporal resolution at a minimum interval of six hours. The interval was achieved by a combination of a noon-midnight orbit (ALOS-2) and a dusk-dawn orbit (CSK). Thus, the limited observation interval and data acquisition times for a single satellite can be effectively solved by the combination use of multiple SAR satellites.

AB  - Experimental study of efficiency of the radar data interferometric processing algoritluns is complicated by the fact that a quantitative result can be obtained only after the entire processing procedure is finished. So it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of the individual processing stages, i.e, the multilooking, phase noise suppression. For accuracy estimation at such steps, method of the reference digital elevation model inverse transformation is proposed and tested on ALOS PALSAR data samples.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing average air temperatures and the change of climate elements pose negative threats to human and its life. Human beings develop different methods and plans to eliminate and minimize the threats that occur. Satellite imagery is the tool of these methods and plans. Through existing satellite imagery, land surface temperatures and land uses are determined by remote sensing methods to provide sustainable planning. Surface temperatures of the land are such a parameter that concerns the climate, fauna, flora and interaction of human beings with the environment. This study aimed to establish the bond between the surface temperature of the land and the different land uses. The data was collected from Erzurum province, which is located in Turkey, with a surface area of 25066 km(2). Thermal Band data obtained from four different dates which represents the four seasons and Coordination of Information on the Environment (CORINE) Land Cover (CLC) maps were digitized and interpreted statistically in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) package program. The results showed that forest areas 12.2 degrees C, water surfaces 13.8 degrees C, agricultural areas 17.9 degrees C, open areas 15.7 degrees C and residential areas 18.7 degrees C has average surface temperature values. Statistically, the bonds between land uses and other variables were evaluated using Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) analysis. As a result, this study will contribute planners and decision makers develop climate-sensitive strategies and policies regarding basin planning and urban planning.

TI  - CHINGIZ AITMATOV'S FICTIONAL WORLD
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - In Aitmatov's works, there are three dimensions of reality. The first one is that of the modern or recent history that conveys the element of transformation, changeability, and fragility. The second one relates to the characters: for all their individuality, there is a basic archetypical human principle polarized between the good and the evil, that shines through all of them. The most significant level is the third one that gives sense of inner unity to Aitmatov's diverse works: this is something unchanging, transpersonal, combined of mythology and archetypes that are not subject to historical change - e.g. the national worldview model. Space represented as an open and positively charged space plays the major role in this model. The fictional space in Aitmatov's works has two distinct mythological features: it is primordial and infinite. The peculiarity of this vertical (heaven/earth) spatial structure is in that the Kyrgyz writer perceives heaven and earth in terms of organic unity. His worldview is complete, there is no opposition or hierarchy within it that distinguishes it from the mythological world pattern: the latter, as a rule, was organized according to the hierarchical principle, e.g. the underworld, earth, and heaven. Aitmatov's worldview is imbued with the spirit of animism; he widely uses mythological motifs of metempsychosis and zoomorphism in his fiction. Distant past has indispensable value for the author and his characters: it acts in a dual function, as the most important means of national self-identification and as an ethical measure. The life of Aitmatov's positive characters falls into two dimensions of time - historical and mythological, However these two dimensions do not oppose each other, they are easily and organically combined within the artistic fabric of the text as well as in the consciousness and life of the characters themselves.

T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyses forest reference level in terms of loss, gain and transitions among forest, cocoa agroforestry, cassava, maize, settlement and others in the Kloto district (Togo) for REDD+ and sustainable forest and agriculture. The pixel-based classification was adopted and combined with the extended change matrix quantity and intensity analysis using 32-year (1985-2017) Landsat data and land use information from land owners and farmers. Results indicate an active forest loss (19.5%) with dormant gain (0.8%). Forest is involved in most transitions as the most targeted category with the largest transition being a forest to cocoa agroforestry while the avoiding transition was from forest, cocoa agroforestry, maize, cassava and settlement to unclassified classes (e.g. road, water body) and vice versa. Other targeting categories were from forest to settlement, cassava and maize Thus, both cash and food crops are major contributors of forest loss. The study concludes that cropland land degradation is the main reason that explains the significant conversion of forest lands to stable agricultural lands. Therefore, review of the existing cropping and farming systems by promoting agroecology systems (e.g. agroforestry, rotational cropping, mixing cropping with pulses) to sustain and restore soil degradation while mitigating climate change, forest degradation and provide food security for the rural communities is recommended. Economic measures such as: trade-off compensations for agroecology practices and afforestation and reforestation through farmer's association initiatives could be encouraged to limit forest extensions.

AB  - Cervical cancer is a malignant epithelial tumor that forms in the uterine cervix. Most cases of cervical cancer are preventable through human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, routine screening, and treatment of precancerous lesions. However, due to inadequate screening protocols in many regions of the world, cervical cancer remains the fourth-most common cancer in women globally. The complete NCCN Guidelines for Cervical Cancer provide recommendations for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of cervical cancer. This manuscript discusses guiding principles for the workup, staging, and treatment of early stage and locally advanced cervical cancer, as well as evidence for these recommendations. For recommendations regarding treatment of recurrent or metastatic disease, please see the full guidelines on NCCN. org.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the energy balance approach was used to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) of red pepper plots managed with four different irrigation strategies (100, 70, and 40% of ET, and rainfed) with drip irrigation systems in the sub-humid Bafra Plains located in northern Turkey. In order to calculate components of energy balance, hyper-spectral reflectance, infrared surface temperature, and net radiation data were measured using nadir-looking hand-held proximal sensing devices over the experimental plots. Additionally, soil moisture levels were monitored frequently with a well-calibrated neutron moisture meter and a soil water budget approach was used to calculate actual ET values. Current findings revealed that the response of red pepper crops to water stress offered a significant opportunity to detect different levels of spectral reflectance, surface temperature, and net radiation. Furthermore, statistical comparisons revealed significant relationships between measured and estimated daily ET (r = 0.92 and RMSE = 0.83) and cumulative ET (r = 0.99 and RMSE = 43.98) values. Estimation errors for daily and cumulative ET using the energy balance algorithm were 27% and 14%, respectively. Overall, present results indicated that the energy balance algorithm with field level remotely sensed data had a great potential to estimate ET of red peppers at plot scale.

AB  - Infection with tropical parasitic diseases has a great economic and social impact and is currently one of the most pressing health problem. These diseases, according to WHO, have a huge impact on the health of more than 40 million people worldwide and are the second leading cause of immunodeficiency. Developing countries may be providers of statistical data, but need help with forecasting and preventing epidemics. The number of infections is influenced by many factors - climatic, demographic, vegetation cover, land use, geomorphology. The purpose of the research is to investigate the space-time patterns, the relationship between diseases and environmental factors, assess the degree of influence of each of the factors, compare the quality of forecasting of individual techniques of geo-information analysis and machine learning and the way they are ensembled. Also we attempt to create a generalized mathematical model for predicting several types of diseases. The following resources were used as a data source: International Society for Infectious Diseases, Landsat, Sentinel. The paper concludes with the summary table containing the importance of individual climatic, social and spatial aspects affecting the incidence. The most effective predictions were given by a mathematical model based on a combination of spatial analysis techniques (MGWR) and neural networks based on the LSTM architecture.

AB  - This article addresses the cognitive premises of designation units denoting mythic concepts in a variety of texts and discourses. The article focuses on myth-oriented semiosis as a cognitive and cultural phenomenon reflected in the semantic transformations of lingual signs, resulting in the development of noematic senses relevant to the states of affairs in diverse worldviews or modelled alternative realities. This article provides an analysis of the basic cognitive models and procedures responsible for irrational cognition. The reconstructed cognitive models are then discussed in terms of their correspondence with the universal patterns of open system interaction and information exchange.

TI  - Systematic Study on Materials for Lithium-, Sodium-, and Potassium-Ion Batteries
T2  - ELECTROCHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rechargeable batteries are capable of storing electric energy on the basis of pairing electrochemical redox reactions to realize sustainable energy society in our future. Since lithium-ion batteries with the highest specific energy among all the practical batteries were commercialized in 1991, many studies on lithium insertion materials and their electrochemical characterization have been reported to achieve even higher energy density, longer cycle life, and safer lithium-ion battery technologies. It is quite fortunate that the author had an opportunity to contribute to the research and development of lithium battery materials since 1997. In particular, studies on the influence of dissolved metallic ions like Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Na+, and K+ ions in electrolyte solution on graphite negative electrodes in lithium-ion batteries motivated the author to extend the research scope to electrochemical sodium insertion chemistry. Furthermore, the author's research experiences as a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Delmas' group in FY 2003 and a remarkable oral presentation on alpha-NaFeO2 electrode properties given by Professor Okada's group in 2004 provided motivations and opened up new avenue toward the successful demonstration of non-aqueous sodium-ion batteries later in the career. Since 2009, the author's research group has successfully demonstrated 3-volt class charge and discharge of a sodium-ion battery of a NaNi1/2Mn1/2O2// hard carbon cell and a brand-new potassiumion battery of a K2Mn[Fe(CN)(6)]// graphite cell. The systematic studies of three different alkali-metal insertion systems synergistically induce deeper understanding and faster development of new materials for the next-generation rechargeable batteries.

T2  - VESTNIK ROSSIISKOGO UNIVERSITETA DRUZHBY NARODOV-SERIYA LINGVISTIKA-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This contribution explores the representation of the verbal image of aggression in the texts of the English- language digital mass media. The research is based on the quantitative and qualitative semantic analyses of 174 authentic English texts (journalistic reports and newspaper articles) produced during the period of 2013-2015 and selected on the basis of special criteria, which were elaborated in our previous works on detecting descriptors of aggression in written texts. The aim of the research is to reveal the structural components of the verbal image of aggression reproduced in the worldview of Russian native speakers after reading English texts (British and American digital newspapers articles) and to find out if the resulting cognitive model refers to the real act of aggression. The paper contributes to the research field of psycholinguistics, emphasizing the need to support people's psychological health in the context of an aggressive media environment, which produces high psychological tension. The research methodology is based on a modified associative experiment procedure, which involves 98 native speakers of Russian (university students majoring in linguistics and translation). The obtained results demonstrate a great variability of the structural elements of aggression verbalized in mass media texts. They also indicate that the focus of the reader's attention is deliberately shifted towards the formation of a hostile cognitive model of the world, with the aggressor and the third party involved in the aggressive act in the center of the battlefield, and the victim of aggression on the periphery. The findings are illustrated by textual examples from authentic British and American newspaper articles and supplied with the author's commentaries.

T2  - QUAESTIO ROSSICA
M3  - Book Review
AB  - This review considers a book by the Irkutsk researcher Natalia I. Gavrilova, published in 2017 and devoted to the history of the Sibiryakov family, one of the most famous merchant families both in Siberia and Russia as a whole. Despite its name, the work reviewed is not limited to the genre of historical biography. Considered together, the detailed information about the representatives of different generations of the Sibiryakov merchant family reflects the history of all Russian merchantry, making it possible to judge the journey that took the family almost two hundred years, from the early eighteenth to the early twentieth century, to make. The author describes the full variety of merchant behaviour and the debatable character of their contribution for their contemporaries; to make it easier to understand the essence of the merchantry, the author also considers issues such as the interaction of individuals and public and state structures, the importance of merchant activity in the economic development of remote territories, the scale of private charity and the evolution of worldviews and daily practices among both merchant men and women. These factors, along with the excellent style of presentation and abundance of illustrative material, make Gavrilova's work important and interesting both for specialists and for general audiences.

AB  - By 2050 most parts of India will be water stressed zones as most of the water resources are under heavy stress due to increasing nutrient contamination in their waters. In this scenario, studying the changes occurring in the freshwater nutrient contamination levels over a temporal scale is extremely important. This study focuses on monitoring the changes occurring in the nutrient contamination levels over a decade in a large reservoir known as Nagarjuna Sagar (NS) using remote sensing data. In this study, Landsat (5 & 8) data for the year 2005, 2009, 2015 and Sentinel (2A and 2B) data for the years 2016 and 2018 is used to study nutrient contamination in NS. The spatial spread of chlorophyll - a (chl-a) area is used as a proxy to estimate the extent of nutrient contamination in NS. In this study, only October images of NS are used as they exhibit the maximum spatial spread of Chl-a and hence help assess the contamination levels over the period 2005 - 2018. The analysis shows that during this period, chl-a spatial spread area has increased from 21 Km(2) to 205 Km(2), indicating a decrease in water quality in the reservoir. The study shows that this is accompanied by an increase in the agricultural land use area by 1000 Km(2) in addition to a steep increase in the use of agricultural inputs, primarily fertilisers like urea, P and K. Thus, while the combined effect of excessive usage of fertilizers with agricultural intensification has increased crop yields, it has also contributed to damaging the freshwater resources.

AB  - Determination of satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) dates back to the 1970s, and it was derived using measured brightness temperature (BT) of 11 and 12 mu m channels only. Although triple-window algorithm (TWA) including shortwave infrared (SWIR) channel/s is a proven better option for SST retrieval, generation of linear coefficients including shortwave channels during daylight hours is extremely challenging due to the highly nonlinear contribution of solar reflection and scattering. On the other hand, SWIR channel/s can be easily incorporated in physical deterministic SST (PDSST) retrieval method. A successful implementation of SWIR channels for daytime SST retrieval in operational environment from MODIS-AQUA using PDSST method is discussed here. The performances of newly developed PDSST are validated by two different ways using: a) collocated in-situ measurements (buoys/Argos) quantitively and b) microwave SST from AMSR2 qualitatively. This study mainly focuses on the Indian Ocean region that is known to be a most oceanographic dynamic region among all Oceans. Also, the performances of newly developed PDSST are compared with the quality of the currently NASA-distributed MODIS-AQUA SST, obtained from Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC). An enormous improvement in the quality and coverage for daytime SST data by PDSST using SWIR channels as compared to currently operational PO.DAAC SST product that is regression based without SWIR channels is reported in this paper.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration plays a crucial role in the surface hydrothermal balance. On a regional scale, especially in the blown-sand areas, an accurate estimate of evapotranspiration has important guiding significance for a rational allocation of water resources and drought monitoring. The objective of the study is to estimate the surface evapotranspiration for the blown-sand region in the Ordos Basin based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model using six phases of Landsat 8 remote sensing images during 2015-2016 and the corresponding surface meteorological observational data, analyze the characteristics of temporal and spatial distributions of evapotranspiration in the study area. The results show that (1) the daily evapotranspiration presents a seasonal variability with the highest in summer, lower in autumn and spring, and the lowest in winter; (2) the evapotranspiration is distinctly characterized by its spatial variability, which is related to the terrain and geomorphology in this area as well as the effect of human activities; and (3) the daily evapotranspiration estimated by the SEBAL model was validated using the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Penman-Monteith (P-M) model, which yielded an mean relative error (MRE) of 19.5%. In summary, the remote sensing data based SEBAL model can be applied to robustly estimate evapotranspiration for the blown-sand regions, and the study results can be served as an important reference for the research of water circulation, rational utilization of water resources, and protection of the ecological environment in the arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Understanding the drivers of deforestation and agricultural transformations in the Northwestern uplands of Cambodia
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - At the end of the 1990s, the Northwestern uplands of Cambodia were one of the last forest frontiers of the country. In a region that was the last Khmer Rouge stronghold, the opening of former conflict zones after a peace agreement initiated a vast movement of agricultural colonization. This movement was economically triggered by high market demand for agricultural commodities such as maize and cassava and fueled by a massive flow of spontaneous in-migration of land-poor farmers from lowland regions around the entire country. Focused on four upland districts along a pioneer front of Northwestern Cambodia, we analyzed historical trajectories of land use/cover changes using a chronological series of Landsat data from 1976 to 2016. We identified key drivers of deforestation using demographic data and qualitative information from local actors and other relevant stake-holders. We found a 65 percent forest cover loss due to conversion by smallholders into agricultural land for maize and cassava cultivation over a period of 15 years. The underlying mechanisms of land use change were further investigated to understand the diversity of individual farm trajectories and decision-making processes in relation to land conversion. These elements of diagnosis are essential to engage farming communities in innovative land use systems and to develop sustainable alternatives to boom crops that have led to the current situation of land degradation and economic instability.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Active and Passive Microwave Remote Sensing for Environmental Monitoring III
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Landslide events are triggered by heavy rain or earthquake each year around the world. The remote sensing technique is an effective tool for disaster mapping, monitoring, and early warning. In particular, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has great potentials due to its all-weather with day and night time imaging capabilities. Thus, rapid damage detection of landslide events using SAR data is expected. However, the technique for landslide detection has not been established. In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely developed in semantic segmentation. The CNNs based on the U-Net, in particular, has a capability of fewer training images for semantic segmentation. In this study, we demonstrate a landslide detection using the CNNs based on the U-Net with SAR data. The landslides induced by the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake was selected for a case study. ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data were acquired on 29 March 2018 and 13 September 2018 in ascending orbit and were acquired on 23 August 2018 and 6 September 2018 in descending orbit. For pre-processing, radiometric calibration and ortho-rectification were performed in each PALSAR-2 data. Firstly, we performed a conventional method, which is the backscattering coefficient difference (BCD) for landslide detection. The highest value of the F-measure (31.9%) was obtained within a 7 x 7 window size with the slope angle in the ascending orbit dataset. Secondly, we performed a CNNs method based on the U-Net for landslide detection. The highest value of the F-measure (79.9%) was obtained using the CNNs method in the ascending orbit dataset. In conclusion, the proposed CNNs method is more effective than the threshold method for landslide detection using pre- and post-event ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 data.

AB  - Forest fires are the major cause of degradation of forest. Forest fires have caused substantial damage in the state of Karnataka in terms of economic, social, environmental impacts on humans and also loss of biodiversity. Fire risk indices are important tools for the management of forest fires. They are developed based on static and/or dynamic factors influencing the occurrence of fire and propagation of fire. The objective of the present study was to develop a new static fire risk index based on parameters influencing forest fire such as fuel type, elevation, slope, aspect, terrain ruggedness, proximity to a road, proximity to water bodies and proximity to settlements. MODIS Land cover type yearly L3 global 500m SIN grid(MCD12Q1) was used to compute fuel type index based on historical fire data, SRTM DEM was used to compute slope index, aspect index, elevation index, and terrain ruggedness index. Road index, settlement index, and water body index were developed from the proximity maps generated. A geographic information system (GIS) was utilized adequately to join diverse forest fire causing factors for demarcating static fire risk index. The evaluated exactness was around 87%, i.e., the developed GIS-based static fire risk index of the examination zone was observed to be in solid concurrence with actual fire affected regions. The study area exhibited 32.38% prone to fire risk.

AB  - Carbonaceous aerosol originating from forest fires and other types of open biomass burning (BB) is known to have a strong impact on the radiative balance of the atmosphere but available model estimates of the corresponding climate effects are characterized by large uncertainties due to insufficient knowledge of its sources and atmospheric transformations (aging). Here we study the atmospheric aging of BB aerosol by analyzing data of satellite measurements of the absorption and extinction aerosol optical depths (AAOD and AOD) in BB plumes from wildfires in Siberia. Along with the aerosol measurements, our analysis involves satellite data for CO column amounts as well as the simulations of the BB aerosol photochemical age using a chemistry transport model. The analysis includes the two main stages. First, we study the BB aerosol evolution as a function of its photochemical age by using the observations over Siberia in the period from May to September of 2012. Second, we examine changes in the BB aerosol optical characteristics in the smoke plumes that had been transported from Siberia into the European part of Russia in July of 2016. The results indicate that photochemical aging strongly affects the behavior of both AAOD and AOD. The results also show that aged BB aerosol becomes less absorptive at the near UV wavelength range, indicating a depletion of brown carbon in particles. The BB aerosol aging effects detected at the both stages of the analysis are found to be consistent.

TI  - THE PAINTINGS OF ILYA GLAZUNOV THROUGH THE PRISM OF THE METHODOLOGIES OF SERGEI EISENSTEIN AND LEV VYGOTSKY
T2  - NAUKA TELEVIDENIYA-THE ART AND SCIENCE OF TELEVISION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present article the attempt is made for the first time to apply the methodologies of Sergei Eisenstein and Lev Vygostsky to analysis of the paintings of Ilya Glazunov and his contemporaries. The attention of the researcher is focused on the phenomenon of the character suite discovered by Einsenstein in drawings as "pure motion of the run of montage thought." The present phenomenon was focused on disclosing one and the same emotion in its various gradations. Its versatile discovery is also aided by analysis of the other principles of movie montage the manifestation of which is revealed by the author of the article in painting as well: the parallel, associative and intellectual. For the aim of revealing the essence of the examined works of pictorial art the article makes use of a method, correlating with Eisenstein's, formulated by Soviet scientist Lev Vygotsky, who researched in literature the psychology of inner conflict of images on the basis of the contrariety of the plot and the storyline. The convergence of the mentioned intellectual paths of learning about the paintings of Glazunov and his contemporaries creates the possibility of systematic perfection of "multiple-point entering" into the artistic image, which makes it possible to elucidate the meaning of the authorial conceptions in pictorial art, including those paintings by Glazunov which by their worldview content and image-related compositional solution arouse impassioned critical reactions.

AB  - Marine domain awareness is important for crisis management in case of accidents but also as a surveillance tool against illicit discharge activities. Copernicus Sentinel-1 data are used for the detection of spills as they are provided free and in near real time. The availability of data and the recently developed cloud infrastructures give the opportunity for developing open source algorithms and techniques for oil spill detection. In this study a simple semi-automatic system for oil spill detection is presented for Sentinel-1 images. After image segmentation, the Orfeo Toolbox SVM vector classifier is trained based on the features extracted and separates the objects to possible oil spills and lookalikes.The method has been tested using three images depicting the evolution of an oil spill that resulted from a ship collision in the Mediterranean, offshore Corsica, on the 7th October 2018. Results were sound but further development is needed especially on algorithm training and feature extraction. All the software packages used are free and open source.

AB  - The European Space Agency's Sentinel 1 satellite acquires global synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, making it particularly well-suited for analyzing tropical regions that may be covered in clouds and therefore concealed from optical data. Here, we focus our attention on rice, a predominant crop in the tropics, and leverage Sentinel 1 data to identify field boundaries, classify fields as rice or not rice, and estimate the number of times each rice field is harvested during a year. Using the Descartes Labs Platform to conduct this analysis allows us to scale our models to run across Asia, providing a region-wide analysis of rice extent and management.

TI  - Polysomnography Utilization in Veterans Presenting Acutely with Ischemic Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack
T2  - CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an independent cerebrovascular risk factor and highly prevalent in patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Timely diagnosis and treatment of OSA is important as clinical data suggest that treatment of OSA in the setting of acute ischemic stroke improves functional outcomes. We aimed to assess polysomnography (PSG) utilization in US. Veterans with acute stroke or TIA over a 2-year period. Methods: Veterans with acute ischemic stroke or TIA presenting to a Veterans Administration Medical Center (VAMC) between October 1, 2015, and June 30, 2017, were included. Demographic, clinical data, and PSG within 12 months of hospital discharge were obtained from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse to determine the rate of PSG testing among those with acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Fisher's exact test and two-sample t tests were used to compare demographic and clinical characteristics for those receiving and not receiving PSG. Mixed effect logistic regression was used to model the association of clinical and demographic characteristics with PSG receipt. Results: In fiscal years (FYs) 2016 and 2017, 9,200 Veterans were admitted to a VAMC with ischemic stroke (6,011) or TIA (3,089). Veterans were elderly (70.5 +/- 11.1 years), predominantly male (95.7%), and largely Caucasian (68.0% Caucasian, 26.3% African-American). Just 6.0% of Veterans underwent PSG within 1 year of acute ischemic stroke or TIA in FY 2016, compared to 6.2% in FY 2017 (p = 0.72). Compared to Veterans >= 80 years, those <60 had adjusted OR of 6.73 (4.10-11.05), those 60-69 had OR 4.29 (2.73-6.74), and those 70-79 had OR 2.63 (1.66-4.18) of having PSG. Veterans with diabetes or heart failure had significantly higher odds, whereas those with dementia had significantly lower odds of receiving PSG. Conclusion: PSG utilization among US Veterans is low and stable over time, despite recent guidelines recommending PSG among those having stroke or TIA. Older Veterans and those with dementia were unlikely to get PSG, representing especially vulnerable populations. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Inadequate characterization of AMD-generating mine waste is a major obstacle to remediation of post-mining sites, on the other hand a complete inventory and assessment of their environmental impacts are far from complete. This lack of update records calls for new fast and time and cost efficient monitoring techniques. Imaging spectroscopy represents an alternative to conventional methods (chemical analyses-based assessment tools) and efficient way to characterize mines and assess the AMD discharge. In this study, a new index for Sentinel-2 data (S-2) is introduced (DS-2(AMD)) allowing mapping AMD and sufficient differentiation between jarosite minerals and other oxy-hydroxides. It is also demonstrated that S-2 data has a potential to map seasonal variations of AMD.

AB  - Today, in the digital age, the emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) reshape human life significantly. Fundamental changes reflect in humans' behavior and worldviews. In the field of education, the impact of ICTs manifests on the four components of education: teacher, learning environment, student and curriculum. Each of these components is affected by the digital age. The teachers' identity is a critical component, that can throw light and explain why the field of education is still far behind when it comes to digitization and reshaping education. In this paper, we apply a known SAMR (Substitution, Augmentation, Modification and Redefinition) model in order to assess the above components of education in the context of digitization. Teachers' testimonies are used to place each of the mentioned components at its specific SAMR level. The teachers' testimonies verify the major differences between the way the teachers adjust to the digital age and the way their students do. The criteria found to be the main implication in the interviews resonates why each of the mentioned components is in a different SAMR level. To succeed in reshaping education to fit the digital age, and reach digitalization, all the components described should reach the highest level of SAMR - redefinition. The difficulty lies within the contingent relations between the components. When one independently progresses, others are still behind blocking other components' progress as well.

AB  - For evaluating in quantitative manner the progress of achieving the sustainable development goals and how big the progress is, a global indicator framework was developed. In this paper, we propose the approach to the comprehensive Air Quality (AQ) monitoring based on harmonized satellite and in-situ data in the framework of the HORIZON 2020 Project. Within this survey we describe conceptual architecture of the infrastructure to measure, in particular, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), Particles less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5), Particles less than 10 mu m (PM10) concentration over the Kyiv city using up-to-date monitoring instruments; we describe requirements for information tools and network for informing Kyiv city community on the state of AQ that will be created on the base of existing AQ monitoring stations. The comprehensive review of in-situ and satellite measurements of atmospheric pollutants is provided as well as the results of validation of global AQ products from Sentinel-5 Precursor (Sentinel-5P) and Copernicus Air Monitoring Service (CAMS) with the use of available in-situ data.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a model and a computational algorithm for recovering the X-ray component of the solar spectrum based on GOES XL (0.1-0.8 nm), XS (0.05-0.4 nm or 0.05-0.3 nm), and SDO QD (0.1-7 nm) data. The model relies on the emission spectrum of optically thin plasmas in the Mewe approximation, which is the temperature spectrum. An assumption is made about the possibility of representing the total spectrum as a superposition of Mewe spectra situated in the absorbing solar atmosphere to an optical depth equal to 1 for the energy corresponding to its temperature parameter. Thus, this model is a version of the multi-temperature approximation. Spectrum parameters are determined from support functions, approximation expressions for which are given in Appendix.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article describes the impact of the Mass Media on the formation of the worldview of the young. This impact may be positive or negative. On the one hand, the media educate young people and enhance their participation in public life. On the other hand, they may mislead or promote false values, and manipulate the young generation's consciousness. What helps people not to get involved into the tried-and-true crowd manipulation scheme in the media landscape is critical thinking, whose lack results in inability to choose the right guidelines in the flow of false information provided by various Media.The authors emphasize the role of the state, which, regarding the needs of the society, should enculturate the young generation, as well as exercise tight control over communication in the global web and publications in the Internet Media and social networks. One of the directions of the state's policy is expanding the geography of information and communication technologies, and the other is ensuring information security of the young in general and adolescents in particular. To provide this, the state develops organizational and legal mechanisms aimed at protecting children from harmful information in the web, and requirements for the content, its expert evidence and government control.The article demonstrates the results of a study carried out by the authors to assess the current youth Media and their influence on criminality. The key criterion for selecting participants of the focus group was young age, since the young are the most active and the least protected players in the media landscape. The sampling was made by random choice in order to ensure equal opportunities for participation in the study.

AB  - The article discusses the conditions for the formation of creative abilities of children of preschool age in the study of English and presents the results of the study.The foreign language in extended education can and should contribute to the process of developing the creative abilities of preschoolers. Possessing a vast educational and developmental potential of students' creative skills, a foreign language can be realized only in the implementation of the practical learning goal, that is, just if the child is in the process of foreign language communicative-cognitive activity (listening, speaking, reading, using writing) will expand their horizons, develop their thinking, memory, feelings and emotions. If the social-value qualities of an individual will be formed in the process of foreign language communication: worldview, moral values, and beliefs, character traits. The creative abilities of the individual in the classroom of a foreign language can only be carried out in creative activities in the learning process.The findings of our study illustrated the research in the children's center "Baby Space," where five students were studying at the age of 4 years. The topics were Figures, Toys, Animals, Fairy Tales, Seasons, Verbs of Movement, Adjectives were proposed for studying English. For training, various techniques were used following the age characteristics of children - reading, audio fairy tales, drawing, modeling, designing. Also, a theater corner was made to provide for developing interaction with each other in professional and game activities: reading poems by roles; games-drama; staging tales, stories, songs, poems; etudes and play exercises in which children interact with each other; playing up different situations. As a result of the study, students mastered the specific fund of lexical units, the ability to form the simple requests, the phonetic hearing, the simple speech patterns: My name is ..., I am (age) ... I see ..., I can ..., I love ..., I want ..., I have ...; and also developed creative imagination, the way of thinking, arbitrariness, experimentation, and improvisational skills.This paper attempts to draw some conclusions about nourish and educative facilities of the creative abilities of younger preschoolers in learning English. All data were analyzed, and positive results were obtained, which will be presented in the discussion and conclusion sections of this article.

T2  - VESTNIK PERMSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISTORIYA-PERM UNIVERSITY HERALD-HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introducing the concept of values politics (axiopolitics) as a set of methods of political "handling" of values (and their use for political purposes), the author offers his own typology of this phenomenon and outlines the main historical stages of its formation. Considering the values politics of the left-indigenist regime in Bolivia, he reveals its connection with the formation of nation and the incomplete process of modernization in the country. The article gives a description of the ideological and value complex, known as "Suma qamana", which underlies the axiopolitics of the Bolivian state. The concept is the quintessence of the traditional worldview of indigenous peoples of the Andean region. It includes the idea of harmonious coexistence of people with each other and with nature. The "Suma qamana" ideology openly opposes developmentalism as a paradigm of unidirectional development of mankind and consumerism, which orients economy to infinite increase in producing consumer goods. Its appearance was a reaction to the unsuccessful for Latin American countries policy of neoliberalism in the 1990s - early 2000s. The author reveals the content of the "Suma qamana" system of values and the essence of the arguments put forward by its critics. It is shown how the regime used the "Suma qamana" ideology to achieve its political goals.

TI  - About Studying the Traditional Singing Tradition of the Vepsians in the Context of Cognitive Ethnomusicology
T2  - PROBLEMY MUZYKALNOI NAUKI-MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents an attempt of studying the singing tradition of the Vepsians from the standpoint of cognitive ethnomusicology. This direction, represented in our days by publications in Russian ethnomusicology amounting in the single digits, is analyzed from the standpoint of the development of Boris Asafiev's theory of intonation. In relation to ethnomusicology, in light of the cognitive paradigm, an artistic text is comprehended as a complex symbol which expresses the ethnophor's knowledge of reality, embodied in traditional art works as an individual worldview represented by means of sound. The Vepsian folk music tradition is remarkable and authentic. It is represented by works of various genres: lyrical songs; wedding, funereal and recruit lamentations, calendar chants, lullabies, spells, ditties, fairy tales, etc. Upon acquaintance with the tradition, researchers have their interest aroused primarily by the unusual character of the sound of the Vepsian songs. The ethnic music of the Vepsian people, which is an extremely interesting but an under-investigated phenomenon, is based on the peculiarities of the ethnogenesis, geographical location and historical and cultural specificity. The Vepsians are one of the most ancient peoples of the European North. Scientists link their origin to the Vesi and Chudi tribes, which were first mentioned in historical records as far back as the middle of the 6th century. Thereby, already in the 1st half of the 1st millennium, these tribes have inhabited the Mezhozerye [Region between the Lakes] - the area between the three largest northern lakes - Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega and Lake Beloye. Currently, the territory of the traditional settlement of the Vepsians occupies a narrow strip along Lake Onega and the central part of the Mezhozerye. Application of a cognitive approach to the Vepsian ethnic musical material has made it possible to identify the semantically important correlation between timbre and intonation in the process of the formation of the artistic chronotope.

AB  - The bursting transition to a knowledge-based economy poses unexpected challenges to global education systems. On one hand, the uneven development of technology allows some or other world regions to gain a major technological advantage and occupy market niches in the field of online education and training, but on the other hand, the rapid multiplication of these same technologies creates new global competition, which undeniably escalates with the time. Education systems around the world are undergoing a qualitatively new kind of transformation, linked to the possibility of being both regionally challenged and globally accessible, and the tendencies of globalization come in direct clash with the cultural identity of nations and individuals in a purely digital dimension.The article explores the opportunities for online education in literature and philosophy with the tools of the most advanced distance learning platforms, defending the thesis that online teaching of humanities acts as a natural "antioxidant" to the ever more technologically and unifying global educational ecosystem. We face one of the most serious challenges in today's world, namely replacing the centuries-old copy-paste models of the "traditional" education with an externally attractive but frightening unifying model of the modern digital culture that threatens to smash differences and to crush the diversity of philosophies, semantics, notion and worldview characteristic of different peoples and nations. The key role of online education in humanities, in particular literature and philosophy, for the promotion of the cultural identity, the specific way of thinking and the construction of kind of "digital bridges" between the different regions, ethnic groups and social communities has been explored.

TI  - Assessment of open source digital elevation models (SRTM-30, ASTER, ALOS) for erosion processes modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOLOGY GEOGRAPHY AND GEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relief has a major impact on the landscape's hydrological, geomorphological and biological processes. Many geographic information systems used elevation data as the primary data for analysis, modeling, etc. A digital elevation model (DEM) is a modern representation of the continuous variations of relief over space in digital form. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are important source for prediction of soil erosion parameters. The potential of global open source DEMs (SRTM, ASTER, ALOS) and their suitability for using in modeling of erosion processes are assessed in this study. Shumsky district of Ternopil region, which is located in the Western part of Ukraine, is the area of our study. The soils of Shumsky district are adverselyaffected by erosion processes. The analysis was performed on the basis of the characteristics of the hydrological network and relief. The reference DEM was generated from the hypsographic data (contours) on the 1:50000 topographical map series compiled by production units of the Main Department of Geodesy and Cartography under the Council of Ministers. The differences between the reference DEM and open source DEMs (SRTM, ASTER and ALOS) are examined. Methods of visual detection of DEM defects, profiling, correlation, and statistics were used in the comparative analysis. This research included the analysis oferrors that occurred during the generation of DEM. The vertical accuracy of these DEMs, root mean square error (RMSE), absolute and relative errors, maximum deviation, and correlation coefficient have been calculated. Vertical accuracy of DEMs has been assessed using actual heights of the sample points. The analysis shows that SRTM and ALOS DEMs are more reliable and accurate than ASTER GDEM. The results indicate that vertical accuracy of DEMs is 7,02 m, 7,12 m, 7,60 m and 8,71 m for ALOS, SRTM 30, SRTM 90 and ASTER DEMs respectively. ASTER GDEM had the highest absolute, relative and root mean square errors, the highest maximum positive and negative deviation, a large difference with reference heights, and the lowest correlation coefficient. Therefore, ASTER GDEM is the least acceptable for studying the intensity and development of erosion processes. The use of global open source DEMs, compared with the vectorization of topographic maps, greatly simplifies and accelerates the modeling of erosion processes and the assessment of the erosion risk in the administrative district.

TI  - GEOINFORMATION MODELING OF ANTROPOGENIC TRANSFORMATION OF THE BASIN GEOSYSTEMS (CASE STUDY OF DNISTER RIGHT TRIBUTARIES)

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to analyze anthropogenic transformation of river-basin geosystems of the outer Subcarpathian region by geoinformational modeling tools using various methods of quantitative estimation of anthropogenic pressure; comparison of modeling results on the basis of administrative-territorial and natural units, selection of optimal structural units for the study of anthropogenic changes in basin geosystems.Research methods. The features of estimation methods of anthropogenic transformation level of territorial complexes, based on various conceptual approaches to the study of anthropogenic changes in the components of the environment were investigated. In particular, the article compares methods of F.M. Milkov, P.G. Shyshchenko, E. Klementova and V. Geinige, P.P. Borschevsky, M.V. Boyarin, I.P. Kovalchuk, N.M. Ridey and D.L. Shofolov, A.M. Tretyak and others and by the means of geoinformation modeling of riverbasin geosystems (namely, the case study of the outer Subcarpathian Dniester tributaries) shows the degree of representativeness of the results produced by each of them. It is noted that the technique by P.G. Shyshchenko allows to more accurately reflect the state of anthropogenic transformation of the river-basin system's natural conditionsResults. A range of digital cartographic models was developed to evaluate and compare anthropogenic transformation level of the two Carpathian basin systems and to identify similar and distinctive features of the state and the transformation level of the basin systems' natural environment andstability of agricultural and forest landscapes in the studied basin geosystems. In particular, the study has revealed that the anthropogenic transformation of the outer Carpathian river basins is rising downstream. In the upper parts of the basins, it manifests itself in deforestation, while in the lower parts agricultural influence dominates. In addition, the index of anthropogenic transformation is rising with an increase in the order of sub-basins. The worst conditions of agro-landscapes are observed in the reclaimed valleys of the main rivers and their tributaries (due to the considerable level of plowing in the plain parts of the basins due to low fertility of soils, high levels of their acidity, degradation processes and chemical pollution). Stable territories are inherent exclusively in sub-basins which remain in their natural state or bear only traces of human activity. Settlements, which influence adjacent areas, are characterized by unsustainable land use. As for anthropogenic transformation, in the basin geosystem of the Berezhnytsia river its indicators increase upwards due to an increase in the share of arable land. On the contrary, in the basin of Bystrica much more land is occupied by industrial facilities, which affect the components of the geosystem the hardest. In this regard, the largest values of nature anthropogenic transformation indicators are found in the northern part of the basin and upstream of the city of Nadvirna and the town of Bykiv.Scientific significance. Case study of the administrative regions and the river basin located within them reveals the advantages of studying the geoenvironmental state of the territories according to their natural geographic taxonomic units, which allows to determine the most strained areas in geosystems. Particular attention is paid to the choice of optimum sized geospatial objects during the study of diverse basin systems. River sub-basins of the third order (according to the classification scheme of A. Strahler) were chosen to this purpose. Their size corresponds to that of the combined territorial communities' area. The importance of formation a database that reflects on the state of the geospatial entities under study is emphasized. For this purpose, it is appropriate to convey the structure of land use, represented by indices of different land cover and land use types (protected areas, forest covered areas, swamps and wetlands, meadows, gardens and vineyards), arable land, land under rural and urban development, natural objects modified by human activities (reservoirs , ponds, channels), land utilized by industry and transport in each investigated object. The article shows that the best solution to this problem is provided by the processing of high-resolution spatial (in panchromatic and multispectral) remote sensing data. The most appropriate in this case are QuickBird satellite imagery, designed to create and update topographic maps and plans, to make inventories of forests and agricultural lands and to assess their condition, therefore allowing mapping of land use types that are not identified in statistical inventories.Practical significance. The results of this work will be helpful in selecting the specific technique allowing the most complete representation of anthropogenic transformation of natural objects; in choosing the most optimal spatial units to carry out the analysis and, accordingly, to fill in the database. The developed models reveal the most anthropogenically loaded parts of river-basin geosystems of the outer Subcarpathian region, which is essential for the extrapolation of the obtained results to other right tributaries of the Dniester River.

AB  - Insufficient knowledge about spatial-temporal forest heterogeneities in the tropics is a major impediment to better estimation of carbon storage and prevention of deforestation by remote sensing. While the differences between the dense evergreen rainforest and the open (semi-) deciduous dry forest is obviously large, variations caused by seasonal changes can easily introduce fluctuations in the same order of magnitude within the same forest class. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of the variability of tropical forests based on homogeneous big data analysis on multitemporal ALOS-2 dual-polarized ScanSAR data. The first, easy to understand global forest variability maps provide unseen insights into forest structures for the entire tropical belt. Based on these results, we discuss the development of a new global classification scheme for tropical forests. Preliminary results demonstrate how the use of various statistical parameters obtained from the long-term systematic L-band SAR forest monitoring data, including the average gamma(0), its temporal standard deviation and the gamma(0) range, can improve the classical global-scale forest classifications. In addition to the basic separation into the three main forest types i) rainforest, ii) moist forest and iii) dry forest, the results provide a detailed mapping of the seasonally flooded forest areas.

AB  - In the years 2014-2016, at the fields of Wroclaw University of Environmental and Life Sciences, we conducted a one-factor field experiment in a random block system in four replications. The variable was the application of the following preparations: TS Osivo (pre-sowing seed dressing at a dose of 0.5 dm(3).ha(-1)), TS Eva (foliar spray at BBCH 13 stage, at a dose of 0.5 dm(3).ha(-1)), TS Sentinel (foliar spray at BBCH 39 phase, at the dose of 0.25 dm(3).ha(-1)). The morphological characteristics of plants and winter wheat yielding were primarily affected by weather conditions in individual years of the experiment, and secondarily by the applied stimulant. The use of TS series stimulants in growing of winter wheat contributed, compared to the control, to an increase in plant height and ear length, as well as, the number and weight of grains per ear, and weight of 1 000 grains. The application of the TS Eva stimulant at BBCH 13 stage of winter wheat resulted in obtaining the highest grain yields and protein yield from 1 ha. TS stimulants used for growing winter wheat improved the quality of harvested grain.

AB  - In this work we present the results of internal solitary wave ( ISW) observations derived from high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements acquired over the seasonally ice-free Chukchi and Beaufort Seas. The information on internal wave properties and locations was obtained from Envisat Advanced SAR (ASAR) images acquired during May-October 2007 and 2011. Altogether, 233 ISW packets were identified in 727 ASAR images. As observed, there is no significant difference in the normalized number of ISW observations between 2007 and 2011, while most of the waves were detected in July (33%) and August (43%). Geographically, most of the waves were observed over shelf and shelf break regions (94%), while only 6% of them were found over depths exceeding 200 m. In the Chukchi Sea, the waves were frequently observed in the northern part of the sea centered at about 72.6 degrees N, 168 degrees W, in its southwestern part, around Herald Shoal, near the Barrow Canyon, and in the Bering Strait. In the Beaufort Sea, some ISW activity was observed along the shelf break and north of Cape Bathurst, while a major hot spot of ISW generation was found on the Mackenzie Shelf. Maps of selected ISW properties, including their propagation direction, crest length and wavelength of leading waves provide further details about spatial characteristics of the observed internal waves.

AB  - Here we analyse high-resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements to retrieve statistical and dynamical properties of ocean eddies in the ice-free regions and the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of Fram Strait. Analysis of historical Envisat ASAR images allowes to obtain detailed spatial statistics of eddy generation sites, their diameters and vorticity sign. As shown, the total number of cyclones strongly dominates over anticyclones. Eddies are frequently observed over continental slope and shelf regions around Svalbard, however, about 80% of them are identified over the deep Fram Strait regions. In general, eddies range in size between 1.5 km and 64 km with a mean value of 8 km. Larger eddies of 10-30 km in diameter are usually found over deep water, while smaller eddies of 3-7 km in diameter prevail around Svalbard. As observed, the overall pattern of eddy field in the strait attributes well to the position of West Spitsbergen Current jet and its southern recirculation branch known from literature. Analysis of sequential Sentinel-1 images allows to retrieve surface current velocity field having a clear signature of an anticyclonic eddy in the Fram Strait marginal ice zone. Mean orbital velocity of the observed eddy is estimated to be around 0.4-0.5 m/s, in good agreement with earlier field observations. Presented results demonstrate the potential of spaceborne SAR data to retrieve critical properties of eddies of various scales, and further investigate their role in the Arctic Ocean.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the funeral rites of the Tho people of Thanh Hoa province of Vietnam as as one of the rituals of transition, which comprises various aspects of Tho social relations and worldview. Study of the ritual practice of small ethnic groups is actual due to the threat of their extinction, the growing influence of dominant cultures, and either the loss or transformation of traditional material and spiritual values because of rapid modernization. The study is novel for its collection of field materials and investigation of unexplored Tho people culture. This novelty is also introduced through the interdisciplinary nature of the research, when funeral rites are explored from the point of view of ethnology, sociology, cultural studies and semiotics. The study has used methods of structural and comparative analysis, namely comparing the components of the Tho people funeral rituals with those of of the neighboring Kinh, Muong and Thai. Such an approach has revealed differences and similarities in the ritual practice of the ethnic groups under consideration, defined mutual influences, and therefore drawn conclusions about the specifics of their world perception, and finally revealed the universals connected with dichotomous concepts of life and death.

The importance of addressing the study of a holistic worldview as an integral and dynamic psychological phenomenon is justified. Particular attention is paid to the concepts of computer metaphor, sociocultural pathology and clip thinking. Education approaches are analyzed in this context. The problem of methods for studying the worldview of an individual and group subject in virtual space is discussed: methods for working with big data, sentiment analysis of the text, corpus linguistics methods. Some of the possibilities of these methods are illustrated, their advantages and limitations are considered, their high potential in psychological research is emphasized. Methodological problems of studying the influence of modern information technologies on the worldview are formulated, in particular, the uncertainty of terms in the framework of the concept of clip thinking, the paucity of differential psychological studies and psychological methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the spectral analysis of a number of estimates of the ice extent of the Barents Sea, obtained from instrumental observational data for 1900-2014, and for the selected CMIP5 project models (MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR and GFDL-CM3) for 1900-2005, a typical period of similar to 60-year inter-annual variability associated with the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) in conditions of a general significant decrease in the ice extent of the Barents Sea, which, according to observations and model calculations, was 20 and 15%, respectively, which confirms global warming. The maximum contribution to the total dispersion of temperature, ice cover of the Barents Sea, AMO, introduces variability with periods of more than 20 years and trends that are 47, 20, 51% and 33, 57, 30%, respectively. On the basis of the cross correlation analysis, significant links have been established between the ice extent of the Barents Sea, AMO, and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) for the period 1900-2014. A significant negative connection (R = -0.8) of ice cover and Atlantic multi-decadal oscillations was revealed at periods of more than 20 years with a shift of 1-2 years; NAO and ice cover (R = -0.6) with a shift of 1-2 years for periods of 10-20 years; AMO and NAO (R = -0.4 divided by -0.5) with a 3-year shift with AMO leading at 3-4, 6-8 and more than 20 years. The periods of the ice cover growth are specified: 1950-1980 and the reduction of the ice cover: the 1920-1950 and the 1980-2010 in the Barents Sea. Intensification of the transfer of warm waters from the North Atlantic to the Arctic basin, under the atmospheric influence caused by the NAO, accompanied by the growth of AMO leads to an increase in temperature, salinity and a decrease of ice cover in the Barents Sea. During periods of ice cover growth, opposite tendencies appear. The decrease in the ice cover area of the entire Northern Hemisphere by 1.5 x 10(6 )km(2 )since the mid-1980s. to the beginning of the 2010, identified in the present work on NOAA satellite data, confirms the results obtained on the change in ice extent in the Barents Sea.

AB  - Spectrometer MODIS, installed on TERRA and AQUA satellites, provides daily global coverage of the Earth. Based on its measurements, data on aerosol optical depth (AOD) with different spatial resolution are formed: 10, 3, 1 km. The classical algorithm with a coarse spatial resolution of 10 km is not suitable for studying the variability of aerosols at the city scale. Introduced in 2018, a new algorithm for multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) provides AOD data with spatial resolution of 1 km. This information can already be used to analyze the spatial distribution of aerosols in the city. The relationship between MAIAC AOD and PM2.5 concentrations of particulate matter was investigated, which is measured at automated posts of city environmental services. Our analysis showed that the data with a spatial resolution of 1 km allow us to see the areas of dust pollution inside the city. This information, together with measurements at the posts, can be used as an objective assessment of the environmental situation.

TI  - Recession of Trakarding glacier and expansion of Tsho Rolpa lake in Nepal Himalaya based on satellite data
T2  - HIMALAYAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most obvious consequences of climate change in the Himalayan mountain region is wide-spread glacier recession and growth of glacial lakes. This study explores the link between the recession of Trakarding glacier and the growth of its proglacial Tsho Rolpa lake based on multi-temporal satellite images including high-resolution Corona KHA, KH-9 Hexagon and moderate-resolution Landsat images. The study reveals that Trakarding glacier shrank from 30.7 +/- 0.2 km(2) to 28.8 +/- 0.7 km(2) with an average rate of 0.04 +/- 0.001 km(2) a(-1) between 1964 and 2018. The glacier length reduced by about similar to 2 km with an annual rate of 37.0 m a(-1) +/- 0.2 m. The Tsho Rolpa proglacial lake grew nearly three times from 0.48 +/- 0.01 km(2) in 1964 to 1.56 +/- 0.01 km(2) in 2018 and has become one of the largest glacial lakes of Nepal. We conclude that the connection of proglacial lakes with glaciers snout accelerates the glacier recession, which in turn leads to the growth of lake itself.

AB  - Vityazevskaya Bay-Bar is a part of Anapa Bay Bar-large accumulative form of coastal relief on the north-eastern coast of the Black Sea. This part is located at a distance from the settlements, still less susceptible to human exposure and is an important resource for further recreational development. Detailed mapping of this region was performed basing on the interpretation of digital aerial photography with a resolution of 10 cm at a scale of 1:2 000 for dune belt zone, as well as using SPOT-6 satellite images with a resolution of 8 m at a scale of 1:5 000 for a wide area of around lagoon lowland. The compiled landscape-morphological map shows the specific features of this region. On wide beaches of Vityazevskaya Bay-Bar a belt of beach dunes were formed, but behind the beach zone the dune belt is not developed, replaced by gentle dune slopes. Together with hilly sands, they separate the beach from an extensive around lagoon lowland, in which downstream depressions, with sedge-reed thickets, sometimes filled with sea water, are combined with sandy rises, covered with grassy and tree-shrub vegetation, alternating at higher sites wind-waving sands. Several troughs crossing hilly sands contribute to the penetration of storm seawaters to lowland and dumping them back into the beach zone, where excessive moisture areas, mastered by vegetation, are forming. Thus, the combination of aquatic and dune landscapes is a distinctive feature of the Vityazevskaya Bay-Bar, which must be taken into account for its recreational development.

AB  - Waters from a closed Vistula lagoon actively influences the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea (offshore Kaliningrad region). When entering the Baltic Sea lagoon waters become a perfect tracer to track different hydrodynamic and biological processes with the help of Ocean Color Data. The research is primarily based on remote sensing data being a first step to determine properties and propagation boundaries of the outflow into the open Baltic Sea. During research we could analysis different types of remote sensing data including color composite images from MODIS Terra/Aqua, OLI/TIRS Landsat 8; MSI Sentinel 2; OLCI Sentinel 3. The oceanographic experiments include CTD transects and determination of turbidity and CHL-a concentration in outflow waters to describe water properties of the outflow and provide verification of satellite data. Results of a combined experiment for determination of the Vistula Lagoon outflow distinctive features with the use of satellite images from optical sensors and oceanographic in-situ data are shown.

TI  - Impacts of land use policy on the recovery of mountain catchments from acidification
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Watersheds in mountainous regions provide water resources available to large downstream areas. Acidification of mountain waters leads to problems in water quality with impacts to drinking water supply and biodiversity conservation. Effects of the land use policy, air pollution and forest canopy on acidification of headwater catchments in the Jizera Mountains were studied in the period of 1982-2015. The archive of LANDSAT imagery and a field inventory was used to reconstruct changes in the vegetative cover. The atmospheric deposition of acidic substances (sulphate, nitrate, and ammonia) in studied catchments was approximated by a spatial interpolation. The acid atmospheric load culminated in the 1980s. The Helsinki protocol on the reduction of sulphur emissions lead to a reduced open field deposition of sulphur, but, the atmospheric deposition of sulphur and nitrogen is also controlled by the vegetative canopy. A drop in the acid load and a recovery of surface waters from acidification were observed with the harvest of spruce forests. The existing land use policy, institutes of 'protected headwater area' and 'zones of hygienic protection' (Water Act 138/1973) were ineffective in this situation. In a catchment scale, the proposed scenario of structured forestry zones (respecting riparian buffers, stability of steep slopes, significant fog drip areas, peat spots) can decrease the annual load of sulphur and nitrogen by approx. 30%.

AB  - Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite images present directional reflectance effects caused by the configuration of the 12 detectors of the Multispectral Instrument (MSI). These effects are more distinct over water bodies due to water optical properties and they are often described by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Kernel based models that simulate the BRDF can lead to their elimination. In this study, the c-factor approach along with the Ross-Li BRDF model are employed in order to calculate the Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) for all the pixels of S2 images. NBAR allows prediction of reflectance for nadir observations for all the detectors of the MSI. Results prove the effectiveness of the methodology over ocean scenes.

AB  - SENTINEL-2 (S2) is a European wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission consisting of two twin satellites with a high revisit frequency that contributes to ongoing multispectral observations and enhances Copernicus services and applications such as continuous coverage of overseas and oceans with the production of global maps of phytoplankton chlorophyll and other sea surface properties that contribute to the air-sea flux of carbon dioxide and other climate relevant gases.The S2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) features two distinct arrays of 12 detectors mounted on each focal plane covering VNIR and SWIR channels respectively, in order to cover the whole instrument field of view. The configured operation of the 12 detectors introduces bidirectional reflectance effects on the S2 satellite images, which are more distinct over water bodies due to water inherent optical properties.In this study, three methods for the elimination of the bidirectional reflectance effects are evaluated: i) The c-factor approach along with the Ross-Li model, that simulates the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) for calculating the Nadir BRDF Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR), ii) an image-based method, which encompasses the across-track reflectance variances, using for each column, the deviation between the column mean value and a polynomial trendline which is constructed to fit all the column mean values, and iii) a method which adjusts the reflectance values of each detector to those originated from the detector with the closest to nadir view zenith. Furthermore, the ACOLITE atmospheric correction software was evaluated in terms of reflectance variance elimination when S-2 images are processed.A mosaic of S2 images presenting the Ionian Sea, southwest of Greece has been used for the evaluation. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the NBAR methodology over ocean scenes proving that physical models adequately describe bidirectional causes and effects. The other two methods smooth variances between the detectors, however, they do not eliminate the BRDF effects. ACOLITE software did not achieve to reduce reflectance variances in S-2 images.

AB  - Oil spill pollution comprises a significant threat of the oceanic and coastal ecosystems. A continuous monitoring framework with automatic detection capabilities could be valuable as an early warning system so as to minimize the response time of the authorities and prevent any environmental disaster. The usage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired from satellites have received a considerable attention in remote sensing and image analysis applications for disaster management, due to the wide area coverage and the all-weather capabilities. Over the past few years, multiple solutions have been proposed to identify oil spills over the sea surface by processing SAR images. In addition, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) have shown remarkable results in a wide variety of image analysis applications and could be deployed to overcome the performance of previously proposed methods. This paper describes the development of an image analysis approach utilizing the benefits of a deep CNN combined with SAR imagery to establish an early warning system for oil spill pollution identification. SAR images are semantically segmented into multiple areas of interest including oil spill, look-alikes, land areas, sea surface and ships. The model was trained and tested using multiple SAR images, acquired from the Copernicus Open Access Hub and manually annotated. The dataset is a result of Sentinel-1 missions and EMSA records for relative pollution events. The conducted experiments demonstrate that the deployed DCNN model can accurately discriminate oil spills from other instances providing the relevant authorities a valuable tool to manage the upcoming disaster effectively.

AB  - Individual drainage basins of ice sheets specify the glaciated area that is drained by a single outlet glacier. These catchments are needed to partition mass balance measurements to the single glacier level. Until now complete glacier inventories that contain annotated basin information are missing for the Earth's two ice sheets. Here we present delineations of all major outlet glacier catchments in Northeast Greenland that have been produced by a modified watershed algorithm using TanDEM-X elevations and Sentinel-1 velocity measurements. The approach shows the potential to generate a complete basin inventory for entire Greenland and Antarctica.

M3  - Article
AB  - Concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that exceed air quality standards affect human health and have an impact on the earth's radiation budget. The lack of round the clock ground-based observations from a dense network of air quality stations inhibits the understanding of PM2.5's spatio-temporal variability and the assessment of its health and climate effects. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) values retrieved from satellite based instruments can be used to derive surface PM2.5 concentrations. This study integrates Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD retrievals and simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) to determine the ground-level PM2.5 concentrations at a 36 km resolution across India. WRF-Chem simulations provide the factor relating the AOD with the PM2.5. Satellite-derived PM2.5 mass concentrations are compared with the available ground-based observations across India for the year of 2011. The results show a correlation between the satellite-derived monthly PM2.5 estimates and the ground-based observations for 15 stations in India with coefficients of 77% and diurnal scale coefficients varying from 0.45 to 0.75. The best estimations of PM2.5 mass concentrations on a spatio-temporal scale across India address various environmental issues.

AB  - Aerosol distribution and its impact on cloud properties have always remained as an unsolved problem. The complexity lies due to both direct and indirect effect of aerosol on cloud and the atmosphere. The development of satellite meteorology has empowered the studies in atmospheric science and has opened the doors for a more novel and path breaking research in this field. In this work, we attempt to study the correlation of seasonal variations in the anomaly of aerosol and cloud dynamics. The region of this study is chosen over New Delhi and four consecutive years (2014-2017) of MODIS cloud and aerosol retrieved products are considered for this work.

AB  - Coastal Subsidence is a global phenomenon that caused by both natural and anthropogenic activities. The impact of coastal subsidence can affect the monitoring of sea level rise by in-situ tide gauges. The Korean peninsula is one of such areas that reported considerably rapid sea level rise than the global average in the recent years. The objective of this study is to estimate the earth's surface movements along the coastal areas of Pohang, South Korea. To achieve that, we acquired C-band Sentinel-1 data during 2016 - 2017. Time-series InSAR technique is applied to measure displacements at high-resolution with reduced decorrelation noise from interferograms. The results showed about 1.83 cm/year subsidence in the Pohang coastal area, where significant sea level rise is observed in this region. The results will provide further insight into the localized subsidence rates in the study sites and its impact on the sea level monitoring.

AB  - Subsidence is a widespread phenomenon caused by both natural and anthropogenic activities, particularly in the coastal areas. Eventually, the impact of coastal subsidence can affect the monitoring of sea level rise by in-situ tidal gauge stations. The Korean peninsula is one of such areas that reported considerably rapid sea level rise than the global average in the recent years. Therefore, there is a need for assessing the land subsidence component of relative sea level rise for better future prediction models. Space borne interferometric SAR technique provides millimeter level of accuracy in displacement measurements. The objective of this study is to estimate the earth's surface movements along the coastal areas of Pohang, South Korea. To achieve that, we acquired C-band Sentinel-1 data during 2016 2017. Time-series Stanford Method of Persistent Scatter (StaMPS) InSAR analysis proved technique to measure displacements at high resolution with reduced decorrelation noise from interferograms. The results showed about 1.83 cm/year subsidence in the Pohang coastal area, whereas significant sea level rise is observed in this region. The results will provide further insight into the localized subsidence rates in the study sites and its impact on the sea level monitoring.

AB  - The paper explores Napoleon's attitude towards the philosophical controversies of his time and to the spiritualism that was taught at the Imperial University. Napoleon's ideological evolution, and the extent to which he was acquainted with the philosophical ideas of his epoch is also discussed. In light of Napoleon's praise of Royer-Collard's philosophy, the author looks for the object of Napleon's approval in the new system. The author suggests that it was the general orientation against "ideologists" (something Napoleon acknowledged in his communication with Talleyrand). Not only the orientation against "ideologists" was important for the emperor, but also the way in which it was established: flawless, inescapable, refined. It is argued that Napleon could approve of Royer-Collard's arguments about the incompleteness of the knowledge of man that sensualists possessed, the limitations of their theory of the ideas, and their inability to justify virtue with their own principles. Among other possible reasons behind his approval are Royer-Collard's attacks on the lack of clarity, the metaphorical and hypothetical character of many philosophical assumptions of the "ideologists", his appeals for their expulsion from science, the demand to rely only on established facts. Finally, Royer-Collard's ontological scheme - matter, soul, God - was not in opposition to the emperor's worldview. It is remarkable that Royer-Collard, as any other university professor of his time, found it possible to derive the existence of God from the overall collection of the phenomena observed by the man. Napoleon proved to be right in his prediction of the fall of the school of "ideologists" and its replacement by the contemporary spiritualist ideas. However, his political ideas, which the emperor also thought to be important, never became an incentive either for Royer-Collard or for other philosophers, who valued his thinking and were inspired by it. Of course, the philosophy in its development is subject to the influence of social factors, but it can't be completely reduced to a political calculation.

AB  - Hyperspectral data provides huge amount of detailed information about spectral properties of the objects. In the era of fast data volume enlargement, it is necessary to develop methods and algorithms which are capable for information extraction from Big Data. On the other hand, plenty of phenomena observed on Earth reveal (multi)fractal character or properties. In our work, we focus on application of multifractal formalism for remote sensing data analysis. In this paper, we present an example of multifractal parameters estimation for aerial hyperspectral dataset analyses. We have applied the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MDFA) for spectral signatures description.

TI  - Leveraging Technology to Manage Chagas Disease by Tracking Domestic and Sylvatic Animal Hosts as Sentinels: A Systematic Review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Review
AB  - Surveillance of Chagas in the United States show more is known about prevalence in animals and vectors than inhumans. Leveraging health information technology (HIT) may augment surveillance efforts for Chagas disease (CD), given its ability to disseminate information through health information exchanges (HIE) and geographical information systems (GISs). This systematic review seeks to determine whether technological tracking of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels can serve as a potential surveillance resource to manage CD in the southern United States. A Boolean search string was used in PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Relevance of results was established and analysis of articles was performed by multiple reviewers. The overall Cohen statistic was 0.73, demonstrating moderate agreement among the study team. Four major themes were derived for this systematic review(n = 41): animals act as reservoir hosts to perpetuate CD, transmission to humans could be dependent on cohabitation proximity, variations in T. cruzi genotypes could lead to different clinical manifestations, and leveraging technology to track T. cruzi in domestic animals could reveal prevalent areas or "danger zones." Overall, our systematic review identified that HIT can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. Health information technology can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. This can be accomplished by tracking domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels within a GIS. Information can be disseminated through HIE for use by clinicians and public health officials to reach at-risk populations.

TI  - "You Were a Witness Against Yourself": McCarthy's Judge as Chamberlain's Interlocutor in <i>Blood Meridian</i>
T2  - CRITIQUE-STUDIES IN CONTEMPORARY FICTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In his 1985 novel Blood Meridian, Cormac McCarthy takes his challenges to the divine order directly to one of its self-proclaimed adherents: Samuel Chamberlain. Throughout the novel, the reader can observe a discourse between McCarthy's nineteenth century historical source texts, principally Samuel Chamberlain's My Confession (1956), and McCarthy's own twentieth-century sensibilities. The dialog McCarthy creates between his text and Chamberlain's results in Blood Meridian's rebuttal to the nineteenth century Christianity of My Confession in favor of a scientific, naturalist view of the world as represented by the judge. Furthermore, as a part of that discourse, McCarthy not only countervails Chamberlain's Christian worldview but the very notion of his public "confession" as a witness of the Glanton Gang's atrocities; McCarthy achieves this through the figure of the kid who is a witness only unto himself and cannot confess in the same way that Chamberlain does.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on such plentiful material as journalism, literary criticism and ego-documents by Zinaida Gippius of the emigration period this article is the first one to present an analysis of her views on the vocation of Russian writers and their moral responsibility for the fates of Russia and Europe. After 1917, the understanding of the writer's vocation seen by Gippius in many aspects coincided with the views of the radical part of the Russian diaspora who considered the preservation of cultural traditions and the rebirth of Russia as one of their most important tasks. Similarly to D. Merezhkovsky, I. Burin or D. Filosofov, Gippius perceived emigration as a vocation and a historical mission, claiming that literature and its creators are crucial in shaping cultural and national identity. Emphasizing the connection of literature with a given historical moment, Gippius considered emigre writers as "depositories of truth and values", who should participate in the liberation of their homeland. Gippius raised the question of their civic responsibility and activity, their participation not only in cultural life, but also in social life. She disapproved of the writers' individualism and subjectivism (the concept of "pure art"). A characteristic feature of Gippius's emigre critics became a special interest in the ideological meaning of the works, and her assessment of the writers was often dependent on their worldview, especially their political views. Gippius' journalism, literary criticism and ego-documents prove that she considered the terms "true writer" and "true man" as synonyms, especially when the author took moral responsibility not only for his own words but also for his own life choices.

AB  - The study of the marine coastal accumulative forms' relief allows clarify the regularities of their evolution. The use of satellite imagery to create bathymetric maps provides information about structure and dynamics of the underwater relief. To date, there are a number of developed algorithms for calculating the depths using satellite data with an expanded range of spectral channels (WorldView-2/3). There are also designs for using images with a standard range of channels (Red-Green-Blue-NIR).The objective of this study is to build bathymetric maps based on data from the non-commercial satellite Sentinel-2. The studied accumulative forms are located in the Black and Azov Seas. Regions characterized by increased muddiness and a small number of cloudless days. In this study the qualitative information was obtained about presence and value of the underwater part of the accumulative forms' dynamics. It has been shown that the detail of the Sentinel-2 images for this purpose is sufficient. The algorithm, chosen for mapping, is based on the use of the linear regression method of the ratio of natural logarithms of the reflected radiation values of pairs of channels. The software implementation of mapping was based on the ScanEx Image Processor software.Digital bottom relief models were obtained for two sites with depths of 0-7 m. For correct of the underwater relief at greater depths, the obtained DEMs were supplemented with data from navigation maps. Estimation of accuracy was carried out according to the bathymetric measurements made by the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology RAS. The analysis showed that Sentinel-2 images are an important source of data for scientific research in shallow water areas. However, there are limitations that do not allow creating a universal method for creating bathymetric maps.

AB  - The length of the coastline and area of the water body are important parameters for geographical statistical calculations, lithodynamic studies, researcher of the land-sea contact zone. Traditionally, the length of the coastline and the area of water bodies were determined by navigational or topographic maps. Both systematic errors, related to errors in mapping or different approaches to determining of coastline position, and errors, related to the high dynamics of the coastal zone, affected to accuracy of such determination. For majority of sea coasts, especially for accumulative, planimetric and high-altitude variability of the water edge position connected with sea level fluctuations or abrasive-accumulative processes is significant. High-and medium-resolution multispectral satellite imaging technologies have opened up new possibilities for clarifying of water bodies' boundaries and areas. In addition, the theoretical understanding of the coastal development mechanisms, causes and characteristics of their dynamics has expanded significantly in recent decades.The task of this work is to clarify the current coastline length and area of the Sea of Azov. Remote data type was chosen taking into account the survey one-time for the all sea area, spatial coverage, resolution and the availability of spectral channels for accurate determination of the water-land boundary. Images from the satellite Sentinel-2 have optimal combination of characteristics. Total length of the shores of the Azov Sea in 2018 amounted to 3430 km, its area - to 40570 km(2). The length of the shores of the Azov Sea without isolate parts amounted to 2100 km, its area - to 35095 km (.) Analysis of the results showed that the Sentinel-2 images can be used for revision of parameters of the inland seas.

TI  - RELIGIOUS THEMATICS IN UKRAINIAN MUSICAL CULTURE OF THE XIXTH CENTURY: HISTORICAL PREREQUISITES
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article: the analysis of socio-historical citrumstances of musical and religious creativity of Ukrainian composers of the 19th century under the conditions of belonging of the Ukrainian lands to the different empires- Russian and Austrian (Austro-Hungarian). The methodology of the research includes the historical method necessary for the peculiarities analysis of the composers' music-religious creativity development of the Dnieper and Western Ukraine in the long evolutionary process, the traditions of performance and the formation of the foundations of composer's creativity; retrospective and structural-systemic methods in the studios of specific music and religious artifacts; historical and comparative principle in tracing the socio-political circumstances of composing religious music of the nineteenth century, as well as in determining its role in a particular sociohistorical environment. The research novelty of the article is to present the religious works of the most prominent representatives of the musical culture of the Dnieper arid Western Ukraine of the 19th century, M. Lysenko and M. Verbitsky - canonical or religiously related - from the standpoint of the historical processes in the Russian Empire and the Austrian Empire, as well as in covering the peculiarities of the musical language of the works mentioned. The connection between the choice of genre model and the system of musical and expressive means and the specific historical and social circumstances in which they were written, allows understanding the motivation of the composers' appeal to sacred genres or religious subjects, the intensity of their creative ideas regarding the choice of means andArms of spiritual content. The Conclusions. Thus, the historical and political prerequisites that emerged in the Ukrainian society of the nineteenth century in the Russian and Austrian empires, conditioned both the motivation of the composers to appeal to religious genres and themes, and the specificity of their individual interpretation of the musical language in these works. For M. Lysenko, the most important thing was to emphasize the national and patriotic orientation of spiritual works, as well as the reliance on folk-ritual sources and the conscious continuation of the centuries-old tradition of spiritual music. Instead, the post-Lysenko school, especially his students and followers, give such vivid examples of spiritual music as the liturgical opuses of Kyrylo Stetsenko, Mvkola Leontoiych, Oleksandr Koshyts and others. In them, the "sacral and secular" parity is already being revealed in a new worldview dimension, in accordance with new historical realities in the struggle for the consolidation of the Ukrainian idea. In Western Ukrainian music and religious work, the Bormiansky tradition, and more broadly- the spiritual concert of the eighteenth century, played the role of a national standard up to the beginning of the twentieth century, when young generations (Stanislav Liudkevych, Vasyl Barvinskyi, Nestor Nyzhankivskyi, etc.) define the task of music in society in a new way, and thus rethink its artistic and expressive system. They do not abandon the numerous and varied allusions to biblical themes, the use of characteristic intonational appeals formed in spiritual genres, but give them a completely different, more modern ,figurative-aesthetic and stylistic interpretation, consistent with the historical changes in the lift of Ukrainian society.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node - historical background and current views on its significance in complex management of breast cancer patients
T2  - BRATISLAVA MEDICAL JOURNAL-BRATISLAVSKE LEKARSKE LISTY
M3  - Review
AB  - Nowadays, breast cancer is the leading oncological diagnosis in women worldwide. On the other hand, breast cancer treatment can be considered one of the most progressive therapeutic approach in the medical field of oncology. The invasive types of breast cancer have a tendency to spread via lymphatic route, what brings in the issue of sentinel lymph node - the first node into which the lymph drains from a given anatomical location. This review paper discusses the historical background of the concept of sentinel lymph node and focuses on clinical significance of the positivity of sentinel lymph node(s)as well. Modern-day conservative therapeutic surgery of breast cancer should be in accordance with diagnostic and preventive interventions in the axilla, whose rate of invasiveness and morbidity must be also attenuated without worsening the patient ' s prognosis and survival rate. Formerly, a complete axillary lymph node dissection was routinely performed for prophylactic and cancer staging purposes. The indiscriminate application of this approach was replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy. Along with common histopathological examination, immunohistochemistry, as well as modern techniques of molecular biology are often employed. These state-of-the-art methods enabled the identification of micrometastases, or even nanometastases, though their real prognostic value is yet to be concluded (Ref. 52). Text in PDF www.elis.sk.

AB  - This study provides quantitative estimates of wind waves breaking contribution to dual co- and cross-polarized radar scattering. Extending approaches suggested by [1], [2], 1696 RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar measurements collocated with 65 in situ National Data Buoy Center buoys observations are analyzed. For VV polarization, wave breaking contribution decreases from 60% to 20% with increasing incidence angle, while for HH polarization and cross-polarization wave breaking contribution is about 60%-70% at all incidence angles. Empirical dependencies of wave breaking contributions to co- and cross-pol signals on wind speed, incidence angles and azimuth are then suggested.

T2  - ESTONIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The core properties of the wave climate and its changes in the Caspian Sea are established in terms of the annual mean significant wave height and its regional changes in 2002-2013 based on the outcome of the satellite altimetry mission JASON-1. Remotely estimated wave heights are validated against properties of the empirical distribution of instrumentally measured wave heights in the southern Caspian Sea and monthly averages of visually observed wave heights at three locations. A correction for systematic differences leads to very good correspondence between monthly averaged in situ and satellite data with a typical root mean square difference of 0.06 m.The average significant wave height in the Caspian Sea is 0.5-0.7 m in the northern basin of the sea, around 1.2 m in large parts of the central and southern basins and reaches up to 1.8 m in the northern segment of the central basin. The basin-wide average wave intensity varied insignificantly in the range of 1.02-1.14 m in 2002-2013. These estimates overestimate the wave heights by about 30% because low wave conditions are ignored. Substantial and statistically significant changes in the wave height occurred in certain areas. The wave height decreased by 0.019 +/- 0.007 m/yr in the eastern segment of the central basin and by 0.04 +/- 0.04 m/yr in the western segment of the southern basin. These changes can be explained by an increase in the frequency of westerly winds at the expence of southerly winds. Both basin-wide and regional extreme wave heights exhibit large interannual variations but do not show any significant trend. The patterns of changes in mean and extreme wave height are different. The average wave height has increased while the extreme wave height has decreased in the eastern segment of the southern basin.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the climate elements which plays an important role in ecosystem water balance, including in oil palm plantations. Therefore, many mathematical equations and algorithms have been developed and designed to estimate and determine the spatial distribution of evapotranspiration. Remote sensing data are one of the important sources and techniques to estimate spatial variation of various climate elements, including ET. The main objective of this research is to estimate the spatial variation of ET using the SEBAL algorithm and Landsat-8 imagery of a large-scale commercial oil palm plantation, i.e. PT Perkebunan Nusantara VI Batanghari, Jambi Province, Indonesia. The analysis is carried out using Landsat-8 (OLI/TIRS) data and reference meteorological data from a micrometeorology flux tower. We calculated surface radiance, reflectance, albedo, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index ( NDVI), emissivity, surface temperature, net radiation, soil heat flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux to derive the hourly and daily evapotranspiration from the study area. Validation of ET from the SEBAL model were performed against ET from aerodynamic measurements from a micrometeorological tower at the same site. Differences in ET within "only oil palm cover" are relatively low and that difference in ET over the entire area of the oil palm plantation is mainly between oil palm vs. open lands, roads, and buildings. The evapotranspiration values of oil palm cover (NDVI 0.45-0.54) were between 2.42 +/- 0.36 - 3.36 +/- 0.17 mm d(-1). There was no significant difference between ET derived from SEBAL compared to aerodynamic methods (p-value = 0.598; r = 0.75).

AB  - Fires occur every dry season. The frequency of fires is increasing each year. Peat fires often occur in developed and developing countries. Peat fires also occurred in Indonesia, particularly Sumatra, Kalimantan and Papua. Peat fires can be monitored by utilizing remote sensing technology, using the hotspot data from Terra / Aqua MODIS. The more hotspots, the higher is the potential peat fires. Knowing the frequency and distribution of hotspots is expected to reduce the impact of fire. The objective of this study was to determine the utilization of modis data to analyze frequency and distribution peatland future fires . This study is exploratory and descriptive. The method used in this research is quantitative. Collecting data using secondary data is data Hotspot. Hotspot image obtained from Terra / Aqua MODIS with the implementation of the algorithm for the fire. Hotspots are classified into three: confidence low, medium and high. Spatial analysis is done between data hotspot with the image of the spectral transformation. The results showed that the distribution of the most concentrated Hotspot District of Simpang Empat as many as 821 include a satellite 419 satellite 402 aqua and terra. District of Cintapuri Darussalam was the District in the last eight years was not found hotspots. Distribution and frequency of hotspots on the surface of the earth is an indication of a peat fire. Faster detection can be done immediately for prevention by forecasting.

AB  - Nowadays, the road accidents in modern urban areas are increased to uncertain level. In highly populated countries like India, more than 410 people get swooped up every day. A leading cause of the global burden of public health and fatalities is road accidents. The loss of human life due to accident is to be avoided. There is no technology in current times for detection of accident. Reaching of ambulance to the accident location is mostly delayed due to the conjested traffic that increases the chance of victim death. To reduce loss of life or save life of person due to accidents and reduce the time taken by ambulance to reach the hospital, there is a need of system which needs to come into force in our daily lives. To bar loss of human life due to accidents, we introduce a scheme called automatic accident rescue system (AARS). There is an automatic detection of accident by crash sensors in the vehicle. A GPS module in the vehicle will send the location coordinates of the accident using IoT platform to central unit which will notify and send an ambulance from the nearest hospital in the vicinity to the accident spot. This scheme is fully automated; thus, it finds the accident spot, helping to reach the hospital in time. This system can help in reducing the loss of lives of human which happen by the accident.

AB  - In the present study the particulate matter (pM) mass concentrations such as PM2.5 and PM10 for the winter (November 2016 -February 2017) and summer (March 2017 -May 2017) months were observed and analyzed. The aerosol optical properties such as MODIS-Aqua AOD (Aerosol optical depth) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) were found the significance seasonal variations. Monthly average AOD (similar to 1.00) and AE>1 were observed in the winter season. Whereas, in the summer season monthly average AOD (-0.50) and AE<lwere observed. High monthly mean aerosol mass loading was recorded for both PM2.5 (156.38 +/- 21.24 mu g/m(3)) and PM10 (256.54 +/- 69.82 pg/m(3)) in winter season. Whereas concentrations of PM(2.)5 (25.47 +/- 16.95 mu g/m(3)) in April 2017 and PM10 (127.68 +/- 51.31 mu g/m(3)) in May 2017 were found low in summer season, typically exceeding national standard. The mean PM(2.)5/PM10 ratio was similar to 61% in the winter season, is the indicative of a higher loading of the fine aerosol particles compared to the coarser aerosols in Varanasi. However the unfavorable meteorological conditions are also responsible for the highly increasing atmospheric pollution in Varanasi.

TI  - Geo-Statistical Modelling of Remote Sensing Data for Forest Carbon Estimation-A Case Study on Sikkim, Himalayas

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Computing and Communication (IC3)
CL  - Rangpo, INDIA
AB  - The mountainous topography coupled with the high biodiversity throws up the range of challenges in remote sensing of forests for forest carbon assessment. The correlations between vegetation indices or grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) metrics and forest carbon cannot be reliably used in the estimation of forest carbon in biodiversity-rich mountainous topography of Sikkim Himalayas due to geometric, spectral and radiometric distortions. In this paper, an attempt has been made to apply the geo-statistical modelling of aboveground terrestrial vegetation carbon in Sikkim using products derived from remotely sensed satellite data, GIS and ground sampling data. The paper makes use of universal kriging as an interpolation method that makes use of semivariogram models for spatial autocorrelation to make a prediction of forest carbon at unsampled locations. The errors associated with prediction have been estimated. Remote sensing derived forest type and forest density maps have been used as cokriging parameters. Cross-validation technique has been used to evaluate the interpolation results. The analysis reveals that the total aboveground vegetation carbon stored in the forests of Sikkim is about 29.46 million tonnes. Importantly, the montane wet temperate forests contain the maximum forest carbon of 8.46 million tonnes, while the least carbon (1.03 million tonnes) is stored in the moist alpine scrub.

TI  - SURPRISES OF TYPOLOGY: FROM THE WORLD OF ANCIENT GREEK AND KAZAKH LYRIC POETRY
T2  - REVISTA DE ETNOGRAFIE SI FOLCLOR-JOURNAL OF ETHNOGRAPHY AND FOLKLORE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the spirit of the law of typological succession, pioneered by Boris Putilov, the living Kazakh oral-written tradition, with its vibrancy and its typological completeness can explain the nature of ancient Greek poetry, which we have only in fragments, and, in case of the obscure Archilochus' so-called Cologne fragment, without obvious context. Agon in ancient Greece and aitys (song competition) in Kazakhstan gave rise to a specific culture of word and behavior. Thanks to Kazakh source material, it becomes possible to advance the hypothesis about the typological affinity of the Archilochus fragment to the idiosyncratic genre of the aitys in letters. The living sheds light on the long dead. The Kazakh present-day experience suggests that we should read the ancient Greek texts as chronologically distant, but typologically close in terms of worldview. The fragments of the past find not only form, but also, in their way, a voice, and reveal themselves as signs of a long-ago type of behavior.

M3  - Meeting paper
AB  - Annual climate variability which is monsoon and inter-annual climate variabilities which are ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillation) and IOD (Indian Ocean Dipole) affect the processes of aquatic productivity in the sea. Enrichment processes such as upwelling, river runoff, and mixing that occurs in the waters area cannot be separated from the influence of climate variability. Each of these waters has different responses to climate variability. Enrichment variability on the marine areas has affected to the fluctuations of fisheries abundance of both seasonal and inter-annual, so there are times in a given year occurred season and abundance of fish in another famine fish. This study aimed to assess the effect of climate variability ( monsoon, ENSO, and IOD) on aquatic productivity, fish catches, and time of fish season in the waters of Jepara using descriptive methods. Variability of aquatic productivity was determined based on indicators of chlorophyll-a MODIS satellite imagery. The results of the study showed that the monsoon is the most influence on aquatic productivity and Sea Surface Temperature (SST) in Jepara waters. High productivity occurs in the west and east season. In particular, the highest productivity generally occurs in the east. Harvesting of fish in the waters of Jepara occur in transitional season I (March-May) and Transition II season (September-November), there are lag time 1-3 month after highest peak of chlorophyll-a. The fish lean season occurs in the west, generally months from December to January. Interannual climate variability ENSO and IOD showed that significant affect to SST and fish productivity. When El Nino-positive IOD event impact decrase of SST and highest fisheries productivity.

AB  - This is our submission to the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Single-view Semantic 3D Challenge. The task of this track was to predict semantic labels and normalized DSM (nDSM) aboveground heights from a single-view imagery. RGB and Multi-Spectral Satellite data, along with semantic labels and corresponding height ground-truth were provided for training. We show, in this paper, that an ensemble of a few varied backbones employed in a U-Net architecture, is best at the semantic segmentation and height prediction tasks. Specific band combination from the Multi-Spectral Imagery and the use of hybrid of binary cross-entropy and Jaccard loss proved key in higher semantic accuracy. For height prediction, we show that the addition of a coarse-map initialized from either the global mean or median heights, specific to that particular class label to be valuable for fast convergence and accuracy.

AB  - Total suspended solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a concentration are two critical parameters to monitor water quality. Since directly collecting samples for laboratory analysis can be expensive, the technique proposed in this paper takes another approach. TSS and chlorophyll-a are optically active components therefore enable measures through remote sensing. Using data from both Sentinel-2 spectral images and laboratory analysis, an artificial neural network was trained to predict the concentration of TSS and chlorophyll-a. The predictions were evaluated using the R-2 coefficient, where TSS and chlorophyll-a achieved values of 0.7 and 0.72, respectively.

AB  - The article addressed the issues of integrated environmental assessment based on the results of chemical analysis and satellite monitoring data. The method for estimating the anthropogenic load and the degree of territories degradation in the areas of oil production using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), characterizing the change in the state of the vegetation cover, has been proposed. The dynamic of vegetation state change in the Yamal- Nenets Autonomous Okrug was calculated using Landsat satellite imagery data on the basis of GIS ArcGIS Desktop and the results were compared with the data of field observations of the environmental situation. A stable correlation between the NDVI change and the increase of pollution level of the territory was revealed. The thematic maps in GIS were created according to results of analysis.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The study presents the results of iterative process of classification using Maximum Likelihood algorithms to estimate the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-2 (summer-autumn) images for mapping tree species in two forest districts of Penza Oblast of Russian Federation. For classification and validation of thematic maps of tree species distribution we used 298 test sites with independent field data, as well Canopus-V and Resurs-P satellites images of high spatial resolution. The authors also analysed the forest polygons and compared them to the state forest inventory data. Based on the field studies 10 classes of land/forest cover were identified to assess the spatial-temporal structure of the forest areas. In both forest districts tree species were distinguished at 10 m spatial resolution. The use of Sentinel-2A autumn data (October) maximized allocation of forest polygons by species that are more difficult to obtain on summer images due to similarity in spectral characteristics of deciduous species (alder, lime, birch and aspen). The beginning of the change in the phenological conditions of the forest stands allowed distinguishing all estimated tree species. Cross-validated overall accuracies, ranged between 74-85%, showed high degree of agreement between the tree species maps and the ground truth data. Research results can be applied for the long term forest monitoring and development of forest management plan for the investigated region.

AB  - Aim: According to the previous studies conducted in Albania involving Roma communities and in general populations, the prevalence of HBV was 13% and 7%-9%, respectively. Due to this high prevalence of HBV and difficulties accessing adequate healthcare, a screening was performed in some areas where Roma populations live. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HBV in the Roma population in Albania in order to make evidence-based recommendations for increasing the awareness of the population about this disease and increase the access to the vaccination.Conclusion: A higher prevalence of HBV was found among Roma population in Tirana district compared to the general population. The age-group 25-44 years, males, and people residing in Tufina area showed a higher HBsAg positivity rate. Improvement of the sentinel surveillance, increase of the awareness about the disease, promotion of vaccination and healthy behaviour, are the recommended actions that should target the Roma population.

TI  - Thinking about (and of) the infinite as an epistemological problem of Kojeve's philosophical system
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ontological-temporal dualism developed by Kojeve in opposition to Hegel's ontology and Heidegger's anthropology is accompanied by a division of people into "nonphilosophers," "philosophers" and "sages." Their differences are determined by their different epistemological premises (Koyre) and contemplative-active attitudes (Marx). The author argues that Kojeve's epistemological premises not only determine his ontology and anthropology, but also destroy his philosophy of history, which requires a change of the contemplative-active attitude in order to be preserved. The difference in epistemological attitudes consists in a different understanding of the possibility of thinking about the infinite. The idea of the infinite is viewed as a consequence of the finiteness of man and the world in the context of the ontological argument (Anselm, Descartes). A "philosopher" differs from a "non-philosopher" in that a philosophical understanding of the cogito does not require a hypostasis or a substantivation of the idea of the infinite as infinite thinking or, alternatively, as the thinking of an infinite super-being. Therefore, the cogito is inherent in a mortal human being autonomously, reflexively and self-trancendentally. Kojeve argues that the thinkable infinity is "potential," i.e., scholastically speaking, it is what can be called "limitlessness" (interminaturn), whereas "actual" infinity (infinitum) is considered unthinkable and reducible to "potential" infinity. Reducing the "actuality" of infinity to its "potentiality" is incompatible with faith in God, and, therefore, epistemological differences are not resolved discursively; they are a matter of the choice of "worldview" (Weltanschauung). At the same time, according to Kojeve, the epistemological "mistake" that made the "actual" infinity (as well as the God of Abrahamic religions) possible was heuristically productive and via secularization helped modern science to appear. However, the reduction of "actual" infinity precludes the implementation of the most famous of Kojeve's ideas: his idea of the "end of history" is temporalized and, thus, loses its absolute necessity. In light of this, a "philosopher" must actively participate in the implementation of history and finish history. Only that way she can become a "sage."

AB  - Producing a landslide susceptibility (LS) map using the statistical techniques such as the density ratio heavily relies on an existing inventory dataset. In the absence of the data in Western Area, Sierra Leone (Africa), the SBAS-InSAR technique was applied for detecting the ground deformation using multi temporal Sentinel-1 SAR datasets from July 2015 to August 2017. The derived slope displacements coupled with the geomorphological evidence in the ancillary data are used to map the possible landslides in the area. The density ratio technique was used to generate landslide parameter class values. The values are aggregated to create the LS map and the result validated using the degree of fit and the error index. This paper, therefore, highlights a method of creating the landslide inventory and susceptibility in areas where the inventory data are limited or even absent.

AB  - Monitoring ground surface deformation is one key for an early warning system to mitigate against landslide damages. In this study, the SBAS-InSAR technique was applied to analyze forty-seven SLC Sentinel-1A C-band SAR datasets acquired in the interferometric wide-swath (IW) mode for the detection of the time-series surface deformation leading to the Regent landslide events in 2017, Sierra Leone. The potential landslide sites were also identified in the area. It is argued that if the monitoring program using the SBAS-InSAR technique were in place in 2017, an early warning of the imminent slope failure could have been given some days before the landslide events occurred on 14 August 2017.

TI  - Interrelation Between Conceptual and Linguistic Worldviews (Based on the Economic Lexical Item 'CLIENT')
T2  - PSYCHOLINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a theoretical approach to the concept interpretation "worldview" which expresses human knowledge about environment. The difference between conceptual and linguistic worldviews has been determined. Associative meaning represents the conceptual worldview. Vocabulary definitions reflect the linguistic worldview. To identify main peculiarities in conceptual and linguistic worldviews the lexical item 'CLIENT' was selected according to criteria: contextual conditioning, frequency, information, presence in dictionaries and encyclopedias of different areas, expressing relevant concepts nowadays. 915 respondents took part in the experiment. Obtained results (1,600 reactions) have been processed using statistical methods. The application of modeling allowed creating the associative field structure defining core and periphery. Items representing essential features of the concept form the core; secondary features of the subject form the periphery. The core and periphery combine associative meaning of the item. Comparison of lexical and associative meanings has been made according to algorithm: defining main components in the lexeme structure using structural-semantic principle; calculation of core reactions because the lexicon core of the native speaker reflects the actual worldview; establishment total number of core reactions that are connected with vocabulary; determination the level of lexical and associative meanings' approximation. The economic lexical item 'CLIENT' is on the edge of incomplete coincidence according to association and lexical meanings. This fact allows arguing that the conceptual worldview is more dynamic than linguistic. Changes in reality are reflected in core reactions of the associative field only with time being reflected in the lexical meaning.

TI  - IS SCIENCE EPISTEMICALLY AUTONOMOUS? AN OVERVIEW OF SOME CONTEMPORARY DISCUSSIONS
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - In this overview of recent works in philosophy of science, the discussions of the nature of scientific rationalism and epistemic normativity of science are presented as taking place between the two extremes: the radical anarchism of social constructivism that claims that science has no epistemic normativity of its own and complete isolationism, according to which the rationalist norms of science are totally immune to any influence of non-scientific context. The author explores the arguments of the conception of social empiricism, according to which irrationality in the actions of individual scientists as well as in their motivation need not entail irrationality of science as a social enterprise because the factor of consensus plays a role in forming the picture of the world that ends up being accepted by the scientific community. The feminist attack on the traditional ethos of scientist is discussed. It is shown that feminist criticism revealed the hidden biases in what seemed to be a bias-free scientific worldview. However, some counterarguments against egalitarian principles of organization of science are also mentioned. Rudner's hypothesis according to which the comparison of different pieces of evidence on the scale of credibility is always ethically biased is discussed and its influence on the contemporary philosophy of science is explored. Finally, the author presents some recent arguments that suggest that contextual influence on science can be legitimate and illegitimate.

AB  - Komering Watershed has experienced degradation in the quality of environment and ecosystems. This ecosystem and environmental degradation is due to significant deforestation and land conversion in upstream and central areas. Land conversion which led to erosion in the upstream and sedimentation in the downstream causing changes in river channel. This study aims to analyze the deformation (morphodynamics) of river channel of Komering River in 1990, 1997, 2000, 2010 and 2013. The occurred changes are identified using satellite image interpretation and calculation from sinuosity index based on changes in river channel Satellite image data are obtained from multitemporal Landsat images to identify changes in the river channel, while sinuosity index is used as an indicator of changes in the river channel. The results of this study showed that during 26 years period (1990 - 2016), the channel of Komering River changes in eleven locations. There are five locations that indicate tendencies to be straight and six locations show tendencies to get curved. This conclusion is based on the calculation of the sinuosity index value due to changes in land cover.

AB  - The issues addressed in the article relate to the development of modern technology based on open source data compatible with the Copernicus Urban Atlas service. The city atlas of Kyiv was developed within the framework of the project H2020 ERA-PLANET SMURBS (SMART URBan Solutions for air quality, disasters, and city growth). Kyiv became the first city outside the EU for which such a product was created. This technology is based on free satellite data of Earth observations and land cover classification using in-house machine learning methods and geostatistical analysis of building density from open-source vector city maps, including OSM (Open Street Map) data. The distinctive features of the proposed solution are the use of open-source data only and the annual updating of city land cover / land use information. In the future, the developed technology can be applied to other cities.

AB  - Accurate information of actual paddy field area is very importance for food security to support decision making. Remote sensing data is a use-full tools to detect and to create the paddy field area information, because of spatial and temporal characteristics. It is challenging in using the time series single polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to detect such information. This research used the Sentinel-1 VH polarization and GRD level in Subang district of West Java in 2018 with 12-days temporal interval, around 30 temporal data were used. The remote sensing image pre-processing steps were applied in every single data such as geometric correction, backscattered calculation, topographic flattening, and lee filtering. The ready data was in 30x30 meter pixel resolution then be filtered by temporal filter using median moving window. Then, it was transformed using phenological approach by temporal transformation. There are several RGB composite products were compared and analyzed by using paddy field map from Ministry of Agriculture as reference data. The results show that the best RGB composite for detecting paddy field area is the RGB temporal combination using minimum backscattered Jan-June and maximum backscatter of Jan-June or Jan-December. It could be used to identify the paddy field well. Adding with minimum backscattered from July-Dec can be used to identify another seasonal plantation.

T2  - NIGERIAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aim: There are conflicting results of studies on accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for axillary staging. The aim of this study is to determine the factors affecting the efficacy of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET/CT in detecting axillary metastases in invasive breast cancer. Materials and Methods: Data of 232 patients with invasive breast cancer who underwent F-18-FDG PET/CT examination before surgery between January 2013 and September 2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Histopathological examination of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) was used as a reference to assess the efficacy of F-18-FDG PET/CT in detecting axillary metastases. Results: While 134 (57.8%) patients had axillary metastases as detected in F-18-FDG PET/CT scans, histopathologically axillary metastases were detected in 164 (70.7%) patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT in detection of axillary metastasis were 72.56%, 77.94%, 88.8%, 54%, and 74.1%, respectively. The false-negative and false-positive rates were 27.4% and 22%, respectively. In univariate analysis, patients' age, estrogen receptor positivity, higher ALN SUVmax, greater tumor size, and lymph node size determined by F-18-FDG PET/CT were all significantly associated with accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT for axillary metastasis. In multivariate analysis, tumor size determined by F-18-FDG PET/CT and ALN SUVmax were independent variables associated with axillary metastasis. The accuracy of F-18-FDG PET/CT for axillary metastasis was higher in patients with a larger tumor (>= 19.5 mm) and a higher ALN SUVmax (>= 3.2). Conclusion: F-18-FDG PET/CT should not be routinely used for axillary staging, especially in patients with small tumors. It cannot eliminiate the necessity of sentinel lymph node biopsy. When it is used, both visual information and optimal cut-off value of axillary node SUVmax should be taken into consideration.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the work is to select the most informative spectral indices for determining the boundaries of reservoirs and diagnosing the processes of eutrophication of water bodies in the Kirov region. Five satellite images obtained from the Landsat 5 satellite were decrypted. The water color index, turbidity index, chlorophyll concentration index a, normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized index of water refractive index (NDWI) for four reservoirs in the Kirov region were determined: Belokholunitskoye, Omutninskoye, Bol'shoye Kirsinskoye and Chernokholunitskoye. To confirm and correct the data of deciphering the images, we used the results of bathymetric surveys, algological and chemical analyzes of water from the reservoirs of the Kirov region, obtained during ground-based field observations in water bodies. To build index maps, we used the QGIS software product, versions 2.18 and 3.8. Scales for indices were selected empirically, highlighting areas with similar indices. The minimum and maximum values of the index in the reservoirs were taken as the boundaries of the scale. It is noted that with high turbidity (more than 8 units of turbidity by formazine) and high water color (from 42 to 398 degrees of color), the most informative indicators for identifying the boundaries of water bodies are the NDVI and NDWI indices. On satellite images taken in the spring, water color indices, NDVI and NDWI are lower than in the Slimmer. In the Omutninsk reservoir, an increase in the turbidity index during the mass development of phytoplank ton was noted. The ability to assess and compare the degree of development of phytoplankton, its spatial distribution over the water area of the Kirov region reservoirs using the turbidity indices and the concentration of chlorophyll a in water is shown. When analyzing index charts, it was noted that the maximum values of the chlorophyll concentration index a correspond to areas of the water area occupied by thickets of higher aquatic plants (Omutniniskoye reservoir)and shallow areas with delayed water exchange (Om utni risk oye, Belokholunitskoye reservoirs).

AB  - This research features the phenomenon of the so-called literature of space, namely amateur and professional poetic texts that together constitute a cultural supertext devoted to the Siberian coal mining region of Kuzbass. The article employed a multifaceted approach (statistical, pragmatic, textual and temporal/spatial vision analysis) to reconstruct the image of the region in the naive worldview. Statistical analysis identified the key words and semantic models. The cognitive analysis reveals the basic cognitive structures, while the textual analysis makes it possible to reconstruct narrative and perception. The pragmatic analysis determines the communication role model and the predominant speech acts. The study exposes extended thematic nets of geographical, natural and meteorological terms, time description, and coal mining realia. The predominating cognitive models represent Kuzbass as a territory / a living being / treasure trove / home / family, while the most significant motif for professional oeuvre is legitimizing the peripheral area as an inseparable part of the Russian domain and history. Introspection, simultaneity, and strong modality appears to be the most significant text characteristics. Thus, the image of Kuzbass proves to be a complex comprehensive multitiered phenomenon based on different linguistic units and reflecting the results of the evaluative perception and processing.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Aerospace Conference
CL  - Big Sky, MT
AB  - Emergency hazard and risk mapping services are crucial in providing rapid-response information for disaster management and reducing damage of water-driven cascading disasters such as floods. For rapid-response flood mapping, this study introduces an improved flood detection algorithm to fuse two different C-band and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired over the same area of interest, e.g., mega-floodplain. The main objective of this study is to propose a new algorithm for dynamic flood detection using two different SAR images acquired at different times and under different conditions. As an image fusion technique, we propose an improved floodwater detection algorithm using the pixel-based water fractional fusion and wavelet-based image fusion. This approach allows investigating the optimization of fusion parameters from two different products in the case of a premonsoon flash flood.This preliminary study was conducted to identify and estimate large-scale flood inundation area over a challenging area, where flash flood events often occur along the Maghna River in northen Bangladesh. The resultant fused map of the maximum flood-detect extent suggested the possibility of a rapid and accurate floodwater detection to identify the flood location and extent area with the validation data from ground-truth survey in the representative experiment sites.

AB  - A multi-dimensional approach is an upcoming technology in disaster risk to understand a real risk. In the case of flooding, dimensions of time and elevation (height) should be considered to produce rapid and accurate risk information. Dynamic spatio-temporal flood prediction is an urgent issue for the risk management of short- and long-duration flooding. The main objective of this paper is to propose a step-wise process for dynamic flood detection using the synchronized floodwater index (SfWI(2)) coupled with 5-day lead-time forecasting data and in-situ water-level data with the primary focus on daily change in flood extent. We mainly employed the 2015 time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data acquired over the study area along the Brahmaputra River where flood events occur annually. Based on scenario-based forecasting water-levels, flood extent maps were created and show the possibility of the proposed multi-dimensional approach as a useful tool for short-duration flood prediction.

AB  - In this paper, we present some preliminary results on change detection using satellite images. We first present a change detection framework that incorporates multiple change detection algorithms. A number of change detection maps, including normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI), non-homogeneous feature difference (NFHD), global Reed-Xiaoli (GRX), chronochrome (CC), etc. are integrated to generate the final change map. We then present an algorithm to fuse low spatial resolution but high temporal Landsat and high spatial resolution but low temporal resolution Worldview images. Finally, we compare change detection results using pure Landsat images, pure Worldview images, and fused images. Our results indicate that there is definitely some advantages in using fused images for change detection. It was observed that change maps based on the fused images are slightly better than that of using the pure Landsat images and are worse than the pure Worldview images maps. Consequently, more research is needed in generating high quality fused images so that change detection using fused images can be further improved.

AB  - This paper presents some preliminary results using Landsat and Worldview images for change detection. The studied area had some significant changes such as construction of buildings between May 2014 and October 2015. We investigated several simple, practical, and effective approaches to change detection. For Landsat images, we first performed pansharpening to enhance the resolution to 15 meters. We then performed a chronochrome covariance equalization between two images. The residual between the two equalized images was then analyzed using several simple algorithms such as direct subtraction and global Reed-Xiaoli ( GRX) detector. Experimental results using actual Landsat images clearly demonstrated that the proposed methods are effective. For Worldview images, we used pansharpened images with only four bands for change detection. The performance of the aforementioned algorithms is comparable to that of a commercial package developed by Digital Globe.

AB  - Ground object detection is important for many civilian applications. Counting the number of cars in parking lots can provide very useful information to shop owners. Tent detection and counting can help humanitarian agencies to assess and plan logistics to help refugees. In this paper, we present some preliminary results on ground object detection using high resolution Worldview images. Our approach is a simple and semi-automated approach. A user first needs to manually select some object signatures from a given image and builds a signature library. Then we use spectral angle mapper (SAM) to automatically search for objects. Finally, all the objects are counted for statistical data collection. We have applied our approach to tent detection for a refugee camp near the Syrian-Jordan border. Both multispectral Worldview images with eight bands at 2 m resolution and pansharpened images with four bands at 0.5 m resolution were used. Moreover, synthetic hyperspectral (HS) images derived from the above multispectral (MS) images were also used for object detection. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves as well as detection maps were used in all of our studies.

AB  - Pansharpened Landsat images have 15 m spatial resolution with 16-day revisit periods. On the other hand, Worldview images have 0.5 m resolution after pansharpening but the revisit times are uncertain. We present some preliminary results for a challenging image fusion problem that fuses Landsat and Worldview (WV) images to yield a high temporal resolution image sequence at the same spatial resolution of WV images. Since the spatial resolution between Landsat and Worldview is 30 to 1, our preliminary results are mixed in that the objective performance metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), correlation coefficient (CC), etc. sometimes showed good fusion performance, but at other times showed poor results. This indicates that more fusion research is still needed in this niche application.

AB  - This article is devoted to the historical paintings of N. K. Roerich from the point of view of the artist's desire for historical origins and modern approach to Russian history of medieval age. Roerich created a series of historical paintings, dedicated to the beginning of Kievan Rus on the basis of archaeological research and historical imagination. Roerich's family thought that its origin was associated with the legendary founder of the Russian state - Rurik, as a result of which from an early age in the artist's work appeared Varangian theme.The thinker-painter Roerich was greatly influenced by the estate of his childhood and youth Izvar, with which Roerich's inner connection was not interrupted until the end of his life. Near the estate, he participated in local archaeological excavations of old burial mounds and the experience helped him to engage in professional archaeology and history, with which Roerich has created historical paintings. From Izvara, whose name means in Sanskrit “Lord” or “Supreme” to India - his last place of life, the thinker-mystic Roerich went on the way of searching for the Supreme wisdom and spreading these wisdom as a “messenger” of humanity.Unlike the works of other realistic historical painters, the works of the modernist-Roerich are more decorative, flat, sharp in rhythm, integral in form, luxurious and bold in colors. The historical paintings expressed Roerich's desire to avoid narratives, drama, detailed coverage of events and to illustrate a certain historical moment with the atmosphere of the era and the worldview of history. The color of Roerich goes beyond the usual concepts and acquires symbolic meanings. His bright, sonorous colors not only revive the forgotten old history, but also convey his prophecy and perspective about the future of Russia in a symbolic way.

TI  - The Buddhist worldview of the poet Jeong Wanyeong
TI  - 정완영 시조의 불교적 세계관
T2  - 시조학논총
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study surveys the writing of the poet Jeong Wanyeong, who was primarily writing in the 1960s. He explored the ceremonial rituals and the Buddhist aspects of the world through "formulism" and "lyricism" of the modern founder reaching its 100th anniversary. He also revealed that Buddhist rituals are implicitly embedded in images dominant in his world. Jeong Wanyeong had written over 3,000 poems in his life, where he replaced national emotions with his own poetic aesthetics through his martyrdom, saying, "Poet is the fatherland." Among them, a linguistic fight can be seen, in which Jeong Wanyeong's views of history and life were sublimely harmonized, and where his ethnic emotions can be felt, all while recreating the traditional-as-modern lyrical poem.At the center of the literary museum to which orthographic lyricism is added lies nature's life cycle, along with the quest for the existence of humans and the world, all through the lens of Buddhism and religious imagination. For example, the anthropomorphic anne, which appears in the first jyoujaji, is used to study the Buddhist ritual aspects in the poems of Jeong Wanyeong, while the meaning of the famous temple pilgrimage, which is displayed in the second serial founder, is the third dansillo. Furthermore, the meaning of the flower was classified as sangshi, displayed in each section and observed through each of the three founders. The types usually used in Shijo's creations, such as yongshijo, ancestral founder, and dansillo, are not divided into simple types, but are used as effective creation techniques to represent the Buddhist rituals of John Wanyeong, and meaning is reconstructed.First, unlike the singular originator having more than one number, in "the meaning of the straight finger temple ann sound displayed in yong jakushi,” the elasticity between the poetic material and the speaker's emotion through the scene vividly depicts his youthful integrity. As can be seen, his emotions are beyond the unique category of each test piece, and according to the material of the work, landscapes are drawn flexibly while the essay is inherent in the sound of An.Second, is a focus on the meaning of “the famous temple pilgrimage displayed in the second series” by the founder of the second series where "The structure of the first series founder using subtitles,” a frame-type composition was used with materials inside and outside the temple, creating an external structure. By placing materials inside the body and bringing the internal structure outside, it grasps the essence of the phenomenal world as a poetic event passing from inside through the middle and to the outside, without specifying it in Buddhism (indefinitely). Third, in the meaning of flowers as “Songsi displayed in Dansillo,” the absolute boundaries of Songsi are shown as dansillo with the "free connection network" and "margins of meaning" that are behind flowers. This derives from sympathy with nature, and ships enlightenment as the line-price unionized sangshi. However, we destroy the existing order of balance and harmony by injecting them into the form, and harmonize without logic, or harmony in the transcendent of logic, creating a purposeless free world.

T2  - The Journal of Saramdaum Education
T2  - 인격교육
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study examines the educational methods of the Hitler Youth(Hitlerjugend), a youth organization of Nazi Germany. The educational purpose of the Hitler Youth was to inculcate the German youth with Nazi values, worldview, and racial beliefs. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to examine Hitler’s educational ideals; the inception and growth of the Hitler Youth; the characteristics of the Hitler Youth curriculum; and implications of Hitler Youth educational methods for our society. Hitler’s National Socialist(Nazi) worldview can be broken down into the view of the Germans as a master race, racism, antisemitism, pan-German expansionism, and anti-parliamentarianism. Hitler’s worldview was directly applied to his educational ideals, characterized as “inculcating the supremacy of the German Aryan race” through the Nazi worldview and history education, “fostering strong and vigorous individuals” through physical education and military training, and “strengthening community awareness” through character education. Hitler Youth educational policies centered on education through peer leaders, integrative education, standardized manuals, the intensive use of mass media, and performance assessment. As the main problems of the Hitler Youth education, this study proposes racial superiority ideology, hatred education, and excessive nationalist zeal suppressing independent and creative thinking. The systematic indoctrination of children and adolescents, who have not yet built their own system of thought, with hatred-based education to arouse anger directed towards other races is obviously a serious violation of human rights and abuse of minors by tacitly encouraging them to participate in crimes of the state. It is necessary to remain vigilant against the uncritical inclusion of excessive nationalism and chauvinism in school curricula. It is also of vital importance to foster the cognitive abilities required for unbiased judgement from a balanced and critical perspective in our constantly changing political landscape.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing data have been a valuable tool for severe air pollution event monitoring. In this study, we present the results of smoke plume from the sudden burning accident cases such as chemical explosion and forest fires by using the combination of satellite and trajectory analysis (CSTA) method. CSTA uses the satellite detected smoke plume data and a matching forward-trajectories for generating airmass history pattern. Smoke detection based on the polar- and geostationary-orbit satellite observation data were compared to the forward air mass trajectory analysis by the HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. The use of CSTA for the major event cases reveals remarkable spatial coherence for source-transport pattern. CSTA forecasted points of ES are consistent with the area of satellite detected smoke plume. The success rate of the 24 hour forecast result was about 78.7% in this study. There was good correlation between satellite images and trajectory lines after the explosions, which support the feasibility of using the integration of satellite observed and model derived data for emergency forecasting.

AB  - This paper is a study on the world view and thought of Nam Gang, Lee Seung-Hoon. After meeting Dosan Ahn Chang-Ho in 1907, the Nam Gang began to open its eyes to the people and education and devoted 23 years to the people only until its death in 1930. He founded Osan School(오산학교) as a cradle for new education and joined the secret society Shin Min-hoe(신민회), as well as participated in the March 1 Movement. Later, he went out of his way to celebrate his country's liberation. These activities were by no means accidental, but the result of his firm view of the world and ideas. His view of the world can be explained largely in terms of sincerity, courage and initiative. And his ideas can point firstly to the theory of ethnicity. Ethnic fundamentalism is based on national self-reliance. They say it is difficult to preserve a nation's national anthem without its own power and self-determination. They say it is difficult to preserve a nation's national anthem without its own power and self-determination. Second, his idea boils down to the idea of an educational salvation. His theory of education and salvation means the combination of education and the state. It is said that fostering human strife through education is the way to save the country. Finally, he is emphasizing the theory of national capital. It is the basis of the core idea of the theory of national capital that if national capital is not accumulated, foreign intervention and aggression will be strengthened. Through the fusion and accumulation of national capital, he sought to build up a self-reliant economic power.

TI  - Combining high-resolution images and LiDAR data to model ecosystem services perception in compact urban systems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we aim to understand how the provision of ecosystem services (ESS) is spatially distributed within a compact urban system considering the structure and spatial arrangement of green spaces in relation to built-up areas and other infrastructures. For this purpose, we devised an approach to assess the ESS provided by urban green spaces through the integration of social data (i.e., stakeholders' perception of the multiple benefits of green spaces) with remotely sensed data, such as high-resolution satellite images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point-cloud. We developed a spatially explicit indicator (or metric) called Normalized Difference Green-Building Volume (NDGB), derived from remote sensing, that can be used to predict the way people perceive the ESS conveyed by green spaces in cities. We designed the NDGB metric using the city of Bad, Southern Italy, as a case example by involving four groups of stakeholders (n = 202) to assess ten urban green spaces. Our results show a strong positive relationship between the NDGB and the way stakeholders perceive the ESS provided by these urban green spaces. Thus, our indicator accurately expresses the relationship between stakeholders' perceptions of ESS provided by green spaces and the physical data (i.e., green space structure) produced by remote sensing technology. The green space most highly evaluated by the NDGB indicator, the periurban park "Lama Balice", was also the one on which all stakeholder group responses converged, including the group of NGOs and associations, which assigned average low scores for perceived ESS across all the green spaces presented in the study. The study was developed using the city of Bari in Southern Italy as testbed. There is a need to further extend and replicate our approach to other urban systems across different regions (e.g., Northern Europe, North America, Asia), especially those which are in the process of pursuing more sustainable green infrastructure planning and development, as they could be inclined to adopt our approach in ongoing decision making processes. We believe our approach can inform planners and decision makers on ESS provision and supply them with evidence of the local co-benefits of green spaces as well as of the spatial distribution of ESS within compact urban systems.

AB  - In the framework of the E-SHAPE "EuroGEOSS Showcase: Applications powered by Europe" project, one of the pilot applications concerns the disasters in urban environment. One of the objectives of this application is the conceiving of innovative services for extreme-scale hydro-meteorological modelling that make use of Copernicus Earth Observation data. An example of innovative service is the ingestion of high-resolution Copernicus remote sensing products in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The rationale is that NWP models are presently able to produce forecasts with a spatial resolution in the order of 1 km, but unreliable surface information or poor knowledge of the initial state of the atmosphere may imply an inaccurate simulation of the weather phenomena. It is expected that forecast inaccuracies could be reduced by ingesting high resolution Earth Observation products into the models. In this context, the Copernicus Sentinel satellites represent an important source of data, because they can provide a set of high-resolution observations of physical variables (e.g. soil moisture, land/sea surface temperature, wind speed over sea, columnar water vapor) used in NWP model runs. The possible availability of a spatially dense network of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) stations could also be exploited to allow NWP models to assimilate timely updated data about water vapor in the atmosphere. As a preliminary activity carried out in the frame of the E-SHAPE project, this paper presents the results of the experiments regarding the insertion/assimilation of surface information derived from Sentinel data into a NWP model. The experiments concern a flood event occurred in Italy in 2017 that affected an urban area, namely the Livorno city.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first experimental results of a study on the ingestion in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, of Sentinel satellites and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) derived products. The experiments concern a flash-floodevent occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) in September 2017. The rationale is that numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are presently able to produce forecasts with a km scale spatial resolution, but the poor knowledge of the initial state of the atmosphere may imply an inaccurate simulation of the weather phenomena. Hence, to fully exploit the advances in numerical weather modelling, it is necessary to feed them with high spatiotemporal resolution information over the surface boundary and the atmospheric column. In this context, the Copernicus Sentinel satellites represent an important source of data, because they can provide a set of high-resolution observations of physical variables (e.g. soil moisture, land/sea surface temperature, wind speed) used in NWP models runs. The possible availability of a spatially dense network of GNSS stations is also exploited to assimilate water vapour content. Results show that the assimilation of Sentinel-1 derived wind field and GNSS-derivedwater vapour data produce the most positive effects on the performance of the forecast.

AB  - Modelling of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) temporal variations have been a great concern. However, most previous studies only focused on modelling the SUM variations in the past period, yet those for their future patterns remain rarely investigated. By incorporating various predictable meteorological variables in the SVM regression model, this study achieved an attempt to the prediction for the next-day SUHIs over Chinese main cities. Both the SUHI intensity (SUHII) and the pixel-based Gaussian-simulated LSTs were predicted. The averaged MAE of our predicted SUM across Chinese megacities is 0.67 K; and the MAE for the LST is generally less than 1.5 K. The incorporation of meteorological variables was shown to greatly contribute to the predicted daily SUHIls. We consider our study, by achieving an attempt to the SUM prediction, can improve the understanding of the SUM mitigation.

The extraction of high-resolution satellite remote sensing image information has also gradually increased. Based on high resolution image, this paper discusses its main characteristics, current research progress, main interpretation methods and similarities and differences with traditional interpretation methods, and further research is discussed. An example of surface water information extraction for Miyun Reservoir, China based on Landsat-7 image is preliminary explored. It provides a good reference for choosing different interpretation methods for different research purposes or situations.

AB  - Objective: To assess the clinical outcome of patients with high-risk early-stage endometrial cancer and negative pelvic nodes who received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy plus vaginal brachytherapy (VBT). Methods: This investigation assessed 80 patients who underwent hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy for stage Ib-II, grade 2-3 endometrioid (n = 43) or stage Ia-II nonendometrioid (n = 37) endometrial cancer. Results: Five-year local control rate, 5-year disease-free survival, and 5-year overall survival were 97, 87, and 97%, respectively, for endometrioid carcinoma, and 66, 50, and 72%, respectively, for nonendometrioid carcinoma. Conclusions: This retrospective study appears to show that adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy plus VBT achieve very good results in endometrioid carcinoma. This combined treatment seems to be less effective in nonendometrioid carcinoma. (c) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

M3  - Correction
AB  - The Earth Trends Modeler (ETM) is an earth observation software tool that allows for modeling environmental changes and trend analyses of earth observation data. We used Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS)-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-3rd generation (NDVI3g) and Climatic Research Unit Time Series (CRU-TS) for climate data. We applied Mann-Kendall Monotonic Trend (MKMT) test using the ETM for changing trend analyses, correlation and multiple regression for analyzing relationship between vegetation greenness and climate factors. These methods are effective approaches for conducting long-term monitoring and correlation analyses in broad area using satellite data. These methods were used to analyze the long term data, but mostly focused on national scale study. Our study expanded the methodological applicability over the whole Asia during the last 33 years. In addition, we used spatio-temporal data such as vegetation greenness, rainfall, temperature, and potential evapotranspiration in order to estimate changing trends and relationship analysis ofMKMT test was an applicable method for broad area and analyzed the increasing or decreasing trends using time series dataset with a predetermined level of significance.The correlation and regression analysis were suitable and useful methods to estimate spatial relationships between vegetation greenness and climate factors in the long term period.

AB  - Soil Water storage Capacity (SWC) is an important quantity in the field of hydrology and agronomy, but SWC characterization using classic method is often impossible due to soil spatial variability. In this study we take profit of the new capacities offered by the Sentinel 2 mission, which allows characterizing relevant features in vegetation dynamic linked to stresses and particularly water stresses. In addition, yield map offers an additional source of information. Both yield and vegetation development are sensitive to several factors as the water supply, nitrogen supply, crop installation quality or pest. To isolate the influence of the water supply, and therefore access parameters involved in the SWC, it is necessary to invert a crop model able to simulate the observation together with the representation of most of influencing factors. After a sensitivity analysis we have developed an inversion procedure of the STICS crop model. The procedure was tested on non-irrigated durum wheat in a Mediterranean context in southeastern France. The approach was evaluated on heterogeneous field. Soil heterogeneities are well captured by the method, but some heterogeneities interpreted as soil heterogeneities might be artefacts induced by other factors. A multiyear analysis is then necessary to get the permanent features that are most likely linked to soil properties.

TI  - Mineral footprints of the Paleoproterozoic sediment-hosted Abra Pb-Zn-Cu-Au deposit Capricorn Orogen, Western Australia
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The minerals exploration undercover relies on the understanding of the ore-forming processes and the associated alteration characteristics that are used in vectoring towards a deposit. Previously, the proposed process for forming the 1590 Ma Abra base-metal deposit, hosted at 250 m depth in the Paleoproterozoic Edmund Basin of the Western Australian Capricorn Orogen, was through exhalation to the seafloor (SEDEX-style). Lacking any visible signs of alteration, sediments overlying the Abra deposit were perceived as younger, unaltered, and cutting the mineralisation and associated alteration comprised of siderite, chlorite and minor sericite. However, a recent study delineated a phengitic (i.e. Al-poor, Mg-, Fe-, Si-rich) white mica footprint in regolith above the deposit from hyperspectral field and remote sensing data. This study links the surficial mineral footprint to the deposit below through detailed analysis of hyperspectral data from drill core. The hyperspectral data processing results were validated using optical microscopy, micro-XRF and SEM-EDS analysis, and compared with geochemical, lithological and structural drill core data. Hyperspectral short-wave infrared (SWIR) data revealed a vertically zoned alteration footprint from the deposit to the surface, where very fine-crystalline phengitic white mica (i.e. sericite) and chlorite are most abundant a few tens of metres above the deposit. The abundance of chlorite gradually decreases, and the distal phengitic alteration is cut by the present erosional surface, but only moderately affected by weathering, confirming the surficial footprint detected in the previous study. Similarly, a vertically zoned carbonate alteration was delineated from thermal infrared (TIR) reflectance spectra from drill cores up to 2 km away from the deposit. Carbonate alteration from proximal to distal comprised of Mn-rich siderite, ankerite and ferroan dolomite, which replace the dolomite matrix in coarse-grained stratigraphic sequences. The replacement of dolomite matrix suggests that these permeable horizons acted as fluid conduits, which channelled hydrothermal fluids into sedimentary strata from a feeder structure. The presence of a vertically zoned carbonate and chlorite-phengite footprint in the overlying sediments advocates for their deposition before the ore formation at Abra, and a sub-seafloor replacement within a permeable sedimentary sequence as the ore-forming process. Comparable alteration footprints have been described around some world-class sediment-hosted base-metal deposits, including the Sullivan in the British Columbia, which is considered as a classic SEDEX-style by some and an exhalative-replacement hybrid by others. Also, identical footprints are common around the volcanic-hosted massive sulphide and are associated with the carbonate replacement-style deposits - an overlap which is an interesting future research space where hyperspectral technologies could provide answers. Validated hyperspectral data combined with geochemical, lithological and structural information enabled the identification of a subtle mineral footprint above the Abra deposit, and the established method can be used for vectoring towards other buried mineralisations - even through weathering.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We have derived values of the Ultraviolet Index (UVI) at solar noon using the Tropospheric Ultraviolet Model (TUV) driven by ozone, temperature and aerosol fields from climate simulations of the first phase of the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1). Since clouds remain one of the largest uncertainties in climate projections, we simulated only the clear-sky UVI. We compared the modelled UVI climatologies against present-day climatological values of UVI derived from both satellite data (the OMI-Aura OMUVBd product) and ground-based measurements (from the NDACC network). Depending on the region, relative differences between the UVI obtained from CCMI/TUV calculations and the ground-based measurements ranged between -5.9% and 10.6%. We then calculated the UVI evolution throughout the 21st century for the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5). Compared to 1960s values, we found an average increase in the UVI in 2100 (of 2-4%) in the tropical belt (30°N-30°S). For the mid-latitudes, we observed a 1.8 to 3.4 % increase in the Southern Hemisphere for RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0, and found a 2.3% decrease in RCP 8.5. Higher increases in UVI are projected in the Northern Hemisphere except for RCP 8.5. At high latitudes, ozone recovery is well identified and induces a complete return of mean UVI levels to 1960 values for RCP 8.5 in the Southern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, UVI levels in 2100 are higher by 0.5 to 5.5% for RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 6.0 and they are lower by 7.9% for RCP 8.5. We analysed the impacts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) on UVI from 1960 by comparing CCMI sensitivity simulations (1960-2100) with fixed GHGs or ODSs at their respective 1960 levels. As expected with ODS fixed at their 1960 levels, there is no large decrease in ozone levels and consequently no sudden increase in UVI levels. With fixed GHG, we observed a delayed return of ozone to 1960 values, with a corresponding pattern of change observed on UVI, and looking at the UVI difference between 2090s values and 1960s values, we found an 8 % increase in the tropical belt during the summer of each hemisphere. Finally we show that, while in the Southern Hemisphere the UVI is mainly driven by total ozone column, in the Northern Hemisphere both total ozone column and aerosol optical depth drive UVI levels, with aerosol optical depth having twice as much influence on the UVI as total ozone column does.

AB  - The purpose of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) CoastWatch/OceanWatch/PolarWatch Program (a.k.a. "CoastWatch", https://coastwatch.noaa.gov) is to improve decision outcomes by facilitating the use of ocean satellite data in applications and research. NOAA CoastWatch provides free and open access to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate. Satellites make observations from which several ocean, coastal, and inland water parameters can be derived. Ocean observations from space have the advantage of broad spatial and temporal coverage that complement in situ measurements. While NOAA may be known for operating satellites for use in weather forecasting by the National Weather Service (NWS), NOAA also routinely produces satellite-based ocean data products in support of all NOAA mission services including NWS, National Marine Fisheries Service and National Ocean Service, and the office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. These ocean products are freely and openly available to everyone, including government, academic, commercial and general public users. NOAA CoastWatch has existed since 1989 when the primary focus was on distributing sea surface temperature data for continental US regions. With time and in response to the continual development of ocean observations from space, the CoastWatch scope has expanded. CoastWatch satellite data products now include multiple environmental parameters such as sea surface temperature, ocean color (chlorophyll, etc.), sea surface height (altimetry), ocean winds, surface roughness (synthetic aperture radar), salinity and sea ice. These products have global and regional coverage and near real-time as well as delayed-mode, higher quality and longer term time series datasets. CoastWatch customizes, serves and monitors ocean satellite data products from NOAA and/or non-NOAA satellite missions. We serve a broad audience who use ocean satellite data in operational oceanographic applications. Here, the word "operational" has an expanded definition compared with traditional weather service usage. The program is organized as a "hub and spokes". The "hub" has the primary processing responsibilities and co-located with the ocean satellite environmental data record (EDR; i.e., Level 2) producers. The "spokes" are regional Nodes distributed geographically and across NOAA mission line offices, CoastWatch is well-positioned to bridge upstream ocean EDR producers with downstream user needs. The new interactive data portal enables search and discovery, multi-product visualization and customizable data downloading. Casual or occasional users can search, view and download data products using online interactive tools, including a space and time search. Routine "power" users can use command-line scripts to automate their access. CoastWatch maintains a helpdesk which responds to everything from educating and guiding novice users, help with discovering data products for specific applications, code suggestions to setup routine queries and downloads, etc. The OceanWatch Monitor (https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/socd/om/) enables the assessment of data products over time and in comparison with reference datasets and an internal Data Monitor tracks operational production output. Beyond the helpdesk, CoastWatch offers training courses, develops tutorials to educate and guide users from the novice to the expert.CoastWatch also develops and distributes CoastWatch Utilities (https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/user-resources/coastwatch-utilities.html), a software package, to help users analyze and visualize satellite data products. Some examples of data products, discovery and access pathways, tutorials and several user applications will be presented.

TI  - Integrated approach of RUSLE, GIS and ESA Sentinel-2 satellite data for post-fire soil erosion assessment in Basilicata region (Southern Italy)
T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire effects consist not only in direct damage to the vegetation but also in the modification of both chemical and physical soil properties. Fire can affect the alteration of soil properties in different ways depending on fire severity and soil type. The most important consequences concern changes in soil responsiveness to the water action and the subsequent increase in sediment transport and erosion. Post fire soil loss can increase in the first year by several orders of magnitude compared to pre-fire erosion. In this study a distributed model based on the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is used to estimate potential post-fire soil loss for four different fire events occurred in Basilicata region in 2017. Geographic Information System techniques and remote sensing data have been adopted to build a prediction model of post-fire soil erosion risk. Results show that this model is not only able to quantify post-fire soil loss but also to identify the complexity of the relationships between fire severity and all the factors that influence soil susceptibility to erosion.

TI  - Genomic-polygenic and polygenic predictions for milk yield, fat yield, and age at first calving in Thai multibreed dairy population using genic and functional sets of genotypes
T2  - LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this research were to estimate genomic-polygenic and polygenic variance components and parameters, and to compare prediction accuracies and rankings of animals for 305-d milk yield (MY), 305-d fat yield (FY), and age at first calving (AFC) using three genomic-polygenic models and a polygenic model (PM). Data came from 8361 first-lactation cows from the Thai multibreed dairy population. The genomic-polygenic models utilized the complete set of SNP from GeneSeek GGP80k (ssGBLUP), a genic set composed of SNP associated with MY, FY, and AFC located inside or within 2500 bp of genes in the NCBI database (ssGBLUPS1), and a functional set was a subset of the genic set that included only those SNP that were present in enriched pathways involving these traits (ssGBLUPS2). The 3-trait ssGBLUP, ssGBLUPS1, ssGBLUPS2, and PM included contemporary group (herd-year-season) and heterosis as fixed effects, and animal additive genetic and residual as random effects. REML genomic-polygenic and polygenic variance components and parameters were estimated with program AIREMLF90. MY and FY ssGBLUP heritabilities were higher than PM (0.25 vs. 0.15 for MY, 0.18 vs. 0.14 for FY), but lower than PM for AFC (0.16 vs. 0.19). Genetic correlations were positive between MY and FY (0.65 for ssGBLUP; 0.72 for PM), and negative between MY and AFC (- 0.11 for ssGBLUP; - 0.08 for PM) and between FY and AFC ( - 0.17 for ssGBLUP; - 0.22 for PM). Accuracies of the EBV for MY, FY, and AFC from ssGBLUP and ssGBLUPS1 were similar and higher than those from ssGBLUPS2 and PM. ssGBLUP and ssGBLUPS1 EBV yielded the highest rank correlations of all pairs of models among sires, cows, and all animals for all traits. The similarity between EBV accuracies and rank correlations from ssGBLUP and ssGBLUPS1 indicated that the set of SNP markers in the genic set could be a feasible alternative to the complete SNP set from GeneSeek GGP8Ok for genomic-polygenic evaluation and selection of animals in the Thai multibreed dairy population. However, an annual reassessment of the set of SNP markers included in the genic set would be advisable as additional phenotypic, pedigree, and genotypic information becomes available in future years.

TI  - EARTH OBSERVATION AS AN AID TO COASTAL WATER MONITORING: POTENTIAL APPLICATION TO HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM DETECTION
T2  - EARTH OBSERVATION ADVANCEMENTS IN A CHANGING WORLD
M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In this work we show the application and prospects of the combined use of satellite and in-situ measurements for the monitoring of vulnerable coastal zones. The focus is on areas of outstanding environmental value but subject to strong anthropogenic pressures and recurrent issues like harmful algal blooms (HAB), such as Marine Protected Areas. Given the highly dynamic variability of marine systems, a comprehensive monitoring method needs to combine multiple sources of information. The biogeochemical and physical data of a specific area derived from in situ and satellite sources - MODIS Aqua and OLCI Sentinel 3 - are here compared with specific thresholds, in order to detect the conditions under which a potential damaging event for the environment is likely to occur. This study describes, as an application of the method, an exploratory analysis conducted in an area of Tuscany coast known to be particularly vulnerable to HAB, Ostreopsis ovata (O. ovata). In spite of the discontinuous temporal frequency of the available O. ovata monitoring data, bloom favourable conditions concerning sea state and water temperature were identified from weather stations and buoys data, as well as from satellite data. This monitoring method, together with high resolution hydrodynamic modelling, was originally developed within the ESA Sympa (Satellite assets Integration for Marine Protected Areas) demonstration project.

TI  - [MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network). ARIA's comprehensive solution for mobile app for the multimorbidity of allergic rhinitis and asthma].
T2  - Revista alergia Mexico (Tecamachalco, Puebla, Mexico : 1993)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The vast majority of patients with allergic rhinitis (AR) do not receive the proper management which is recommended by the guidelines, but they frequently self-medicate. MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network) is an integral part of a project that is supported by the European Union against chronic diseases and focused on active and healthy aging. MASK represents the third phase of ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma), in which, by using a mobile application in a smart device, the objective is to guide the patient in the control of his/her multi-morbidity, AR and/or allergic conjunctivitis (AC) and/or asthma. The mobile app Allergy Diary by MACVIA-ARIA is free and it is available for both Android and iOS platforms. After it is downloaded to the patient's cell phone, it first requests some information about the patient's profile, allergic pathologies and medication; afterwards, through a visual analog scale, the patient is invited to determine the degree of affectation in the nose, eyes, and bronchi, and its influence on their productivity at work / school. After analyzing the data generated by filling the Allergy Diary, it became clear there is a new clinical entity: allergic rhinitis+ allergic conjunctivitis +asthma, with greater effect; in addition to a high level of self-medication: in general, the patient takes medication on days when symptoms are present. The app has already been deployed in 23 countries, including several Spanish-speaking countries.

MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel Network) forma parte integral de un proyecto apoyado por la Union Europea contra las enfermedades cronicas y enfocado al envejecimiento activo y saludable. Constituye la tercera fase de ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma), en la cual mediante una aplicacion movil en un dispositivo inteligente se intenta guiar al paciente en el control de su multimorbilidad, rinitis o conjuntivitis alergicas o asma. La aplicacion Diario de Alergia por MACVIA-ARIA es gratuita y esta disponible para Android e iOS. Al descargarla al celular del paciente, a este se le piden datos de su perfil, patologias alergicas y medicacion; posteriormente, mediante una escala visual analogica se le invita a determinar el grado de afectacion en nariz, ojos y bronquios y su influencia sobre su productividad laboral/escolar. Con los datos del Diario de Alergia se observa que existe un nuevo patron de presentacion: rinitis alergica + conjuntivitis alergica + asma, con mayor afectacion, asi como un alto nivel de automedicacion: en general, el paciente toma medicacion cuando presenta sintomas. La app se ha desplegado en 23 paises, incluyendo varios paises hispanohablantes.

TI  - The legacy of lymphedema: Impact on nursing practice and vascular access.
T2  - Canadian oncology nursing journal = Revue canadienne de nursing oncologique
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) is a chronic condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of protein-rich fluid in tissues resulting in swelling of the upper limb or trunk after treatment. Lack of consensus on definition, classification and grading of BCRL has led to subjective and objective parameters estimating incidence and severity. Prospective studies estimate the risk of BCRL to be approximately 21.4% (14.9-29.8). In patients with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), the estimated risk of 19% (13.5-28.2) was about four times higher than those patients who had sentinel lymph node biopsy (5.6%, 6.1-7.9). Seventy percent of these patients will experience BCRL within two years of surgery, 90% within three years, and a 1% rate per year thereafter. Many patients who have no high-risk variables such as mastectomy, ALND and radiation therapy develop BCRL. Patients fear this complication, which has no cure and no proven prevention strategies. Risk reduction strategies, primarily focused on reducing trauma to the surgical arm, are based on anecdotal information and effectively restrict the use of the at-risk limb for the patient's lifetime. Although broad risk reduction strategies have been recommended, the avoidance of needle sticks has become the most common strategy practised, enforced through institutional policies and procedures and reinforced through patient education initiatives and breast cancer support groups. Large cohort studies have found no significant association between blood draws and intravenous infusions in the surgical arm and the development of BCRL. Current literature supports that approximately 21% of patients will develop BCRL, leaving 79% free of the complication. Due to increased survival, breast cancer survivors go on to develop other healthcare issues that may require vascular access. Therefore, long-held beliefs with regards to risk factors and preventative measures need to be challenged. Education of healthcare providers, patients and support groups through the dissemination of evidence-based information on the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of BCRL is necessary to ensure that patients receive the best care possible with the least risk.

AB  - Indonesia has entered an alarming condition related to forest fires. It is becoming a seasonal hazardous phenomenon in tropics. As the largest tropical forest in Indonesia, Borneo is the most susceptible area to fire especially in dry condition. Forest fires are threatened by climate, human activities, and ecosystem processes, but only climate variable can be quantified well in Borneo. This research aims to evaluate random forest model in predicting forest fires based on the climate variables and satellite data of burned area. Prediction of forest fires is expected to reduce the impact of forest fires in the future. Based on analysis of spatial and annual variability, the random forest model with all selected climate variables can represent the forest fires event over Borneo.

AB  - Monitoring of agricultural regions is an important task. Recent trends to solve it are based on applying multi-temporal remote sensing in order to obtain reliable crop classification maps. If a radar remote sensing is used, speckle presence in the original data reduces a classification accuracy. A negative impact of speckle can be reduced by image pre-filtering procedure. Recent studies carried out for Sentinel-1 imagery have shown that more efficient pre-filtering usually results in better classification. Thus, here we propose a modification of block matching three-dimensional (BM3D) filter adapted to the properties of Sentinel-1 radar data. We demonstrate that its use leads to improved classification of crops in agricultural region of Ukraine compared to earlier methods which are based on other filters. Additionally, a convolutional neural network approach for crop mapping is investigated in this paper for decreasing noise impact and is compared with a traditional pixel-based multi-layer perceptron.

TI  - Concurrent Field Experiments and Satellite Surveys for Assessing Environmental Risk in the Coastal Zone of Southeast Baltic
T2  - Ecologica Montenegrina
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of field experiments concurrent to satellite surveys conducted in the summer periods of 2014-2019 in the southeastern part of the Baltic Sea off Sambian Peninsula are presented. The main goal was to study coastal currents in a highly variable wind field and its impact on the transport of potential marine pollution. Southeast Baltic is, on the one hand, an area of active navigation, fishing, off-shore oil production, and, on the other hand, a rapidly developing recreation area. It is also an area of frequent massive blooming of harmful algae. Considering these facts, studying coastal currents and their impact on antropogenic and biogenic pollution propagation in the area is highly important. Our main research instrument was drifting Lagrangian buoys (mini-drifters) that are quite often used in oceanography today, Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and CTD probe measuring temperature, conductivity (salinity) and pressure (depth) and in-situ turbidity and CHL-a In addition, we used satellite remote sensing data publicly available from European and American databases. Mainly, these were data obtained from Sentinel-2 (MSI), Landsat-8 (OLI/TIRS), Sentinel-3 (OLCI) and MODIS (Aqua/Terra) satellites. The experimental data allowed us to describe in detail the alongshore current structure and identify the areas most affected by marine pollution, among which are the most popular places of the region: the beaches of the Yantarniy settlement and Curonian Spit, a national nature reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

M3  - Article
AB  - For many years, the primary environmental problem of the Caspian Sea has been oil pollution, which is associated both with oil production and transportation, as well as changes in sea level, leading to secondary pollution, river runoff and even seismic activity, which provokes natural oil spills from the bottom of the sea. Abnormal bloom of waters every year becomes more and more long and covers more and more areas, and also occurs in areas where it was not previously observed. However, the current state of the sea, and the trends of its evolution has not been studied enough, which determines the relevance of the solution of the main task of the ongoing Russian Science Foundation Project "Assessing ecological variability of the Caspian Sea in the current century using satellite remote sensing data". Implementation of the proposed project will assess the relative contribution of each of the sources of pollution of the Caspian Sea, which varies in different periods depending on climatic factors, on the intensity of various hydrodynamic and hydrometeorological processes, on seismic activity and human economic activity. The goal of the project is to assess the changes in the ecological state of the Caspian Sea since the beginning of the current century under the impact of natural and anthropogenic factors. This calls for a detailed analysis of large banks of satellite data acquired over the Caspian Sea from 1999 to 2022 jointly with multi-year hydrometeorological and in situ data. The goal is achievable due to powerful capabilities of the "See the Sea" (STS) information portal developed by the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI RAS) as part of IKI - Monitoring Center for Collective Use. STS offers oceanographers new and unique tools to work with remote sensing data, enabling comprehensive analysis of data different in physical nature, spatial resolution and time of acquisition.

AB  - The results of multi-year satellite monitoring of ice cover in the Caspian Sea are presented. The basis of the study was remote sensing data in the optical range, such as Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, Landsat-7 ETM+, Terra/Aqua MODIS, as well as archival Landsat-5 TM data. Also, Sentinel-1 SAR-C and archival ERS-1/2 SAR and Envisat ASAR radar data were used. The main objectives of the study were: determination of areas occupied by ice, identification of trends in ice formation and clearing periods, their interannual variability. To solve the problem of determining the parameters of ice cover, we used the multisensory approach whenever possible, i.e. comprehensive integrated analysis of heterogeneous data. The analysis of a vast array of satellite data, differing in nature and spatial resolution, and ice mapping was carried out using the toolkit of the See the Sea (STS) information system developed at the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IKI RAS). STS enables working with multi-year archival data, conduct joint analysis of different satellite data together with hydrometeorological information. It was found that during the study period, from the 1998-1999 winter to the present time, the largest area of ice cover of over 90,000 sq. km was observed in the 2011/2012 winter period. Ice was observed even in the bays of the Southern Caspian. Another direction of research, the results of which are presented, is the identification of capabilities and limitations in the use of satellite data obtained in different ranges (radar and optical) and at different polarizations.

TI  - Establishing Optimal Match-up Protocols between Ocean Color Satellites and Ground Truth AeroNET-OC Radiance
T2  - OCEAN SENSING AND MONITORING XI
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Ocean Sensing and Monitoring XI
CL  - Baltimore, MD
AB  - The SAtellite VAlidation Navy Tool (SAVANT) was developed by the Navy to help facilitate the assessment of the stability and accuracy of ocean color satellites using ground truth (insitu) platform and buoy stations positioned around the globe and support methods for match-up protocols. This automated, continuous monitoring system for satellite ocean color sensors employs a website interface to extract and graph coincident satellite and insitu data in near-real-time. Available satellite sensors include MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) onboard the Aqua satellite, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard Suomi National Polar-orbitting Partnership (SNPP) & Joint Polar Satellite Sensor (JPSS), Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3A and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) onboard the Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS). SAVANT houses an extensive match-up data set covering nineteen plus years (2000-2019) of coincident global satellite and ground truth spectral Normalized Water Leaving Radiance (nLw) data allowing users to evaluate the accuracy of ocean color sensors spectral water leaving radiance at specific ground truth sites that provide continuous data. The tool permits changing different match-up constraints and evaluating the effects on the match-up uncertainty. Results include: a) the effects of spatial selection (using single satellite pixel versus 3x3 and 5x5 boxes, all centered around the insitu location), b) time difference between satellite overpass and ground truth observations, c) and satellite and solar zenith angles. Match-up uncertainty analyses was performed on VIIRS SNPP at the AErosol RObotic NETwork Ocean Color (AeroNET-OC) Wave Current surge Information System (WavCIS) site, maintained by NRL and the Louisiana State University (LSU) in the North Central Gulf of Mexico onboard the Chevron platform CSI-06. The VIIRS SNPP and AeroNET-OC assessment determined optimal satellite ocean color cal/val match-up protocols that reduced uncertainty in the derived satellite products.For this dataset, the protocols for an optimal match-up included 1) a box size of 5x5, 2) a satellite time of +/- three hours, 3) solar zenith angles of less than 75 and sensor zenith angles of less than 60, and 4) utilizing the quality flags to remove high glint, stray light, navigation failure, and low water-leaving radiance.

T2  - European Journal of Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes in forest cover can determine the survival of terrestrial endangered mammal species in the wild. This study assessed the impacts of forest cover changes on endangered mammal species distribution at global scale aiming to understand how the changes in forest cover may have impacted the distributions of 35 endangered small and large-body terrestrial mammals. There were used forest data obtained from time-series analyses of Landsat images between 2000 and 2014, species occurrence records collected by observations between 2000 and 2015 of Global Biodiversity Information Facility and species range data of International Union for Nature Conservation (IUCN) of the year 2015, to test the 'natural and resource conditions' hypothesis. Hypothesis on 'natural and resource conditions' produced models with high prediction accuracy of above 70 percent for 88 percent of 35 species models. The changes in forest cover explained species occurrences in 10 percent of all species models. In average, 59 percent of species occurrence records overlapped with species range data. The 51 percent of all species had no occurrence records between 2000 and 2015. Species and forest data collection as well as transnational cooperation for conservation of species roaming in the wild in upland forested areas and in cross-border areas may be critical for endangered mammal species conservation.

TI  - THE ANCIENT POLAND STATE SYSTEM IN SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE XXth CENTURY
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the research - is to demonstrate the heated discussion in the Polish historiography concerning the ancient Poland state system issues in the context of the modern typology of the scientific conflicts. The methodology of the research is based on the general scientific and special historical methods application. The principles of historicism, the objectivity and the value approach concerning the studied phenomena have been observed. The study source base has been covered and ensured by the heuristic method application. The use of the historical-genetic, historical-typological and historical-systemic methods has made it possible to reproduce and follow precisely the scientific discussions unfolding and to obtain the correct conclusions. The scientific novelty is that for the first time in historiography, the scientific controversy in the beginning of the XXth century concerning the state system of the ancient Polish state, which was developed between the scientists O. Balcer and S. Kutrzeba and was supported by other researchers, is regarded as a worldview controversy of the numerous historiographic centers and generations representatives. Conclusions. The essence of the scientific conflict between the researchers O. Balcer and S. Kutrzeba consisted in the theoretical and methodological aspects, as it arose because of the conceptual differences within the classical positivist model of historiography that at the beginning of the XXth century stepped into the phase of the modernist transformations. As far as we are concerned, such conflicts have rarely a destructive nature, but rather contribute to the fruitful competition of ideas, since othe minimum level presence competition creates the conditions for the new ideas birth), (Collins, 2002). Therefore, it is undisputed that the above-mentioned controversy contributed to the farther scientific progress significantly, as it inspired scientists to study the ancient Polish state nature more thoroughly, as well as raised the new issues, revised many fundamental problems, and even led to the introduction of new numerous views into the historical science in the participants' publications.

Images corresponding to such sensors were simulated out of an airborne hyperspectral acquisition. At the end, the relevance of an enhanced spectral configuration and especially providing bands from the SWIR domain was proven, as well as the need for a fine spatial resolution to retrieve urban objects. However, the (late) fusion of multispectral imagery at 2 m resolution with hyperspectral data at 8 m resolution was also proven to lead to good results.

AB  - This paper aims at detecting several urban morpho-type classes out of complementary SPOT-6/7 imagery and Sentinel-2 time series and using existing Urban Atlas database. A bottom-up strategy is proposed. It first detects basic urban objects (buildings, roads, vegetation), that are used to calculate multi-scale morphological features. These features are then fed to a Random Forest classifier trained from samples out of Urban Atlas urban classes. Obtained results are optionally merged with a Random Forest classification based on Sentinel-2 time series. Obtained results are promising.

AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence time series provides potential information used for temporal change monitoring of regions of interest on the Earth surface. This paper addresses the change analysis of multitemporal InSAR coherence images for volcanic eruption monitoring using Change Detection Matrix (CDM) approach. The Piton de la Fournaise volcano (French island La Reunion) with four eruptions in 2018 was selected as a case study. From InSAR image time series (ITS) included 28 Sentinel-1 images acquired during 2018 over the study area, sorted by acquisition date, 27 coherence images were computed between each two adjacent dates. Changes on the ground related to volcanic eruptions were analyzed through the obtained coherence ITS using CDM framework. The preliminary results on lava extent mapping have demonstrated the relevancy of this study.

T2  - Ecologica Montenegrina
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry data are used for investigation of the sea level variability and sea ice cover retreat in the Barents Sea in 1992-2018. The data from ERS - 1/2, ENVISAT, SARAL/AltiKa, and Sentinel-3A/3B satellites were used in this study. An increasing trend of the sea level of about 2.31 mm/yr was observed in this time period, which caused a total increase in the Barents Sea level by about 6 cm. Linear trends of the sea level change varied from 1.84 mm/yr in July to 4.29 mm/yr in September. The average velocity of the ice edge retreat along the tracks in the northeastern direction is of 10.9 km/yr for the same period. It was found that the ice edge displacement rate tends to increase by 0.30 km/yr per a degree in longitude in the eastward direction. Thus, the ice edge retreat along the "eastern" tracks goes faster than along the "western" ones, which is likely explained by a change in the water dynamics in the Barents Sea.

CL  - Quebec, CANADA
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is commonly used to assess thaw subsidence in permafrost regions. However, the method is vulnerable to noise, processing strategy, and other environmental processes. In this study, we present a post-processing correction method applied to DInSAR displacement maps over a study area near Rankin Inlet, Nunavut. The correction removes residual noise, and permits quantitative comparison between different DInSAR maps and other data. Our correction method does not require advanced InSAR processing, but requires the presence of stable bedrock outcrops uniformly distributed over the DInSAR scenes. Results show that the method successfully corrects for local errors without drastic deviation from uncorrected maps. By using corrected displacement maps from C-band (RADARSAT-2) and L-band (ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) satellites, we combine seasonal and inter-annual displacements to create a permafrost terrain map that describes current and short-term permafrost conditions. The permafrost terrain map also highlights areas where DInSAR results could preferentially be affected by soil moisture or flooded vegetation. For the Rankin Inlet area, the permafrost terrain map shows that permafrost is relatively stable, with localized high subsidence related to the melting of frost blisters and, to a lesser extent, the melting of segregated ground ice near top of permafrost.

TI  - Farming systems monitoring using machine learning and trend analysis methods based on fitted NDVI time series data in a semi-arid region of Morocco

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXI held at SPIE Remote Sensing
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Managers and policy makers demand information on agriculture dynamics and distribution for the establishment of plans and strategies. For this purpose, the use of remote sensing data constitute an essential key to follow-up the agricultural systems dynamics. The aim of this study is to define a method based on fitted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series extracted from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), trend analysis tests and machine learning approaches for assessing and monitoring farming systems in a semi-arid region of Morocco. NDVI time series were smoothed using TIMESAT software for the period between 2000 and 2018. Then, three trend analysis tests were conducted which are: monotonic trend (Mann-Kendall), Man-Kendall significance and median trend (Theil-Sen). In addition, Random Forest (RF) classification methods were performed to classify the main agricultural cover type over the study area for the 2017/2018 cropping season. The results demonstrated the ability of fitted NDVI data and RF classification to identify the main agricultural systems, which are: 1) irrigated annual crop, 2) irrigated perennial crop, 3) rainfed areas and 4) fallow. Analysis of trend patterns based on fitted NDVI values shows high variability over the farming systems. Irrigated annual and perennial crops present high improvement of biomass activity with a small inter-variability with significant trend. For the Rainfed area and fallow, these classes show a non-significant trend with low degradation of productivity. In addition, these results can constitute a relevant means of control and spatio-temporal monitoring of farming systems. Overall, the results are relevant for managers and policy makers to develop procedures and actions in order to prevent environmental and agricultural events resulted from the spatio-temporal changes in farming systems.

TI  - A comparison of algorithms for coastline mapping using satellite methods
T2  - HRVATSKE VODE
M3  - Review
AB  - The paper presents the methods of coastline determination and describes the method using remote sensing algorithms in more detail. It further analyses the results of the most widely used algorithms of the water indices NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI_nsh, AWEI_sh and WRI, which are used for determining coastlines and water surfaces in general. The algorithms were applied to the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 satellite imagery, with central Dalmatia selected as the test area. After the calculation of water indices, unsupervised classification and reclassification were conducted in these areas and, finally, the evaluation of the classification accuracy for each individual index was presented. The results were shown at larger scale for two areas - the Jadro river mouth in Solin and the Cetina river mouth in Omis. The result analysis revealed that the best results were obtained using the NDWI water index and the poorest results using the AWEI_nsh water index.

AB  - Terrestrial Gross Primary Production (GPP) is the largest global carbon flux, and forest ecosystems are important because of the ability to store much more significant amounts of carbon than other terrestrial ecosystems. There have been several attempts to estimate GPP using mechanism-based models. However, mechanism-based models including biological, chemical, and physical processes are limited due to a lack of flexibility in predicting non-stationary ecological processes, which are caused by a local and global change. Instead mechanism-free methods are strongly recommended to estimate nonlinear dynamics that occur in nature like GPP. Therefore, we used the mechanism-free machine learning techniques to estimate the daily GPP. In this study, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used and compared with the traditional multiple linear regression model (LM). MODIS products and meteorological parameters from eddy covariance data were employed to train the machine learning and LM models from 2006 to 2013. GPP prediction models were compared with daily GPP from eddy covariance measurement in a deciduous forest in South Korea in 2014 and 2015. Statistical analysis including correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean squared error (MSE) were used to evaluate the performance of models. In general, the models from machine-learning algorithms (R = 0.85 – 0.93, MSE = 1.00 – 2.05, p < 0.001) showed better performance than linear regression model (R = 0.82 – 0.92, MSE = 1.24 – 2.45, p < 0.001). These results provide insight into high predictability and the possibility of expansion through the use of the mechanism-free machine-learning models and remote sensing for predicting non-stationary ecological processes such as seasonal GPP.

T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korea Meteorological Administration uses soil moisture (SM) observed by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2) to monitor drought. However, it may not be appropriate for monitoring drought in South Korea due to significant underestimation of SM. In this study, we used a deep learning method that performs better than traditional statistical and physical models for reliable estimation of SM based on remotely sensed satellite data. For estimating SM, we carefully selected input variables that exhibit a feedback loop with SM. To build an effective deep learning model, we examined the influences of sampling criteria and input parameters as well as the accuracy of several deep neural networks. The selected model was cross-validated to determine its stability. The estimated SM using deep learning had a high correlation coefficient (R) of 0.89 and a low root mean square error (RMSE; 3.825%) and bias (-0.039%) compared to in-situ measurements. A time series analysis using dynamic time warping was conducted which showed that the estimated SM was almost similar to the in-situ SM. In order to investigate the improvement in SM estimation using our method, it was compared with the Global Land Data Assimilation System and AMSR2. Significant improvements in R and a reduction in error values by more than half were achieved using our method. The estimated SM has finer spatial resolution at 4km, and it can be rapidly produced, which will be useful for drought monitoring over the Korean Peninsula in near-real-time.

M3  - Data study
AB  - In cancer patients, metastasis of tumors to sentinel lymph nodes (LN) predicts disease progression and often guides treatment decisions. The mechanisms underlying  tumor LN metastasis are poorly understood. Using comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics analyses of primary and LN metastatic tumors in mice, we found that LN metastasis requires that tumor cells undergo a metabolic shift toward fatty acid oxidation (FAO). Transcriptional co-activator yes-associated protein (YAP) is selectively activated in LN metastatic tumors, leading to upregulation of genes in the FAO signaling pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of FAO or genetic ablation of YAP suppressed LN metastasis in mice. Several bioactive bile acids were highly accumulated in the LN metastatic tumor. Inhibition of FAO or YAP may merit exploration as therapeutic strategies for mitigating tumor LN metastasis.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The artistic trend of the 1960s, defined as the “era of freedom and experimentation”, in the era of Thaw, two Russian directors, Sergei Paradzanov and Andrei Tarkovsky representing externally the so-called “Soviet Nouvelle Vague generation”. Both of them maintained a special rapport while continuing their cinematic aesthetics full of poetic parables and metaphors, and were accompanied by a series of aesthetic dialogue through various motifs in each other’s films. The friendship and emotional exchange that the two directors maintained throughout their film career not only enriched the two directors’ film world but also became an important driver for expanding the foreign presence of Russian films.In this paper, we considered how the two directors’ deep bond and cinematic communion influenced each other’s cinematic aesthetics, and how they were mutually reflected through aesthetic images and objects. Consistent images of “Imaginary material world” in Paradzanov’s films are also key elements that penetrate Paradzanov’s aesthetics, just as various symbols – images that are not directly related to film plots but constantly protruding – reflect the director’s own psyche and worldview, while at the same time creating semantic unity that runs through the entire Tarkovsky’s film. The constant repetition of aesthetic images and objects in the two master's films has also been an important device for creating an internal dialogue as well as an homage to each other.

AB  - This study applied SGM (Semi Global Matching) to generate DSM (Digital Surface Model) using WorldView-1 high-resolution satellite stereo pair in Terrassa, Spain provided by ISPRS (International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing). The SGM is an image matching algorithm that performs the computation of the matching cost for the stereo pair in multi-paths and aggregates the computed costs sequentially. This method finally calculates the disparity corresponding to the minimum (or maximum) value of the aggregation cost. The cost was applied to MI (Mutual Information), NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation), and CT (Census Transform) in order to the SGM. The accuracy and performance of the outline representation result in DSM by each cost are presented. Based on the images used and the subject area, the accuracy of the CT cost results was the highest, and the outline representation was also most clearly depicted. In addition, while the SGM method represented more detailed outlines than the existing software, many errors occurred in the water area.

AB  - The decentralization of decision making is more prominent in modern economy with market economy being more complex. However, the major researches from recently developed behavioral economics have shown that there may happen diverse biases in decision making process of individual economic agents due to bounded rationality.This study reviews the main contents of the prospect theory, the one of main theories of behavioral economics with focus on the characteristics of human decision- making process and its policy implications that we can examine it from the perspective of Biblical worldview and derive the possible role of Christian professionals regarding the issues arising from the biases in decision making processes.The parable of the Talent in Matthew 25 shows that “endowment effect” and its related “loss aversion” may give rise to negative results in the biblical example, too, which can be relieved by “broad framing”. We propose the role of Christian professionals for the possible solution for the negative outcomes caused by “certainty effect” and “possibility effect”. We also propose establishment of ethical codes for the Christian organizations, which can be effective when the ethical codes is incorporated in the way that the loss aversion can effectively work in its implementation.We hope that the active role of Christian professionals in helping people suffering the problems caused by divers biases manifested by prospect theory may renew the role of Churches in modern world.

AB  - Recently, interest in urban temperature change and ground surface temperature change has been increasing due to weather phenomenon due to global warming, heat island phenomenon caused by urbanization in urban areas. In Korea, weather data such as temperature and precipitation have been collected since 1904. In recent years, there are 96 ASOS stations and 494 AWS weather observation stations. However, in the case of terrestrial networks, terrestrial meteorological data except measurement points are predicted through interpolation because they provide point data for each installation point. In this study, to improve the resolution of ground surface temperature measurement, the surface temperature using satellite image was calculated and its applicability was analyzed. For this purpose, the satellite images of Landsat 8 OLI TIRS were obtained for Seoul Metropolitan City by seasons and transformed to surface temperature by applying NASA equation to the thermal bands. The ground measurement data was based on the temperature data measured by AWS. Since the AWS temperature data is station based point data, interpolation is performed by Kriging interpolation method for comparison with Landsat image. As a result of comparing the satellite image base surface temperature with the AWS temperature data, the temperature difference according to the season was calculated as fall, winter, summer, based on the RMSE value, Spring, in order of applicability of Landsat satellite image. The use of that attribute and AWS support starts at 2.11 and RMSE 3.84, which reflects information from the extended NASA.

AB  - A leader’s worldview, personality, and life affect his or her surrounding people. Nowadays the missionary leadership of the Korean church is in crisis with various aspects in her pastoral field and mission field beyond its heyday. It is said that the crisis of the Western church in the beginning of the 20th century, which had caused the phenomenon of moratorium of mission, was succeeded by the Korean church today. It is essential and necessary to reexamine and rearm the missionary leadership of our Lord Jesus Christ at this time. In this respect, it is meaningful to meditate on the ‘song of the servant’ that portrays in the latter half of Isaiah.The ‘servant of Jehovah’ revealed within the song of the servant has various interpretations, but this is eventually compressed into the Messiah and Israelite community. If we regard it as a New Testament achievement, Jehovah’s servant can be interpreted as Jesus Christ, the Church, or Christians. The missionary leadership of Jehovah’s servant is manifested by a firm calling, care for the marginalized, compassion for the weak, the patient, and the persecuted. Therefore this article examines the definition of missionary leadership and the Jehovah’s servant throughout the four ‘Song of the Servants’ texts of Isaiah, the Old Testament commentary and mission theological literature, reinterprets it in terms of missionary leadership. Furthermore these presented applications suggest in relation to their situational issues.

In this regard, out of the sample points of the 1st Forest Health Management survey in Gyeongbuk area, 78 spots were selected. For these spots, the species diversity index was selected from the survey sections, and the spatial interpolation method was applied. Inverse distance weighted (IDW), Ordinary Kriging and Ordinary Cokriging were applied as spatial interpolation methods. Ordinary Cokriging was performed by selecting vegetation indices which are highly correlated with species diversity index as a secondary variable. The vegetation indices – Normalized Differential Vegetation Index(NDVI), Leaf Area Index(LAI), Sample Ratio(SR) and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index(SAVI) - were extracted from Landsat 8 OLI. Verification was performed by the spatial interpolation method with Mean Error(ME) and Root Mean Square Error(RMSE). As a result, Ordinary Cokriging using SR showed the most accurate result with ME value of 0.0000218 and RMSE value of 0.63983. Ordinary Cokriging using SR was proven to be more accurate than Ordinary Kriging, IDW, using one variable. This indicates that the spatial interpolation method using the vegetation indices is more suitable for spatialization of the biodiversity index sample points of 1st Forest Health Management survey.

AB  - This study is a follow-up study to “A study of the pattern stamped on the Cotton Armor and Helmet of the late Joseon period: Analysis and restoration of the stamp patterns” (Lee, Park, & An, 2019). It examines the origin and the meaning of the stamp patterns on the Cotton Armor and Helmet of the late Joseon period. The body armor which is the only remaining part of the Cotton Armor of the late Joseon period (Registered Cultural Property No. 459) in Korea has been considered as “the world’s first scientific bulletproof armor” or an “uncivilized heavy armor” reflecting either emphasizing superlative achievement or a defeatist attitude by scholars or the press. However, by focusing on the historical and symbolic value of the stamp patterns, different aspects of the armor and helmet are revealed. As a result, the patterns are classified into three categories: the Om Mani Padme Hum, the icons of the Five Great Mountains, and the Nine Stars and Eight Doors talisman. These magical and superstitious patterns reveal to be the national, military, and cosmic patterns reflecting the Neo-Confucian worldview of the Joseon Dynasty. These symbols provide a hint to assume that the Cotton Armors and Helmets were originated in the 18th century as an armor for the artillery before they appeared in the wars such as French campaign against Korea in 1866 and American expedition in 1871.

AB  - In South Korea, Particulate matter (PM) has become one of the major threats to public health and safety across the country. Urban forests have been considered as a possible contributor to mitigate the air pollutants in urban areas. However, there is lack of research on investigating the role of urban forests on mitigating PM. This study investigated on the relationship between urban forests and PM concentrations in Seoul, South Korea, by using urban forest data, PM measurements, satellite imagery, and meteorological data. The correlation between the size of urban forests and PM measurements within three concentric buffers of 1 km, 500 m, and 300 m in radius were analyzed. Overall PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly with different seasons during the 2-year study period. Overall PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations tended to be reduced as the urban forest size increased. This tendency became less noticeable as smaller urban forest patches were predominant over larger patches in the buffers. Season-specific models were developed by using 30m-resolution satellite imageries of Landsat 8 and meteorological parameters for estimating PM concentrations. No noticeable correlations were found between the modeled PM concentrations and the Urban forest size showing the ualves of Pearson’s coefficient r of 0.08 to 0.23 for PM10 and -0.16 to 0.04 for PM2.5. In this study, the variations in PM measurements with the presence of high urban forests within buffers were investigated. Overall PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were lower along the domains encompassing higher urban forests in elevation.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with axillary node metastasis: A survey of clinical practice
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A survey of breast surgeons was conducted to evaluate changes in clinical practice regarding sentinel node biopsy (SNB) among clinically node-negative patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with axillary node metastasis.Methods: We conducted two surveys among 252 members of the Korean Breast Cancer Society. The questionnaire comprised a case presentation and two associated questions. The case outlined a woman diagnosed with right breast cancer; core needle biopsy had confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma and tumor size was 4 cm on imaging examination. Fine needle aspiration examination for axillary lymph node enlargement showed metastatic carcinoma. The patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and tumor size was decreased by 2 cm; axillary lymph node enlargement was not observed on palpitation or imaging examination. Finally, the patient underwent breast conserving surgery. Survey recipients were asked: 1. Would you perform SNB in this patient? 2. If you perform SNB and no axillary node metastasis is seen, would you perform additional axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)?Results: The response rate was 28.2% (71/252) and 15.1% (38/252) in 2013 and 2017, respectively. For the first question, the SNB to ALND ratio increased significantly from 54% versus 46% in 2013 to 92% versus 8% in 2017 (p < 0.001). The proportion of surgeons performing no additional ALND versus additional ALND increased from 38% versus 54% in 2013 to 53% versus 37% in 2017, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.1).Conclusions: These data show that application of SNB among clinically node-negative patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer with node metastasis has increased among surgeons in Korea.

AB  - Today’s AI technology goes beyond simple automation technology to intervene in human judgment and decision making, showing considerable autonomy and similarity to humans in a certain range. This situation, coupled with the romantic worldview going back to the Greek Automata and the Jewish Golem, led to a discourse on whether AI could be recognized as a kind of subjectivity. From the viewpoint of law, this discussion is a matter of whether to give legal personhood to AI.This problem can be approached in two ways: the property-based approach and the relationship-based approach. First, the property-based approach focuses on whether AI also has the property on the basis of which human beings are recognized as legal person. Since Immanuel Kant, modern law has considered rational reason and free will as the cornerstone of personhood. This foundation is still valid, despite advances in learnings that have shown that human reason is limited and that human free will does not transcend causality. The present AI is rational in the sense that it effectively performs a given task and autonomy in the sense that human intervention is minimized. However, this instrumental rationality and autonomy cannot be discussed in line with human reason and free will, which are the basis of legal personhood. Some views focus on attributes such as soul, mind, consciousness, or emotion. But the present AI does not have this property. However, if the development of technology leads to the emergence of so-called stong AI that is indistinguishable from humans in the future, the attribute-based approach may require the recognition of AI as legal person unless it does not take specism.A relationship-based approach attempts to judge whether something is recognized as a legal person by its relationship with other subjects rather than by its attributes. Looking back on history, some humans were not recognized as legal person. On the contrary, some non-humans were recognized as legal person. Juristic person such as corporation that plays a pivotal role in today’s legal system is one of those examples. In order to give legal personhood to non-human beings, social reality and legal convenience must be recognized. First of all, from the aspect of social reality, it is difficult to say that present AI is being accepted as a legal entity by existing legal entities. As long as social reality is not established, it’s impossible to grant legality regardless of legal convenience. In addition, legal recognition of AI is not legally convenient because it incurs risks and costs that outweigh some benefits, such as making it easy to establish liability. While proper attribution of liability is possible by other laws, there is a significant cost to make institutional foundation, the risk of shrinking innovation, and, above all, the profound impact on existing legal system.Therefore, the recognition of AI as legal person is premature at this point. Even though it’s hard to predict whether strong AI will be realized in the future, if such a day comes, it is necessary to be extremely cautious in assigning legal personhood to AI.

TI  - Study on Narrative Structural Original Form of the Hungarian Folktales

M3  - research-article
AB  - t was in advanced Western European countries that research and study on the oral literature was first. Because of the Romantic Movement in the late 18th century and the interest of folktales, a collection of folktales by Grimm brothers was created. Since the publication of this collection of folktales, collecting activities have continued in numerous European countries, and international folktales have been unearthed. In Hungary, with the influence of the Grimm Brothers, the collection of Hungarian folktales began in 1782. In 1822, it was published in German by Gaal Gyorgy, the first collection of hungarian folktales. Since the 1850s, full-scale movements in Hungarian folktales have continued. The first collection of folktales in Hungarian is “Nepdalok es mondak” by Erdelyi Janos, which consists of three volumes in total.Compared to myths and legends, folktales were less historical and local, and were more easily passed on and disseminated because of their strong entertainment. There are many stories of common sense and public disclosure that share common motifs and illustrations, as well as similar plots in different countries and peoples. That is why there are so many folktales in the world that are universal, while reflecting strong locality and ethnicity. Hungarian folktales have been reorganized by dissolving Hungarian ideas and sentiments in a world-class oral literature. In this regard, I think Hungarian folktales have a better sense of value and worldview than historical events recorded by certain people.As a language structure that has been handed down by countless Hungarians for a long time, Hungarian folktales also describe the lives of the Hungarian people in three dimensions. Hungarian folktales contain a perfect human life and philosophy and are giving the Hungarians a genuine touch and lesson. From an epic perspective, the main paper tries to analyze the narrative structure of the story surrounding the representative type of Hungarian folktales, and analyze the meaning contained in the story to extract the cultural and instructive meaning. An epic is a sub-unit that classifies a stated language based on a spoken form as a term of rhetoric, with dynamic subject of statement and a mixture of expression and explanation. The tale, epic, and novel belong to these forms and are all linguistic structures that embody meaning through the movement of the subject. The most basic form of these epics is folktales. The purpose of this study is to explore the meanings of archetypes found in the Hungarian folktales, focusing on narrative structural original form. The archetype characteristic of the narrative structure. I hope that the meaning of the structural prototype of the Hungarian folktales analyzed through this article will serve as the basis for opening new horizons.

AB  - Can accounting manipulation and fraud through improper accounting be improved? Since the 1997 IMF financial crisis, fraudulent accounting that distorts financial statements has not stopped. As a result, the country`s accounting transparency index is at the lowest level in the world, and Korea discount which pays high financial costs to finance overseas markets, is not improving. This study examines the ethical approach to the improvement of misappropriated accounting especially accounting ethics from the biblical point of view. A comprehensive survey of the body of the new system related to accounting ethics was conducted to establish the rules to be followed by Christian executives. The results are as follows.(1) Recognize that the ownership of a company is in God's hands, as shown in Gen 1:1, and prepare the financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards in the proper faith.(2) Do not take any unfair advantage and try to be as rich as Noah, Abraham, and Job.(3) Make efforts to save the poor and in the course of the annual report do not be stingy with gratitude, but volunteer to overflow.(4) Be honest, do not cheat on the scales, avoid bribery, and do not despise your neighbor, as Solomon says.(5) Do make a profit by hard work as Matthew's gift metaphor ; do not make a place for robbery ; like Judah, do not betray anyone who sells their teachers at 30.(6) Apply the community of faith that has been achieved in the early church to the enterprise and do everything to the Lord to seek the glory of God.Finally, when all of these accounting ethics are applied, the accounting fraud will automatically dissipate and improve.

AB  - The forest structure parameters are important parameters for understanding of the global forest carbon storage and cycle, forest richness/biodiversity, as well as climate changes. Lidar waveform and (polarimetric) SAR interferometry have been widely and successfully used for extracting 3D forest structure profiles by means of both SAR and lidar airborne systems, but individually and on a local scale. To generate global-scale 3D forest structure information and to understand terrestrial carbon dynamics, fusing both spaceborne SAR and lidar data sets and developing new merging algorithms become critical. We have used (simulated) GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigator) data and interferometric SAR (InSAR) satellite data from DLR's TanDEM-X at HH polarization over NASA AfriSAR campaign test sites, Gabon.

AB  - Raising a Christian leader-coach as an ultimate goal, this study is the first stage of research to develop an integrated Bible-based leadership-coaching model. Raising a Christian leader-coach as an ultimate goal, this study is the first stage of a three-part study to develop an integrated Bible-based leadership-coaching model. Along with the literature review, we first conducted three different group education sessions and focus group interviews with experts and then we carried out the expert content validity of the model. That is, we computed the average score using a 4-point Likert-type scale and content feedback. The experts participating in the expert review are university professors currently writing a PhD thesis on the subject of leadership and coaching, and they are professional coaches who are holding the KAC, KPC, KSC and MCC certificate.After the validity of the model was thoroughly reviewed and approved by the participating experts, the developed model has been named the “GOD 4N Leadership-Coaching Model” where “GOD” stands for God. “Holiness” (Leviticus 11:45) is the core value that this model is pursuing.The GOD 4N leadership-coaching program has two models, conceptual model and practical model.GOD, the conceptual model, is composed of three sub-models, each of which takes the initial letter of “God Father”, “Only Jesus”, “Dream of Holy Spirit”, respectively, and thus G-O-D. Based on the three conceptual models, each model is then further divided into four practical models whose names all start with the letter N, which is G-4N, O-4N, and D-4N.Specifically, G-4N consists of New Life, New Frame, New Practice, and New Attitude, O-4N consists of No Bible, No Bread, No Bed, No Breath, and finally D-4N is composed of Never-ending Coach-Leader, Never-ending Cheerer, Never-ending Comforter, and Never-ending Counselor.The way to become holy is to live a new life everyday based on the Bible and the GOD 4N leadership-coaching model as a guideline.The second stage of this study will be to develop a program that utilizes the GOD 4N leadership-coaching model and to analyze its effect. The names of the programs that will be developed based on this model will be <Fisher on Men>, <Carol Leader>, and <Fruits of Vineyard>, and all will be approached with ‘The Word Coaching’ methods.

AB  - Optimizing the utilization of huge data sets is a challenging problem for weather prediction. To a significant degree, prediction accuracy is determined by the data used in model initialization, assimilated from a variety of observational platforms. At present, the volume of weather data collected in a given day greatly exceeds the ability of assimilation systems to make use of it. Typically, data is ingested uniformly at the highest fixed resolution that enables the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model to deliver its prediction in a timely fashion. In order to make more efficient use of newly available high-resolution data sources, we seek to identify regions of interest (ROI) where increased data quality or volume is likely to significantly enhance weather prediction accuracy. In particular, we wish to improve the utilization of data from the recently launched Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16, which provides orders of magnitude more data than its predecessors. To achieve this, we demonstrate a method for locating tropical cyclones using only observations of precipitable water, which is evaluated using the Global Forecast System (GFS) weather prediction model. Most state of the art hurricane detection techniques rely on multiple feature sets, including wind speed, wind direction, temperature, and IR emissions, potentially from multiple data sources. In contrast, we demonstrate that this model is able to achieve comparable performance on historical tropical cyclone data sets, using only observations of precipitable water.

Through this, we recognize the value of newly created works based on traditional dances and look at the possibility of modern variations and motifs of traditional dances. The purpose of the project is to explore the meaning and value of an independent area different from other genres by expanding the worldview at the same time as further strengthening the realm of Korean creative dance.By analyzing the structure of <Yeom, Dodeuri>, this work was newly interpreted and dismantled using the rhythm, color, motion, and emotional motif of a Buddhist dance to create new value.First, as a motif for creative dance, it confirmed the infinite possibilities of traditional dance.Second, the creation of a new language through the transformation and dissolution of traditional dances.Third, by reinterpreting the characteristics of traditional style into a modern frame, the enhanced order and improvisational sensibility are harmonized.Fourth, having aesthetic symbolism.Based on this value, I hope various Korean creative dances that establish identity will be tried. I also hope that traditional dance will be rediscovered as a more valuable role, adding a future-oriented style as well as an original style as it is.

AB  - Students in the open-distance and electronic learning (ODeL) environment often work in isolation and face challenges in accessing knowledge resources, especially when conducting research. To support these students in succeeding with their studies, the learning management system (LMS) needs to be usable; this implies the attributes of effectiveness, efficiency and user satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to propose usability guidelines specifically focused on the requirements for a learning management system in the context of ODeL honours research projects. The study is novel in exploring the supervisors' view of the usability requirements of the LMS. Based on a pragmatic worldview, this study is guided by the design science research (DSR) methodology. The initial set of usability requirements was abstracted from the literature and used as the basis for the LMS evaluation. Usability testing of the LMS was followed by heuristic evaluation, post-test questionnaire and interviews. All evaluations were done with the supervisors as participants. The contribution of the study is the refined usability guidelines based on the triangulation of the findings from the different usability evaluations conducted on the same ODeL LMS.

AB  - Detection and tracking of oil spills using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have received a considerable attention over the past few years, notably due to the wide area coverage, short revisit frequency and free of charge. Oil spills appear different signatures from the normal seawater depending on the spectral and spatial characteristics of remote sensing image. This paper uses a local difference box-counting (DBC) algorithm to construct the textural fractal map (TFM) from the MODIS imagery. Based on that, the oil spills can be highlighted, thus to be easily extracted. The DBC approach is verified over Mediterranean Sea on MODIS images in sun glint condition. Results show that the sun glint effects on the MODIS imagery have been removed from its fractal textural map. Following that, two oil slicks can be easily extracted from temporal MODIS TFMs for mapping their trajectories.

AB  - As urbanization picks up speed, great changes have taken place in the Urban Landscape Pattern (ULP), which in turn causes variation in urban climate. The Heat Island Effect (HIE), a prominent feature of the changing urban climate, poses a huge threat to our life and health. Starting with HIE and with the aid of geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing (RS), this paper studies the remote sensing images of Beijing from 1995 to 2015, which were captured by Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and infrared technology. Specifically, the author analyzed the evolution laws of the ULP and the HIE in Beijing, discussed the relationship between the two factors, and disclosed the controlling effect of the ULP on the HIE. The results show that: the accelerated urbanization has fragmented the landscapes in Beijing dramatically; the HIE can be alleviated by increasing the greenery coverage, reducing the spacing between green lands, and enhancing their density. Finally, several suggestions were put forward to construct a secure and ecological ULP in Beijing from the angle of adjusting the green land landscape pattern. This research sheds new light on the relationship between the ULP and the HIE and lays a basis for the planning and construction of eco-cities.

AB  - Satellite data 2003-2015 of sea-ice extent, sea surface temperature (SST), and lower tropospheric methane (CH4) concentrations were analyzed for anomalies and trends relative to the Barents Sea. Large positive CH4 anomalies were discovered around Franz Josef Land (FJL). The Southeast Barents Sea, south Kara Sea and coastal areas around FJL exhibited the strongest CH4 growth, dCH(4)/dt. Likely sources are CH4 seepage associated with petroleum reservoirs underlying the central and east Barents Sea and the Kara Sea. The spatial pattern of dCH(4)/dt was poorly related to seabed depth, but could be explained by a process of shoaling of strengthening warm ocean currents that would also advect the CH4 to areas where seasonal deepening of the surface ocean mixed layer depth leads to ventilation of these water masses.

AB  - This paper attempts to exploit how the geometry of the radiative flux, sensor characteristics, atmospheric effects and particularities inherent to water bodies can affect water quality indicators parameters data retrieved from satellite imagery. This was done by comparing data from bio-optical models applied to Sentinel-2 MSI imagery with field samples from 12 campaigns ranging from 2016 to 2019 at the Jupia Reservoir (Brazil), along with analyzing the spectra of different atmospheric correction algorithms, in the search of possible natural effects that hampered the quality of the satellite-derived data. Compared water quality parameters were: Turbidity, chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and Secchi disk depth. Results showed that, the data presented very low, if not inexistent, correlation. However, the error values estimated reflected that the data were not too far apart, despite having no correlation. The effects that may have caused the low correlation and the errors were analyzed through the retrieval of the spectra in the field sampling points. The compared spectra showed that, effects of haze caused by aerosols, bottom reflectance from optical depth and the presence of submerged plants were the most critical reflectance altering phenomena, which reflected in the extracted water quality data. Inelastic scattering, fluorescence and ozone layer influence were undetected, while the adjacency effect and Sun glint presented little to no effect on the data. Further focused analysis of these specific effects is a promising field of study in order to improve atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms.

AB  - Rainfall is not only an essential parameter in hydrology and in the research of water resources, but also an important consideration for the issue of flood control, disaster mitigation, runoff forecast, irrigation, etc. However, the conventional monitoring approaches of rainfall involve many disadvantages, such as limited observing range, high cost and only-one-point rainfall observation. Consequently, how to get the rainfall of any part of the valley attracts more and more attention. In this study, the main meteorological parameters which influencing the rainfall can be extracted from the MODIS satellite cloud imagery, and these meteorological parameters arc combined with the actual observed rainfall data which is obtained from ground-based rainfall site correspondingly. The remote sensing retrieval model is established respectively based on the BP neural network and GA-BP neural network, and a better effect of error precision estimation is obtained. It's also proved that the high resolution of MODIS cloud products can be used to estimate rainfall rate.

TI  - First results of all-weather soil moisture retrieval from an optical/thermal infrared remote-sensing-based operational system in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface soil moisture (SSM) content plays an important role in a number of physical processes involving the energy and mass exchanges between the land and atmosphere interactions. Determination of spatially complete SSM in regional scale has long been one of the most significant tasks in remote-sensing community. Although with limited penetrating ability comparing to microwave missions, optical/thermal infrared sensors can provide surface observations at finer spatial resolution. On the basis of a recently developed approach for deriving all-weather SSM content from satellite images, the present study investigates an optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system for mapping finer spatial resolution all-weather soil moisture content in China from the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological products. A preliminary evaluation of the all-weather SSM retrieval is implemented with field SSM measurements at 461 sites across China. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) varies from 0.053 to 0.070m(3) m(-3) with an average RMSE of 0.063m(3) m(-3) and an average bias of -0.018m(3) m(-3) obtained on the six selected days from April to September. These first results of all-weather SSM retrieval indicate that the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system has a promising perspective for mapping SSM with currently available satellite and meteorological products in regional scale. Finally, two practical recommendations with respective to improve the system inputs for producing more reliable SSM products are summarized for further developments of the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system.

TI  - Discriminating Ship From Radio Frequency Interference Based on Noncircularity and Non-Gaussianity in Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex information in single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is seldom used. This is a common practice based on the conventional resolution theory. However, with the advent of high-resolution SAR sensors, information in the complex data has been found to be of significance for ocean applications. In particular, we note that there is a special type of instrumental artifact in Sentinel-1 images. It is rarely researched and may be attributed to radio frequency interference (RFI). It has similar intensity with ships and can degrade ocean interpretation performance severely. This paper proposes an innovative method to discriminate ships from RFIs based on noncircularity and non-Gaussianity. Among them, noncircularity is calculated based on the measure called normalized noncircularity, and non-Gaussianity is estimated based on the complex generalized Gaussian distribution. The discrimination rationale is analyzed in detail. The experimental procedure is based on Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath products. Only cross-polarization data are tested since RFIs are quite weak in co-polarization data. It is found that noncircularity and non-Gaussianity can characterize and identify the difference between ships and RFIs. Ships present larger noncircularity and sup-Gaussianity while RFIs are found to exhibit quite low noncircularity and mainly show sub-Caussianity. The proposed method achieves quite good performance. These results show that noncircularity and non-Gaussianity are extremely helpful complements for single-channel SAR imagery interpretation.

TI  - CREATING WALLONIA'S NEW VERY HIGH RESOLUTION LAND COVER MAPS: COMBINING GRASS GIS OBIA AND OTB PIXEL-BASED RESULTS

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G)
CL  - Bucharest, ROMANIA
AB  - The Walloon region of Belgium has launched a research project that aims at elaborating a methodology for automated, high-quality land cover mapping, based primarily on its yearly 0.25m orthophoto coverage. Whereas in urban areas an object-based (OBIA) approach has been the privileged path in the last years as it allows taking into account shape information relevant for the characterization of man-made constructions, such an approach has its limits in the rural and more natural areas due to increased difficulties for segmentation and less sharp boundaries, thus calling for a pixel-based approach. The project thus consists in developing a combination of methods, and to integrate their results through an ensemble fusion approach. As many of the more natural land cover classes have temporal profiles which cannot be detected in a one-date orthoimage, Sentinel 1 and 2 data are also included in order to take advantage of their higher spectral and temporal resolution. All methods are trained using existing regional databases. In a second step, we combine the different LC classification results by fusioning them into one high-accuracy (over 90% OA) product, using a series of different approaches ranging from rule-based to machine learning to the Dempster-Shafer method. The entire toolchain is based on free and open source software, mainly GRASS GIS and Orfeo ToolBox. Results indicate the importance of the quality of the individual classifications for the fusion results and justify the choice of combining OBIA and pixelbased approaches in order to avoid the pitfalls of each.

AB  - Today, improving the understanding of disaster risks is an important key point to define emergency preparedness and planning measures. Generally, natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, drought and cyclones cannot be prevented but the number of lives they take and the damage they cause can be greatly reduced thanks to space systems for Earth Observation. Since 2008, COSMO-SkyMed mission is playing a key role in emergency response activities being one of the most exploited SAR mission during disaster events. In this context, the constellation is able to monitor efficiently the different phases of crisis: early warning, recovery operations and post-crisis, representing an efficient approach for managing and limiting the effects of natural and man-made disasters.

T2  - NOVYI FILOLOGICHESKII VESTNIK-NEW PHILOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to revealing the traditions of literary confession in Archimandrite Tikhon's book (Shevkunov) "Unholy Saints and Other Stories". Basing on the achievements of modern science, the author determines the content and artistic features of the confessional genre such as the true disclosure of one's own spiritual world, self-cognition, the desire for dialogue, the rejection of the biographical sequence and the transfer of emphasis in the plane of spiritual and metaphysical search, as well as including prayer, preaching, hagiographic discourse in the text, etc. The main attention is on the structure of the work where there is a transition from linear to nonlinear narrative. Moreover, the confessional principle is most fully manifested through a number of cycles. The cycle of fate is related to the life of the bearers of a unique spiritual and religious experience, amongst whom the inhabitants of the Pskov-Pechersk monastery occupy an important place. The revealing of these characters takes place with the help of hagiographic elements (confession, the motive of "meeting with a miracle"), contrast (when comparing the liturgical, ritual and everyday contexts), the situation of "last meeting". The cycle of events is unveiled with the help of the compositional "case-appeal-conclusion" plot chain aimed at the destruction of stereotypes about the impossibility of overcoming the laws of worldly reality. Taking into account both cycles allows the author to conclude that the narrator's mind forms the idea of a close relationship between the Heaven and the Earth, which is manifested in the daily life of human existence. Such transformation of the narrator's worldview requires a dialogue and a focus on the addressee, which makes it possible to observe the presence of the traditions of literary confession genre of in the book "Unholy Saints".

T2  - JEWISH STUDIES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is on the collective self-delusion constructed by the Jews in regard to their fate under the Nazi regime and in regard to the Zionist mission, as it emerges in Naomi Frankel's trilogy Saul and Joanna. I explore Frankel's use of the characters' illusion as a literary construct, in her writing about the Holocaust only a decade after the Second World War, which shows Frankel to be a unique writer in the cultural milieu that surrounded her. To examine the way in which their self-delusion vis-a-vis the Zionist mission is revealed in the literary work, I rely on the theory of the political unconscious, a concept derived from Frederick Jameson's cultural worldview. The fact that the trilogy was well accepted by the literary critics of the time highlights the importance of re-examining this work 60 years after the publication of the first volume of the trilogy.

M3  - Article
AB  - The 20th century began under the sign of deconstruction of the classical comprehension of substantiality of history, culture and mind. It turned out that each culture has its unique worldview universals and a conclusion has been made that there is a principal difference between classical and modern cultural worlds, and in the rationalities characteristic to them. In the article, based on V. Stepin's conception of scientific rationality, the essential characteristics of the classical mind, which possess heuristic potentials when comparing pre-modern and modern rationality, are explicated. In particular, the ontologism of the pre-modern mind has been distinguished and substantiated based on historical and philosophical material - rootedness in being, only partially related to man; its hierarchy is the dependence of cognitive possibilities on the ontological level of the entities opening to the mind; and the transcendence is the fundamental incomprehensibility of the bases and "guarantors" of the mind and the world for the mind itself. Within the framework of the classical mind, archetypical principles of Western rationality were formulated as such, some of which, after the secularization of medieval culture, became the principle of organizing secular social reality, which ultimately led to the emergence of a new social reality, later called Modernism.

M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - The study and evaluation of growing agricultural areas is an important task for the national economy of the Russian Federation. The use of satellite information in similar studies is a priority. Modern development of technologies allows to estimate the big areas at the minimum financial and human efforts. The study was based on the analysis of thematic maps obtained by the controlled classification of satellite images Landsat 8 with a spatial resolution of 30 m in various combinations of spectral channels that were obtained from the NASA database. Evaluation of the accuracy of the developed thematic maps allowed to identify the optimal combination of spectral channels of satellite imagery and the time of survey.During the thematic mapping, 10 maps were obtained for several time periods. The evaluation of the resulting thematic maps was carried out using control points obtained in the test areas, with the Kappa coefficient (k) being determined. The highest accuracy was shown by the thematic map, obtained from the spring image in combination of the 6-5-2 (SWIR2 - NIR - BLUE) spectral channels. The Kappa coefficient, which has a value of 0.66-0.67 for spring shots, indicates good consistency of thematic maps and field data. On the final thematic map of the agricultural lands of the Republic of Mari El for 2017, the areas of the sites of abandoned agricultural lands, overgrown with coniferous and deciduous species, were determined.

TI  - The Variations of Satellite-Based Ecosystem Water Use and Carbon Use Efficiency and Their Linkages with Climate and Human Drivers in the Songnen Plain, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) and carbon use efficiency (CUE), as two of the most important ecological indicators of an ecosystem, represent the carbon assimilation rate of unit water consumption and the capacity of transferring carbon from the atmosphere to potential carbon sinks. Revealing WUE and CUE changes and their impact factors is vital for regional carbon-water interactions and carbon budget assessment. Climate affects carbon and water processes differently. Compared to WUE, the variations in CUE in response to climate factors and human activity remain inadequately understood. In this study, ecosystem-level WUE and CUE variations in the Songnen Plain (SNP), Northeast China, during 2001-2015, were investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The relationships between WUE, CUE, main climate factors, and human impacts were explored. The results showed that ecosystem WUE and CUE have fluctuated over time, with regional average values of 1.319gCkg(-1)H(2)O and 0.516, respectively. Deciduous broad-leaved forests had the highest average WUE but the lowest CUE. The multiyear average CUE of grassland ranked in first place, while the lowest WUE indicated that a lesser capacity of net productivity was generated by the use of limited water supply. WUE and CUE showed a downward trend in most areas of the SNP, indicating that the carbon sequestration capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem became weaker in the past 15years. Annual precipitation and relative humidity had positive influences on WUE and CUE in more than 60% of the study area. The total annual sunshine duration and annual average temperature negatively affected WUE and CUE in most areas. Human activities had a positive effect on ecosystem WUE changes in the SNP but might inhibit CUE variations. Our findings aid in understanding the biological regulation mechanisms of carbon-water cycle coupling and provide a scientific basis for formulating sustainable regional development strategies and guiding water and land resources management.

AB  - With the rapid development of Guangzhou's economy and urbanization and the gradual deepening of the urban planning and development system, various types of engineering construction activities have become increasingly frequent, and different degrees of ground subsidence have appeared in some areas of the city.Traditional InSAR technology is greatly affected by terrain residuals when monitoring surface deformation.To improve the accuracy and resolution of the digital elevation model and remove the terrain residual phase is the key to improve the monitoring accuracy of temporally interferometric SAR deformation.Based on the TerraSAR-X and tandem X acquisition of high-precision DEM, this paper proposes a Tandem-assisted sequential interference SAR (permanent scatterer) technology, 21 views of ENVISAT/ASAR data and 56 views sentinels on Pazhou Island in Guangzhou City - 1 The data was processed to obtain high-precision monitoring results of surface subsidence and spatio-temporal evolution of urban areas in the study area.The experimental results show that the DEM extracted by TSX/TDX can significantly improve the accuracy of temporally interferometric synthetic aperture radar, and proves that this method has a good effect and application potential in the monitoring of urban surface subsidence.

TI  - Cloud Features of Tibetan Plateau Vortex Category Cloud Cluster over Different Regions along the Eastward-Moving Path in Summer
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the data of CloudSat satellite, FY series satellite, CMORPH hourly precipitation, and ERA-interim reanalysis products, this paper aims to reveal the cloud features of Tibetan Plateau Vortex (TPV) category cloud clusters over its eastward-moving regions. 107 cases of eastward-moving TPV category that occurred in the summer half-year (April to September) are picked out, and then the cloud features of them are further analyzed by statistics. The results show that the eastward-moving TPV category occurs mostly in May and June, but leastly in July and September. With consecutive enhancement of precipitation intensity and convection intensity, an increasing trend is found in the proportions of deep convection clouds and multiple layer clouds during the TPV category eastward movement. In order to reveal the inner connection among the precipitation intensity, the convection intensity, and the microphysical characteristics of TPV category cloud clusters, the TPV category cloud clusters are classified into different categories by the criteria of the precipitation intensity and the convection intensity separately. Consequently, the two different criteria share the commonality that the number concentration of both ice crystal and cloud droplets increases obviously with the enhancement of precipitation intensity or convection intensity. However, the discrepancy of conclusions also exists between the two classification criteria. A notable stretching upward trend is found in the number concentration distribution of the ice crystal and downward trend in the number concentration distribution of the cloud droplet. The same increasing trend is also discovered in the effective average radius of the ice crystal and cloud droplet. But the TPV category cloud clusters with severe convection do not present the similar variation trend both in the number concentration and the effective average radius. Hence, although the above findings confirm that the precipitation intensity, the convection intensity, and the distribution of cloud hydrometers are associated and interacting mutually, the closed function relationship among them cannot be established, and other meteorology factors related to the ambient conditions should also be taken into consideration as a complete cloud microphysical system.

AB  - The detection of cloud using satellite observations is important for retrieval algorithms, image visualization and climate applications. Identifying the presence of cloud and establishing an accurate cloud cover results is a challenging task. Here, we use data from the PARASOL satellite data. In this paper, we describe a new algorithm to detect cloud based on multi-spectrum and polarization characteristics of the polarization images. This uses the new dynamic thresholds obtained by statistics for different atmosphere models and underlying surfaces in different time and areas. Aiming at improving the accuracy of the final cloud detection, especially for those special scenes, such as bright land surface and severe haze. Also, an ice/snow detection algorithm has been adapted from the cloud detection algorithm.A validation for the new cloud detection results has been carried out. In comparisons with other satellite instruments, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO) and CloudSat. Experiment results show the new dynamic cloud detection algorithm has obvious advantages over the official cloud detection algorithm to the whole track results in accuracy, especially when in some areas covered by the bright cloud-free objects. The overall accuracy compared with CloudSat/CALIPSO is 95.07%. The new algorithm improves the accuracy of cloud detection results and constructs a new theoretical model for the cloud detection algorithm of the multi-angle polarization satellite image, such as the Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) launched onboard the GF-5 (GaoFen-5) Satellite.

TI  - New automated method for extracting river information using optimized spectral threshold water index
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of mountain river information is highly significant in water resource investigation and ecological environment protection. However, there are some problems in the existing methods of river information extraction, which are mainly the interference from shadows and buildings. Such interference leads to erroneous and redundant extraction of river information, which leads to inaccuracy or incompleteness. In this study, a precise extraction method of mountain river information is established using Landsat8 image and digital elevation model. The main steps of the river extraction method are as follows: (1) we propose the optimized spectral threshold water index to extract river information; (2) based on digital elevation model data, we simulate the mountain shadows of the study area to remove interference from them; (3) we establish the buffer zone of the river network using digital elevation model data to solve the problem of redundant extraction of river information; (4) we separately calculate and then standardize land surface temperature, albedo, and normalized different building index. The effects of buildings near the river are removed. Results show a relative accuracy of 97.52%. The new method decreases the interference of mountain shadows and buildings.

TI  - Paired-Agent Fluorescence Molecular Imaging of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Using Indocyanine Green as a Control Agent for Antibody-Based Targeted Agents
T2  - CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. Paired-agent molecular imaging methods, which employ coadministration of an untargeted, control imaging agent with a targeted agent to correct for nonspecific uptake, have been demonstrated to detect 200 cancer cells in a mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. This study demonstrates that indocyanine green (ICG), which is approved for human use, is an ideal control agent for future paired-agent studies to facilitate eventual clinical translation. Methods. The kinetics of ICG were compared with a known ideal control imaging agent, IRDye-700DX-labeled antibody in both healthy and metastatic rat popliteal lymph nodes after coadministration, intradermally in the footpad. Results. The kinetics of ICG and antibody-based imaging agent in tumor-free rat lymph nodes demonstrated a strong correlation with each other (r=0.98, p<0.001) with a measured binding potential of -0.102 +/- 0.03 at 20min postagent injection, while the kinetics of ICG and targeted imaging agent shows significant separation in the metastatic lymph nodes. Conclusion. This study indicated a potential for microscopic sensitivity to cancer spread in sentinel lymph nodes using ICG as a control agent for antibody-based molecular imaging assays.

AB  - Landsat 8 has a higher radiometric resolution than the previous Landsat series which offers the possibility that, if well processed, the data will be more suitable for effective monitoring of coastal and inland waters. In this paper, as part of a validation of Landsat 8 surface reflectance over water surfaces, some issues in calibration and radiative transfer modelling are investigated. Atmospheric correction using the MODTRAN 5.4 radiative transfer model is applied to Landsat 8 images at a site in Northern Queensland where ground aerosol and water reflectance measurements are available from an AERONET site to create a matched data series. The atmospheric corrections included aerosol and Rayleigh scattering, gas and aerosol absorption as well as sky and sun glint effects. The surface reflectance values from Landsat 8 were then compared with surface reflectance measurements. The results show that with a suitable solar irradiance model and accounting for surface roughness, the retrieved surface reflectance values have good agreement with surface measured values. It also achieves an acceptable reflectance signature for inland and ocean water. These signature are very important for inland water quality and shallow water bathymetry application.

AB  - Snow and ice in the Tibetan Plateau are important water source of Asia, as many famous rivers originate from this plateau. To ascertain the change of snow and ice under the global warming background, we used thirty years Landsat images and observation data to analyze this change. Utilizing the classic Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) algorithm to extract the area of snow and ice in the Babao River basin. The results indicated that the annual river discharge, average precipitation and temperature were all increased in the Babao River basin. However, the annual average snow and ice area obviously decreased with fluctuations from 1986 to 2017, which was correlated with the temperature rise. The river discharge increase was benefit from the precipitation increases and snow and ice melt. This study provides a reference for the research about snow and ice change in the Tibetan Plateau or other regions.

TI  - The Multi-source Image NDVI Interactive Corrective Method for Long-term Remote Sensing Monitoring of Rare Earth Mining Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to solve the inconsistency of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) caused by the differences in the use of sensors, this essay is aimed to provide a practicable method to make the long-term remote sensing monitoring of rare earth mining area possible. The quantitative relationship between the two NDVI was studied by regression analysis using four pairs of Landsat TM/OLI and HJ-1B CCD image pairs that were transited on the same day. Two pairs of images were selected as experimental images to construct the NDVI conversion equation, and the other two pairs of images were used to verify the accuracy of the conversion equation. The results show that there is an obvious linear positive correlation between the NDVI of Landsat TM/OLI and HJ-1B CCD images. The conversion equations constructed have higher precision, and the root mean square error of the conversion equation is within 0.05. In the scope, the conversion equation can be used to realize the high precision phase conversion of the NDVI of Landsat TM/OLI and HJ-1B CCD data, which is beneficial to complement each other's vegetation monitoring results and provide support for monitoring and analysis of multi-source time series images.

AB  - In this study, we present an operational algorithm to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from MODIS thermal infrared data using physically retrieved emissivity product. This algorithm was implemented in the MUlti-source data SYnergized Quantitative (MuSyQ) remote sensing product system. First, the emissivity in the MODIS two split window channels was estimated using the vegetation cover method, with the bare soil component emissivity derived from the ASTER global emissivity dataset. Then, the LST was retrieved using a modified generalized split -window algorithm. The MuSyQ MODIS LST product and the C6 MxD11 LST product were evaluated using ground measurements collected from four barren surface sites in Northwest China during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) experiment. The evaluation results indicate that the MuSyQ LST products provide better accuracy than the C6 MxD11 product during both daytime and nighttime at all four sites. This study demonstrates that physically retrieved emissivity products are a useful source for LST retrieval over barren surfaces.

AB  - Housing vacancy data, providing useful information on building occupancy rates, are used extensively by public and private organizations to evaluate the need for new housing development programs and also the vacancy rate is regarded as a leading indicator to measure the economic climate. Such a topic has received considerable attentions in China due to its overheated real estate development. Previous house vacancy studies use governmental statistics or private user positioning data, the collection of which is time consuming and difficult. In this work, an efficient indicator Vacancy Area Index (VAI), ranging from 0 to 10, is proposed to measure the county level housing occupancy and ghost cities over China based on MODIS products and DMSP-OLS nighttime light data. Results show that VAI is a good measure of house vacancy with a detection rate 94.44% of ghost cities and a precision 92.48% of non-ghost cities. About 320 among 2430 county areas in China have a VAI no less than 7, indicating national wide spread high house vacancy. The VAI can also reveal the spatial characteristics and temporal development of cities with different features such as tourism cites, industrial cities, and real "Ghost Cities" accurately.

AB  - On August 8, 2017, an Ms7.0 earthquake occurred in the city of Jiuzhaigou, Sichuan, China. We processed the European Space Agency ascending-descending Sentinel-1A/IW monitoring data, with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) small baselines subset techniques and permanent scattering interferometry techniques for interference processing. We obtained the initial InSAR coseismic deformation interference results of the earthquake, and then used the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) coseismic observations to calibrate the InSAR results. The InSAR coseismic deformation fields show that the maximum displacement of the surface deformation caused by the earthquake is about 20 cm in the line-of-sight direction, and the coseismic deformation filed has an asymmetric distribution.In this study, InSAR technology has achieved some results in surface deformation monitoring and digital elevation model acquisition due to its advantages of all-weather, all-day technique with the ability to penetrate cloud. And the GNSS can obtain single-point high-precision and high accuracy positioning. Combined, these two data types can ameliorate errors that are caused by satellite orbit error, surface conditions, and temporal irrelevance, which are difficult to eliminate in InSAR data. The technique can also realize the effective unification of GPS technology with high time resolution, high plane position accuracy and InSAR technology with high spatial resolution and high elevation deformation accuracy.It was shown in previous research that a single-orbit radar dataset could not accurately reflect a coseismic deformation field on the surface of the Earth. The novel contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we used ascending-descending InSAR data and various GNSS dataset to improve surface deformation information accuracy. Second, we compared the displacement variables obtained by using only sentinel-1A data with the combined sentinel-1A data and GPS CORS site data.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Distribution Characteristics of Mesoscale Convective Systems Producing Short-Duration Heavy Rainfall over the Tianshan Mountain Area
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on hourly precipitation data and FY-2 satellite infrared (IR) digital satellite imagery collected during the warm season from 2005 to 2015 in the Tianshan Mountains and the adjacent areas in Xinjiang, China, the definition of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) was revised based on short-duration heavy precipitation processes. The spatiotemporal development of MCSs in terms of the initiation, maturation, dissipation, duration, and movement was statistically analyzed. Most mesoscale systems in the area were dominated by meso- convective systems (MCSs), which was in line with the annual heavy precipitation frequency. In meso- convective systems (MCSs), persistent elongated convective systems (PECSs) occurred more commonly than mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs). MCSs were common in summer, with the peak frequency of MCS occurrence in June and the peak frequency of MCS occurrence mainly in July and August. From the perspective of diurnal variations, MCSs initiated in the late afternoon, developed during the evening, and dissipated before midnight. MCSs in general lasted 6 approximate to 9h between June and July and 9 approximate to 11h in August. The MCSs lasted approximately 14h, and the MCSs lasted from 7h to 12h. The development and termination stages of MCSs lasted 3 approximate to 6h and 2 approximate to 7h, respectively. In low-elevation areas and on the windward slope of the mountains, MCSs initiated more easily and more frequently over the northern and western slopes than that over the southern and eastern slopes. The central area of the Junggar basin hosted the development of MCSs, but the distribution of the convective systems at different scales varied. During the termination stage, these mesoscale systems were mainly located at the basin edges. In terms of tracks, most MCSs moved eastward under the influence of the westerlies and the MCSs moved faster but in a more scattered manner than the MCSs. Additionally, some unusual tracks appeared because of the effects of the underlying surface topography and environmental wind.

TI  - Development and Validation of Nomograms Predictive of Axillary Nodal Status to Guide Surgical Decision-Making in Early-Stage Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To develop and validate nomogram models using noninvasive imaging parameters with related clinical variables to predict the extent of axillary nodal involvement and stratify treatment options based on the essential cut-offs for axillary surgery according to the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria.Materials and Methods: From May 2007 to December 2017, 1799 patients who underwent preoperative breast and axillary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively studied. Patients with data on axillary ultrasonography (AUS) were enrolled. The MRI images were interpreted according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data system (BI-RADS). Using logistic regression analyses, nomograms were developed to visualize the associations between the predictors and each lymph node (LN) status endpoint. Predictive performance was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap resampling was performed for internal validation. Goodness-of-fit of the models was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test.Results: Of 397 early breast cancer patients, 200 (50.4%) had disease-free axilla, 119 (30.0%) had 1 or 2 positive LNs, and 78 (19.6%) had >= 3 positive LNs. Patient age, MRI features (mass margin, LN margin, presence/absence of LN hilum, and LN symmetry/asymmetry), and AUS descriptors (presence of cortical thickening or hilum) were identified as predictors of nodal disease. Nomograms with these predictors showed good calibration and discrimination; the AUC was 0.809 for negative axillary node (N0) vs. any LN metastasis, 0.749 for 1 or 2 involved nodes vs. N0, and 0.874 for >= 3 nodes vs. <= 2 metastatic nodes. The predictive ability of the 3 nomograms with additional pathological variables was significantly greater.Conclusion: The nomograms could predict the extent of ALN metastasis and facilitate decision-making preoperatively.

AB  - Land subsidence, as a regional environmental disaster problem, hinders social stability and sustainable development, and endangers people's lives and property in the long term. As demonstrated by many examples, Time Series InSAR is able to monitor land subsidence using a stack of synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images. However, due to the data missing problem caused by short satellite life and data confidentiality, it is difficult to get the full monitoringresult during long time by using only a single sensor. In recent years,multi-sensor InSAR fusion methods are mostly used for cross validation and comparative analysis. Unfortunately,the datasets used in these methods is repetitive and cohesive in short time, the problem of missing data during long time has not been solved. In this paper, we will exploit three stacks of time-gapped SAR data, acquired from 2004 to 2005 by Envisat ASAR, from 2007 to 2010 by ALOS PALSAR, from 2015 to 2016 by TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, to analyze the long term subsidence of Shenyang city. In order to fuse the time-series InSAR results from different sensors, mathematical methods based on nonlinear curve fit will be conducted to find the best-fit model for the deformation time series. We also examine the performance of the nonlinear curve fit by calculating the root mean square error (RMSE) based on the difference between the vertical deformation time series and the best-fit model.

AB  - The quality of ecological environment is closely related to human life and the method of the evaluating the ecological environmental quality is the main factors for the accuracy of the models. We proposed a novel Ecological Environmental Quality Evaluation (EEQE) model which is constructed by combining the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and the Principal Component Analysis method (PCA) etc. The natural factors, meteorological factors, topographical factors and anthropogenic activities factors are also considered in the EEQE model which can be utilized to effectively assess the quality of the ecological environment. The results showed that the ecological environmental quality of five cities with good level and excellent level is most about 80%. Besides, we also analyzed the correlations between ecological environmental quality and the impact factors. The results indicate that the dominant factors of the ecological environment quality in Huai'an, Lianyungang, Suqian, Xuzhou and Yancheng are precipitation, land surface temperature, net primary productivity, wetness and slope respectively.

TI  - Deformation monitoring and prediction for residential areas in the Panji mining area based on an InSAR time series analysis and the GM-SVR model
T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground coal mining activities often cause ground subsidence and damage to surface construction, which seriously threatens the lives and property of residents in mining areas. In this paper, the deformation of the Yang Juzhuang village, which is a residential area in the Huainan mining area (China), was monitored through an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series analysis. The vertical displacements were detected using thirteen Sentinel-1A images that were acquired between December 2016 and May 2017. The validity and applicability of the method are verified by comparing the acquired images with the GPS measurement results. Because of the deformation characteristics of the mining area, a prediction model that is combined with a grey support vector machine regression (GM-SVR) is proposed, and the practical effects of the model are verified using the deformation monitoring results of the study area. The combination of this model and SBAS-InSAR provides rapid dynamic monitoring and enables the issuance of disaster warnings in the region.

AB  - Dues to its large capacity of information, super-speed transmission and high stability, laser communication has become a popular kind of satellite communication technology. Different from other kinds of communication technology, laser communication terminals (LCT) consists of optical systems with high imaging quality, high precise and rapid tracking systems. Testing the LCT on land is necessary to ensure its performance on the satellite. This article introduces a LCT-test and evaluation station (LCT-TES) in the laboratory. The LCT-TES is a high quality optical system providing laboratory measurements of the key characteristics of LCT, such as power testing, energy distribution of light spot in the far field, and the angle of beam divergence. The test precision of LCT- TES is also analyzed in this paper.

CP  - 11th IEEE International Conference on Wireless Communications and Signal Processing (WCSP)
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - High altitude platform (HAP) is an important supplement facility for low earth orbit mobile satellite system (LEO-MSS) to increase the capacity in hot-spot regions beyond the coverage of terrestrial networks. Because of the large propagation delay and the frequent passive handover caused by the quick movement of LEO satelliets, handover protocols and strategies should be studied and improved. In this paper, we design different handover procedures suitable for LEO-HAP system based on 5G protocol and analyze the performance on delay and signalling cost. And we propose a dynamic handover strategy to optimize the handover moment and resource allocation. Lagrange duality is used and a sub-gradient algorithm is presented to solve this problem. Simulation results show that the proposed handover processes provide better performance on delay and signalling cost compared with the traditional protocol. And the proposed strategy has an excellent performance on drop rate and power consumption.

AB  - Sea ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change. This study focuses on retrieving sea ice concentrations from the brightness temperatures recorded by the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) on board the FengYun (FY)-3B satellite. After cross calibration with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E) data from July to September 2011, MWRI brightness temperatures are used to calculate the sea ice concentrations based on the Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction Study Sea Ice (ASI) algorithm with different tie points' combinations. The combination corresponding to the most similar results to AMSR-E sea ice products is selected as the new tie points to retrieve the sea ice concentrations in the Arctic. After comparing with the products of AMWR-E and MWRI, the sea ice concentrations from this work are validated by Aqua/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) calibrated radiances data.

TI  - Precise identification of maize in the North China Plain based on Sentinel-1A SAR time series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Playing a vital role in the national economy and food security of many countries, maize should be identified precisely to accurately determine planting area and yield times. Analysis of multi-temporal backscatter characteristics based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data provides an effective approach to spatially map maize on a regional scale. Accordingly, we acquired nine European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR dual-polarimetric (VV and VH) radar time series data at a 20m spatial resolution for a segment of the North China Plain in 2016. After observing variability in C-Band VV and VH backscattering coefficients and analysing microwave backscattering characteristics for different structures at different growth and development stages, as well as a comparison between different crops, we selected the optimum temporal phases to construct Sentinel-1A SAR time series data sequences for classification. To assess the performance of different polarization modes in identifying maize, both single- and dual-polarimetric data were used. Results showed that a high-recognition accuracy could be achieved for maize using SAR time series data. Specifically, long-sequenced dual-polarimetric SAR time series data performed better with an overall accuracy of 93.57% and a kappa coefficient of 0.92 compared to dual-polarimetric SAR data from July (45.13% and 0.34, respectively). Although an increment increase in the number of images used improved overall accuracy, more than five could result in an increase in errors. Single-polarimetric data from a single temporal phase yielded an accuracy of only 31.58%. Additionally, classification accuracy obtained by applying dual-polarization could be improved by 13% compared to single-polarimetric SAR data from a single temporal phase time acquisition alone. However, the differences among the single-polarization, dual-polarization, and multi-polarization results were relatively moderate when sufficient temporal phase data were applied.

TI  - An improved distributed storage model of remote sensing images based on the HDFS and pyramid structure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapidly growing amount of remote sensing data, data management needs to adopt a new architecture. Some improvements have been made in some areas. For example, the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) can be utilised for large files. However, small files will be produced when storing remote sensing images in the pyramid-based structure. In this paper, we propose a method based on the Hadoop system with MapFile. The method is an improved storage model for efficient storage and allows for access of the small files on the HDFS. The proposed method combines small files into the MapFile serialised container, and it reduces the number of small files. The metadata sensor information is stored in the index to improve the search speed. Results demonstrate the efficiency of remote sensing image processing using the pyramid model and the reduced execution time compared with the HDFS, HDWebGIS and Hadoop archives.

TI  - Satellite-Based Spatiotemporal Trends of Canopy Urban Heat Islands and Associated Drivers in China's 32 Major Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect, in which urbanized areas tend to have warmer conditions compared to their rural surroundings, has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Using ground-based and satellite remote sensing data, we present a method to quantify the spatial pattern and diurnal and seasonal variations in canopy layer heat islands (CLHIs) in China's 32 major cities during 2009 and investigate their relationships with built-up intensity (BI), nighttime lights, vegetation activity, surface albedo, and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII). The results show that both the annual daytime and nighttime CLHI intensities (CLHIIs) were positive ranging from 0.2 degrees C to 2.2 degrees C and from 0.3 degrees C to 2.4 degrees C for these major cities, respectively. Higher CLHIIs were observed in the night, especially for northern parts of China. Along urban-rural gradients, the CLHI effect had an exponential decay shape and differed greatly by season. The CLHII distribution correlated positively and significantly to BI and nighttime lights. Vegetation activity was negatively correlated with the CLHII and more strongly in summer. Surface albedo showed an extremely weak correlation with the CLHII. In addition, CLHII had a strong correlation with SUHII. The annual daytime SUHII was 1.2 +/- 1.1 degrees C (mean +/- standard deviation) with 0.40 degrees C (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.44 degrees C) of annual daytime CLHII. The annual nighttime SUHII was 2.0 +/- 0.8 degrees C with 1.04 degrees C (0.99 to 1.09 degrees C) of annual nighttime CLHII. Our results suggest that, reducing built-up intensity and anthropogenic heat emissions and increasing urban vegetation provide a co-benefit of mitigating SUHI and CLHI effects.

AB  - Urban building change detection is one of the most important parts of remote sensing applications. Researching change detection method based on deep learning is an effective solution to monitor the urban expansion and recognize the specific change classes. In this paper, we propose a novel urban building change detection method based on the revised residual Unet with Sentinel-1 SAR intensity images. Firstly, we present a new difference image by combing both the original intensity image and the enhanced log-ratio difference image using a non-linear function. Then, the combined difference image is sent to a revised residual Unet network to detect the building changes. By the proposed combined difference image and the revised network, our method is able to focus on the building's change while ignoring other land type changes in a large area. A pair of real bitemporal SAR images is used to test the proposed approach and the obtained experimental results confirm its effectiveness.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - The development characteristics of land subsidence of Xi'an by an advanced InSAR technique are investigated based on Envisat, Radarsat-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, and it can be found that there still have been five typical land subsidence bowls with maximum subsidence rates beyond 40 mm/year in Xi'an. In 2012, the land subsidence took on slightly slowing down with a ground rebound area of up to 6.3 km(2). But in 2003-2010, 2016 and 2017, there was more serious land subsidence and especially in 2017 the maximum velocity reached up to -137 mm/year. Yuhuazhai-Nanyaotou subsidence bowl as the greatest subsidence bowl, its area that rate was below 50 mm/year in 2017 was up to 10.64 km(2). Moreover, these land subsidence bowls mainly concentrate upon tectonic depression area due to huge thickness clay soil and are spatially and temporally coincident with confined aquifer depression cones, suggesting that over-exploitation groundwater plays a decisive role for land subsidence. Ground fissure belts are generally controlled by normal faults in Xi'an, but asymmetry settlement of land surface can also give rise to the abnormal activities of ground fissure belts, which have caused serious threat or damage to building structures. In addition, it could also be found that surface uplift area in 2012 involves in both the tectonic depression area and loess ridge in terms of their same thickness sand layer.

CL  - Haikou, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Breast cancer is the leading threat to women health both in the developed and developing countries around the world. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has become the standard of care for the staging of this disease over the past few decades. Conventional ultrasound lacks the capability to identify the SLNs. Thus, during the procedure, radioactive tracers and dyes are injected and an open surgery is required to identify the dye accumulated SLNs. As a rapidly growing technology, photoacoustic (PA) imaging is gaining widespread attention due to its excellent imaging contrast as well as high resolution for deep imaging [1, 2]. Therefore, handheld ultrasound linear array based PA systems have been developed by several groups for SLN identification over the past few years, which were demonstrated to be able to identify SLNs noninvasively, and can potentially eliminate the need for radioactive tracers and open surgeries [3]. In most of these systems, the light excitation and ultrasound detection are not designed coaxially, and thus high laser pulse energy is usually needed to produce PA images with a decent signal-to-noise ratio. For one recently reported coaxial based design, the imaging probe is very bulky and complex, making it unfriendly for clinical use and translation [4].

AB  - The microwave radiation data from the microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) onboard FY-3C meteorological satellite was employed in the data assimilation system to estimate the impact of this data on typhoon forecasts. 118.75-GHz and 183.31-GHz channels from the MWHTS provide atmospheric temperature and humidity profile measurements, respectively. These measurements play critical roles forecasting the path of the typhoon and pressure of the typhoon center. In this paper, the data from the MWHTS are implemented in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model data assimilation system (WRFDA) to forecast the path of the typhoon and pressure of the typhoon center. The results demonstrate that the path prediction of the typhoon has been improved, but the error of the forecast pressure did not decrease significantly. It can be concluded that the data of the 118.75-GHz and 183.31-GHz channels from the MWHTS for predicting the path of the typhoon is effective. In particular, the 118 GHz frequency is the first time applied to polar orbiting meteorological satellites in the world. The application of the 118-GHz channels in data assimilation will deserve further research in the future.

AB  - There are atmospheric temperature sounding channels on the new generation of Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) and the Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) onboard the FY-3D polar-orbiting meteorological satellite, which are set at frequencies near 118.75-GHz and 50 similar to 60-GHz, respectively. These atmospheric temperature sounding channels are used to analyze sensitivity to precipitation over ocean and land, respectively. In this paper, data from the MWHTS, MWTS and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 are matched in time and space. Then, combined with the MWHTS and MWTS microwave data, the global ocean and land precipitation sensitivities are analyzed separately. The results demonstrate that three groups of channels, (118.75+2.5-GHz and 52. 8-GHz), (118.75+3.0-GHz and 51.76-GHz) and (118.75+5.0-GHz and 50.3-GHz), are at the same height, and the corresponding brightness temperatures have good consistency. The application of these channels will deserve further research in the future.

TI  - Decline in Transparency of Lake Hongze from Long-Term MODIS Observations: Possible Causes and Potential Significance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Transparency is an important indicator of water quality and the underwater light environment and is widely measured in water quality monitoring. Decreasing transparency occurs throughout the world and has become the primary water quality issue for many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems due to eutrophication and other human activities. Lake Hongze is the fourth largest freshwater lake in China, providing water for surrounding cities and farms but experiencing significant water quality changes. However, there are very few studies about Lake Hongze's transparency due to the lack of long-term monitoring data for the lake. To understand long-term trends, possible causes and potential significance of the transparency in Lake Hongze, an empirical model for estimating transparency (using Secchi disk depth: SDD) based on the moderate resolution image spectroradiometer (MODIS) 645-nm data was validated using an in situ dataset. Model mean absolute percentage and root mean square errors for the validation dataset were 27.7% and RMSE = 0.082 m, respectively, which indicates that the model performs well for SDD estimation in Lake Hongze without any adjustment of model parameters. Subsequently, 1785 cloud-free images were selected for use by the validated model to estimate SDDs of Lake Hongze in 2003-2017. The long-term change of SDD of Lake Hongze showed a decreasing trend from 2007 to 2017, with an average of 0.49 m, ranging from 0.57 m in 2007 to 0.42 m in 2016 (a decrease of 26.3%), which indicates that Lake Hongze experienced increased turbidity in the past 11 years. The loss of aquatic vegetation in the northern bays may be mainly affected by decreases of SDD. Increasing total suspended matter (TSM) concentration resulting from sand mining activities may be responsible for the decreasing trend of SDD.

AB  - The earthquake disaster not only caused great damage to the original ecological environment system, but also even formed a new ecological system. Remote sensing technology has played an important role in post-earthquake emergency and disaster assessment with its rapid, high revisit cycle and macro-micro comprehensive observation. The effective use of multi-period remote sensing data combined with the theory of eco-environmental impact assessment can build an effective model to evaluate the dynamic changes of ecological environment. In this paper, taking Wenchuan County in Wenchuan Earthquake as a case study, we proposed a comprehensive evaluation index method and the eco-environmental quality evaluation of Wenchuan County after 10-year earthquake were constructed and the changes of eco-environmental quality were analyzed. The result of the analysis showed that ten years after the earthquake (2018), the eco-environmental quality of poor regions in the county had also exhibited an obvious improvement. The eco-environmental quality in some regions in the county had fully recovered. The results are of great significance to scientific disaster relief and reasonable restoration and reconstruction.

AB  - The knowledge and understanding of intra- and inter annual characteristics of canal water is crucial for agricultural water management. The narrow shape of canal greatly limits the application of moderate-resolution remote sensing technologies. Based on newly available Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) imagery with frequent revisit and higher spatial resolution, we identified variation of water/bank boundary by Roberts, Sobel, Prewitt, Laplacian of Gaussian and Canny 5 edge detectors and furtherly compared the water width results with estimation by ground measurement. The preliminary results show that all detectors can successfully monitor seasonal variation of canal water surface. Canny detector is most stable among 5 methods for time series monitoring, although overestimated the water width during dry period. Our methods and results reveal the great potential of Sentinel-2 imagery for canal water utilization and irrigation management.

AB  - In this paper, in order to produce long term fully global land surface temperature (LST) product, the generalized split-window (GSW) algorithm and dual-window (DW) algorithm was used to retrieve LST from different geostationary (GEO) satellite data, including the FY-2E/4A, MTSAT-2/Himawari-8, MSG2, and GOES13/15. First, the coefficients of the GSW and DW algorithm were obtained from a simulation database constructed using the MODTRAN 5.2 and the SeeBor V5.0 atmospheric profile database. Second, the emissivity was estimated using the vegetation cover method, with the bare soil component emissivity derived from the ASTER global emissivity dataset (GED). Finally, the LST results of FY-4A AGRI and Himawari-8 AHI were retrieved and cross-validated. The results show that the LST algorithms developed in this work are capable of generating accurate high temporal resolution LST retrieval from global GEO satellite data.

TI  - Water level changes of Hulun Lake in Inner Mongolia derived from Jason satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water levels in lakes can reflect changes in such bodies. Therefore, there is value in identifying the variations in water levels using observations from altimetry satellites and analyzing the possible causes. In this work, the water-level changes of Hulun Lake in Inner Mongolia during the period from 2002 to 2015 are monitored by the use of Jason satellite data, the results of which are compared with historical data. Landsat TW/ETM/OLI_TRIS remote sensing images are analyzed, and the surface area of the lake extracted from them and converted to the corresponding water level to verify the values obtained from the Jason observations. The results show a downward trend after 2000 (-0.98 mm/year) and a sharp increase after 2012 (3.07 mm/year). The root mean square error (RMSE) between the two methods was 0.2369 m, and the correlation coefficient was 0.986. By analyzing the various influencing factors, we draw the conclusion that the water level of Hulun Lake is affected by both natural factors (e.g., rainfall, runoff, evapotranspiration etc.) and anthropogenic influences (e.g., water consumption in coal mining, overgrazing, etc.). These are the main causes of the decrease in the area of Hulun Lake and other lakes in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. By comparing the lake storage anomalies of Hulun Lake with the terrestrial Total Water Storage anomalies (TWSA) inverted from GRACE satellite data and the Surface Water Storage anomalies (SWSA) from WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) within the Hulun Basin, we find that not only do Hulun Lake and basin interact with each other, but also that Hulun Lake has an important function with regards to the changes within the basin as a whole. This work therefore provides a method for monitoring the dynamic changes of lake water levels, while analyzing the influencing factors based on multi-scale data. Such a method shows potential for being applied to efforts to ensure environmental protection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - As one of the important land surface parameters, land surface temperature plays an important role in monitoring agricultural drought, global change, meteorological forecast, water cycle, urban heat island etc. However, cloud pattern becomes one of the main obstacles to inversion of land surface temperature inevitably. Take Landsat 8 OLI as an example, firstly, a new cloud pattern detection algorithm is proposed on the basis of the results of previous methods, in this algorithm, cloud patterns are divided into three categories: cloud, cloud shadow and cloud cover; Then, the sensitivity of this algorithm to different seasons and different regions are analyzed. Finally, the effect of cloud cover on land surface is discussed. The results show that the new algorithm can identify cloud, cloud shadow and cloud cover effectively in different regions and different season assuming that cloud and cloud shadow have similar shape, and the accuracy can satisfy the needs of research. The findings of this study can further specify the influence of cloud pattern on land surface temperature change and effectively promote all-weather the inversion of land surface temperature.

AB  - As a new remote sensing monitoring information, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been widely used in the detection of changes in vegetation state at global and regional scales in recent years. SIF study in agricultural field has quickly become a research hotspot. TanSat is a global scientific experiment satellite for carbon dioxide monitoring launched in December 2016 with SIF monitoring capability. This paper aims to retrieve SIF based on a simplified physical model using TanSat data. The KI Fraunhofer Line at 770.1 nm was selected, which is less affected by the atmosphere. L1B-level data of TanSat was used to extract SIF of southeast China in July 2017. We used cloud mask products from MODIS data at the same period to eliminate cloud-affected areas and obtain SIF under clear sky conditions. The SIF value of our retrieval result is between -2mW.m(-2) . sr(-1).nm(-1) and 5mW.m(-2) . sr(-1).nm(-1). Comparing the result with SIF products showed that there is an encouraging consistency between them. This indicated that the inversion algorithm based on the simplified physical model can be used to retrieve SIF from TanSat data.

AB  - Forest stand height is one of the most important tree measurement metrics in forest inventory. Airborne LiDAR is likely to be a preferred technology for acquiring high-quality forest stand height to support forest survey and management, but the cost is much higher if being used to monitor the changes of forest stand height in time series. In this study, we use ZIYUAN-3 (ZY-3) tri-stereo imagery to create photogrammetric digital surface models (DSM) by dense image matching methods and LiDAR data to derive the digital terrain models (DTM). Forest stand height can be derived from ZY3-lidar CHM which is produced by subtracting the lidar DTM from the ZY-3 photogrammetric DSM. The forest stand height map is validated by the systematic LiDAR CHM plot. The result shows that ZY-3 tri-stereo imagery can be used for forest stand height mapping.

T2  - EKOLOJI
M3  - Article
AB  - For the study area, Introducing the humidity correction and aerosol scale height correction methods, the optimal Aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and the PM2.5 mass concentration estimation models are selected as the Monadic quadratic equation model. Based on 5 point sliding average method and accumulated variance analysis, using the cumulative slope change ratio comparison method, taking the winter as the base period without considering other factors, the relative contribution rate of relative humidity to PM2.5 in the process of retrieving PM2.5 mass concentration was calculated to be 31.60% and 48.40% respectively in spring-summer and autumn, the relative contribution rate of Aerosol scale height to AOT was 72.28% and 40.23% respectively in spring -summer and autumn, the relative contribution rate of relative humidity to AOT was 24.59% and 26.23% respectively in spring-summer and autumn. By analyzing the contribution rate of relative humidity and Aerosol scale height to AOT or PM2.5, this study reveals the sensitivity of AOT to relative humidity and Aerosol scale height and the sensitivity of PM2.5 to relative humidity. It provides a reference for a more accurate inversion of PM2.5 mass concentration in near ground surface. The National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) began continuous observation of the atmosphere in 1996 in Tsukuba, Japan, with a compact Mie-scattering lidar system, and added polarization measurement capability in 1999. Similar systems were installed at Nagasaki University on 22 February 2001 and at the Sino-Japan Friendship Center for Environmental Protection in Beijing on 1 March 2001.

TI  - <i>l</i><sub>0 </sub>Sparse Approximation of Coastline Inflection Method on FY-3C MWRI Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) located onboard the FengYun-3C (FY-3C) satellite provides a considerable amount of critical information for numerical weather predictions. Obtaining accurate geolocation results from the FY-3C MWRI data is of great importance. In this letter, we improve the traditional coastline inflection method (CIM) and propose an l(0) sparse approximation model for geolocation error estimation and correction. Specifically, we propose using the jump point of the step function to estimate the true coastline point. This approach can characterize the geolocation errors more accurately than the CIM, which further improves the geolocation accuracy. In the theoretical part, we provide a complete solution to obtain the step function through an iterative blind deconvolution. For a practical use, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for geolocation error estimation through quantitative results obtained on the FY-3C MWRI data. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve an improvement of up to 33.33% in the standard deviation of geolocation errors (approximately 0.00030) compared to the traditional CIM (approximately 0.00045). Furthermore, we also apply the proposed method to the FY-3C satellite and improve the geolocation accuracy of the MWRI data through geolocation error correction.

AB  - Drought will affect ecological environment and cause economic losses. Guangdong Province has been suffering from seasonal drought for a long time. Traditional drought assessment mainly relies on site-scale soil moisture content data or meteorological-related data. The spatial representativeness of this drought assessment method based on single point is poor. The high temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing images is more conducive to our assessment of long-term and large-scale drought changes. Soil moisture and dryness can affect the growth of vegetation. In vegetation-covered areas, indicators reflecting vegetation status can also be used for drought assessment to a certain extent. We calculated Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) using an 8-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003 to 2017. The spatial and temporal distribution of drought in Guangdong Province in recent years was analyzed based on VCI. The following main conclusions are obtained: 1) the results of remote sensing drought assessment by using VCI are consistent with the actual situation. The annual average VCI in Guangdong Province in 2005, 2006 and 2010 was lower than in other years. According to the meteorological data of Guangdong Province, severe drought occurred from late 2004 to early 2005, from late 2005 to early 2006 and from late 2010 to early 2011. 2) On a long-term trend, the drought situation tends to decrease year by year in Guangdong. Compared with other areas in Guangdong, drought occurrence in eastern Guangdong is less frequent and milder. 3) Spring drought and autumn-winter drought of different severity usually occur in Guangdong Province. Spring drought is usually the most serious in Western Guangdong and the lightest in eastern Guangdong.

AB  - Thin cloud removal is very important for optical remote sensing imagery. Different from thick cloud removal, the pixels contaminated by thin cloud still preserve some surface information. Therefore, thin cloud removal methods usually focus on suppressing the cloud influence instead of replacing the cloudy pixels. In this paper, we proposed a deep residual symmetrical concatenation network (RSC-Net) to make end-to-end cloud removal. The RSC-Net is based on an encoding-decoding framework consisting of multiple residual convolutional layers and residual deconvolutional layers. The feature maps of each convolutional layer are copied and concatenated to their symmetrical deconvolutional layers. Using supervised training with real Landsat-8 data, input samples include one cloudy image and one cloud-free reference image, and the cloud-free reference image also serves as the target. When the RSC-Net is fully trained, it is able to take cloudy image as input and produce cloud-free image as output. Experimental results show that our method has significant advantages in removing thin cloud contaminations in different bands when compared with other traditional and state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - This chapter introduces a CyberGIS solution that aims at resolving the big data challenges in the discovery, search, visualization and interoperability of geospatial data. We describe a service-oriented architecture to make heterogeneous geospatial resources easily sharable and interoperable. OGC standards for sharing vector data, raster data, sensor observation data etc. are adopted in such an infrastructure because of their widespread popularity in the GIScience community. Three supporting techniques include: (1) a novel method that combines real-time Web crawling and meta-cataloging in support of quick identification and discovery of distributed geospatial services; (2) an ontology-enabled semantic search framework to enhance the relevancy search and ranking; (3) multi-dimensional visualization of diverse interrelated dataset for discovering underlying patterns and decision-making. Finally, we introduce two applications: Landsat Image Service Archive (LISA) and the ESIP (Earth Science Information Partnership) Semantic Web Testbed to demonstrate the applicability of proposed techniques in various Earth Science domains.

AB  - As we begin to consider modeling large, realistic 3D building scenes, it becomes necessary to consider a more compact representation over the polygonal mesh model. Due to the large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly to obtain, we leverage synthetic data to train our system for the satellite image domain. By utilizing the synthetic data, we formulate the building decomposition as an application of instance segmentation and primitive fitting to decompose a building into a set of primitive shapes. Experimental results on WorldView-3 satellite image dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our 3D building modeling approach.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - Land use and land cover change has a slow but prolonged impact on various aspects of environment on local, regional and global scales. In developing countries especially population pressure and food demand have compelled conversion of wetlands to built-up and agricultural lands. One such unique example is the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKWs) located on the eastern fringes of Kolkata City in India where such land cover change is very intense and rapid. In this study, wetland conversions in EKWs from 1972 to 2011 were analyzed with four Landsat images using the Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GeOBIA) and a post-classification comparison. Results suggested that wetland areas decreased by 17.9 percent during the study period. The western part of the wetlands saw the maximum conversion of wetlands to built-up areas with time, whereas the east and south experienced more of wetlands to agricultural and other land conversions

TI  - AGING BRICK KILNS IN THE ASIAN BRICK BELT USING A LONG TIME SERIES OF LANDSAT SENSOR DATA TO INFORM THE STUDY OF MODERN DAY SLAVERY

AB  - The brick-making industry of the 'Brick Belt' (spanning mostly parts of Bangladesh, Nepal, India and Pakistan) is a major employer, providing work for tens of millions people. Unfortunately, it is known via locally-based human rights groups that many of those working in the brick kilns are modern-day slaves. However, reliable and timely, spatially explicit and scalable data on the full extent of this slavery is currently unavailable. Since brick kilns leave a visible impact on the Earth's land cover that can be detected from space, and given that satellite sensor images are readily available globally for the past >40 years, using these data could afford a better understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of this slavery activity, affording optimal intervention. This research focuses on aging of brick kilns in the `Brick Belt' based on Landsat time series data, in order to reflect the evolution of brick kilns. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) time series data from 1984 to 2018 were downloaded from Google Earth Engine according to the coordinates of a collection of kilns identified in the 'Brick Belt'. A break detection method applied to the time series of data and random forest classifications were used to age the kilns. Results showed that the accuracy of kiln aging, determined using Google Earth as ground data, was approximately 83%, and the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) between the Landsat prediction date and Google Earth date was about 3.60 years, both highlighting the potential to age kilns across the broader region. The results also show that many kilns were younger than 10 years, indicating that the brick making industry has been highly active in recent years, being driven by the demand for bricks as the region's economy grows.

AB  - Cloudiness and precipitation are important output parameters in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, both for their own sake and because they strongly affect other parameters, e.g., surface temperature. The spin-up problem is an important reason resulting in low accuracy of forecasts during the early prediction stage (0-6 h), so it's necessary to introduce cloud-related information to eliminate or weaken this problem. For typhoon prediction, microwave satellite data is crucial. Profiles of cloud microphysical parameters can be retrieved from the microwave imager using certain inversion technology. The microwave imager onboard Fengyun-3B (FY-3B MWRI), the microwave imager onboard Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM TMI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) onboard AQUA are selected to do this research. Experiments of initialization of the cloud microphysical information in Global and Regional Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES) during typhoon MA-ON activity are carried out to investigate their impact on forecasts. The results indicate that prediction of hydrometer parameters and surface rain rate can be faster through initialization of cloud information derived from satellite microwave observations in GRAPES model and there is positive contribution during the first 6 hours of the model integration. Retrievals from MWRI, TMI and AMSR-E have a good consistency, and fusion data with three kinds of retrievals shows a more positive impact.

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing of Clouds and the Atmosphere XXIV, held at SPIE Remote Sensing Conference
CL  - Strasbourg, FRANCE
AB  - Launched in 2013, and 2017 respectively, Chinese Fengyun-3C and 3D meteorological satellites are equipped with two microwave sounders, Microwave Temperature Sounder (MWTS) and Microwave Humidity Sounder -2 (MWHS-2), whose observations play an important role in numerical weather prediction by data assimilation. Data quality control should be carried out before assimilation to filter out bad data, such as cloud- or rain-polluted data and questionable data. This work can't be accomplished purely depending on MWTS or MWHS-2 themselves. MWHS-2 is taken as an example to do quality control in the paper, and the method is suitable for MWTS too. Multi-source information from other instruments onboard FY-3 is extracted to assist in the work. Cloud mask product from VIRR (Visible and InfraRed Radiometer), oceanic cloud liquid water content product from MWRI (Microwave Radiation Imager), and global rain rate product from MWRI are mapped to MWHS-2 for quality control in combination with oceanic rain detection product from MWHS-2 itself. 6 kinds of cloud and rain detection schemes are then designed to get the best choice by analyzing the characteristics of background departure. RTTOV v10 is adopted to simulate brightness temperature of MWHS-2 at all channels. The results suggested that scheme RI RC (MWRI cloud and rain information ingested) and scheme RC (all information ingested) are the two best choices for numerical assimilation application, and scheme RI RC can retain more samples. Questionable data can also be found in the way to help monitor the operational status of instruments.

T2  - THERMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lunar volcanism play an important role on studying the thermal and compositional evolution of the Moon. However, the studies on the relationships among composition, location and age of Lunar volcanos are still limit. The high-quality and multi-source remote sensing data offer the opportunity to obtain significant features of the Lunar volcanism and the evolution of the Moon. Specifically, the high-quality gravitational features of volcanic landforms of the Moon are observed by the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory. Besides, the lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera provides detail morphologic features of Lunar volcanos based on high-resolution optical images. This paper aims to find the characteristic of lunar volcanos by observing the gravitational and morphologic features in the center of craters. The final results show that most of the craters with central peaks have gravity anomalies except the Mendeleev crater (5.7 degrees N and 140.9 degrees E) whose central area contains significant gravity anomalies but no central peaks. The area of gravity anomaly may indicate heat source under the ground.

TI  - Tightening ecological management facilitates green development in the Qilian Mountains
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qilian Mountains Scientific Expedition was launched under the framework of the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition Program after tightening eco-environmental management in the Qilian Mountains. The expedition focused on three key areas: (1) Ecosystem diversity and security, (2) dynamic changes in glaciers and permafrost, and (3) changes in human activities and their corresponding eco-livelihood impacts.In this scientific expedition, a comprehensive investigation was conducted according to an integrated space-drone-ground-based field survey and a socioeconomic survey. More than 200 researchers participated in this expedition that lasted for 260 d and spanned 47500 km. First, investigations were performed for changes in human activities before and after tightening eco-environmental management in the Qilian Mountains. The local eco-environmental benefits and economic losses after the tightening eco-environmental management were analyzed by adopting the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model and the System of Integrated Environmental and Economic Accounting method. Additionally, the telecoupling values of the overall ecosystem services of the Qilian Mountains were estimated using an innovative method. Second, investigations were performed for several glaciers located in the Qilian Mountains to evaluate the characteristics of glacier distribution and variations in glacier changes. The glacier ice storage and annual degradation rate were further estimated using data derived from a glacier inventory and Landsat images. Moreover, the characteristics of permafrost distribution in the Qilian Mountains were comprehensively analyzed. Furthermore, an innovative method was developed to estimate ground ice storage and the annual water discharge rate from permafrost in the six river basins of the Qilian Mountains. Lastly, investigations were performed on changes in the forest line in a coupled forest and shrub ecosystem using a drone and field surveys. Further, the spatial and temporal grassland patterns and the associated productivity were analyzed. Moreover, dynamic changes in the five main lakes in the Qilian Mountains were assessed at different spatial and temporal scales, and the activities of the key rare species such as the snow leopard were monitored regularly using infrared cameras.The key findings of the Qilian Mountains Scientific Expedition were as follows: (1) The ecological service functions of the Qilian Mountains are promoted by tightening eco-environmental management; (2) the ecosystem of the Qilian Mountains is recovering under a warm and wet climate, and the population of rare species is expanding; however, localized overgrazing is causing grassland degradation in some areas; (3) the glacier loss rate is accelerating, and the contribution of glacial melt to river runoff is expected to exceed the critical point; (4) over the past 10 years, the meltwater from permafrost has been as high as 1.18 km(3)/a, which is equivalent to 10% of the annual runoff into the Qilian Mountain rivers; (5) the value of the overall ecosystem services in the Qilian Mountains has been estimated to be as high as 1067.6 (+/- 160.1) billion Yuan, which is much higher than the regional economic loss observed in 2017. It is suggested that the government should markedly increase ecological compensation to achieve a win-win situation for green development regarding ecological livelihood in the Qilian Mountains. The findings from this scientific expedition provide comprehensive datasets and decision-making support for the establishment and management of the Qilian Mountain National Park and the protection of the ecosystems of the Qilian Mountains. Such expeditions can provide scientific support for watershed management in states or regions located along the Silk Road Economic Belt.

TI  - An Object-Based River Extraction Method via Optimized Transductive Support Vector Machine for Multi-Spectral Remote-Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate extraction of rivers is closely related to agriculture, socio-economic, environment, and ecology. It helps us to pre-warn serious natural disasters such as floods, which leads to massive losses of life and property. With the development and popularization of remote-sensing and information technologies, a great number of river-extraction methods have been proposed. However, most of them are vulnerable to noise interference and perform inefficient in a big data environment. To address these problems, a river extraction method is proposed based on adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization (PSO) support vector machine (AMPSO-SVM). First, three features, the spectral information, normalized difference water index (NDWI), and spatial texture entropy, are considered in feature space construction. It makes the objects with the same spectrum more distinguishable, then the noise interference could be resisted effectively. Second, in order to address the problems of premature convergence and inefficient iteration, a mutation operator is introduced to the PSO algorithm. This processing makes transductive SVM obtain optimal parameters quickly and effectively. The experiments are conducted on GaoFen-1 multispectral remote-sensing images from Yellow River. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existed ones, including PCA, KNN, basic SVM, and PSO-SVM, in terms of overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient. Besides, the proposed method achieves convergence rate faster than the PSO-SVM method.

AB  - FPAR is one of the key climate parameters for the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS). An accurate assessment to FPAR is particularly important to understand the global climate change. In this paper, the FY-3C Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) data combined with the improved PROSAIL model and look-up table algorithm to retrieve the FPAR at the Hulunber Grassland. The cross-validation results show that FPAR retrieved from FY-3C data has good consistency with the FPAR products of MODIS, GEOV1 and GLASS, with 0.6654, 0.6893 and 0.6192 at overall Pearson's correlation coefficients (R), respectively. This study provides the potential for the generating the large-area and long-term sequence FPAR products from FengYun-3C (FY-3C) data.

AB  - People in mountainous regions are likely to settle on alluvial fans that are primarily composed of accumulated debris flow sediment. Despite their many agricultural benefits, these areas are also highly vulnerable to debris flow hazards. Dabaini catchment, in the Xiaojiang basin, Yunnan province, was chosen as a study area to monitor the long-term change of alluvial fans as well as the corresponding influencing factors. Landsat images of the area from 1987 to 2013 and an object-oriented classification method were used to interpret the debris flow fans in each of these years. Their evolution characteristics revealed that (1) the hazard area of debris flow fans has shrunk during the recent 30 years; (2) the debris flow alluvial fans in Dabaini are affected by the size of the debris flows; (3) less precipitation, sediment source, human activities and higher vegetation are the main factors that contribute to the changes of volume in the alluvial fan in recent years.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between three-dimensional urban built environment and urban surface temperature using LANDSAT 8 satellite image data in Seoul city. The image was divided into 600m×600m grid units as an unit of analysis. Due to the high level of spatial dependency in surface temperature, this study uses spatial statistics to take into account spatial auto-correlation. The spatial error model shows the best goodness of fit.The analysis results show that the three-dimensional built environment and transport environment as well as natural environment have statistically significant associations with surface temperature. First, natural environment variables such as green space, streams and river, and average elevation show statistically significant negative association with surface temperature. Second, the building area shows a positive association with surface temperature. In addition, while sky view factor (SVF) has a positive association with surface temperature, surface roughness (SR) shows a negative association with it. Third, transportation related variables such as road density, railway density, and traffic volume show positive associations with surface temperature. Moreover, this study finds that SVF and SR have different effects on surface temperature in regard to the levels of total floor areas in built environment. The results indicate that interactions between floor area ratio (FAR) and three-dimensional built environmental variables such as SVF and SR should be considered to reduce urban surface temperature.

AB  - ScanSAR images are widely used in both military and civil fields with the capability of wide swath. However, the scalloping effect seriously affects the quality of scanSAR images, especially in the complex scenes, e.g. the sea-land junction scene. This paper presents a modified Kalman-filter method for scalloping suppression. First, the scanSAR image model is built, considering the scalloping effect and noise. Then, Kalman filter is adopted for suppressing the scalloping effect. Moreover, pre-processing method, on the basis of image statistical characteristics, is implemented to accommodate complex scene. Specifically, the pre-processing, involving image segmentation and brightness filling, divides the image into sub-images with different brightness and provides linear-Gaussian condition for Kalman filter through brightness filling. Finally, the method is verified by GaoFen-3(GF-3) SAR images, with the discussion and conclusion.

AB  - In recent years, frequent droughts have caused serious harm to the sustainable development of agriculture and food security. Based on the wide range and real time data, remote sensing was widely employed in drought monitoring. Many researchers have proposed a series of drought monitoring methods based on MODIS data over the past few decades. The AquaCrop model was released by FAO, which is suitable for crop growth monitoring in arid area with its simple interface, less input parameters and good simulation effect. AquaCrop model was applied to the researches on climate change, irrigation strategy, planting management and so on. Many scholars have verified the efficiency of AquaCrop model in arid areas of China. Since AquaCrop model is driven by water, it is reasonable to use it to monitor and reflect the drought process. This study was based on Terra-MODIS data products and agro-meteorological data during the year of 2007-2008, 2008-2009, 2009-2010 and 2011-2012 of Winter Wheat growth periods in Henan Province. In this study, firstly, localizing the AquaCrop by the simulated and observed Canopy Cover (CC), Biomass (B), Yield (Y) and 0-50cm Soil Water Content (SWC). The values between observed and simulated have good consistency, with R-2=0.9289 of CC, R-2=0.9418 of B, R-2=0.8309 of SWC. Meanwhile, the simulation results of four growth stages of winter wheat show that the model has good applicability and stability in Henan Province. Secondly, calculating TVDI using MODIS data in the same time range. Finally, analyzing the correlation between the results of two models and observed soil water content in different depth of soil layers. Similarly, the simulation accuracy of two models are better with shallow soil moisture. MODIS TVDI has a highest correlation with 30cm soil water content (r=-0.344), while AquaCrop model with 10cm (r=0.819). The research can provide important reference for drought monitoring of winter wheat and it is helpful for effective agriculture drought monitoring and decision-making.

TI  - Solar reflection band site automatic calibration by the Dunhuang site automatic observation radiometric calibration operational system
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Solar reflection band of typical in-orbit payload was calibrated by the use of the Dunhuang site automatic observation radiometric calibration operational system (DARCOS) in 2018. Several automatic observation instruments were installed at Dunhuang site. DARCOS integrated product generation, acquisition, archiving, publishing, retrieval, downloading, user hierarchical management and performance monitoring functions together. Automatic calibration algorithm for AQUA\MODIS, JPSS1\VIIRS, FY2G\VISSR, FY3C\VIRR and FY4A\AGRI were developed. How to accurately measure the surface reflectance without human intervention and correct it to the payload viewing angle is an important subject needs to be solved. A surface reflectance algorithm based on surface radiance and total sky radiation was developed. The directionality calibration was performed using the micro-facet cosine linear kernel-driven (MICOKE) BRDF model. The reflectance was corrected by the site vicarious calibration campaign on August 7-9, 2018. The site correction factor exhibits two variations rules with increasing wavelength, which corresponds to the HIM detector design. The calibration results for 5 payloads between August 13 and December 31, 2018 were analyzed. Ratio of the apparent reflectance from space and ground base was used to judging the agreement. AQUA\MODIS (1.02-1.15), JPSS1\VIIRS (1.07-1.15), and FY3C\VIRR(1.10 to 1.19) are in good agreement with the automatic observation products of the site. FY2G\VISSR (1.25) and FY4A\AGRI (1.07-1.31) show differences changing by time. As an efficient independent calibration method, automatic calibration could be an effective supplement to the in-orbit calibration.

AB  - This paper debates the performance of the HARMONY (STEREOID) ESA EE-10 candidate mission in measuring the two-dimensional (2D) terrain deformation. Thanks to its Stereo configuration, where the two passive spacecrafts span a large along-track baseline centered on the Sentinel-1 satellite, a large observation angle diversity in azimuth can be achieved. This theoretically leads to promising deformation performance in the north-south direction component, which will play an extremely important role for the surface displacement analysis in the future

TI  - Monitoring the Interannual Spatiotemporal Changes in the Land Surface Thermal Environment in Both Urban and Rural Regions from 2003 to 2013 in China Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal environment is closely related to human well-being. Diurnal and seasonal variations in surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have been extensively studied. Nevertheless, interannual changes in SUHIs as well as in land surface temperatures (LSTs) in cities and their corresponding villages remain poorly understood, particularly using data from several continuous years to analyse change rates and corresponding significance levels. Using Aqua/Terra moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2003-2013, we explored not only the interannual changes in annual and seasonal mean LSTs in rural and urban regions which were identified based on modified criteria, but also the SUHI intensities (SUHIIs) for these cities. The results showed that most of LSTs and SUHIIs did not change significantly (p0.05). Their changes exhibited clear spatiotemporal agglomeration and variation laws. The rural region LST change rates, which exhibited significant changes, were generally highest in the summer, with most of values of 0.1-0.5 degrees C (yr(-1)) during the daytime across China, except for the Xinjiang autonomous regions, and 0.1-0.2 degrees C (yr(-1)) during the night-time. The rates were lowest in the winter, with most of values of -0.4 to -0.1 degrees C (yr(-1)). The rates of daytime SUHIIs with significant changes were generally highest in the summer, with most of values of 0.1-0.3 degrees C (yr(-1)), and lowest in the winter, even with most of values of -0.4 to -0.1 degrees C (yr(-1)) in northern central China. During the night-time, most of rates were 0.0-0.1 degrees C (yr(-1)). In China, most of the changes in the surface thermal environment were harmful to humans at both large national and local urban scales. The changes could lower thermal comfort levels, harm human health, affect human reproduction rates and lives, and increase the energy consumed for refrigeration or heating, thereby increase emissions of greenhouse gases.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In some remote sensing applications such as change detection, satellite images with both high spatial and high temporal resolution are required. However, no single satellite sensor can currently provide such images due to technical specifications. To solve this problem, spatio-temporal fusion provides a cost-effective solution. In this paper, we propose a new spatio-temporal fusion approach, based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for Landsat and MODIS image fusion. Specifically, the proposed approach utilizes CNNs to model the heterogeneity of fine pixels from the coarse MODIS images. Here, the heterogeneity of fine pixels is defined as the difference between the reflectance changes obtained from the two types of images. After that, two transition-predicted images can be obtained using the trained CNNs, which are then fused in order to obtain a final prediction. In our newly proposed approach, CNNs are only used to learn the heterogeneity of fine pixels rather than the whole images, thus providing a more stable and less time-consuming strategy as compared to other available approaches. We evaluated the proposed approach on a public spatio-temporal fusion dataset and the obtained results suggest that our newly developed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Temporal Attention Networks for Multitemporal Multisensor Crop Classification
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification based on multitemporal multisensor remote sensing imagery has a great significance. As more and more Earth observation satellites are launched, it becomes easier to obtain increasingly dense multitemporal data, and the category patterns hidden in multitemporal data can be more and more finely mined and expressed. However, the traditional classification methods treat the features of different temporal periods consistently, so the classification performances are not well enough, especially for the categories with subtle phenological differences. In this paper, we propose a temporal-attention CNN-GRU (Convolutional Neural Networks and Gated Recurrent Unit Networks) approach to distinguish subtle crop differences, and the temporal attention mechanism introduced in the model can achieve the effect of enhancing phenological differences and suppressing phenological similarity. Firstly, we use the GRU networks to model the temporal correlation of the multitemporal data. And then, the temporal attention layer utilize a query module to retrieve "what is the important information" over the whole temporal sequence, so we can obtain the attention weights for each temporal period. In the experiments, multitemporal samples are collected from Sentinel-2A/B and Landsat-8. Due to the different spatial resolutions of multiband images, transposed convolution which can extract the raw spatial structure information is used for multiband features fusion. Experimental results on multitemporal data show that the proposed approach achieve the best performance compared with conventional methods, especially for the categories with similar phenological laws.

TI  - Evaluation of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A Aerosol Optical Depth Retrievals across Chinese Cities and Implications for Medium Spatial Resolution Urban Aerosol Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In urban environments, aerosol distributions may change rapidly due to building and transport infrastructure and human population density variations. The recent availability of medium resolution Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data provide the opportunity for aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimation at higher spatial resolution than provided by other satellites. AOD retrieved from 30 m Landsat-8 and 10 m Sentinel-2A data using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) were compared with coincident ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 AOD data for 20 Chinese cities in 2016. Stringent selection criteria were used to select contemporaneous data; only satellite and AERONET data acquired within 10 min were considered. The average satellite retrieved AOD over a 1470 m x 1470 m window centered on each AERONET site was derived to capture fine scale urban AOD variations. AERONET Level 1.5 (cloud-screened) and Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and also quality assured) data were considered. For the 20 urban AERONET sites in 2016 there were 106 (Level 1.5) and 67 (Level 2.0) Landsat-8 AERONET AOD contemporaneous data pairs, and 118 (Level 1.5) and 89 (Level 2.0) Sentinel-2A AOD data pairs. The greatest AOD values (>1.5) occurred in Beijing, suggesting that the Chinese capital was one of the most polluted cities in China in 2016. The LaSRC Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A AOD retrievals agreed well with the AERONET AOD data (linear regression slopes > 0.96; coefficient of determination r(2) > 0.90; root mean square deviation < 0.175) and demonstrate that the LaSRC is an effective and applicable medium resolution AOD retrieval algorithm over urban environments. The Sentinel-2A AOD retrievals had better accuracy than the Landsat-8 AOD retrievals, which is consistent with previously published research. The implications of the research and the potential for urban aerosol monitoring by combining the freely available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite data are discussed.

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Topography determines the nature of hydrodynamic processes and its changes potentially affect the water quantity and quality. This study assessed the spatiotemporal impacts of topography changes on hydrological and hydrodynamic characteristics of China's largest freshwater lake, Poyang Lake. Results from simulation of different channel erosion intensities indicated that topography changes induced hydrological and hydrodynamic variations with spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Water levels in the lake decreased and the effect was enhanced with stronger erosion intensities. The decrease in water level was significant during the dry period, but negligible during the wet period. Water levels decreased by an average of 0.90-1.1 m in the northern channel during the dry period, and 0.27 m and 0.20 m in the central and eastern lakes during the rising and recession periods. The changing water level further affected the distribution of water with the effect of gathering water to the channel from nearby areas. Moreover, channel erosion altered the lake-river interactions. During the dry period, outflow discharges increased as the channel conveyance capacity increased by 25-136%. In contrast, during the wet period, outflow discharges decreased as the inflow regulation volume increased by 3.8-8.2 x 10(8) m(3). Particularly, backflow frequency and volume increased during the flooding period of the Yangtze River. In addition, the dry period in Poyang Lake was extended, and the frequency of low-water events increased significantly. This study demonstrated the spatiotemporal impacts of topographical changes on hydrodynamic processes in Poyang Lake, therefore providing a better understanding of variations in water regimes and lake-river interactions.

AB  - A novel imaging algorithm is presented in this paper for focusing the very-high resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data of spotlight mode. First, the first step of two-steps processing approach (TSPA) is used to get a high azimuth sampling rate which is higher than PRF for the raw data. Then, the "fast-time" effect of stop-and-go approximation is corrected in 2-D frequency domain. Finally, the backprojection algorithm (BPA) is used to correct the error introduced by the curved orbit and the "slow-time" effect of stopand-go approximation. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method has good performance. The spaceborne SAR data acquired by Gaofen-3 SAR systems demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.

AB  - Surface water has been monitored by using remote sensing techniques for decades. Nevertheless, remotely sensed images inevitably compromise temporal and spatial resolution, which limits the urgent application in sudden flooding response. Images with a high spatial resolution cannot be acquired and processed frequently to monitor the fast-evolving flood events that could change dramatically within a few days. To address such a challenge, this paper presents a method to un-mix surface water from MODIS derived water indices, which could be generated daily. First, before flooding, the water indices are calculated from satellite sensed reflectance, and water fraction is calculated from classified Landsat images. Second, the relationship between water fraction and water indices is learned by using a regression tree ensemble method. Third, after flooding, water indices are obtained from the new MODIS images, and water fraction is retrieved by applying the learned regression tree ensemble. By spatially un-mixing coarse but daily accessible surface water observations, this proposed method facilitates near-real-time emergency responses to flooding and inundation monitoring.

AB  - Drought is one of the most serious natural disasters. In this study, based on NOAA/AVHRR meteorological satellite data from 1981 to 2015, the spatial and temporal characteristics of spring drought in China were analyzed by using vegetation status index (VCI) as drought monitoring index, frequency analysis, trend rate analysis, anomaly index analysis and Mann-Kendall mutation test. The results show that China is a high-incidence area of spring drought, but most of the areas are mainly light and moderate drought. The heavy drought areas are concentrated in southern Tibet, Sichuan Basin, Tarim Basin and the surrounding areas of Qaidam Basin. The frequency of drought is obviously different in different regions. The frequency of spring drought is relatively high in the northern and southern regions which are greatly affected by monsoon. The frequency of spring drought is relatively low in the northwest and Qinghai-Tibet regions which are less affected by monsoon, except in Xinjiang, northern Inner Mongolia and southern Tibet. During 1981 - 2015, the spring VCI in all parts of China showed an overall upward trend, that is, drought in most regions tended to ease. Moreover, the trend was a wavelike increasing trend rather than a one-way change and could be divided into 4 phases: 1) a slow increasing phase from 1981-1990, 2) an intensive fluctuating phase from 1991-2000, 3) a steady increasing phase from 2001-2010, and 4) a slow decreasing phase alter 2010. Mann-Kendall analysis further suggested that the VCI sequence of the Spring Festival in China was on the rise, and the changes in the south, northwest and Qinghai-Tibet regions reached significant levels. The time point of mutation in the South was 2000, and that in the northwest and Qinghai-Tibet regions was 1992.

TI  - Spatio-temporal pattern of <i>Potamogeton crispus</i> L. in Lake Dongping based on <i>NDVI</i> time series
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Dongping is the second largest freshwater lake in Shandong Province. It is also an important junction on the east route of south to north water transfer project and on the route of the west to east water transfer. However, Potamogeton, crispus L. community's expansion has caused a series of ecological issues, including the waterway blocking and a large number of fish death. In order to maintain the ecological environment security in Lake Dongping, there is an urgent need to understand the spatial and temporal characteristic and the inducements of P. crispus community's expansion. We employed moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data and the field investigation to extract the phenological characteristic curve of P. crispus. According to the P. crispus growth characteristics, the Landsat images at P. crispus flowering phase and decline phase in eight different years during 1985 and 2017 were used to extract and analyze the P. crispus distribution characteristics. The results showed that P. crispus community expanded continuously in the past 32 years. Its habitat changed from the scattered distribution in near shore in 1991 to the continuous distribution in whole lake in 2013. The period of P. crispus community growth was divided into three stages. Before 1996, it is a slow growth, with 10.34 km(2). During 1996-2001, it was an explosive growth feature and P. crispus has become the dominant species in Lake Dongping. During 2001-2017, the area continues to increase to 49.07 km(2) in 2017, accounting for 40% of the water area of Lake Dongping. Spearman rank correlation analysis showed that there was a significant correlation between P. crispus area and lake eutrophication level. Although with the opening of east route of south to north water transfer project and increased management for Lake Dongping, P. crispus community still shows continuous growth and the ecological risk caused by P. crispus is still not solved. The managers should pay more attention to this issue.

TI  - An algorithm based on differential evolution for satellite data transmission scheduling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data transmission task scheduling is one of the important problems in satellite communication. It can be considered as a combinatorial optimisation problem among satellite data transmission demand, visible time window and ground station resource, which is a NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a satellite data transmission task scheduling algorithm which searches for an optimised solution based on differential evolution algorithm framework. In its progress of evolution, the individual's evaluating procedure is improved by a modified 0/1 knapsack-based method. Extensive experiments are conducted to examine the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheduling algorithm. Experimental results show that the scheduling results generated from the algorithm satisfy scheduling constraints and are consistent with the expectation.

AB  - Drought has an important impact to agriculture, and its monitoring is very necessary for many regions subjected to drought in Shandong province. Gaomi city of Shandong was chosen as a study area to probe remote sensing monitoring method of drought. Landsat8 satellite data and soil volumetric moisture content data from filed investigation were used. Temperature- vegetation method was adopted to monitor drought in the study area. The results showed that land surface temperature was negatively related to NDVI. Temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) had a significant correlation with soil water content. TVDI can reflect the drought in the study. It suggests that TVDI can be used as a effective index to monitor drought in the study area.

AB  - Accurate and effective modeling of grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is an important basic task in monitoring and management of grassland and livestock interaction in pastoral areas. In this study, three machine learning methods, multi-layer perceptron network (MLP), support vector regression, and random forest regression (RF) are assessed for modeling the grassland AGB in the southern region, Qinghai Province, China. The results show that: 1) among the three methods, the MLP model performs the worst, with R-2 and RMSE of 0.38 and 768.74 kg DW/ha, respectively for the test data, and of 0.34 and 745.06 kg DW/ha for the training dataset; 2) the RF model performs the best, with R2 and RMSE of 0.76 and 473.20 kg DW/ha, respectively for the test data, and of 0.95 and 208.88 kg DW/ha for the training dataset. This performance is similar to the best back propagation ANN model previously reported (0.66 and 556.57 kg DW/ha for test data, 0.85 and 355.04 kg DW/ha for training data, and 0.68 and 537.09 kg DW/ha for validation). The RF model is easy to apply in practice and is a robust tool for modeling grassland biomass based on DEM and remote sensing data.

M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-3, the first polarimetric SAR satellite of China, carried out polarimetric calibration experiments using C-band polarimetric active radar calibrators (PARCs), trihedral corner reflectors (TCRs), and dihedral corner reflectors (DCRs). The calibration data were firstly processed referring to the classic 2 x 2 receive R and transmit T model for radar polarimeter systems, first proposed by Zebker, Zyl, and Held, and Freeman's method based on PARCs, but the results were not good enough. After detailed analysis about the GaoFen-3 polarimetric system, we found that the system had some nonlinearity, then a new imbalance parameter was introduced to the classic model, which is equivalent to the g proposed in Freeman's paper about a general polarimetric system model. Then, we proposed the calibration data processing algorithm for GaoFen-3 based on the improved model and obtained better results. The algorithm proposed here is verified to be suitable for GaoFen-3 and can be applied to other spaceborne and airborne fully-polarimetric SAR systems.

AB  - In this study, Sentinel-2 and VEN mu S remote sensing data were combined to estimate corn biomass based on a simple light use efficiency method. The RMSE between the measured dry aboveground biomass and estimated dry aboveground biomass is 112.36 g/m(2). The estimates show good agreements with the measured biomass, indicating that the effective light use efficiency (ELUE) can be effectively estimated using maximal fAPAR throughout the growing season.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a key role for energy transfer and water circulation in the biosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and atmosphere. In present study, spatially complete ET over the Heihe river basin, Northwest of China, was estimated from the synergistic use of MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and CLDAS (China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation) gridded meteorological data from June 1 to September 15 in 2012. For the estimation of ET over clear-sky pixels, a pixel-to-pixel pattern of land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation index (VI) feature space was developed where meteorological data were used to determine the dry and wet edges for each pixel; whereas the traditional Penman-Monteith equation was implemented to obtain ET over clouds pixels. Finally, ground ET measurements collected at two sites (corn and orchard) were used to evaluate the estimated results, root mean square error (RMSE) of 77.2W/m(2) and 74.9W/m(2) can be obtained for the two sites, respectively, indicating that spatially complete ET can be derived from currently available satellite images and meteorological data.

AB  - The spatio-temporal pattern of cultivated land and its changes are of great significance in the study of ecology, geography and agronomy. In this study, long time series remote sensing information is used to monitor the spatio-temporal pattern and phenological characteristics of cultivated land on Chongming Eco-island, Shanghai, China. Based on MODIS-NDVI products (2012-2018), NDVI expectations curves of Chongming Eco-Island are established. It is demonstrated that the negative peaks of NDVI expectation curve in June become less noticeable after 2016. After that, NDVI image difference is performed between the time points at the positive peaks and negative peaks. The results indicate that the reason for the NDVI pattern changes these years may be related to the policy that wheat reduction and green manure enhancement implemented in Chongming Eco-island. Therefore, crops are diversified, and the phenological period of crops on the island is no longer sheer two cropping per year. This study is helpful to the ecological structure adjustment of Chongming Eco-island and the scientific management of cultivated land.

The algorithm is based on a stochastic detection model that aims to minimize a cost function derived from the probability density functions of the fire and background pixels. Using MODIS active fire product as the reference data, the optimal threshold was derived and the omission and commission errors were found to be 0.66 and 0.16, respectively.

T2  - GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS & RISK
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess which data type is more effective for spatial modeling in the Republic of Korea, we conducted geostatistical analysis based on frequency, intensity, and spatial autocorrelation using two types of forest fire occurrence data: that collected through field survey of the Korea Forest Service (KFS) and satellite active fire data of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model was used with environmental factors in the spatial modeling of fire probability to compare the accuracy of the two data types based on 10 years of historical data. The results showed a clear difference in fire frequency and similar fire intensity patterns. The spatial autocorrelation between the fire frequency and intensity of the two data types was analyzed using a semi-variogram. Fire intensity was significantly correlated, with the MODIS data having a higher correlation than the KFS data. Examination of the spatial autocorrelation and related factors by fire source also indicated that MODIS data had higher spatial autocorrelation, with remarkable distinction found in climate factors. In spatial the modeling, MODIS data showed a similar outcome to that of hotspot analysis, with higher accuracy and better model performance attributable to high spatial autocorrelation. Even though the KFS data were collected from post-fire surveys, they resulted in low spatial autocorrelation and reduced model accuracy owing to the wide distribution of data. MODIS had many detection errors. With spatial filtering, however, the model accuracy can be improved with relatively high spatial autocorrelation.

AB  - Since accrual accounting system was successfully adopted in New Zealand government, many countries' governments have introduced accrual accounting system. The South Korean government has also prepared to introduce accrual basis accounting system since Asian financial crisis in 1997. Then the Government Accounting Law was enacted in 2007 and come into effect in January 1st, 2009. And the financial statement was submitted to the Board of Audit and Inspection and the National Assembly since FY 2011. This study aims to analyze the accrual accounting system of South Korean government on the indigenization and suggests policy reform for the accrual accounting system. The indigenization of accrual accounting system has two characteristics in South Korean government. One is path dependence and the other is path creation. The characteristics of path dependence can be seen from the continuance of the receipt and expenditure accounts and examination of receipt and expenditure accounts. And the characteristics of path creation can be seen from the making of financial statements and examination of financial statements. This study suggested that for the accrual accounting system to be indigenous to South Korean government, the actual operation of the accrual accounting system should be carried out in a appropriate manner to the context of the South Korean government while implementing the basic values of the system.

AB  - The study investigates the different impacts of the typhoon disaster report frame (episodic focus vs fact focus) on discrete negative emotions(fear/worry/sadness/anger) and risk perception. Also the mediating effects of negative emotions and risk perception were examined in the process of revealing the relationship between the types of typhoon disaster reporting and behavioral intentions, and whether the mediating effects of negative emotions and risk perception are controlled by cultural worldviews (hierarchist/individualist/egalitarian/fatalist). Participants in the experiment (N=320) were divided into two groups. As a results, the occurrence of sadness, anger, and risk perception in the episodic frame group was significantly higher than that of the fact frame group. The reporting frame had a positive effect indirectly on the preventive behavioral intention through the sadness, and had a positive influence indirectly on the avoidance behavioral intention through anger. In addition, the reporting frame indirectly influenced the precautionary intention through risk perception. Individualist in the four cultural worldviews moderated the mediating effect of sadness. This study examined the differential effects of discrete emotions, such as sadness and anger, in the process of framing affecting risk behavioral intentions. This means that the framing effect of disaster news is extended to the emotional response as well as the cognitive dimension of the people. In addition, it is meaningful to prove that the cultural worldview acts as a moderating variable in the process of the framing effect of disaster news.

AB  - A series of hyperspectral and chlorophyll experiments was conducted to gather WorldView multispectral data and derive an estimation model of chlorophyll concentration (CHLS) oftree leaves. The multispectral effective chlorophyll indicators (MECL, and MECL) derivedfrom the reflectance ofRed, Red edge andBlue or Coastal bands ofthe WorldView data appeared to be able to achieve an estimation with around 38% ofPRAISE, which is almost 4 times greater than the value of the measure (1-R2) of the CHLS-MECI models. Such uncertainty in tree leaves chlorophyll estimation was duplicated in both multiple regression models determined by ordinary least squares method and ridge method using the spectral signal of Yellow, Red, and Red edge bands. In contrast, a ridge regression model using the reflectance of both NIR bands, the normalized difference vegetation index of Yellow and Red bands (NDVIYR) as well as Red edge and Yellow bands (NDVIREY) was able to reduce the uncertainty of CHLS estimation significantly. In summary, the ridge model was able to increase estimation accuracy to a level of RMSE=0.35 mg/g and PRMSE=22%. The major strength of the ridge model was observed in a reduction ofthe estimation error offresh leaves by 65% of the PRAISE of the CHLSMECI models. However, there was no improvement observed to the CHLS estimation of water-stressed leaves.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors have been in operations for more than 19 and 17 years (thus 36 combined years) as part of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) on the Terra platform that was launched in December 1999 and on the Aqua platform that was launched in May 2002, respectively. Accurate geolocation is a critical element needed for accurate retrieval of global biogeophysical parameters. In this paper, we describe the latest trends in the continuously improved MODIS geolocation accuracy in Collection-5 (C5), C6 and C6.1 re-processing and forward-processing data streams. We improved geolocation accuracy in the re-processed data and corrected for geolocation biases found in forward-processed data, including those caused by operations such as the stop-go-stop status of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) instrument on the Aqua platform. We discuss scan-to-scan underlaps near nadir over the equator regions that was discovered in checking the non-underlapping requirement in the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) based on trending parameters from the actual Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite orbit. The underlaps are closely tied to instrument effective focal length that is measured from on-orbit data using a technique we recently developed. We also discuss potential improvements for the upcoming C7 re-processing.

TI  - A methodology for quantitative analysis of hydrated minerals on Mars with large endmember library using CRISM near-infrared data
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrated minerals are good indicators of aqueous environments on Mars. Accurate mineral species identification and quantitative estimation of their abundance is very important for understanding past and present geologic and climatic processes of Mars. We present a novel methodology to analyze hydrated minerals using the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) data. The methodology is driven by a sparse unmixing model, which can select the optimal subset of signatures from a large endmember library to best model mixed spectra. Laboratory measured spectra of minerals and rocks, scene-derived spectra of common components such as dust and synthetic flat and pure slope spectra are used to populate an endmember library. CRISM and the endmember library reflectance spectra are converted to single-scattering albedo with the Hapke radiative transfer model. The single-scattering albedos of the CRISM and endmember library spectra are then L-1 normalized to eliminate the effects of the different measurement conditions between laboratory and orbital data. The sparse unmixing algorithm is finally applied to CRISM normalized single-scattering albedo data using the spectral library. Mineral identification and quantitative analysis are accomplished at the same time. The methodology shows good performance in synthetic and laboratory mineral mixture suites. Examples of six CRISM targeted mode images in three locations (Nili Fossae, Northeast Syrtis Major and Kashira crater), which have been previously thoroughly studied, were analyzed in detail in this study. In comparison with previous studies, our methodology identifies the mineral deposits detected through more manually intensive methods by expert analysts while simultaneously determining the mineral abundances. Furthermore, this new method provides an objective pathway to the determination of mineral presence from a large library of potential options. As an example of unexpected results, we detected putative serpentine in the Nili Fossae images for the first time. Even though the typical diagnostic spectral features used to identify minerals directly from CRISM data are obscured due to the mixing among mineral phases, T-test analyses of serpentine abundance provide critical statistical proof of its presence. Overall, the methodology we present works well for hydrated mineral detection with CRISM data and could provide a rigorous, objective method to map mineralogy in planetary hyperspectral remotely sensed data.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel ship detection method for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images via graph-based sparse manifold ranking. The main framework comprises a coarse-to-fine scheme. We employ the image intensity for prescreening and introduce graph-based sparse manifold ranking (GSMR) for discrimination. The distance between the ship and clutter in sparse code domain is explored. And the image elements in candidate region are ranked based on the prescreening priors and the new distance in graph labeling framework. The final detection result is produced with the ranking procedure. Experiments performed on two RADARSAT-2 images demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

T2  - OPEN GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lithological mapping in weathered and vegetated coastal zone is always a crucial but challenging issue for geological remote sensing. This study tested the applicability of Sentinel-2A and ASTER GDEM data for lithological mapping in the coastal zone of Shanwei district, southern China. Here, a comprehensive scheme for tuff and granite outcrops extraction and lithological classification was employed to process the remote sensing data: 1) Using the matched filtering with image-derived spectra as references, the weathered but representative outcroprelated patches were preliminarily extracted based on the fractal "DN-A" (digital number-area) algorithm; 2) The image masks of NDXI (NDVI, NDSI and MNDWI) in conjunction with spatial intersection, were conducted to minimize the influence of vegetation coverage; 3) Considering terrain features caused by differential weathering, slope analysis have allowed us to discriminate from tuff to granite outcrops; 4) A set of empirical verification criteria were established to assess the classification accuracy, which are exactly 82.4 similar to 83.2% of tuff and 91.3 similar to 92.3% of granite. The peak values of tuff and granite patch areas are 0-0.1 km(2) (51%) and 0-0.5 km(2) (60%), and 90% of patches are < 0.6 km(2) of tuff and < 3.5 km(2) of granite, respectively. The protolith of extracted weathered outcrops were further identified by several excavated trenches. This research has contributed a useful case study for remote-sensing lithological mapping in weathered and vegetated coastal zone, and the proposed approach should have a great possibility to be extrapolated for other similar cases.

In order to lit the fine temporal resolution requirement, satellites are required to have a high revisit cycle. MODIS is an ideal platform for monitoring the ground thanks to its daily coverage while the spatial resolution is too coarse. Research has demonstrated the possibility to improve the spatial resolution of MODIS using the Landsat 8 images. This research is aimed to establish a workflow to adapt the data fusion algorithm to achieve automatically processing at real-time in order to support short-term decision making.

M3  - Article
AB  - The remote-sensing based Flood Crop Loss Assessment Service System (RF-CLASS) is a web service based system developed and managed by the Center for Spatial Information Science and Systems (CSISS). The system uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based flood data, which was implemented by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO), to provide an estimation of crop loss from floods. However, due to the spectral similarity between water and shadow, a noticeable amount of false classification of shadow can be found in the DFO flood products. Traditional methods can be utilized to remove cloud shadow and part of mountain shadow. This paper aims to develop an algorithm to filter out noise from permanent mountain shadow in the flood layer. The result indicates that mountain shadow was significantly removed by using the proposed approach. In addition, the gold standard test indicated a small number of actual water surfaces were misidentified by the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, experiments also suggest that increasing the spatial resolution of the slope helped reduce more noise in mountains. The proposed algorithm achieved acceptable overall accuracy (>80%) in all different filters and higher overall accuracies were observed when using lower slope filters. This research is one of the very first discussions on identifying false flood classification from terrain shadow by using the highly efficient method.

AB  - It is a fast and effective method to evaluate the ecological environment of mining area using remote sensing technology. In this paper, Landsat series data from 1992 to 2017 were used to monitor the change of ecological environment of Zijin Mine, located in the west of Fujian province, China. After radiometric calibration, the normalized difference vegetation indexes (NDVI) of Landsat TM or OLI from 1992 to 2017 were calculated. Based on NDVI data, the change of vegetation coverage of environment around Zijin mountain gold-copper deposit was analyzed. The results indicated that: ( 1) The area of Zijin mountain gold-copper deposit was increasing from 1992-2017. During 1996-2001, the area of mine was increasing rapidly because of large-scale blasting for removing loading strata in 1997, and it became obviously larger from 2014-2017 due to the copper price increases. (2)the NDVI around Zijin mountain raised from 1992 to 2014, indicating a better vegetation recovery, but it reduced from 2014 to 2017, indicating a worse vegetation recovery. low NDVI mainly exist in the middle of Zijin deposit, which is relate to mining activities. These results can give some scientific references for assessment of Zijin gold-copper deposit ecological environment.

AB  - Being different from the traditional analysis of urban expansion in Shanghai from the perspective of humanities or urban geography, this study applies the Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System (GIS) spatial information technologies to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics and evolution of urban land expansion in Shanghai's urbanization process. It provides a basis for further research on the mechanism of urbanization process. In this study, we processed and analyzed the multi-temporal remote sensing images (Landsat series) in Shanghai from 1995 to 2016. A multidimensional feature space was constructed. Then the image classification was carried out by the support vector machine (SVM). On the basis of classification results, the central city zone was extracted by method of regional connectivity. After analyzing the change of area, center of gravity, location and spatial distribution of the central city zone, the spatial layout and trend of urban expansion are obtained. Finally, the driving force of urban expansion in Shanghai is analyzed. The analysis results accurately reflect the process of Shanghai's urban expansion.

AB  - Time series change detection is an effective way of analyzing land use and land cover change (LULCC). However, producing accurate LULCC map is still challenging because of amplified false detections and high omission errors. Here, we proposed a new change detection method to reduce false detections while maintaining low omission errors. First, the time series is decomposed into three components in the temporal scale which is seasonal, linear trend and noise. The potential LULCC are detected in the seasonal component to keep a low omission rate. Second, the false alarm rate is reduced by combining the breakpoint information of all the spectral bands and the post-classification result. Finally, the information of neighboring pixels is utilized to reduce false alarm further. With Kansas City as the study sites, the results demonstrated the effectiveness and stability of the proposed approach. Our results will show the timing and location of LULCC for qualitative analysis. The results will also show that false detections are reduced significantly without compromising omission rate for quantitative analysis.

CP  - IEEE Global Communications Conference (IEEE GLOBECOM)
CL  - Waikoloa, HI
AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel zero-forcing (ZF)based beamforming (BF) scheme for a wireless powered cognitive satellite-terrestrial network (CSTN) operated in the millimeter wave band. Assuming that the satellite and base station are equipped with multiple antennas, we aim at maximizing the sum rate of the CSTN while satisfying the signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio requirements for both the information receivers (IRs) and earth stations, the energy harvesting requirements of the energy receivers (ERs), and the secrecy constraints at the ERs. Since the resulting optimization problem is mathematically intractable, we propose a novel multi-beam-based ZF BF scheme to generate beamforming vectors to serve the IRs and ERs. Specifically, the original nonconvex problem is decomposed into two independent subproblems. The first subproblem, which features beam orthogonality constraints, leads to closed form solutions for the beamforming vectors. The second subproblem, aiming at finding the optimal power allocation, is solved via the S-procedure. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results.

TI  - Canadian Prairie Rangeland and Seeded Forage Classification Using Multiseason Landsat 8 and Summer RADARSAT-2
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland and seeded forage in Canada's Prairie provinces represent productive landscapes that provide multiple ecosystem services. Past efforts to map these resources at regional scales have not achieved consistently high accuracies as they are spatially variable in both ecology and management. In particular, Agriculture and Agri-food Canada needs to distinguish these land use classes from each other and from cropland in its annual national agricultural land cover inventory. Given the potential to distinguish these classes based on seasonal phenological differences, this study used multi-season Landsat 8 top-of-atmosphere reflectance data and derived vegetation and phenological indices, as well as mid-summer RADARSAT-2 data in random forest classification of two ecoregions in Alberta and Manitoba. Classification accuracy was compared for single and multi-date Landsat 8 variables, the vegetation index and phenological variable groups, RADARSAT-2 W and VH backscatter intensity, and combined datasets. Variable importance analysis showed that spring Landsat 8 reflectance generally contributed most to class discrimination, but accuracy improved with the addition of Landsat 8 data from the other seasons. Vegetation indices and phenological variables produced similar accuracies and were deemed to not warrant the additional processing effort to derive them. RADARSAT-2 VH backscatter was the most important variable for the Manitoba study area which is wetter with more vegetation structure variability than the Alberta study area. Backscatter intensity significantly increased overall accuracy when it was combined with one or two-season Landsat 8 data. The best overall accuracy was achieved using the three seasons of Landsat 8 and mid-summer RADARSAT-2 data, but it was not significantly better than that for two season Landsat 8 + RADARSAT-2. The methods presented in this paper provide a process for accurate and efficient classification of seeded forage, rangeland and cropland that can be applied over large areas in operational agricultural land cover inventory.

TI  - Are disturbance separation distances derived from single species applicable to mixed-species shorebird flocks?
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context. Human disturbance threatens many bird species worldwide. Flight-initiation distances (FIDs) offer a scientific basis for separation distances between fauna and agents of disturbance, such as people. However, most available FIDs are from single-species groups. Multi-species flocks have received scant attention with regard to their FIDs; yet, they are extremely common in nature. Aim. To examine suitable separation distances for mixed-species shorebird flocks by comparing single-species FIDs with those of the same species in mixed-species flocks. Method. We examined FIDs in mixed- and single-species flocks of four shorebirds (double-banded plover, Charadrius bicinctus, red-capped plover, Charadrius ruficapillus, red-necked stint, Calidris ruficollis, and curlew sandpiper, Calidris ferruginea). FIDs were collected in comparable habitat and sites with similar (i.e. highly restricted) regimes of human occurrence. Results. FIDs of single-species flocks of these species differed in their FID to an approaching walker. Different species permutations in mixed-species flocks resulted in different FIDs. FIDs of mixed-species flocks were lower than or the same as the FIDs of single-species groups of constituent species. Conclusions and implications. In our study system, separation distances (e.g. buffers; zones that exclude humans to reduce shorebird disturbance) based on FIDs of single species also would be efficacious for mixed-species flocks containing those species.

AB  - The increase in the urban population and number of severe weather extremes (including excessive heat) potentially linked to climate change has highlighted the demand of research into assessment and risk mitigation solutions. One of the naturally-based solutions for urban heat stress risk is to enhance the effectiveness of urban greenspaces to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization and its consequence of urban heat island effect in a sustainable way. The focus of this paper is to investigate the urban greenspaces' features in urban area of Taipei by using high-resolution bands of Sentinel 2 images, which are freely accessible. We present a composite index aggregating four factors including proximity to urban greenspaces, land surface temperature, population density, and land cover to identity patterns of heat stress risk. Results show that urban greenspaces derived from Sentinel 2 images achieved high accuracy with Kappa coefficient of 0.98 and overall accuracy of 99%. Analysis results of heat stress risk indicate that the level of risk is closely correlated with the accessibility to urban greenspaces. It is advised that Taipei City Government and decision makers should take serious measures to enhance the greenness of the environment and effectiveness of urban greenspaces for the benefits of citizens' health and well-beings. Also, it is indicated that Sentinel 2 data are well suitable for not only visualizing the urban greenspaces, but also offering the guidance for landscape planning and management at city scale.

TI  - Clouds Classification from Sentinel-2 Imagery with Deep Residual Learning and Semantic Image Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting changes in land use and land cover (LULC) from space has long been the main goal of satellite remote sensing (RS), yet the existing and available algorithms for cloud classification are not reliable enough to attain this goal in an automated fashion. Clouds are very strong optical signals that dominate the results of change detection if they are not removed completely from imagery. As various architectures of deep learning (DL) have been proposed and advanced quickly, their potential in perceptual tasks has been widely accepted and successfully applied to many fields. A comprehensive survey of DL in RS has been reviewed, and the RS community has been suggested to be leading researchers in DL. Based on deep residual learning, semantic image segmentation, and the concept of atrous convolution, we propose a new DL architecture, named CloudNet, with an enhanced capability of feature extraction for classifying cloud and haze from Sentinel-2 imagery, with the intention of supporting automatic change detection in LULC. To ensure the quality of the training dataset, scene classification maps of Taiwan processed by Sen2cor were visually examined and edited, resulting in a total of 12,769 sub-images with a standard size of 224 x 224 pixels, cut from the Sen2cor-corrected images and compiled in a trainset. The data augmentation technique enabled CloudNet to have stable cirrus identification capability without extensive training data. Compared to the traditional method and other DL methods, CloudNet had higher accuracy in cloud and haze classification, as well as better performance in cirrus cloud recognition. CloudNet will be incorporated into the Open Access Satellite Image Service to facilitate change detection by using Sentinel-2 imagery on a regular and automatic basis.

T2  - FIFTH SYMPOSIUM ON NOVEL OPTOELECTRONIC DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND APPLICATION
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th Symposium on Novel Optoelectronic Detection Technology and Application
CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - As a new hyperspectral remote sensing technology, the thermal infrared hyperspectral remote sensing has the ability to observe the surface day and night. Instead of the surface temperature retrieval, the ultimate goal of the hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data is to retrieve surface emissivity which can be used for mineral detection, ground parameters inversion and target identification and so on. Due to the inevitable atmospheric influence during the data acquisition process of thermal infrared hyperspectral imager, the atmospheric radiation information is included in the hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data. The atmospheric correction with high precision is the premise of effectively implementing the subsequent applications. The aircraft, especially the unmanned aerial vehicle rising in recent years, is an important platform for remote sensing because of its flexibility, immunity to the cloud cover and high spatial resolution. The aircraft flies through the atmosphere when working, which makes the direct measurement possible for the atmosphere. On the basis of summarizing the features of the atmospheric correction methods for the hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data, and the principle and process of atmospheric radiative transfer, the paper proposed an overall vision for the atmospheric correction based on the measured atmospheric downwelling radiance at the aircraft flight height, designed an atmospheric correction system for airborne thermal infrared imaging spectrometer, and stated the atmospheric correction procedure of hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data using the system. The proposed system and procedure for atmospheric correction are able to acquire the atmospheric downwelling thermal infrared radiation information in real time, so without too many assumptions, it is possible to dramatically increase the precision of the atmospheric correction for the airborne hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data and gives a promise to the objectivity of the data.

TI  - Preoperative prediction of sentinel lymph node metastasis in breast cancer by radiomic signatures from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is an important prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer, which is currently determined in clinical practice by invasive SLN biopsy. Purpose To noninvasively predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intra- and peritumoral radiomics features combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics of the primary tumor. Study Type Retrospective. Population A total of 163 breast cancer patients (55 positive SLN and 108 negative SLN). Field Strength/Sequence 1.5T, T-1-weighted DCE-MRI. Assessment A total of 590 radiomic features were extracted for each patient from both intratumoral and peritumoral regions of interest. To avoid overfitting, the dataset was randomly separated into a training set (similar to 67%) and a validation set (similar to 33%). The prediction models were built with the training set using logistic regression on the most significant radiomic features in the training set combined with or without clinicopathologic characteristics. The prediction performance was further evaluated in the independent validation set. Statistical Tests Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman correlation, least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) regression, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed. Results Combining radiomic features with clinicopathologic characteristics, six features were automatically selected in the training set to establish the prediction model of SLN metastasis. In the independent validation set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) was 0.869 (NPV = 0.886). Using radiomic features alone in the same procedure, 4 features were selected and the validation set AUC was 0.806 (NPV = 0.824). Data Conclusion This is the first attempt to demonstrate the feasibility of using DCE-MRI radiomics to predict SLN metastasis in breast cancer. Clinicopathologic characteristics improved the prediction performance. This study provides noninvasive methods to evaluate SLN status for guiding further treatment of breast cancer patients, and can potentially benefit those with negative SLN, by eliminating unnecessary invasive lymph node removal and the associated complications, which is a step further towards precision medicine.

TI  - Dynamics of Land-Use and Vegetation Change Using NDVI and Transfer Matrix: A Case Study of the Huaihe River Basin
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huaihe River Basin is located in-between the north-south climate transitional zone in China and is China's important congested area and production base. The land-use of the environment was occupied by the land-use for social and economics. This paper aims to have a comprehensive understanding about land-use and vegetation evolution of the basin over the past 30 years. In view of 5 years (1985, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2014) land-use data and remote sensing data about NDVI, land-use dynamic degree, and land-use transfer matrix were used to analyze the dynamics of land use. Spatial overlay was used to study vegetation change characteristics of the basin. The present study investigates the evolution trend of vegetation coverage based on spatial overlay analysis. We found that water bodies and urban lands of the basin increased during 1985-2014. On the other hand, the area of artificial vegetation, natural vegetation, and wetland were reduced. The impact was gradually increased by human intervention on various land use types. Overall vegetation coverage level shows deteriorative development, and distribution areas were discrete. The excellent vegetation coverage of natural vegetation and wetland didn't have obvious changes, but the high coverage significantly decreased. Taken as a whole, the natural vegetation coverage was reduced. The vegetation coverage level of artificial water in the land-use for social and economics had greatly increased, but the overall trend of vegetation coverage level of artificial vegetation and resident construction land showed a decreasing trend.

CL  - Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Timing service is an indispensable part of national economy, and timing technology directly restricts the accuracy of time obtained by users. High precision time transfer technology is an indispensable technology for time synchronization in all time laboratories. In this paper, based on GNSS multi-constellation precise single point positioning (PPP) technology, a time transfer method based on GNSS quad-constellation was proposed, and the precision satellite orbit and clock difference products provided by IGS were used for time transfer accuracy and frequency stability analysis. The experimental results show that the GNSS multiple constellation PPP can complete the time transfer of the accuracy of nanosecond. The PPP time transfer accuracy of GPS/BDS/GLONASS three-system combination is improved to a certain extent compared with GPS single system and GPS/BDS two-system, while the precision of GPS/BDS/GLONASS/Galileo four-system is not improved obviously compared with three-system. Through the analysis of the satellite data for 4 consecutive days, it is found that the inter-station clock difference solution calculated by GNSS multi-constellation PPP can reach the frequency stability of 5 x 10(-13)-6 x 10(-13), which is in good frequency consistency with the clock difference product released by IGS.

TI  - Dynamic Evaluation of Ecological Vulnerability in a Lake Watershed Based on RS and GIS Technology
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Located northeast of Yuxi City, Yunnan Province, China, the Fuxian Lake Basin is not only a famous scenic area, but also an ecological and environmental protection zone. The basin is a plateau mountainous lake region that has key ecosystem vulnerability and sensitivity. A dynamic evaluation of ecological vulnerability is important for assessing the ecological environment of a region, which is significant for the protection of ecological environments and providing ecological security early warnings. Based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology, remote sensing data, meteorological data, and economic statistics were used to perform a vulnerability analysis for the Fuxian Lake Watershed. Using the "cause and effect" evaluation model that relies on the remote sensing image pixel as the basic evaluation unit, the ecological vulnerability and the dynamic changes of the basin were evaluated using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method. Data collected in 1974, 1977, 1987, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2015 were analyzed to determine the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics and the dynamic changes over longer time-spans for ecological vulnerability. Afterward, the effects of land use and the consequential changes to ecological vulnerability were studied. The results indicated that the ecological vulnerability showed a trend of " overall stability but local strengthening" in the Fuxian Lake Basin from 1974 to 2015. The annual ecological vulnerability integrated index for the basin was 2.55 +/- 0.16, which indicates a transitional state between micro-vulnerability and mild vulnerability. On the basis of maintaining the degree of original vulnerability, the vulnerability of each grade was most commonly converted to the adjacent grade. The degree of ecological vulnerability was more commonly converted toward a more severe grade, and regions were less likely to recover from the severe vulnerability grade. The ecological vulnerability integrated index of the bare land was the highest (3.28), and the ecological environment of bare land was most vulnerable in the Fuxian Lake Basin.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Characteristics of Cirrus Clouds over the Tibetan Plateau Based on CALIPSO and AIRS Observations
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of high clouds over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) were studied using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the GCM-Oriented CALIPSO Cloud Product (CALIPSO-GOCCP) monthly mean cloud products from 2007 to 2017. The high clouds over the TP are dominated by cirrus and show seasonal variation characteristics. There were two distinct areas with the high occurrence of cirrus clouds in the area (0 degrees-60 degrees N, 75 degrees-103 degrees E). One was located in the regions from the equator to 25 degrees N, and the other was within the latitude belt from 30 degrees to 40 degrees N. From January to May, cirrus clouds mainly occurred in the central and northern parts of the TP (30 degrees to 40 degrees N), and the cirrus cloud fraction increased from January and reached its maximum (approximate to 0.51) in April. From June to August, cirrus clouds mainly occurred in the southern part of the TP during summer. The cirrus clouds over the southern TP were relatively high (located in 10-17km) and manifested northward and southward movements. The ice clouds in the southern TP are associated with plateau deep convection activities and abundant vapor transmitted by the Asian monsoon. Cirrus clouds over the northern and central TP may be relevant to the atmospheric lift by an approaching cold front and topographic lifting. Moreover, the high clouds below 11km are dominated by opaque clouds, while the nonopaque (or thin) and opaque (or thick) clouds above 11km are comparable.

TI  - Superpixel-Guided Layer-Wise Embedding CNN for Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irregular spatial dependency is one of the major characteristics of remote sensing images, which brings about challenges for classification tasks. Deep supervised models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great capacity for remote sensing image classification. However, they generally require a huge labeled training set for the fine tuning of a deep neural network. To handle the irregular spatial dependency of remote sensing images and mitigate the conflict between limited labeled samples and training demand, we design a superpixel-guided layer-wise embedding CNN (SLE-CNN) for remote sensing image classification, which can efficiently exploit the information from both labeled and unlabeled samples. With the superpixel-guided sampling strategy for unlabeled samples, we can achieve an automatic determination of the neighborhood covering for a spatial dependency system and thus adapting to real scenes of remote sensing images. In the designed network, two types of loss costs are combined for the training of CNN, i.e., supervised cross entropy and unsupervised reconstruction cost on both labeled and unlabeled samples, respectively. Our experimental results are conducted with three types of remote sensing data, including hyperspectral, multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The designed SLE-CNN achieves excellent classification performance in all cases with a limited labeled training set, suggesting its good potential for remote sensing image classification.

AB  - Forest is an important part of natural ecosystems and the environment in which living things depend. Forest is constantly changing under the influence of natural and man-made forces. Therefore, monitoring and estimating forest parameters play a key role in forest resource management, while forest growth situation is most directly reflected by the forest biomass and stock. The study area is located in Jilin Province of China, belonging to a national forest park. Combining the spectral data of Sentinel-2 with the radar data of GF-3, an inversion method of forest biomass and stock was proposed in this paper. The actual data of the field experiment in 2018 was used in this paper to validate the proposed method. Twelve vegetation indexes of spectral features were extracted, for example, ratio vegetation index (RVI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil adjustment vegetation index (SAVI). For the radar data of GF-3, the backscattering coefficients were extracted. Taking sixteen extracted eigenvalues as the independent variables, these variables with high importance to the model were further selected to participate in the construction of the inversion model of forest biomass based on random forest. Finally, the biomass of the research area was effectively obtained.

AB  - The classification of forest vegetation types plays an important role in the land management agencies for natural resource inventory information, especially for federally protected national forests in China. The classification results are widely used in the calculation and inversion of parameters such as forest storage volume, biomass and coverage. Forest canopy density response the extent to which the canopy is connected to each other in the forest. It can be used to observe vegetation growth. In recent years, deep learning convolutional neural networks have made significant progress in the task of remote sensing image classification and recognition. Considering that the spectral characteristics of forests in different seasons in Jilin Province of China are quite different, this paper used the optical image data of Sentinel-2A in summer, spring and autumn as the data source to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), bare index (BI), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) and shadow index (SI). Next use the four vegetation indexes combined with weighted overlay analysis method to calculate forest canopy density. In this paper, the convolutional neural network (CNN) was used as the forest vegetation type classifier. The classification indexes were the spectral data and the spectral data combined with the forest canopy density information, respectively. The experiment shows that the forest canopy density can significantly improve the classification accuracy and the overall accuracy is increased from 85.58% to 90.41%.

AB  - The Antarctic ice shelves play a significant role in stabilizing the grounded ice sheet. The collapses of the northern Larsen Ice shelf in the context of global warming highlighted the importance of understanding the relationship between flow dynamics and stability of ice shelves. This study investigated the ice velocity changes of the northern Larsen Ice Shelf as well as its relationship with the distribution of surface structural features using Landsat images acquired in the late 1980s and the early 2000s. Flow accelerations occurred on the Larsen B Ice Shelf, which are found to be closely related to the presence of structural features like melting ponds, rifts and crevasses.

AB  - Timely and accurately obtained regional construction land information for environmental protection, ecological construction, and regional planning is important. In this study, we used Landsat7 ETM+ images acquired in 2002 and Landsat8 images acquired in 2016 as data sources, and performed maximum likelihood classification and class masking in order to extract construction land information in Tongren. The experimental results showed that the construction land of the study area was 306.07 km(2) in 2002 and 675.15 km(2) in 2016. This shows an increase of 369.08 km(2), which marks an increase by 120.59%, while the expansion ratio was quite larger. Construction land was mainly transferred from cultivated land (338.65 km(2)), and shows that large areas of cultivated land were replaced by construction land. The main reason for the construction land increase was urban expansion, and the county expansion ratio was between 3.72 and 7.92. Road construction, mining destruction, and residential expansion are additional reasons, but these have caused smaller changes to the area of construction land, with a change ratio of only 0.34. In mountainous Karst areas, urban expansion may cause ecological problems; therefore, we should protect the natural environment and maintain the landscape in its original state so as not to cause excessive disturbance to land resources.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

CL  - Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS
AB  - With the development of remote sensing techniques, remote sensing data can be obtained with higher spatial, higher spectral, and higher temporal resolution. In addition, to get higher spatial resolution, super-resolution for increasing spatial resolution is getting special attention. In this paper, we will focus on some classical learning-based super-resolution methods to investigate the adaptability for satellite videos with low imaging quality. Methods include sparse representation, collaborative representation, and deep learning methods. Experiments show that learning-based methods can perform well for single-frame super-resolution for satellite videos. Methods based on deep learning show higher PSNR and SSIM. And multi-frame super-resolution will be good for moving objects. However, it may also bring negative influence for a stationary scene, which is caused by low satellite video quality, such as winkling noise, a vibration of a camera, overexposure of metals.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spontaneous generation, natural dissipation, split, and merger of convective cells within the life cycle of the mesoscale convective system (MCS) is the main problem of most existing tracking algorithms. To address this issue, an algorithm called spatio-temporal context and extended maxima transform (SCEMT) is proposed for tracking convective cells using satellite infrared image sequences. In order to track convective cells, the presented method uses the extended maxima transform technique to detect convective cells, learning a spatio-temporal context model, updating scale and variance, and calculating the confidence map of adjacent moments. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in different phases of MCS life cycle. The SCEMT method is evaluated utilising contingency table approach on FY-2F data sets. This novel method has a good discrimination skill (probability of detection 90%, false alarm ratio 7%, and critical success index 84%), and provides a correct tracking of convection motion.

AB  - Satellite provides good observational data for the weather and climate analysis of the Tibetan Plateau. Three kinds of cloud fraction data that comes from PATMOS-x/NOAA, CLARA-A2/NOAA and MODIS / Aqua were evaluated over Tibetan Plateau. Compared with ground observation, PATMOS-x had the highest correlation and the mean correlation was higher than 0.8. Three kinds of long term cloud fraction data showed similar spatial and temporal distribution pattern, namely that eastern Plateau has more cloud than western, northern Plateau has more cloud than southern and day time has more cloud than night. All three kinds of cloud data made mistake with snow along the ridge of mountain. In the daytime, CLARA-A2 had the highest monthly average cloud fraction. At night, the monthly average cloud fraction of Aqua/MODIS was more than that of PATMOS-x and CLARA-A2 except in summer. All three kinds of cloud fraction had similar annual mean value. CLARA-A2 had minimum cloud fraction in summer and maximum cloud fraction in winter. The linear regression and accumulate bias analysis showed that the annual mean cloud fraction of both PATMOS-x and CLARA-A2 displayed a decrease trend from 1982 to 2015. The trend of night time cloud fraction was more obvious than that of daytime. CLARA-A2 displayed obvious trend than PATMOS-x, especially at night.

TI  - A Phenology-Based Cropping Pattern (PBCP) Mapping Method Based on Remotely Sensed Time-Series Vegetation Index Data

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Cropping patterns are closely related to food production, cropland intensification, water resource management, greenhouse gas emission and regional climate alteration. Timely and accurate mapping of cropping patterns is urgently needed in many disciplines. However, the existing cropland-related datasets are informative at the global level, but lack regional-scale details about cropland utilizations. Thus, there is a need for better information on the area and distribution of cropping patterns at regional scales. In this study, we developed a phenology-based cropping pattern (PBCP) mapping method based on remote sensing vegetation index time series. The new method first extracted vegetation phenological metrics (start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), growing season length (GSL) and growth amplitude (GA)) from the vegetation index time series. Then, it identified crop seasons by using the minimum crop GSL, the minimum crop GA and the maximum crop GSL, which were derived from the training samples. Finally, cropping patterns were classified based on a set of decision rules. The case study in Henan province of China showed that, the results indicated that: (1) compared with cropping index derived from the supervised classification of Landsat-5 TM images, the PBCP method provided cropping index with satisfactory accuracy of 85.3%. (2) Validation sample analysis indicated that the cropping pattern mapping accuracy was 84% for the PBCP method. Different to current cropping pattern mapping methods, the PBCP method considered crop planting information in three years in deciding the cropping pattern to map the dominant cropping patterns. It can provide new insights in agriculture related land use analysis.

AB  - The GF-3 satellite is the first full-polarization SAR satellite in China, which operates in the C band with a resolution of 1m. This paper presents a dual-aspect geometric terrain correction method to overcome the inherent shortages of SAR image such as foreshortening, shadow and layover. The results using GF-3 satellite data show that the method can effectively eliminate layover and shadow distortions in SAR images. This method solves the geometric correction problem that cannot be solved with a single SAR image.

AB  - High-quality and long-term soil moisture (SM) products are crucial for studying the climate change over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Five passive microwave remotely sensed SM products were compared against in-situ SM observations from five networks, i.e., Heihe, Naqu, Pali, Maqu, and Ngari. Five SM products include the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), the Fengyun-3B (FY3B), the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The results show that SMAP performs better than other four products in every network, but it has a slightly underestimate and poor dynamic range in Heihe network, which mainly due to the significant heterogeneity of topography and land cover. Moreover, the underestimate for JAXA, the overestimate for LPRM, the noisy temporal variations for SMOS, good dynamic changes for FY3B but lacks perfect absolute accuracy, all of these can be reflected from the validation results.

M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial lake serves as a sensitive indicator of regional climate change and trigger of major glacial disasters. Understanding its spatial distribution and changing characteristics is of great significance for exploring the response of glacial lake to climate change and assessing the risk of glacial lake outburst. Based on the topographic maps in 1968-1980 and Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1994 to 2016, we analyzed the spatial-temporal distribution and dynamic changes of glacial lakes with an area larger than 0.01 km(2) in the Parlung Zangbo River Basin as well as identified and evaluated the potential dangerous glacial lakes using RS, GIS and mathematical statistics methods. The results showed that: In 2016, there were 351 glacial lakes with a total area of 50.48 km(2) in the Parlung Zangbo River Basin. Glacial lakes with areas >1 km(2) accounted for the largest area and <0.1 km(2) accounted for the biggest number. Glacial lakes were mainly concentrated in 2800-5400 m. In the past 50 years, the number and area of glacial lakes in this basin have increased. Among them, the number and area of glacial lakes below 3000 m were relatively stable, whereas those above 4500 m increased rapidly. Under the background of climate warming, the glacier area in the Parlung Zangbo River Basin has decreased by 591.34 km(2) in the past 50 years. The retreat of the glacier terminal and the increase of glacial meltwater provided development space and material source for the formation, expansion and area increase of glacial lakes. There were 9 potentially dangerous glacial lakes being identified in the Parlung Zangbo River Basin. It is expected that the glacial lake outburst will be in an active stage in the future.

AB  - In this study, we proposed a new object-based landslide mapping method using multi-source data and One-Class Random Forest. The method was carried out by using a set of image object features, including spectral, textural and topographical features derived from bitemporal very high resolution images and DEM data. The proposed method was evaluated using WorldView-2 multispectral images and ASTER GDEM data over Haiti area, and the importance of different features was analyzed. The results showed that the proposed method outperformed the two comparative methods, with increases of 11.58% and 5.09% in kappa coefficient, respectively. The proposed method provides a fast and reliable method for landslide mapping.

TI  - Dissolved iron concentration in the recent snow of the Lambert Glacial Basin, Antarctica
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Iron (Fe) is a limiting nutrient in the Southern Ocean (SO), and the input of atmospheric iron may fertilize the SO. Therefore, it is important to estimate the deposition and solubility of atmospheric iron in the Antarctica. For this purpose, we measured iron in a 3m snow pit from the Lambert Glacial Basin (LGB), covering the period 2012-2017. We estimated an average annual dissolved iron (DFe) flux of 1.29 x 10(-3) mg m(-2) a(-1) and an average total dissolvable iron (TDFe) flux of 0.14 mg m(-2) a(-1) for this site. The atmospheric fractional iron solubility (FFS) ranges from 0.01% to 21.47% (mean value 1.20%) and shows an inverse hyperbolic relationship with the TDFe concentration. This relationship suggests that atmospheric iron in the LGB comes from a mixture of mineral dust with low FFS and aerosol with high FFS (e.g. combustion aerosols and volcanic ash). Based on the mean value of the atmospheric iron deposit fluxes from both this and previous studies, we estimated that similar to 0.013 Gg of dissolved atmospheric iron could be deposited in the seasonal sea ice zone (SSIZ) every year, potentially supporting an annual algal production of similar to 2.52 x 10(12) g C in the Antarctic coastal water. This is less than 1% of the annual primary production in the SSIZ of the SO estimated from satellite data. The result shows that, compared with other sources of iron such as iceberg and glacier meltwater, the dissolved atmospheric iron has very small effect on the annual primary production in the SSIZ.

TI  - Clustering of Remote Sensing Data Based on K-Nearest Neighbors Sampling With Non-Evenly Division
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data computation and traffic is the key step to rapid analysis and intelligent transportation application based on remote sensing data. To tackle the low computing efficiency and high storage cost in the analysis of remote sensing and improve the computational performance quickly, this paper proposed a new processing method of remote sensing data based on k-nearest neighbors (KNN) sampling with non-evenly division. In the method, we first sort and preprocess the original dataset in terms of any size of one-dimension and segment the sample dataset by non-evenly division. Then the samples with the range of boundary width are reserved, and a new local unsampled mapping table is reconstructed. Next, we traverse the subset and compute the distance matrix by Euclidean distance and the local density with descending order, and further determine whether the sample belongs to boundary sample in accordance with distance matrix and local density. We then construct the sampling dataset and combine again and achieve the processing result via adding the entire unsampled mapping table to the sample dataset. Finally, the current study is tested and verified by the simulation data and true traffic jam prediction case. Our experiments present that the proposed method not only can record precisely the correspondence relations between samples and unsampled data by the KNN sampling with non-evenly division and ensure the accuracy of clustering results, but also significantly reduce the data traffic and effectively improve the memory utilization. The result reveals that the proposed method can potentially contribute to the data analysis of remote sensing data and prediction of traffic jam with large scale and high real-time performance.

TI  - Integration of two semi-physical models of terrestrial evapotranspiration using the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining surface evaporation and plant transpiration, evapotranspiration (ET) is critical to surface water and heat balances as it links water, carbon cycles and energy exchanges. Many models have been developed and are presently used to estimate terrestrial ET. However, there are large model uncertainties among the different models, which present a problem. By combining meteorological reanalysis data from the China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) with remote sensing data and observational data during 2002-2009, two semi-physical models, the modified satellite-based Priestley-Taylor (MS-PT) model and a semi-empirical Penman equation-based (SE-PM) model, are used to estimate ET and are validated using in situ measurements collected at 22 flux tower sites in China. Then support vector machine (SVM) method is used to integrate these two semi-physical models to improve the accuracy of ET estimates for eight different vegetation types separately, as well as all of these types together. The integrated model likely explains 56-94% of the land surface ET changes indicated by the observations collected at the flux tower sites. The ET predictions obtained by driving the models with the reanalysis data (for which the relative bias and the relative root mean square error (RMSE) for all types of the SVM were 6 and 51W m(-2), respectively, and the maximum decrease of the relative RMSE for different types is nearly 20W m(-2)) are less accurate than those obtained by driving the models with the observational data (for which the relative bias and the relative RMSE for all types of the SVM are 4 and 43W m(-2), respectively). Compared to the individual semi-physical models, the results produced by the integrated model display significantly decreased bias (less than 5W m(-2) for all types) and RMSE (for which the maximum decrease is nearly 71W m(-2)) in the validation.

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter in characterizing vegetation canopy. In this paper, we proposed an efficient method to estimate LAI from Landsat surface reflectance data. The three-dimensional (3-D) discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model was used to simulate canopy reflectance by constructing real vegetation scenes. However, it took too much time to simulate reflectance because of its computational complexity. Thus, we employed Gaussian process (GP) to emulate the DART model using simulation data. LAI was retrieved by iteratively minimizing a cost function with the shuffled complex evolution (SCEUA) global optimization method. The final results demonstrated that the retrieved LAI values are in good agreement with the ground reference map.

CL  - Tianjin Normal Univ, Harbin, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Improvements in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image collection has revealed the ability to semantically describe scene complexity and abundant details. It is difficult for the traditional pixel-based methods to partition geospatial objects. A practical geospatial object partition method based on angular second moment kernel (ASMK) for SAR image is proposed. Firstly, a new kernel termed ASMK is designed in order to obtain accurate classification results. Then, based on classification results, river and urban areas as typical geospatial objects are partitioned. In order to obtain urban border accurately, a likelihood function to evaluate the possibility that one pixel belongs to urban area is established. Results of experiments with high-resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight data of the urban of Rosenheim in Germany demonstrate that the proposed method's effectivity and accuracy in object partition.

AB  - The Moon is a good calibration source for the millimeter-wave radiometer onboard the Feng Yun-4 Millimeter (FY-4M) satellite. The temperature profiles of the lunar surface can be obtained by solving the one-dimensional heat conduction equation with the thermo-physical properties of regolith. Then, the loss tangent is fitting using the Chinese Chang'e-2 (CE-2) 37GHz brightness temperatures (TB) data against TiO2 abundances, which is derived from Clementine five-bands multispectral data. The calculated surface temperatures and the TBs are validated by Diviner infrared data and CE-2 37GHz TB data. With the theoretical analysis of the radiative transfer, the TBs at FY-4M frequencies of lunar center area is obtained for calibration. In addition, the abnormal thermal emission at "cold spots" should be excluded for calibration.

AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is important in the early stage breast tumor resection surgery. Its results will determine if the axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND) will be conducted afterwards. For locating sentinel lymph nodes, indocyanine green ( ICG) has been widely used with a near infrared ( NIR) camera to image its fluorescence. However, surgeons need to watch a screen beside the operating table to see the fluorescence, with their hands operating on the surgical site. We developed a navigation system that projects the invisible fluorescence back to the surgical site visibly in real-time. The system introduces a co-axial optics design to guarantee the projection accuracy. Phantom experiments are conducted to assess the projection resolution and accuracy of the system. Animal experiments with three mice show a good system performance and its preclinical feasibility. Furthermore, the system is tested in a clinical trial of ninety breast cancer patients in three hospitals in China. ICG and methylene blue ( MB) is subcutaneously injected separately into the areola at 3-4 points to get both fluorescent and visible contrast, for further comparison. The navigation process is compared with a commercialized NIR imaging system. The results show a 100% detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes and a good consistency with the methylene blue and the commercialized imaging device. The experiments demonstrate good clinical feasibility of the co-axial projection system.

AB  - A framework about spectral based vegetation classification was proposed, which serves as a core methodology of the vegetation spectral knowledge base. The hyperspectral reflectances of 13 types of plants were measured by an ASD FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer. Two forms of spectral features were used for representing the key spectral characteristics of plants, including Vegetation index (VI) and spectral shape features. Based on these spectral features, a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the most important features for establishing the classifier. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the cross-correlation analysis were applied to derive the sensitivity of features and remove features that have high correlations. Then, a classification method for differentiating plants was established by coupling some spectral similarity measures (e.g., ED) with some classification methods (e.g., BPANN and SVM). The results of discrimination analysis showed that a highest accuracy was produced by SVM with the OAA over 99% when using 7 sensitive VIs. The results suggested the framework about spectral based vegetation classification can form a basis for spectral knowledge base and application technology and further achieve a wide range of plant classification based on remote sensing.

TI  - Joint Spectral and Spatial Consistency Priors for Variational Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a new variational pansharpening model with joint spectral and spatial consistency priors, which aims to fuse a low resolution (LR) multispectral (MS) image and a high resolution (HR) panchromatic (Pan) image to produce a pan-sharpened HR MS image. Specifically, the proposed model combines three consistency terms into a unified variational framework, which are (1) Local spectral consistency fidelity term, which enforces the degradation relation-based local spectral consistency constraint between the HR MS and LR MS images; (2) Hessian feature-enforced spatial consistency prior term, which particularly models the Hessian feature consistency constraint between the HR MS and Pan images to enforce spatial consistency; and (3) Wavelet-based spectral-spatial consistency prior term, which models the consistency between the HR MS image and the constructed Wavelet-based matching image to enforce spectral-spatial consistency. Moreover, the proposed model is efficiently solved by designing an optimization algorithm under the forward-backward splitting framework. Finally, experiments on the QuickBird, Pleiades and GeoEye-1 satellite datasets systematically illustrate that the proposed method performs better spectral and spatial qualities than various compared methods.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid areas, vegetation often exists in patches attributed to water-limited or salinized environments or local microtopography. The quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) distributed in the Yellow River Delta, China have been accepted more attentions because they are ideal for studies on spontaneous plant colonization. In this study, the method based on the tasseled cap brightness and greenness components derived from the July CBERS-04 image with the decision tree classifier was developed for quickly and successfully detecting the QVPs. The precision, recall rate, and F-measure were 60.3%, 56.8%, and 58.5%, respectively. In the future, the time series tasseled cap components are needed to improve the detection accuracy.

AB  - The tasseled cap transformation (TCT) has been widely accepted and used in the remote sensing community. However, for a new sensor, the TCT parameters must be derived using a set of images from the new sensor again. In this paper, the TCT parameters appropriate for the spectral reflectance of fusion high spatial resolution multispectral images from China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite 04 (CBERS-04) were derived based on five images acquired in the different month. The tasseled cap feature spaces including the TCTB and TCTG in this study are equivalent to the MSS and TM tasseled cap plane in terms of Kauth and Thomas's tasseled cap. The use of combined parameters could slightly improve the discrimination of land cover based on the TCTB and TCTG. The tasseled cap parameters from this study will be useful for detecting vegetation patches, and also enhance the application of CBERS-04 images in estimating crop plantation area, detecting the dieback of forest and forest health, and monitoring land use and land cover changes.

AB  - Gaofen-1 (GF-1) is the first high resolution optical imaging satellite of China primary civilian Earth observation project under the China High- resolution Earth Observation System. With the GF-1 trio launched on March 31, 2018, the combined 3+1 GF-1 constellation will offer one-day revisit coverage, which provides more available high resolution remote sensing images for monitoring decametric-scale vegetation patches and long-term pattern dynamics. In this study, a panchromatic image, the original multispectral image, and the pan-sharpened multispectral image from GF-1 Pan-multispectral Camera was compared to evaluate their potential for identifying the quasi-circular vegetation patches (QVPs) in the Yellow River Delta, China. The results showed that high spatial resolution was more important for identifying the QVPs than more additional spectral bands of GF-1, and the pan-sharpened multispectral image had the highest identification accuracy of the QVPs (F-measure is 64.6%). In the future, multi-temporal pan-sharpened GF-1 images should be used to obtain higher accuracy, which is basis for studying vegetation patch pattern dynamics.

AB  - China's Fengyun-3D satellite (FY-3D), which can obtain global cloud amount data, was launched in November 2017. In this study, we qualitatively and quantitatively compare the cloud amount products from FY-3D and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) AQUA in July and October,2018. The results show that the global spatial distribution characteristics of the FY-3D cloud amount products is consistent with that of MODIS. The distributions of the cloud amount of the two products are more similar in October, but theFY-3D cloud amount data are generally higher than the MODIS cloud amount data. After strict space-time matching, the matched samples are used for quantitative accuracy evaluation. In July 2018, the absolute error of the FY-3D cloud amount relative to MODIS is 4.5, the relative error is 0.11, the deviation is 1.68, the error standard deviation is 12.11, and the correlation coefficient reaches 84.8%. In October 2018, the absolute error of the FY-3D cloud amount relative to MODIS is 3.20, the relative error is 0.05, the deviation is 1.68, the error standard deviation is 6.38, and the correlation coefficient is 93.4%. The global error distribution shows that at mid-low latitudes, the quality of the two products is similar and the error ranges between -10 and 10%, while at high latitudes the error is relatively large. FY-3D cloud amount products can be used in studies of the global climate and climate change.

AB  - Agricultural drought given the significant impacts on social economy and human living, the research on agricultural drought monitoring has been paid broad attention by many scholars. Development of remote sensing technology provides a potential opportunity for effective and real-time agricultural drought monitoring. Vegetation index, as one of the most important parameters to characterize vegetation growth and monitor vegetation change, can effectively monitor and evaluate the crop drought status. High resolution vegetation index time series can not only monitor the feature of changes of affected time, but also can extract the area of crop drought disaster accurately and exactly. However, due to cloud pollution, satellite revisit cycle, sensor design limitations and other factors, it is difficult for a single remote sensing sensor to simultaneously acquire high spatial-temporal images. So, it is urgent to get high spatial and temporal data which can be built by fusion algorithm. In this paper, the time series curve of vegetation index was constructed, and the drought area of crops was extracted by using the time series curve characteristics of maize vegetation index in drought-affected and non-drought-affected years. The overall classification accuracy was 90.03%.

AB  - In this paper, we present an automatic approach for change detection in a large and complex image scenario. The proposed technique takes advantages of automatic registration algorithm and change detection method that jointly measures the spatial invariant but spectral variant features in the considered bitemporal remote sensing image pair. Two classes of pseudo training samples, which associated to the change and no-change two classes, are automatically generated by analyzing the change representation information from both global and local perspectives. Finally, the robust classifier, i.e., linear support vector machine (LSVM), is used to identify the binary changes in the whole image scenario using the pseudo training samples. Experimental results obtained on a pair of real bitemporal Landsat-8 OLI images covering a large scene confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - This paper proposes a novel feature-level fusion approach for burned area change detection at a fine level. The proposed approach relies on two features. The first feature is a modified normalized burn ratio (MNBR) fire index based on Landsat-8 OLI SWIR data, and the second feature is the Bright temperature (BT) based on Landsat-8 TIR data. Then two features are combined by using the gradient transfer fusion algorithm and a change detection technique to generate a fine burned area change map. A real Landsat-8 data set covering a complex fire disaster scenario is utilized to test the performance of the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature-level fusion approach comparing with the reference methods in term of higher separability value and detection accuracy.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXIV
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Earlier work by Sun et al. [2005] modeled the Sun view screen transmittance of the solar diffuser stability monitor (SDSM) on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) which explains the oscillatory pattern in the Terra/Aqua MODIS SDSM Sun view response collected during the post-launch yaw maneuvers. The SDSM screen consists of small size pinholes which limit the screen transmittance. The SDSM Sun view transmittance pattern is affected by the size and distribution of pinholes, screen thickness, and orientation between the aperture stop and the Sun view screen. Planning of post-launch yaw maneuver test often requires comprehensive angular coverage to resolve the angular variation of the screen transmittance. This paper developed a Gauss-Kronrod quadrature method-based model to simulate the SDSM Sun view transmittance. This method performs iterative integration of the interception area between pinhole and aperture stop which is critical in the screen transmittance calculation. Parametric dependences of the MODIS SDSM Sun view transmittance on various geometric factors such as the pinhole size or spacing and misalignment between the SDSM Sun view screen and aperture stop are studied. The implications for the post-launch yaw maneuver planning to resolve the angular variation of the SDSM Sun view transmittance due to the SDSM Sun view screen misalignment are discussed.

AB  - Traditional supervised classification has been successfully applied to remote sensing (RS) classification and thematic mapping. However, labeling data is usually time-consuming and expensive. Transfer learning (TL) is able to reduce the labeling labor by utilizing pre-existing labeled data (source domain). Most of the existing TL methods applied in remote sensing still need a few labeled samples in target domain (where to be classified) or interaction between the classifier and users. By transferring the data distributions between the source and target domain into a joint feature space (where the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains is smaller than the original space), a novel unsupervised transfer learning framework is proposed in this paper. In our framework, robust remote sensing indices are extracted from Digital Surface Models (DSM) and the associated orthophoto to help us to estimate the conditional probability distribution of the target domain. After that, our proposed Dispersion-optimized Joint Distribution Alignment (DJDA) method is able to generate transformed feature representations of source and target feature sets through simultaneous reduction of the joint distribution discrepancy between two domains and optimizing the dispersion (both intra-class dispersion and inter-class dispersion). In our experiments, the proposed framework is able to improve the transferability between multi-model datasets (Orthophoto + DSM). The comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed DJDA outperforms the compared state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods on RS image classification.

AB  - Due to the huge tsunamis occurred in the 2011 Tohoku-Oki, Japan, earthquake, more than 100 bridges located in the Pacific coast of the Tohoku region were severely damaged. In this study, the extraction of the damaged bridges in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, was conducted by two methods using two post-event TerraSAR-X (TSX) intensity images, respectively. First, the statistical features within the outlines of the target bridges were calculated. The thresholding method of the backscatter intensity was applied to extract the damaged bridges. Then the TSX image was transformed into a binary image including water and non-water regions. The percentages of no-water regions within the bridge outlines were used to classify the washed-away and survived bridges. By comparing with the optical images and the report of field surveys, the accuracies of the proposed two methods and the influence of the shooting date were investigated.

AB  - Successive heavy rainfall affected the western Japan from the late June to the early July 2018. Increased river water overflowed and destroyed river banks, which caused flooding in vast areas. In this study, two pre-event and one co-event ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images were used to extract inundation areas in Kurashiki and Okayama Cities, Okayama Prefecture, Japan. First, the difference between the pre-event and co-event coherence values was calculated. The decreased coherence areas were extracted as possible inundation. Then the water regions were extracted by the threshold values from the three-temporal intensity images. The increased water regions in July 2018 were obtained as inundation. Finally, the extracted results from the coherence and intensity images were merged to create an inundation map. The results were verified by comparing with a web-based questionnaire survey report and visual interpretation of aerial photos.

AB  - Multi-source Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets are used to investigate the deformation history and failure mechanism of small-scale loess landslide in the Heifangtai loess terrace, Gansu province, China. A total of 65 SAR datasets acquired by L-band ascending ALOS/PALSAR, X-band descending TerraSAR-X and C-band descending Sentinel-1A/B covering the different periods of Heifangtai terrace are fully exploited. In addition, groundwater level data are also involved to analyze the failure mechanism of loess landslide. The displacements occurred during the past eleven years were quantitatively identified for firstly by InSAR technique. The results show that three slopes, failed on October 1, 2017 had large cumulative deformations from January 2016 to November 2016. The acceleration dates of the deformation for the three slopes were successfully captured by Sentinel-1A/B data. Furthermore, the result shows that the magnitude of the landslide deformation is closely correlated to the groundwater level variation.

TI  - DETECTING LONG-TERM TRENDS OF VEGETATION CHANGE AT LOCAL SCALE THROUGH TIME-SERIES IMAGE ANALYSIS: A CASE STUDY IN INNER MONGOLIA, CHINA
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of long-term change trend of vegetation covers faces several challenges. First, the change of vegetation covers exhibits remarkable cyclical oscillations and disturbances, which often mask the long-term trend. Second, the remote sensing image based time-series analysis is often complicated by the lack of long-series ground reference data. In addition, current remote sensing based vegetation change analysis focuses on continental, national or regional scales. Local scale analysis of vegetation changes is often neglected. In this paper, we developed a synthesized analysis framework, the domain adaptive and classified smoothing - DACS, to tackle these limitations. We integrated domain adaptive learning with the classified maps of vegetation groups (VGs) to derive the ground reference data supporting the image-based time-series analysis and to support local scale spatial analysis. We applied empirical mode decomposition model to extract long-term trends of VGs NDVI changes. We employed univariate polynomial regression to examine the long-term change trends of VGs and to identify their spatial and temporal patterns. We tested this new algorithm by analyzing the SPOT-VEG NDVI 10-days composites from 1999 to 2007 in Wulate, Inner Mongolia, China. The findings confirmed that the newly developed DACS method effectively captured the long-term trends of NDVI change over various VGs and revealed that the regional trend of NDVI change differed from the local trends of change of different VGs. DACS is suitable to other image sources, such as MODIS and Landsat images, and can be applied in other regions for local scale time-series analysis of vegetation cover changes.

TI  - Quantifying the relationship between human Lyme disease and <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> exposure in domestic dogs
T2  - GEOSPATIAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Early confirmatory diagnosis remains a challenge, while the disease can be debilitating if left untreated. Further, the decision to test is complicated by under-reporting, low positive predictive values of testing in non-endemic areas and travel, which together exacerbate the difficulty in identification of newly endemic areas or areas of emerging concern. Spatio-temporal analyses at the national scale are critical to establishing a baseline human LD risk assessment tool that would allow for the detection of changes in these areas. A well-established surrogate for human LD incidence is canine LD seroprevalence, making it a strong candidate covariate for use in such analyses. In this paper, Bayesian statistical methods were used to fit a spatio-temporal spline regression model to estimate the relationship between human LD incidence and canine seroprevalence, treating the latter as an explanatory covariate. A strong non-linear monotonically increasing association was found. That is, this analysis suggests that mean incidence in humans increases with canine seroprevalence until the seroprevalence in dogs reaches approximately 30%. This finding reinforces the use of canines as sentinels for human LD risk, especially with respect to identifying geographic areas of concern for potential human exposure.

AB  - Forest gross primary productivity (GPP), the capacity of fixing CO2 through photosynthesis, plays an important role in global changing and carbon cycle. In this study, we proposed a methodology to accurately and efficiently estimate GPP for six dominant forest types in north-east China using the remote sensing imagery driven Physiological Principles Predicting Growth model (3-PG). The GPP were accurately estimated and the results revealed that the largest GPP is obtained from the populus tremula (POTR) forest, with a range of 11.91 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 40.11 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). While the GPP of spruce (PIAS), dahurian larch (LAGM), and fir (ABFA) are similar, with an average of 14.47 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), 14.85 Mg C ha(-1) year-1, 13.39 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. The GPP of korean pine (PIKO) and white birch (BEPL) are the smallest and with mean values of 7.38 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) and 3.70 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. In addition, the comparison with previous researches indicated that the proposed module is reasonable and credible.

AB  - High resolution thermal infrared satellites can provide important observations for applications in various fields. For mine detection application, high resolution data can better resolve mineralogic boundaries. In this paper, an emissivity image simulation method is proposed for a high resolution thermal infrared satellite concept; and the simulated images can be used for mineral recognition and classification algorithm development using such instrument specification. Using Worldview-3 imagery as the simulation data source, the emissivity image has been generated based on a linear mixing model. In addition, accuracy analysis is conducted through comparison between simulated WorldView-3 images and the actual one. Small relative errors in every WorldView-3 band show it is feasible to use our proposed method for image simulation.

AB  - Aerosol optical thickness is a very important parameters in the atmospheric correction of the hyperspectral data. In this study, an improved dense dark vegetation (DDV) based algorithm is introduced to estimate the AOT@550nm from hyperspectral remote sensing data. A correction relationship between TOA and land surface reflectance at short wavelength near 2.13 mu m was introduced in order to reduce the assumption of the traditional DDV that the TOA reflectance is equal to the land surface reflectance at short wavelength near 2.13 mu m. Simulated hyperspectral data of Hyperion sensor were applied to the improved DDV algorithm. The retrieved AOT @550nm show a well correlation with the actual values and the correlation coefficients is larger than 0.99.

TI  - Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of urban land expansion in oasis cities by integrating remote sensing and multi-dimensional DPSIR-based indicators
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban land expansion not only stimulates socioeconomic development, but can lead to negative impacts that threaten regional food security, ecological construction, and sustainable urban development, including losses of cropland and habitats, the creation of housing bubbles, and reductions in biodiversity. Because these economic-socio-ecological problems are generally more serious in ecologically fragile areas, this study focuses on trends seen in Ganzhou District, a typical oasis city within the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in an arid-to-semi-arid area of China. We apply a remote-sensing (RS)-based method that incorporates 11 dimensional features of Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM +) images to map changes in urban land, and also develop a series of multi-dimensional indicators within a drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) framework to quantify urban land expansion. The results of this study show that the urban land area of Ganzhou District in 2016 had expanded by 394.43% from 1987 levels, from 1979.64 ha to 9787.86 ha. These increasing pressures, jointly driven by gross domestic product (GDP), urban population, cropland area, and the industrial structure indicator (ISI), have led to the worsening economic-socio-ecological states and impacts of urban land expansion. Specifically, between 1987 and 2016, expansion intensity (EIPI) and expansion rate pressure indicators (ERPI) increased from 60.27 ha/a to 520.88 ha/a, and from 3.04%/a to 10.21%/a, respectively. Thus, the state indicators of economic development (EDSI), population carrying capacity (FDSI), food security (FSSI), and ecological construction (ECSI) decreased by 2.21 x 10(3) USD/ha, 17.62 population/ha, 34.20, and 10.80, respectively. Moreover, the impact indicators of economic development (EDII), population carrying capacity (FDII), and food security (FSII) decreased by 150.68 x 10(3) USD/ha, 62.12 population/ha, and 27.31, respectively, while the ecological construction impact indicator (ECII) increased by 29.39 between 1997 and 2007 and decreased by 13.31 between 2007 and 2016. Data also show that the area and proportion of cropland and ecological land occupied by urban land expansion increased over time. We therefore propose a series of economic-socio-ecological responses to help limit urban sprawl and foster compact green cities. Measures include planning urban growth boundaries, revitalizing urban centers and brownfields, using and reusing urban land more efficiently, strengthening land regulations, curbing excessive cropland expansion, cultivating more urban green spaces, and optimizing the trade-offs and synergies between multiple conflicting dimensions.

M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the influence of underground mining disturbances on the shallow soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, remote sensing monitoring of the temporal and spatial evolution of surface soil moisture and the influence of mining on multi-source, multi-temporal and high spatial resolution remote sensing data were carried out. The scale effect of monitoring the soil moisture at different scales was analyzed using the Scaled Soil Moisture Monitor Index (S-SMMI). In this paper, SPOT 5/6 and Worldview-2 were used as the data source and mainly made up two aspects of the research: 1) based on the three SPOT data sets with the use of S-SMMI from different angles from the Daliuta mine from nearly three years of soil moisture temporal and spatial changes, the results show that the perturbation has a negative effect on the shallow soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, and average soil moisture of the mining area is smaller than the nonmining area, but the surface ecological construction has effectively improved the impact of the underground mining disturbance on the surface soil moisture. 2) the scale conversion of Worldview-2 data was carried out based on the resampling method. S-SMMI was used to analyze the scale effect of soil moisture monitoring at different scales. The results show that the difference between the soil moisture is only 0.0016 during the conversion process of 2 m-30 m.

TI  - Distributed Scatterer InSAR Reveals Surface Motion of the Ancient Chaoshan Residence Cluster in the Lianjiang Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lianjiang Plain in China and ancient villages distributed within the plain are under the potential threat of surface motion change, but no effective monitoring strategy currently exists. Distributed Scatterer InSAR (DSInSAR) provides a new high-resolution method for the precise detection of surface motion change. In contrast to the first-generation of time-series InSAR methodology, the distributed scatterer-based method focuses both on pointwise targets with high phase stability and distributed targets with moderate coherence, the latter of which is more suitable for the comprehensive environment of the Lianjiang Plain. In this paper, we present the first study of surface motion change detection in the Lianjiang Plain, China. Two data stacks, including 54 and 29 images from Sentinel-1A adjacent orbits, are used to retrieve time-series surface motion changes for the Lianjiang Plain from 2015 to 2018. The consistency of measurement has been cross-validated between adjacent orbit results with a statistically significant determination coefficient of 0.92. The temporal evolution of representative measuring points indicates three subzones with varied surface patterns: Eastern Puning (Zone A) in a slight elastic rebound phase with a moderate deformation rate (0-40 mm/year), Chaonan (Zone B) in a substantial subsidence phase with a strong deformation rate (-140-0 mm/year), and Chaoyang (Zone C) in a homogeneous and stable situation (-10-10 mm/year). The spatial distribution of these zones suggests a combined change dynamic and a strong concordance of factors impacting surface motion change. Human activities, especially groundwater exploitation, dominate the subsidence pattern, and natural conditions act as a supplementary inducement by providing a hazard-prone environment. The qualitative and quantitative analysis of spatial and temporal details in this study provides a basis for systematic surface motion monitoring, cultural heritage protection and groundwater resources management.

CL  - Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Marine aquaculture has developed very rapidly in China and at present, China has become the largest producer of marine aquaculture in the world. While bringing huge economic benefits to China, aquaculture has caused serious damage to the coastal ecological environment, such as eutrophication of seawater and a series of water pollution problems. How to effectively monitor the pollution of offshore aquaculture to guide fishery production and prevent red tide is an urgent problem to be studied and solved. Remote sensing, with its advantages of wide coverage, periodicity and low cost, can effectively monitor the spatial and temporal changes of offshore polluted water bodies, which is conducive to the comprehensive analysis of Marine phenomena. In recent years, the eutrophication of waters of Zhelin bay has intensified, which has become a red tide area, bringing serious economic losses to fishery. It is of great significance to study the distribution of chlorophyll a concentration and its spatiotemporal variation. Take the Zhelin Bay culture area in eastern Guangdong as an example, it is an important aquaculture base in China. Based on the measured hyperspectral data and the concentration of water quality parameters, the spectral characteristics of water body analyzed in Zhelin Bay .Remote sensing inversion model established by the optical classification theory. The accuracy of the inversion model verified by using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images. The distribution characteristics and the temporal and spatial variation of Chlorophyll-a concentration were studied. The results show the reflectivity ratio at the wavelength of 705 nm has a good correlation with the chlorophyll a concentration, and the correlation coefficient is 0.7. For the sentinel-2 data, the model constructed with (Rrs(705)-Rrs(665))/(Rrs(705)+Rrs(665)) as the inversion factor has the best fitting effect, the determination coefficient R2 is 0.891, and the average relative error is 13.25%. Spatial distribution pattern of chlorophyll a concentration: chlorophyll a concentration is higher in the western and northern coastal aquaculture areas of Zhelin bay, followed by the central net box culture area in the bay, and the shellfish culture area is lower. Spatial and temporal variation characteristics of chlorophyll a concentration: higher concentration of chlorophyll a found in the late stage of breeding, followed by the middle stage and the early stage. It provides scientific basis for the protection of offshore ecological environment, marine pollution monitoring and the coordinated development of fisheries.

AB  - Data-driven approach is effective for upscaling observation network data of terrestrial carbon fluxes. In this study, we estimated terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) across Asia by re-assessment of input parameters and updated MODIS datasets (collection 6, C6) with a machine learning approach. Site-level experiments showed that the newly introduced lagged effect successfully improved estimation of NEE. Interannual variations in GPP and NEE across Asia is more consistent with independent model-based estimations compared with the previous data-driven estimation based on MODIS collection 5 data (C5). Our new estimation provides a good benchmark for understanding spatio-temporal variability in terrestrial GPP and NEE.

AB  - A comprehensive analysis of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land-use type, and digital elevation model (DEM) data by using the geographic information system (GIS) showed that the index had increased over time in 84 prefectures that were part of the Grain for Green Project. SPOT Vegetation (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre Vegetation, or satellite observation of the earth's vegetation) data and the NDVI showed that compared to 2000, in 2015 2.05% of the arable land in the study area was no longer cultivated and that 25% of the farmland with slopes steeper than 35 degrees and 2.68% of the moderately sloped farmland (2-35 degrees) had been turned into forests. The arable land had been converted mainly to woodland and grassland. The interpretation of thematic mapper (TM) images showed that forest cover had increased significantly (by nearly 22%); that vegetation cover was less than 10% over 95.27% of the area; and that the area with high vegetation cover had increased significantly. Superposition analysis of TM images and DEM data showed that the intensity of soil erosion had generally decreased, with the areas under mild and pole-strength soil erosion decreasing by more than 10%. However, the Grain for Green Project has failed to check severe soil erosion so far. At present, although 60% of the study area is covered by forests, the extent of change in the degree of vegetation cover varied over time, and the spatial distribution was uneven, being higher in the east than in the west. It is therefore important to continue to strengthen governance through such projects.

AB  - Vaccination against influenza is important in pregnancy for the health of both mother and unborn baby. Influenza introduces risks to pregnancy and to the baby who relies on maternal antibodies for protection. Because the data associated with pregnancy is fragmented across multiple providers of health care, it is challenging to conduct pregnancy-related public health surveillance using a single data source. We report the integration of a novel ontological approach to identifying pregnancies in routine data with a web-based dashboard that feeds back information to general practices in a sentinel network. As a result, practices receive information about how well they are performing influenza vaccination in pregnancy in near-real-time.

TI  - Linking land use changes to variation in soil properties in a Mediterranean mountain agroecosystem
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Several decades of intensive rainfed farming in Mediterranean mountains and later land abandonment has led to rapid land use and land cover changes. During recent centuries, the conversion of rangelands into croplands has increased the surfaces prone to erosion. In the southern Pre-Pyrenees, the process was reversed during the middle of the twentieth century, allowing the recovery of vegetation and subsequent variation in land cover. This work aims to assess how land use changes after generalised land abandonment affect some major soil properties related to soil quality. For this purpose, 98 replicate bulk soil samples were collected in a 23 km2 catchment that was mostly cultivated at the beginning of the last century. Soil samples were distributed over areas representing the main land uses (agricultural land, natural forest, pine afforestation and scrubland). Bulk density, stoniness, grain size, pH, carbonates, electrical conductivity, soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), water retention capacity and magnetic properties (low frequency magnetic susceptibility (LF) and frequency dependence (FD)) were analysed in the samples from different land use areas. A past scenario was recreated using estimated data from the SPEROS-C model in order to evaluate changes in SOC over time. Furthermore, a multitemporal analysis of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index of Landsat images was performed between 1972 and the present in order to assess the dynamics of revegetation. After land abandonment, 16.5% of the area remained as croplands, but afforestation and natural revegetation occupied 83.5% of the catchment. The highest mean value for SOC was found in the pine afforested area and the highest TN mean value was found in the natural forest. The lowest mean values for SOC and TN were recorded on the agricultural land. These results show the impact of soil changes produced by land use changes in fragile Mediterranean mountain agroecosystems.

AB  - Objectives: Description of the qualifications of psychotherapy-training candidates in Austria at the beginning of their training.Methods: Psychotherapists in training in Austria were interviewed at the beginning of their training concerning their socio-demographic background and prior education. These background data were collected using the Trainee Background Information Form (TBIF), which was designed by the Society for Psychotherapy Research Interest Section on Therapist Training and Development (SPRISTAD).Results: The group of 197 psychotherapy trainees from Austria consists largely of women, of persons with high school education and with a satisfactory, financially secure life situation. One-third of them show a "second career" pattern, which is in line with the predominantly part-time training programs in Austria. A high percentage of the candidates have previous professional experience in the psycho social field.Conclusions: As this is a pilot study, results can be seen as a starting point for further research in psychotherapy training and competence development. In discussing the findings, both national conditions and opportunities for future interdisciplinary research are considered.

AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) is an aggressive neoplasm, known for its ability to spread to regional lymphatics as well as distant sites. Although it is less common than basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, the mortality rates associated with CMM far outstrip those of its less aggressive counterparts. When CMM is detected early, the chance of cure is very high; however, a significant number will have regional or distant spread, and the diagnostic and treatment rationale for these is complex. Herein we describe the diagnosis and treatment of regionally metastatic melanoma of the head and neck-with a focus on the differences in treatment of node-positive (N+) and node-negative (N0) patients. We will describe the central role of neck dissection in the treatment of the N+ neck, and the importance of sentinel lymph node biopsy as a diagnostic/therapeutic procedure in patients with N0 disease.

AB  - Natural and anthropogenic aerosol emissions play a fundamental role both modulating directly the incoming solar radiation and affecting the air quality. Likewise, their indirect effects impact cloud lifetime, atmospheric column thermodynamics and precipitation patterns. For this reason, it is of crucial importance to assess aerosol spatial and temporal variability to reduce the uncertainty in forecasting future scenarios by the climatological models. In this study we developed an image based robust methodology that permits to retrieve the atmospheric path radiance and then the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) using the different bands satellite high-resolution spatial images, e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, QuickBird and Ikonos, and a radiative transfer model. The validity and the limits of the proposed methodology are investigated through ground based lidar and sunphotometer observations obtained from the European Aerosol Lidar Network (EARLINET), the NASA MicroPulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) and the NASA AERONET network respectively.

AB  - SAR ocean surface wind retrieval is generally based on the co-polarized Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS). Yet, since April 2014, Sentinel-1 TOPS-mode acquisitions enable large swath dual-pol measurements while preserving relative phase information. In this study, this new capability is analyzed via the co-cross coherence from a massive S-1 VV/VH IW dataset. A Polarimetric Calibration (POLCAL) methodology is proposed to calibrate this variable over sea surface. The odd symmetry of the co-cross coherence from S-1 is confirmed, and potential Polarimetric Geophysical Model Function (PGMF) can be now investigated. The integration of this PGMF in the wind field inversion scheme will be the next step.

TI  - Synergetic Aerosol Layer Observation After the 2015 Calbuco Volcanic Eruption Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 22 April 2015, the Calbuco volcano in Chile (Lat: 41.33 degrees S, Long: 72.62 degrees W) erupted after 43 years of inactivity followed by a great amount of aerosol injection into the atmosphere. The pyroclastic material dispersed into the atmosphere posed a potential threat to aviation traffic and air quality over affected a large area. The plumes and debris spread from its location to Patagonian and Pampean regions, reaching the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and neighboring countries, such as Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, driven by the westerly winds at these latitudes. The presence of volcanic aerosol layers could be identified promptly at the proximities of Calbuco and afterwards by remote sensing using satellites and lidars in the path of the dispersed aerosols. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of AQUA/TERRA satellites and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) on board of Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite were the space platforms used to track the injected layers and a multi-channel lidar system from Latin America Lidar Network (LALINET) SPU Lidar station in South America allowed us to get the spatial and temporal distribution of Calbuco ashes after its occurrence. The SPU lidar stations co-located Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sunphotometers to help in the optical characterization. Here, we present the volcanic layer transported over Sao Paulo area and the detection of aerosol plume between 18 and 20 km. The path traveled by the volcanic aerosol to reach the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP) was tracked by CALIPSO and the aerosol optical and geometrical properties were retrieved at some points to monitor the plume evolution. Total attenuated backscatter profile at 532 nm obtained by CALIPSO revealed the height range extension of the aerosol plume between 18 and 20 km and are in agreement with SPU lidar range corrected signal at 532 nm. The daily evolution of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) at 532 and 355 nm, retrieved from AERONET sunphotometer, showed a substantial increasing on 27 April, the day of the volcanic plume detection at Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP), achieving values of 0.33 +/- 0.16 and 0.22 +/- 0.09 at 355 and 532 nm, respectively. AERONET aerosol size distribution was dominated by fine mode aerosol over coarse mode, especially on 27 and 28 April. The space and time coincident aerosol extinction profiles from SPU lidar station and OMPS LP from the Calbuco eruption conducted on 27 April agreed on the double layer structure. The main objective of this study was the application of the transmittance method, using the Platt formalism, to calculate the optical and physical properties of volcanic plume, i.e., aerosol bottom and top altitude, the aerosol optical depth and lidar ratio. The aerosol plume was detected between 18 and 19.3 km, with AOD value of 0.159 at 532 nm and Ansgtrom exponent of 0.61 +/- 0.58. The lidar ratio retrieved was 76 +/- 27 sr and 63 +/- 21 sr at 532 and 355 nm, respectively. Considering the values of these parameters, the Calbuco volcanic aerosol layers could be classified as sulfates with some ash type.

AB  - In the general population, the incidence of cutaneous malignancies has been rising. However, a particular high-risk population-transplant recipients-suffer at an alarming rate from the incidence of aggressive cutaneous malignancies. The purpose of this review is to examine the latest literature on the epidemiology, risk factors, pathogenesis, prognosis, prevention, and management of highly aggressive cutaneous cancers in the transplant population.With innovations in immunosuppression, surgical technique, and perioperative care, organ transplant recipients are now living longer but now suffer from increasing morbidity secondary to the rising incidence of these aggressive cutaneous cancers. Currently, the three most common causes of delayed mortality following organ transplantation are complications associated with infectious diseases, cardiovascular disease and malignancy.Cutaneous malignancies have now become the most common malignancy in this unique population.

AB  - In this study subsidence related to mining activity in the Nuraxi Figus coal district was detected by means of the Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) technique, applied to COSMO-Skymed (CSK) data. The interferometric results, covering 2011 and 2014, have been obtained in the framework of the so-called "Third Not-ordinary Plan of the Environmental Remote Sensing Project". The remote sensing revealed a maximum subsidence of about 23 cm related to coal extraction, carried out in correspondence of two production panels, 400 m wide and 1300 m long, at a depth of about 500 m below the ground level.Time-lapsed vertical deformation profiles have been carried out to analyze the dynamic ground-deformation development. The study allowed demonstration that subsidence was still active for a year after the mine panel production.

TI  - Earth Observation Actionable Information Supporting Disaster Risk Reduction Efforts in a Sustainable Development Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a high priority on the agenda of main stakeholders involved in sustainable development, and earth observation (EO) can provide useful, timely, and economical information in this context. This short communication outlines the European Space Agency's (ESA) specific initiative to promote the use and uptake of satellite data in the global development community: Earth Observation for Sustainable Development (EO4SD). One activity area under EO4SD is devoted to disaster risk reduction (EO4SD DRR). Within this project, a team of European companies and institutions are tasked to develop EO services for supporting the implementation of DRR in International Financial Institutions' (IFI) projects. Integration of satellite-borne data and ancillary data to generate insight and actionable information is thereby considered a key factor for improved decision-making. To understand and fully account for the essential user requirements (IFI and client states), engagement with technical leaders is crucial. Fit-for-purpose use of data and comprehensive capacity building eventually ensure scalability and long-term transferability. Future perspectives of EO4SD and DRR regarding mainstreaming are also highlighted.

TI  - Performance evaluation of quad-pol data compare to dual-pol SAR data for river ice classification
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite SAR data are a unique source of information about river ice since the microwaves penetrate through clouds as well as snow and ice cover. The influence of the number of polarization channels on the nature and amount of information is, however, not yet fully investigated. The article intends to compare quad-pol and dual-pol data. The studied areas include two rivers with different types of ice cover - the Peace River in Canada and the Vistula River in Poland. We used RADARSAT-2 quad-pol Single Look Complex (SLC) data. The comparison methods include separability analysis (Hellinger distance, Bhattacharyya distance) and Wishart supervised classification. We found that dual-pol and quad-pol data provide equivalent information for homogeneous ice cover (overall classification accuracy above 80% for all polarization modes). Differences were observed in case of complex river ice cover with high diversity of ice types.

TI  - General characteristics of tetraktida dialectics
T2  - FILOSOFSKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a first time publication of the material found in A. F. Losev's archive that relates to the initial structure of his famous book The Philosophy of Name (1927). According to Losev's initial plan, A General and phenomenological analysis of Thought and Word, or Name was the first part of his book, and, for the most part, it would later become part of the published work. In the second part, which was not published, Losev planned to provide a special interpretation of his Dialectic nature of the name. It is this kind of a dialectic system (an original "dialectics of the name") that is developed here in the form of bullet points and relates to two different semantic dimensions: the "vertical" dimension, according to the model of a neoplatonic tetraktida, and the "horizontal" dimension, which builds on the model of Hegelian triads. The same system with insignificant variations is also found in other books written by A. F. Losev in the 1920s. In the present fragment, Losev elaborates on some specific features of the dialectic method he employs: a) the logical entailment and the concept of a "dialectic instant," b) the relation between dialectics and reality, and c) the presentation of dialectics as a special kind of mythology. This text presents an early and very dense version of the basic philosophical ideas that would be developed by Losev in more detail in The Dialectics of Myth (1930), in particular, those that relate to the orthodox Christian worldview as "absolute mythology" and "absolute dialectics."

AB  - Sen2Cor is a Level-2A processor designed to correct Sentinel-2 Level-1C products from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver a Level-2A surface reflectance product. ESA has been using Sen2Cor for systematic Level-2A processing of Sentinel-2 acquisitions over Europe since June 2017. It has since then been successfully integrated into Sentinel-2 ground segment (PDGS) with a global production over the World started in December 2018. In this manuscript, the Level-2A product and algorithm are presented. The performance of this operational Level-2A product is described in terms of cloud screening accuracy and atmospheric correction accuracy. Finally, the on-going parallel developments aimed at improving the product quality at global scale in terms of cloud screening and atmospheric correction are discussed.

TI  - Single incision for oncologic breast conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy in early stage breast cancer: A minimally invasive approach
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Breast conserving surgery (BCS) has a postoperative morbidity up to 30%. We report the feasibility of a single-incision approach for tumor excision and axillary sentinel node biopsy (SNB) sampling intended to minimize patient morbidity and complications. Materials and Methods A tertiary surgical oncology single surgeon database was retrospectively reviewed for all patients undergoing BCS and SNB between January 2013 and December 2015. The single-incision approach used a single breast incision to resect the tumor and the Lymphazurin-tagged SNB. The multi-incision group used a breast incision and a separate axillary incision. Results The single-incision approach was associated with shorter operative time (56 vs 64 minutes, P = 0.026). Sentinel node retrieval was achieved in 100% in both groups. The single-incision technique was used primarily in the upper outer quadrant (N = 41, 85.4%), but was also selectively applied in other quadrants (N = 5). There was no significant difference in complication rates between the two procedures (P = 0.425), and there were no instances of conversion from single-incision to standard BCS-SNB. Conclusions Minimally invasive breast conserving surgery is feasible for patients with early breast cancer located in the upper outer quadrants. This technique may reduce postoperative morbidity and improved cosmetic result.

T2  - BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - If we want to address the problems created by Mara and Mammon, reviewing Buddhist and Christian views of our human condition is not sufficient: Both are Axial Age religions, based on profound cultural transformations that occurred in the Middle East, Greece, India, and China in the middle of the first millennium B.C.E. In order to understand the worldview and social role of such religions, however, they need to be contextualized within a broader understanding of the evolution of culture generally and religion in particular. That means going much further back into our long prehistory and benefiting from the often-uncomfortable insights of evolutionary psychology.Why "often uncomfortable"? Despite accepting the physical implications of evolution, most of us remain wary of any psychological explanation of our predispositions that invokes genetics. But cultural influences do not operate on a Blank Slate: They condition genetically based tendencies for how to interact with others. What psychological predispositions are associated with the genes that tend to survive, and do they sometimes include-and thereby perpetuate-the three poisons: greed (acquisitiveness), ill will (violence, war), and delusion (egoism, tribalism)? In our long history, the most important social program attempting to control and channel our conflicting genetic predispositions was provided by Axial Age religions. The Axial Age can be understood as cultural-evolution's way of compensating for the problematic genetic propensities, both individual and tribal, that had originally enabled our species to survive and thrive in very competitive and often-threatening environments-tendencies, however, that not only led to Bronze Age breakdown but now threaten our very existence.

TI  - Ship Classification in High-Resolution SAR Images via Transfer Learning with Small Training Dataset
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as an all-weather method of the remote sensing, now it has been an important tool in oceanographic observations, object tracking, etc. Due to advances in neural networks (NN), researchers started to study SAR ship classification problems with deep learning (DL) in recent years. However, the limited labeled SAR ship data become a bottleneck to train a neural network. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are applied to ship classification by using SAR images with the small datasets. To solve the problem of over-fitting which often appeared in training small dataset, we proposed a new method of data augmentation and combined it with transfer learning. Based on experiments and tests, the performance is evaluated. The results show that the types of the ships can be classified in high accuracies and reveal the effectiveness of our proposed method.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Super-pixel methods cluster spatially connected similar pixels into perceptually meaningful regions, which are generally used as basic units instead of the original pixels in preprocessing and segmentation of high spatial resolution images for the object-oriented image classification. Among a number of super-pixel methods, the simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) has been widely applied due to its simplicity, efficiency, and ability to adhere to image boundaries. SLIC itself, however, was originally designed to group black-white or three-color common images rather than multi-spectral/hyperspectral remote sensing ones into super-pixels. In order to better apply SLIC to segmenting remote sensing images at high spatial resolution, the SLIC algorithm was modified by incorporating grey-level co-occurrence matrix texture with color features and expanding measure approach for weighted distance of texture and color similarity and spatial proximity between super-pixel center and neighboring pixels. Gaofen-2 panchromatic, multispectral and fused images were used to valid the modified SLIC (MSLIC) algorithm. Both completeness (CPS) and correctness (CRS) were used to quantitatively evaluate both MSLIC and SLIC algorithms. Visually interpreting approach was also applied to compare the segmentation and classification maps from the two algorithms. The experimental results indicate MSLIC achieves higher CPS and CRS than SLIC.

TI  - A methodological review on identification of tree mortality and their applications
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Review
AB  - About 30% of global land areas are covered by forests, which account for nearly 45% of terrestrial ecosystem carbon stock. Thus, the dynamics of forest growth and mortality are critical for regulating the global cycling of matter and energy. In the past years, climate change and its associated disturbance events have profoundly accelerated forest mortality and degradation, leading to negative impacts on ecosystem functions in global forests. Currently, the key approaches to study forest or tree mortality include manipulative experiments, in-situ observations, and ecological modeling. These approaches have been applied from individual, ecosystem, regional to global scales. However, almost all of these approaches have to identify forest or tree mortality based on certain criteria. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the mortality process, a unified definition or identical criterion for forest and tree mortality is still lack. Thus, it is necessary to summarize which methods have been used to define and identify forest and tree mortality in ecological studies.In this synthesis, we provide a methodological review of different approaches which have been widely used in field investigation, field long-term monitoring, remote-sensing studies, and ecological modeling. For field investigation, tree mortality can be directly identified via tree vigor and defoliation conditions. Two inter-related hypotheses, including hydraulic failure and carbon starvation, are proposed to be the major mechanisms associated with drought-induced mortality. Despite the strong debate over the contribution of carbon starvation during drought-induced tree mortality, the bulk of manipulative experiments and field observations has highlighted the importance of understanding the carbon dynamics and interaction of hydraulic failure and carbon starvation during drought mortality. Forest inventory plots and remote sensing are the two powerful tools to monitor forest and tree mortality on the regional scale. Many countries have established forest inventory plots that allow detailed measurements of demographic process, including mortality. Satellite data are available to map forest mortality by detecting changes in forest vegetation productivity at broad spatiotemporal scales. In global carbon-cycle models, the tree mortality has been represented by diverse algorithms. In general, the mortality algorithms in current models are relatively simple. For example, tree mortality in CLM4.5 is parameterized as a constant proportion of total biomass.In summary, this review synthesizes the available methods for identifying forest and tree mortality based on the published literatures. These methods have been developed for different purposes and their applications are scale dependent. There is an urgent need of explicitly simulating tree mortality in Earth system models. Thus, this study calls for a better understanding on the underlying mechanisms of tree mortality and more research efforts on improving mortality algorithms in global carbon-cycle models.

AB  - Hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) image fusion has attracted great attention during the past decades. Numerous of fusion methods have been developed and shown their effectiveness particularly on simulated data. Nonetheless, for real remote sensing data, the different acquisition times or conditions result in a serious spectral distortion and severely affect the fusion quality. Yet very few works have considered this issue. In this paper, a spectral modulation (SM) method is proposed to better maintain the spectral information of the HS data when fusing with MS data. The goal is to generate an adjusted MS image that would have been observed under the same imaging conditions with the corresponding HS sensor. Experiments on two HS and MS data sets acquired by different platforms demonstrate that the proposed method is beneficial to the spectral fidelity and spatial enhancement of the fused image compared with some state-of-the-art fusion techniques.

AB  - NASA has launched the ICESat-2 satellite in September 2018 with the primary purpose of monitoring changes in the elevation of ice at high latitudes. Fortunately, additional and unrealized information from the penetration of laser light below the ocean's surface offers a new and exciting opportunity to study ocean biology over the open sea water and below sea ice. We have proposed a novel algorithm to determine ocean subsurface optical properties, such as, diffuse attenuated coefficient, k(d) (/m), total backscattering coefficients b(b) (/m), and layerintegrated ocean subsurface backscatter from ICESat-2/ATLAS lidar measurements. Our ICESat-2 ocean subsurface results reveal high vertical resolution through the water column that have been hidden in the ocean color record from passive sensors. The comparisons between ICESat-2/ATLAS retrieved ocean subsurface results and Aqua/MODIS ocean color records indicate that the ICESat-2 retrieved ocean subsurface results compare reasonably well with MODIS ocean color results with the mean relative differences less than 10%.

AB  - Tremendous groundwater withdrawal has caused land subsidence disaster in Su-Xi-Chang area, China. In order to monitor land subsidence and reduced the potential damages to railway and highway, nn effective monitoring method is urgently needed. SBAS-InSAR method with SAR data provides an effective ability to detected land subsidence in recent years. In this work, we monitor land subsidence area along railway and highway in Su-Xi-Chang area from 2007 to 2012 by using SBAS-InSAR processing method with ALOS PALSAR SAR data. The InSAR result along highway and highway ranged from -50 mm/year to 16 mm/year, -50 mm/year to 26 mm/year, respectively. Analysis of land subsidence along highway in Wuxi area showes that the area with serious land subsidence distributes in the industrial concentrated area.

M3  - Article
AB  - The urbanization process all over the world has caused serious ecological and environmental problems which have recently become a focus for study. Ecological footprint analysis, which is widely used to assess the sustainability of regional development, can quantitatively measure the human occupation of natural capital. In this study, the ecological footprint based on net primary production (EF-NPP) and MODIS data were used to measure the ecological footprint in Xuzhou central area from 2005 to 2014. The results showed that from 2005 to 2014, the per capita ecological footprint increased from 1.06 to 1.17 hm(2)/person; the per capita ecological capacity decreased from 0.10 to 0.09 hm(2)/person; the per capita ecological deficit increased from -0.96 to -1.09 hm(2)/person; and the ecological pressure index increased from 6.87 to 11.97. The composition of the ecological footprint showed that grassland contributed most to the ecological footprint and deficit, and cultivated land contributed most to the ecological capacity. The spatial distribution of the ecological footprint changed significantly, especially in the expansion of the area of lower value. The ecological capacity and deficit changed little. The ecological situation in Xuzhou central area was unbalanced. Based on this study, Xuzhou city was recommended to control the increase of the ecological footprint, improve the ecological capacity and balance the ecological pattern for sustainable development.

TI  - Optical remote identification of spilled oils from the SANCHI oil tanker collision in the East China Sea
T2  - CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of marine oil spills is an important application of satellite observation data. During the oil weathering process, marine spilled crude oils undergo chemical and physical changes (e.g. spreading, drifting, mixing, emulsification, evaporation, dissolution, and Photo-oxidation) to form different pollution types with various visual features. These visual features include the following: Light sheen, silver sheen, rainbow sheen, streamers, brown oil slick, and black oil, and they represent different oil amounts per unit area. Notably, different treatment methods, such as booms, skimmers, chemical dispersants, and in situ burning, can be used specifically to reduce the damage of various types of oil spill to the marine environment. Therefore, the detection, classification, and quantification of the various types can facilitate the monitoring and assessment of marine oil spills.Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi/hyper spectral optical sensors onboard satellites or aircraft provide timely observation data for remote sensing of marine spilled oils based on distinctly different detection principles. Although SAR is an effective detection method which can penetrate clouds and rain, the identification and estimation of the various spilled oils are difficult. Optical remote sensing has been used for several decades and it has the capability to identify various spilled oils (i.e. oil slicks, water-in-oil (WO) or oil-in-water (OW) emulsions) and to estimate oil slick thickness or oil emulsions concentrations according to their spectral reflectance and other characteristics. Integration of the use of SAR and optical remote sensing imageries will undoubtedly improve the identification and estimation of various marine spilled oils in the future.Here we present the results of a case study of the SANCHI oil tanker collision on January 2018 in the East Sea of China, which we use to evaluate how the advantages of SAR and optical sensors for remotely identifying different marine spilled oils can be combined. SAR imageries of different polarization modes over the East Sea from 7 to 14 January 2018 were collected from the GF-3 satellite (China) for detecting spilled oils. In these different SAR imageries, the modulation of the spilled oils of surface roughness reduces Bragg backscattering, resulting in darker look-alike oils than the surrounding water. Optical data (cloud-free or less cloud) over the same area on 18 January 2018 were obtained from a multi-spectral instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 (European Space Agency, ESA) in order to identify various spilled oils. Laboratory-based measurements of the spectral reflectance of oil slicks, oil emulsions, and crude oil were used to simulate the spectral features of various spilled oils in MSI imagery under weak sunglint reflectance. The high spatial resolution of MSI images (spatial resolution of 10 m) reduces the mixing effect of clouds, and spilled oils could be identified through the gaps in the clouds. These look-alike spilled oils derived from the SAR imagery can be verified using MSI optical images. Moreover, based on the laboratory-derived spectral features of various spilled oils and the decision tree method, these different spilled oils (i.e. oil slicks, WO and OW emulsions) produced by the SANCHI oil tanker collision can be identified using MSI spectral reflectance. The results have been verified against each other, and they indicate that the various spilled oils can be identified using passive optical remote sensing. We conclude that the integrated application of multi-source remote sensing (especially optical remote sensing) can provide an important method for the detection, identification, and estimation of marine spilled oils in the near future.

AB  - Building detection in remote sensing images plays an important role in applications such as urban management and urban planning. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods which benefits from the popularity of large-scale datasets have achieved good performance for object detection. To our best knowledge, there is no large-scale remote sensing image dataset specially build for building detection. Existing building datasets are in small size and lack of diversity, which hinder the development of building detection. In this paper, we present a large-scale high-resolution building dataset named 5M-Building after the number of samples in the dataset. The dataset consists of more than 10 thousand images all collected from GaoFen-2 with a spatial resolution of 0.8 meter. We also present a baseline for the dataset by evaluating three state of the art CNN based detectors. The experiments demonstrate that it is great challenge to accurately detect various buildings from remote sensing images. We hope the 5M-Building dataset will facilitate the research on building detection.

TI  - Integrated Assessment of Ground Surface Displacements at the Ketzin Pilot Site for CO<sub>2</sub> Storage by Satellite-Based Measurements and Hydromechanical Simulations
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been growing interests in recent years for the safe underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) as a potential technology for preventing this greenhouse gas from entering the atmosphere. As suitable locations for geological storage may be diverse, the applicability of various geodetic and geophysical methods for surveillance and monitoring purposes must be investigated. In this paper, we evaluate the ground surface displacement at the Ketzin pilot site for CO2 storage in Germany, using satellite-based measurements and hydromechanical simulations. The InSAR observations, using more than four years of TerraSAR-X data from 2009 to 2013, reflect the stability of the Ketzin pilot site (long-term velocity <0.5 mm/year) in conjunction with the accumulated CO2 volume in the reservoir. This can be due to the low overall pressure change, with a maximum of 16 bar, which is not causing significant surface displacement. However, such overall stability can be interrupted temporarily, as detected within the InSAR time series for a distinct period of noninjection from May to December 2012 (subsidence of 2.8 mm). This is supported by our hydromechanical simulation results, exhibiting a maximum ground surface subsidence of approximately 1 mm during this period, and by a comparison with variations in bottomhole pressure, indicating a positive correlation of 80%.

AB  - Agricultural activities conducted in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, show a significant decline of productivity levels. In this study, a remote and automatic agricultural monitoring system is presented as an effective alternative to the most traditional in situ measurements and observations. We investigated the use of phenological variables and metrics extracted from satellite in accurate crop classification and monitoring. Vegetation indices extracted from Landsat 8 imagery are capable to track the vegetation development through the year and from them the phenological profile can be retrieved and implemented into a multi-temporal automatic classification process to detect agricultural vegetated areas and to discriminate among different crop species. The phenological profiles extracted by satellite images were compared with crop calendar data, compiled by FAO for the area of interest.

T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current global environmental especially climate changes necessitate revisiting approaches to ecosystems management in order to improve productivity in agroecosystems. This study was conducted to identify influential biophysical factors controlling ecosystems productivity, their spatial heterogeneous effect and estimate suitability of the land for production in the tropical Lake Kyoga Basin in Eastern Uganda. The study spanned 15 years (2001-2015). We used a simplified integrated approach to model productivity as a function of climatic, topographic, vegetation, soil attributes (2001-2013, period) using statistical, and geospatial models implemented in a GIS environment. Soil data was obtained through a field survey coupled with secondary data. Climatic and vegetative data were obtained as imagery data from online repositories, while topographic parameters were extracted from a 30-m digital elevation model. MODIS NDVI data was used as proxy of productivity. We used geographical weighted regression to assess the spatial heterogeneity effect of soil, climate and topography on productivity and fuzzy approach to capture gradient of suitable land for production. The results revealed soil types and precipitation as the dominant biophysical factors controlling the productivity. The factors, explained 52% of the observed variation in productivity. Results on soil attributes indicate a fertility problem as OM, N and K levels were below the critical levels for good crop production, hence only 40% of the soils are productive. The results captured well the spatial heterogeneity of the factors influencing productivity and land suitability for production. Overall, 69% of the basin was found to be suitable for production. Thus, the results of this study will motivate planners, decision-makers and researchers to analyse critically the suitability of adopted production technologies such fertilizer applications in the basin. Moreover, the concern authorities to explore external sources of food for areas with less suitable land for production, given projected climate changes.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variation of daytime and nighttime MODIS land surface temperature across Nepal
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable for assessing climate change and related environmental impacts observed in recent decades. Regular monitoring of LST using satellite sensors such as MODES has the advantage of global coverage, including topographically complex regions such as Nepal. In order to assess the climatic and environmental changes, daytime and nighttime LST trend analysis from 2000 to 2017 using Terra-MODS monthly daytime and nighttime LST datasets at seasonal and annual scales over the territory of Nepal was performed. The magnitude of the trend was quantified using ordinary linear regression, while the statistical significance of the trend was identified by the Modified Mann-Kendall test. Our findings suggest that the nighttime LST in Nepal increased more prominently compared to the daytime LST, with more pronounced warming in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The annual nighttime LST increased at a rate of 0.05 K yr(-1) (p < 0.01), while the daytime LST change was statistically insignificant. Spatial heterogeneity of the LST and LST change was observed both during the day and the night. The daytime LST remained fairly unchanged in large parts of Nepal, while a nighttime LST rise was dominant all across Nepal in the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. Our results on LST trends and their spatial distribution can facilitate a better understanding of regional climate changes.

TI  - Land degradation assessment in the Argentinean Puna: Comparing expert knowledge with satellite-derived information
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Puna region, located in NW Argentina, is a dry highland with many endemic species and significant traditional cultural heritage. The Puna was a pilot region for the Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands project (LADA-FAO) which aimed at assessing desertification status in different land use systems (LUS). The results of these assessments are used for reporting to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and for Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) monitoring. The assessment was performed using an expert knowledge questionnaire following the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies initiative methodology (LADA-WOCAT), on LUS map units obtained by a participatory mapping methodology. In this article we compare the inferences on land degradation status and its temporal trends derived from LADA-WOCAT method with those obtained from remotely sensed data. Our aim is to understand similarities and differences in the assessments in order to provide recommendations and suggestions on improved LDN assessment methods, reporting and monitoring. Our results suggest that the LADA-WOCAT participatory mapping successfully delineated LUSs with different phenological characteristics over an extended area. However, the trend and the degradation processes described by experts at the LUS scale did not agree with the ones derived from satellite data. Results obtained at pixel scale help in identifying areas undergoing potential human induced degradation processes and specific areas of agreement between methods. The spatial scale of land degradation assessments obtained by either satellite or expert knowledge may impact the accuracy of the final results. A methodology integrating satellite and expert opinion data at an appropriate scale needs to coalesce to make the most of both data sources and gain accuracy in land degradation and LDN assessments.

TI  - Validation and Application of European Beech Phenological Metrics Derived from MODIS Data along an Altitudinal Gradient
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring plant phenology is one of the means of detecting the response of vegetation to changing environmental conditions. One approach for the study of vegetation phenology from local to global scales is to apply satellite-based indices. We investigated the potential of phenological metrics from moderate resolution remotely sensed data to monitor the altitudinal variations in phenological phases of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Phenological metrics were derived from the NDVI annual trajectories fitted with double sigmoid logistic function. Validation of the satellite-derived phenological metrics was necessary, thus the multiple-year ground observations of phenological phases from twelve beech stands along the altitudinal gradient were employed. In five stands, the validation process was supported with annual (in 2011) phenological observations of the undergrowth and understory vegetation, measurements of the leaf area index (LAI), and with laboratory spectral analyses of forest components reflecting the red and near-infrared radiation. Non-significant differences between the satellite-derived phenological metrics and the in situ observed phenological phases of the beginning of leaf onset (LO_10); end of leaf onset (LO_100); and 80% leaf coloring (LC_80) were detected. Next, the altitude dependent variations of the phenological metrics were investigated in all beech-dominated pixels over the area between latitudes 47 degrees 44 N and 49 degrees 37 N, and longitudes 16 degrees 50 E and 22 degrees 34 E (Slovakia, Central Europe). In all cases, this large-scale regression revealed non-linear relationships. Since spring phenological metrics showed strong dependence on altitude, only a weak relationship was detected between autumn phenological metric and altitude. The effect of altitude was evaluated through differences in local climatic conditions, especially temperature and precipitation. We used normal values from the last 30 years to evaluate the altitude-conditioned differences in the growing season length in 12 study stands. The approach presented in this paper contributes to a more explicit understanding of satellite data-based beech phenology along the altitudinal gradient, and will be useful for determining the optimal distribution range of European beech under changing climate conditions.

AB  - In this paper an overview of the TerraSAR-X/PAZ constellation applications, where two independent X-Band SAR missions work together to provide operational services is presented. Hisdesat and Airbus Defence and Space have teamed up to establish the first steps of the WorldSAR Constellation and to bring all benefits of a true constellation to users. The combined imaging and revisit characteristics of TerraSAR-X and PAZ will foster the development of operational applications satisfying important customer requirements related to data age, update frequency, and coverage. This paper is written from the perspective of a commercial data and service provider and focuses on three selected applications directly benefiting from frequent revisit capability of constellation. These three applications are wide area ship-detection, rapid multi temporal InSAR applications including Amplitude and Coherence Change detection and Stereo Radargrammetry Ground Control Points. The aim of this study is to validate and qualify the combined usage of TerraSAR/TandDEM and PAZ data sets for joint applications.

AB  - The SENTINEL influenza surveillance system is an important tool for monitoring influenza in Poland. Data from this system are necessary to determine the dynamics of seasonal infections and to announce the epidemic by the country level. For the 2017/18 epidemic season, the dominance of influenza type B was recorded and the highest percentage of infections was recorded in the age group 45-64 years. Among the subtypes of influenza type A, A/H1N1/pdm09 was the predominated subtype. Most cases were reported in the age group of 26-44 and 0-4 years. The influenza virus frequently undergoes modifications. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly monitor the emerging strains around the world.

AB  - Conventional measurement methods with low spatial resolution, differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (D-InSAR) is susceptible to signal decorrelation and atmospheric delay, so InSAR time series analysis is widely used for detection and monitoring of slow surface deformation. Persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PS-InSAR) is based on a large number of SAR images, but small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) only needs a small number of images and performs better than PS-InSAR for obtaining nonlinear deformation information. In this paper, 21 COSMO-SkyMed radar images acquired between 2016 and 2017 are processed for land subsidence monitoring with the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) approach in Yongshan County transmission corridors in China.

AB  - Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) is a key indicator for assessing wildfire risk and fire spread rate since fire normally broke out under low FMC condition. However, how the FMC driving wildfire activities is still unclear. To understand the relation between FMC and fire occurrence, this study focused on analyzing the FMC retrieved from Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) and historical fires extracted from MODIS Burned Area (BA) product MCD64A1 to determine critical FMC thresholds for wildfire occurrences in southwest China. The results indicated that there were three significant FMC thresholds for forest: 138.9%, 119.0% and 53.1%, and three thresholds for grassland: 138.3%, 70.2%, and 10.6% that associated with the occurrence of wildfires. Large fires and high frequency of fires became vulnerable when FMC fell below those thresholds.

AB  - In this study, integrating Landsat-derived land uses in continuous years with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model, we have quantified the inter-annual attribution of runoff change in the Qingliu River, China. We found that runoff increased insignificantly during 1960-2012 and changed abruptly in 1984. The land use changed year-by-year mainly from forest and farmland to residential area. Climate variability dominated runoff increase (with a mean of 115.77%) during 1989-2012 except for 2005 and 2007, during which human activity was the main contributor. In comparison, land use changes increased runoff and exhibited relatively small contribution to the runoff change over time. The findings would help people better understand the behavior of the Qingliu River and benefit decision-makers for adaptive water resources management in a changing environment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variations in Dianchi Lake's Surface Water Temperature From 2001 to 2017 Under the Influence of Climate Warming
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Surface Water Temperature (LSWT) is one of the most important biological environmental conditions that determine the biological status of lakes. It is the most important indicator that affects the decomposition of matter and the metabolism of living things, and directs the biomass production processes in lakes. Variations in LSWT are the main factor causing changes in the physical and chemical processes, as well as dynamic phenomena in lake water. In this study, MODIS (Terra) remote sensing images of 2001-2017 were used as the data source, and the LSWT of Dianchi Lake from 2001 to 2017 were extracted with the MOD11A2 LST product. Analysis was then conducted on the temporal and spatial variatons of the lakes's LSWT across the past 17 years, and the influences of climate change on LSWT. The research results show that overall, Dianchi LSWT has been on the rise over the past 17 years. This trend was especially evident in the lake's average annual daytime and nighttime temperature, which has significantly increased by about 0.12 degrees C/yr(-1) (P<0.002) and 0.09 degrees C/yr(-1) (P<0.05), respectively. Correlation analysis reveals that the correlation between air temperature and the average annual water temperature of Dianchi Lake was low, with daytime correlation coefficient being r = 0.041, and nighttime correlation coeffIcient being r = 0.012. On the other hand, average monthly air temperature presents a high correlation with monthly average water temperatures. The coefficient with nighttime monthly water temperature is r>0.82 (P<0.001), and the coefficient with daytime monthly water temperature is r>0.63 (P<0.02).

T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we used radar data from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 satellite to build biomass estimation models and then create a biomass map in Can Gio Mangrove Biosphere Reserve. We used the single variable regression and multivariate regression method, in which 30 sample plots for training model and 15 sample plots for validation model, the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used as metrics for evaluating the biomass estimates. The regression analyses showed that the HV polarization was highly related to the biomass, linear model (R-2 = 0.74; RMSE = 28.16), exponential model (R-2 = 0.69; RMSE = 28.73), and polynomial model (R-2 = 0.76; RMSE = 28.03). However, the HH polarization did not show a high relationship with the above-ground biomass, linear model (R-2 = 0.42), exponential model (R-2 = 0.46), or polynomial model (R-2 = 0.42). We also tried multiple linear regression between the parameters extracted from radar image (HH, HV, and textures) and field biomass. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between the biomass and two independent variables (HH and HV) was 0.79, and RMSE was 29.78. However, the model with the combination of HV variable and eight texture variables provided a better result (R-2 = 0.81; RMSE = 27.76), in other word the model could explain 81% variation of forest biomass. This model was used to produce the aboveground biomass map in Can Gio Biosphere Reserve in South of Vietnam.

TI  - Complement components as promoters of immunological tolerance in dendritic cells
T2  - SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Complement and dendritic cells (DCs) share many functional features that drive the outcome of immune inflammatory processes. Both have a sentinel function, acting as danger sensors specialized for a rapid, comprehensive and selective action against potential threats without damaging the healthy host cells. But while complement has been considered as a "master alarm" system poised for direct pathogen killing, DCs are regarded as "master regulators" or orchestrators of a vast range of effector immune cells for an effective immune response against threatening insults. The original definition of the complement system, coined to denote its auxiliary function to enhance or assist in the role of antibodies or phagocytes to clear microbes or damaged cells, envisaged an important crosstalk between the complement and the mononuclear phagocyte systems. More recent studies have shown that, depending on the microenvironmental conditions, several complement effectors are competent to influence the differentiation and/or function of different DC subsets toward immunogenicity or tolerance. In this review we will infer about the capability of complement activators and inhibitors to "condition" a tolerogenic and anti-inflammatory immune response by direct interaction with DC surface receptors, and about the implications of this knowledge to devise new complement-based therapeutic approaches for autoimmune pathologies.

AB  - A revised independent component analysis (ICA) algorithm was developed to improve the performance in the removal of cirrus cloud effects within spectral data of Landsat-8 Bands 1-7. The prior was that the reflectance values in the cirrus spectral band should be zero or near zero after the cloud removal. Then, the cloud component derived using the forward ICA transformation was revised and use to remove the cloud effects. After the inverse ICA transformation, the cloud removal was completed. Applying the algorithm to the Landsat-8 sub-image of 041/036 (path/row) acquired on 14 March 2015, we noted that cirrus clouds in Bands 1-7 disappeared visually. The cloud-free sub-image of the same location acquired on 1 April was extracted and used as the reference image in the algorithm verification. After the algorithm, R-2 values of the March image and reference image increased significantly. The revised algorithm was effective and valid. The revised one outperformed the original ICA algorithm in the comparison of both algorithms.

AB  - The paper quantitatively compares the results of calculations of the electron density Ne by the International Reference Ionosphere model IRI-2016 with experimental data obtained from the DE-2 satellite. It considers 648 variants of heliogeophysical conditions. The deviation of theoretical estimates from experimental values is within the instrumental accuracy of satellite data in an average of 27% of cases. It is concluded that the IRI-2016 model, the approximation coefficients of which in functional dependences are associated with heights of the F-region, gives negative values of the efficiency coefficient of the predicted electron density in 73% of cases in the outer ionosphere at altitudes over 500 km.

AB  - Soil erosion can lead to land degradation, soil fertility decline, and further affect agricultural development. Soil erosion is serious in Youyang County of China and hinders the sustainable development of this region. This research attempts to map the extent of soil erosion in Youyang County and analyze the intensity of each erosion level. The Landsat8 OLI data is used as data source for calculating the vegetation coverage and interpreting the land cover of Youyang County. The ASTER GDEM product provides the slope information of this area. A three-factor model is used for evaluating the intensity of soil erosion. The results show that the area proportion of soil erosion in Youyang County is 65.17%, and the moderate erosion is the highest, which is 24.5%. The research results will provide a basis for future environmental governance.

TI  - IMPROVED VICARIOUS RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION METHOD CONSIDERING ADJACENCY EFFECT FOR HIGH RESOLUTION OPTICAL SENSORS

AB  - When using field calibration site to perform on-orbit radiometric calibration for a space-borne remote sensor, the observed signal of the sensor may contain energy from adjacent pixels, due to existence of the earth atmosphere and sensor viewing characteristics. Hence the accuracy of radiometric calibration will be decreased to some extent. When calibration of high-resolution sensor is concerned, the non-uniformity of the ground target will be relatively more obvious. In addition, if the brightness contrast of neighboring targets is not small, the impact of adjacency effect will be more outstanding. How to quantitatively analyze and eliminate the influence of this kind of adjacency effect, becomes an actual demand to reduce the uncertainty of on-orbit radiometric calibration. Aiming at the adjacent effect caused by atmospheric multiple scattering, this paper analyzed radiation transfer mechanism first, then constructed a local atmospheric point spread function model using long time-series satellite-ground synchronous observation data, developed an adjacency effect correction method used in on-orbit vicarious calibration, which considers background reflectance spectral information. Test on Sentinel-2A imagery indicates that the proposed correction method can effectively alleviate the influence of adjacency effect in vicarious calibration.

TI  - Baseline Estimation Using DEM Prior Knowledge and Capability Analysis for Gaofen-3 Repeat ass SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the study on the digital elevation model (DEM) reconstruction using Gaofen-3 satellite repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry is presented. The coherence of the single-look complex (SLC) images and residuals of interferogram provide a powerful guarantee for interferometric processing for Gaofen-3. Baseline estimation is the key factor to generate accurate DEM with SAR interferometry. This paper uses the coarse orbit data and the precise orbit data of Gaofen-3 to carry on the baseline estimation and uses the prior coarse DEM information to refine the baseline estimation. Then, the topographic height is reconstructed with more precise spatial baseline. An experiment is conducted to verify the conclusion, and some mountain and flatten region are chosen as the study area. The results show that the DEM errors based on the prior DEM method are rapidly converged compared with the ones based on the orbit data method. Therefore, benefiting from the precise orbit data of the Gaofen-3 satellite, the accuracy of the baseline estimation can be improved further by using the method based on prior DEM information; thus, higher accuracy of DEM can be achieved so that Gaofen-3 repeat-pass data have some good characteristics, such as high imaging quality, stable spatial baseline, and high correlation, which has a good repeat-pass SAR interferometry application prospect.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - The accurate detection of clouds in images is prerequisite for remote sensing image processing and applications. Traditional cloud detection methods rely on particular sensors, and the artificial neural network method only uses spectral or spatial information. In this paper, a novel method combining multiple features based on deep learning (MDL) for cloud detection is proposed. Deep neural network (DNN) and fully convolutional neural (FCN) network are applied to extract the spectral and spatial features of the images respectively, and the features are used for the input of another DNN for re-learning while the image data also serves as an input to the DNN. Finally, joint feature obtained by relearning is classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM). The method makes full use of the spectral-spatial information of the images to detect cloud comprehensively. A comparative experiment was carried on Landsat 8 images containing different types of clouds over various underlying surfaces. The results show that the MDL method performs favorably, which is significantly improved compared to the single neural network algorithm and the function of mask (FMask) algorithm.

TI  - Habitat modification in relation to coastal reclamation and its impacts on waterbirds along China's coast
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern coast of China provides a network of Important Bird Areas (IBAs) as feeding and breeding habitats, as well as migratory corridors for a large variety of waterbirds. However, long-term coastal reclamation has greatly encroached on coastal wetlands and undermined their functions as waterbird habitats. To identify the impacts of coastal reclamation on waterbird habitats in 2014, we analyzed coastal wetland modifications that have been caused by various reclamation types in 38 IBAs along China's coastline by using remotely sensed data. The distribution data of major waterbird families in 15 IBAs were collected to explore their population responses to habitat modification. The densities of their population were calculated to compare the habitat preferences to the natural and modified habitats. In addition, the index of Reclamation Intensity was used to evaluate the comprehensive impacts of coastal reclamation on waterbirds. The results show that more than half of the wetland areas in the 38 IBAs have undergone modification from various types of land use. The different habitat preferences indicate that the original habitat suitability for waterbirds has been perturbed considerably by the coastal reclamation. Our findings revealed that there are still notable conservation gaps for waterbirds along China's coastline and the opportunity exists for trading off waterbird conservation versus socioeconomic benefits by wise use of artificial wetlands as alternative and provisional habitats for waterbirds.

AB  - This study aims to establish a model for environmental situation assessment using hyperspectral data and apply it to regional and planning environmental assessments in the Northwest. The main research contents include: 1. The fusion of multi-level remote sensing technology. Hyperspectral data is a powerful complement to the ground environment monitoring data with its large scale and high precision. A multi-level remote sensing data processing mode integrating ground test, UAV remote sensing and satellite remote sensing is established. 2. The establishment of quantitative remote sensing analysis model. By determining the distribution range, location and extent of the relevant indicators of the target environment, combining the fixed field survey and the analysis of the on-site monitoring data, the eigenvalues are obtained, and the two are combined to establish a quantitative model for the identification of the fine environmental indicators of the environmental situation changes at large scales. 3. Application in the assessment of regional environmental situation in the Gobi region of the northwestern desert. Through the fusion analysis of ground test and high-resolution satellite remote sensing data, a quantitative model of regional desertification, plant disease and other environmental indicators is established. Combined with the analysis of hyperspectral remote sensing data in the planned area within two years, the progress and trend of environmental situation change can be known. This technology can be used to determine the impact of land desertification on planning and construction and the degree of risk.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between upper extremity lymphatics and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer patients. Methods. Forty-four patients who underwent axillary reverse mapping (ARM) during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with SNL biopsy (SLNB) between February 2017 and October 2017 were investigated. ARM was performed using indocyanine green (ICG) to locate the upper extremity lymphatics; methylene blue dye was injected intradermally for SLN mapping. Results. ARM nodes were found in the ALND fields of all examined patients. The rate of identification of upper extremity lymphatics within the SLNB field was 65.9% (29 of 44). The ARM nodes were involved in metastases arising from primary breast tumors in 7 of the patients (15.9%), while no metastases were detected in pathologic axillary lymph node-negative patients. Lymphatics from the upper extremity drained into the SLNs in 5 of the 44 patients (11.4%); their ARM-detected nodes were found to be in close proximity to the SLNs. Conclusions. The ARM nodes and SLNs are closely related and share lymphatic drainage routes. The ARM procedure using fluorescence imaging is both feasible and, in patients who are SLN negative, oncologically safe. ARM using ICG is therefore effective for identifying and preserving upper extremity lymphatics, and SLNB combined with ARM appears to be a promising surgical refinement for preventing upper extremity lymphoedema.

AB  - "Ghost city" phenomenon refers to a phenomenon of serious imbalance between land urbanization and population urbanization in China. It is necessary to identify and evaluate the change of this phenomenon in long time series, so as to prevent and control its tendency. In this paper, we proposed a novel ghost city index (NGCI) that combines the change of nighttime light intensity in the built-up area featuring spatial-temporal characteristics, the change of the plaque area in the built-up area, and built-up area-population proportion with present situation. These parameters considering the spatio-temporal variations from multi-source and multi-temporal remote sensing data are introduced in the NGCI in comparison to the conventional GCI based on statistical yearbook data. Moreover, the emergence and development processes of "ghost city" phenomenon are taken into account in long temporal series to realize the fusion of statistical analysis and the remote sensing technology as well as the present situation and the spatio-temporal characteristics. In this paper, the rationality of identifying NGCI has been conducted with the development land per capita in all cities subordinated to Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 2012 and 2015 as the reference standard. Comparing to the conventional GCI, NGCI identifying results were highly in consistent with the numerical distribution and variation trend of development land index per capita towards the identification of "ghost city" phenonmenon.

AB  - Hyperspectral image is usually composed of hundreds of bands rich of spatial and spectral information. And this is an advantage for the common remotely sensed data. Thus, the classification of hyperspectral image could be of great value. However, the dimensionality of hyperspectral image may lead to the curse of dimensionality phenomenon when it is directly used for land use classification or other applications, making it difficult to be utilized effectively. In this paper, we presented a novel classification framework with capsule network based on the spectral and spatial information of hyperspectral images. At first, we use principal components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionalities of hyperspectral image. Then, we use the capsule network to classify hyperspectral image. Our experimental result showed the novel classification framework is more efficient than other six popular methods. Therefore, the capsule network method is robust for hyperspectral image classification.

AB  - Land use transformation plays a key role in spatial planning, it refers to the changes in land use morphology including dominant morphology and recessive morphology of a certain region over a certain period of time driven by socio-economic change and innovation. In this paper, we chose the arable land to do study. As an important subsystem in the natural ecosystem, the arable land not only guarantees food security, but also has ecological service functions. To date, the arable land transformation provides basis for management, make a decision and layout of spatial planning, efficient and rational of land resource use, promoting area sustainable development in rapid urbanization areas. At present, the introduction of land use transition to the academic circle in China becomes a hot topic, researchers focuses on researches related socio-economic development, the spatial-temporal variation characteristics of land use function or land use/ cover change, the driving mechanism based on land use transformation, analyzing the process of land use transformation and the changes of ecosystem service function, and how affects the land resource management, development of urban and rural, and land consolidation. As one of the important part for change of ecosystem service, land use transformation is not only changing the natural landscape, but also to change the function of ecosystem service. Recently, issues related to land use transformation in China have attracted interest among a wide variety of researchers as well as government officials. In this paper, we choose Maoming as the study area. It is a city which is located in the southernmost part of China, the westernmost part of Guangdong Province. I used remote sensing data in different periods of 2010, 2015 and 2018, analyzing the land use structure in different periods using geographic information techniques, and exploring the driving mechanism of land use transformation spatial-temporal patterns, and their effects on ecosystem service change. Driven by the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area, Maoming has unique geographic advantages and ecological environment, the transformation between the different land use types during a certain period of time arise will be changed by the socio-economic development, and also it affects the ecosystem service value and function. This paper analyzes the effects of land use change for the supply of four service function in ecosystem service: supply function, regulating function, cultural function and supporting function, from the perspective of land use morphology transformation (the dominant/recessive morphology). Therefore, it is of great significance to carry out study of land use transformation and eco-environment service change and explore the influence factors between them for understanding the regional environment and achieving coordinated development of socioeconomic and ecological environments.
