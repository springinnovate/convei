TI  - Risk factors for axillary lymph node metastases in clinical stage T1-2N0M0 breast cancer patients
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) is commonly the earliest detectable clinical manifestation of breast cancer when distant metastasis emerges. This study aimed to explore the influencing factors of ALNM and develop models that can predict its occurrence preoperatively.Cases of sonographically visible clinical stage T1-2N0M0 breast cancers treated with breast and axillary surgery at West China Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between ALNM and variables. Decision tree analyses were performed to construct predictive models using the C5.0 packages.Of the 1671 tumors, 541 (32.9%) showed axillary lymph node positivity on final surgical histopathologic analysis. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, tumor size (P<.001), infiltration of subcutaneous adipose tissue (P<.001), infiltration of the interstitial adipose tissue (P=.031), and tumor quadrant locations (P<.001) were significantly correlated with ALNM. Furthermore, the accuracy in the decision tree model was 69.52%, and the false-negative rate (FNR) was 74.18%. By using the error-cost matrix algorithm, the FNR significantly decreased to 14.75%, particularly for nodes 5, 8, and 13 (FNR: 11.4%, 9.09%, and 14.29% in the training set and 18.1%,14.71%, and 20% in the test set, respectively). In summary, our study demonstrated that tumor lesion boundary, tumor size, and tumor quadrant locations were the most important factors affecting ALNM in cT1-2N0M0 stage breast cancer. The decision tree built using these variables reached a slightly higher FNR than sentinel lymph node dissection in predicting ALNM in some selected patients.

TI  - SLIC segmentation method for full-polarised remote-sensing image
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING-JOE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote-sensing data acquisition technology means that the resolution of remote-sensing image has been continuously improved, resulting in the large scale of remote-sensing image data and the increase of redundant information, which restricts the image processing and analysis. However, super-pixel segmentation method mainly aimed at the general image segmentation algorithm, rarely for remote-sensing image. Therefore, here, the polarisation decomposition of fullpolarised remote-sensing images is used to synthesise pseudo-colour images. Then, based on the region, the image segmentation algorithm based on the colour feature of SLIC super-pixel segmentation algorithm is used to make it have important application value in remote-sensing image target extraction. Here, the image of Danjiangkou reservoir obtained by high-resolution space-borne SAR is selected as the research object. Finally, the polarisation decomposition and segmentation of full-polarised remote-sensing images are realised, and the advantages of SLIC super-pixel algorithm are proved.

TI  - Detecting Building Changes between Airborne Laser Scanning and Photogrammetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting topographic changes in an urban environment and keeping city-level point clouds up-to-date are important tasks for urban planning and monitoring. In practice, remote sensing data are often available only in different modalities for two epochs. Change detection between airborne laser scanning data and photogrammetric data is challenging due to the multi-modality of the input data and dense matching errors. This paper proposes a method to detect building changes between multimodal acquisitions. The multimodal inputs are converted and fed into a light-weighted pseudo-Siamese convolutional neural network (PSI-CNN) for change detection. Different network configurations and fusion strategies are compared. Our experiments on a large urban data set demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our change map achieves a recall rate of 86.17%, a precision rate of 68.16%, and an F-1-score of 76.13%. The comparison between Siamese architecture and feed-forward architecture brings many interesting findings and suggestions to the design of networks for multimodal data processing.

TI  - Automated Surface Water Extraction Combining Sentinel-2 Imagery and OpenStreetMap Using Presence and Background Learning (PBL) Algorithm
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water bodies play important roles in socioeconomic development and ecosystem balance. The fast-developing technology of remote sensing offers opportunities for the automatic extraction and dynamic monitoring of surface water bodies. Compared with other medium- and low-spatial-resolution remote sensing images, such as Landsat and MODIS, Sentinel-2 imagery provides higher spatial resolution and revisit frequency, making it more suitable for surface water extraction. The existing research works on surface water extraction using Sentinel-2 imagery remain focusing on the construction of water indexes, which is easily affected by shadows and built-up areas. In this study, we propose an automated surface water extraction method based on the presence and background learning algorithm (ASWE-PBL) using Sentinel-2 imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The OSM data are used as the auxiliary data to automatically select water samples, and the PBL algorithm is adopted to predict the water presence probability. ASWE-PBL is validated using six typical study areas in China, and the modified normalized difference water index, the automated water extraction index, and the random forest classifier are employed for comparison. Moreover, feature optimization, parameter sensitivity, computation cost, and future work are analyzed and discussed. The experimental results show that ASWE-PBL can effectively suppress noise caused by shadows and built-up areas and can obtain the highest kappa coefficient for five study areas but not for Guangzhou and that the ten-spectral-band composite of Sentinel-2 imagery is a better feature combination scheme than that of spectral and water indexes.

TI  - Multi-feature Map Pyramid Fusion Deep Network for Semantic Segmentation on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing multiple data (elevation information) to assist remote sensing image segmentation is an important research topic in recent years. However, the existing methods usually directly use multivariate data as the input of the model, which fails to make full use of the multi-level features. In addition, the target size varies in remote sensing images, for some small targets, such as vehicles, houses, etc., it is difficult to achieve detailed segmentation. Considering these problems, a Multi-Feature map Pyramid fusion deep Network (MFPNet) is proposed, which utilizes optical remote sensing images and elevation data as input to extract multi-level features from images. Then the pyramid pooling structure is introduced to extract the multi-scale features from different levels. Finally, a multi-level and multi-scale feature fusion strategy is designed, which utilizes comprehensively the feature information of multivariate data to achieve detailed segmentation of remote sensing images. Experiment results on the Vaihingen dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Detecting change-point, trend, and seasonality in satellite time series data to track abrupt changes and nonlinear dynamics: A Bayesian ensemble algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite time-series data are bolstering global change research, but their use to elucidate land changes and vegetation dynamics is sensitive to algorithmic choices. Different algorithms often give inconsistent or sometimes conflicting interpretations of the same data. This lack of consensus has adverse implications and can be mitigated via ensemble modeling, an algorithmic paradigm that combines many competing models rather than choosing only a single "best" model. Here we report one such time-series decomposition algorithm for deriving nonlinear ecosystem dynamics across multiple timescales-A Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST). As an ensemble algorithm, BEAST quantifies the relative usefulness of individual decomposition models, leveraging all the models via Bayesian model averaging. We tested it upon simulated, Landsat, and MODIS data. BEAST detected changepoints, seasonality, and trends in the data reliably; it derived realistic nonlinear trends and credible uncertainty measures (e.g., occurrence probability of changepoints over time) some information difficult to derive by conventional single-best-model algorithms but critical for interpretation of ecosystem dynamics and detection of low-magnitude disturbances. The combination of many models enabled BEAST to alleviate model misspecification, address algorithmic uncertainty, and reduce over fitting. BEAST is generically applicable to time-series data of all kinds. It offers a new analytical option for robust changepoint detection and nonlinear trend analysis and will help exploit environmental time-series data for probing patterns and drivers of ecosystem dynamics.

TI  - Sentinel: Failure Recovery in Centralized Traffic Engineering
T2  - IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - Network failures are common in wide area networks (WANs). Failure recovery in a software-defined WAN takes minutes or longer, as the controller needs to calculate a new traffic engineering solution and update the forwarding rules across all switches. This severely degrades application performance. Existing reactive and proactive approaches inevitably lead to transient congestion or bandwidth underutilization and impair the efficiency of running the expensive WANs. We present Sentinel, a novel failure recovery system for traffic engineering in software-defined WANs. Sentinel pre-computes and installs backup tunnels to accelerate failure recovery. When a link fails, switches locally redirect traffic to backup tunnels and recover immediately in the data plane, thus substantially reducing the transient congestion compared to reactive rescaling. On the other hand, Sentinel completely avoids the bandwidth headroom required by existing proactive approaches. Extensive experiments on Mininet and numerical simulations show that similar to state-of-the-art FFC, Sentinel reduces congestion by 45% compared with rescaling, and its algorithm runs much faster than FFC. Sentinel only introduces a small number of additional forwarding rules and can be readily implemented on today's Openflow switches.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Variation Following the 2017 Mw 7.3 Iran Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During an earthquake, crustal deformation, fluid flow, and temperature variation are coupled; however, earthquake-related land surface temperature (LST) variations remain unclear. To determine whether post-seismic fluid migration can cause changes in LST, and taking the Mw 7.3 2017 Iran earthquake as an example, we modeled surface cooling (CA) and warming (WA) areas induced by co-seismic slip and fluid migration using a thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) coupled numerical simulation. Moreover, using nighttime LST data with 15-min resolution, the daily attenuation coefficient k of nighttime LST was extracted by attenuation function fitting, and the trend of the k time series was analyzed using the Mann-Kendall and Sen's methods. Based on the comparison of k trends between the post-seismic and 2010-2016 periods, we obtained cooling and warming trends for the modeled CA and WA. The numerical simulation and observational data show good consistency, and both indicate that fluid migration caused by crustal deformation can lead to changes in LST. The numerical simulations show that after the Iran earthquake, the surface projection area of co-seismic slip correlated with a cooling area (CA), while the surrounding area correlated with a warming area (WA). For the LST observational data, the post-seismic k trends of the calculated CA and WA are positive and negative, indicating sustained cooling and warming processes, respectively. This study provides evidence that LST variation is caused by co-seismic crustal deformation and fluid migration and reveals the coupled evolution of deformation, fluid, and temperature fields. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms of seismic thermal anomalies.

TI  - Investigating the Impact of Land Parcelization on Forest Composition and Structure in Southeastern Ohio Using Multi-Source Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forestland parcelization (i.e., a process by which large parcels of forestland ownership are divided into many small parcels) presents an increasing challenge to sustainable forest development in the United States. In Southeastern Ohio, forests also experienced intensive forestland parcelization, where the majority of forest owners own parcels smaller than 10 acres currently. To better understand the impact of forestland parcelization on forest development, this study employed multi-source remotely sensed data and land ownership data in Hocking County, Ohio to examine the relationship between forestland parcel size and forest attributes, including forest composition and structure. Our results show that private forestland parcels are generally smaller than public forestland (the average parcel sizes are 21.5 vs. 275.0 acres). Compared with private lands, public lands have higher values in all forest attributes, including forest coverage, abundance of oak-dominant stands, canopy height and aboveground biomass. A further investigation focusing on private forestland reveals that smaller parcels tend to have smaller forest coverage, less greenness, lower height and aboveground biomass, indicating that forests in smaller parcels may experience more human disturbances than larger parcels. The results also show that logarithmic models can well quantify the non-linear relationship between forest attributes and parcel size in the study area. Our study suggests that forestland parcelization indeed has negative effects on forest development, so it is very important to take appropriate measures to protect forests in small ownership parcels.

TI  - Effect of Mathematical Expression of Vegetation Indices on the Estimation of Phenology Trends from Satellite Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices (VIs) from satellite remote sensing have been extensively applied to analyze the trends of vegetation phenology. In this paper, the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and SR (simple ration), which are calculated from the same spectral bands of MODIS data with different mathematical expressions, were used to extract the start date (SOS) and end date (EOS) of the growing season in northern China and Mongolia from 2000 to 2015. The results show that different vegetation indices would lead to differences in vegetation phenology especially in their trends. The mean SOS from NDVI is 15.5 d earlier than that from SR, and the mean EOS from NDVI is 13.4 d later than that from SR. It should be noted that 16.3% of SOS and 17.2% of EOS derived from NDVI and SR exhibit opposite trends. The phenology dates and trends from NDVI are also inconsistent with those of SR among various vegetation types. These differences based on different mathematical expressions in NDVI and SR result from different resistances to noise and sensitivities to spectral signal at different stage of growing season. NDVI is prone to be effected more by low noise and is less sensitive to dense vegetation. While SR is affected more by high noise and is less sensitive to sparse vegetation. Therefore, vegetation indices are one of the uncertainty sources of remote sensing-based phenology, and appropriate indices should be used to detect vegetation phenology for different growth stages and estimate phenology trends.

TI  - Systematic review of the incidence, presentation and management of gastroduodenal artery pseudoaneurysm after pancreatic resection
T2  - BJS OPEN
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Gastroduodenal artery (GDA) pseudoaneurysm is a serious complication following pancreatic resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This review aimed to report the incidence of GDA pseudoaneurysm after pancreatic surgery, and describe clinical presentation and management. Methods MEDLINE and Embase were searched systematically for clinical studies evaluating postoperative GDA pseudoaneurysm. Incidence was calculated by dividing total number of GDA pseudoaneurysms by the total number of pancreatic operations. Additional qualitative data related to GDA pseudoaneurysm presentation and management following pancreatic resection were extracted and reviewed from individual reports. Results Nine studies were selected for systematic review involving 4227 pancreatic operations with 55 GDA pseudoaneurysms, with a reported incidence of 1 center dot 3 (range 0 center dot 2-8 center dot 3) per cent. Additional data were extracted from 39 individual examples of GDA pseudoaneurysm from 14 studies. The median time for haemorrhage after surgery was at 15 (range 4-210) days. A preceding complication in the postoperative period was documented in four of 21 patients (67 per cent), and sentinel bleeding was observed in 14 of 20 patients (70 per cent). Postoperative complications after pseudoaneurysm management occurred in two-thirds of the patients (14 of 21). The overall survival rate was 85 per cent (33 of 39). Conclusion GDA pseudoaneurysm is a rare yet serious cause of haemorrhage after pancreatic surgery, with high mortality. The majority of the patients had a preceding complication. Sentinel bleeding was an important clinical indicator.

M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine the effectiveness of a single Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) infiltration in the pectoralis major muscle, in addition to a standard physical therapy (PT) programme on upper limb impairments and dysfunctions after breast cancer treatment. Methods Fifty breast cancer patients with persistent pain 3 months after finishing treatment participated in a double-blinded randomised controlled trial. The intervention group received a single BTX-A infiltration. The control group received a placebo (saline) infiltration. Within one week after the infiltration, all patients attended an individual PT programme (12 sessions) during the first 3 months. Outcome parameters were active shoulder range of motion, upper limb strength, scapular statics and shoulder function. Measures were taken before the intervention, at 1, 3 (i.e. after the intervention) and 6 months follow-up. Results No differences between groups were found for all outcome parameters over the course of 6 months. However, overall beneficial effects of the PT for active forward flexion shoulder range of motion and shoulder function were found in both groups. Conclusion A single Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) infiltration in the pectoralis major muscle, in addition to a PT programme cannot be recommended to treat upper limb impairments and dysfunctions after breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Exploring One's Family Heritage to Enhance Self-awareness: A Step Toward Developing Cultural Competence
T2  - FAMILY RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To examine the effectiveness of a writing assignment that required undergraduate students in a diversity course to explore their family heritage. The purpose of this assignment was to increase self-awareness of students regarding how structural characteristics of ethnicity, race, social class, and religion shaped the contributions family made to their emerging values, beliefs, and attitudes about interacting with others. Background Instructors for family diversity courses need more instructional strategies that foster self-awareness, which is commonly identified as a first step toward developing cultural competency. One such strategy is described in this paper. Method A mixed method approach was employed, with both quantitative analysis of the frequency of responses from a course effectiveness survey and a descriptive narrative analysis of the text contained in 36 students' family heritage reflective papers. Results Most students reported increased self-awareness of their family history, racial and ethnic identity, role of social class and religion on socialization, and acknowledged contextual experiences of privilege or discrimination. Conclusion Our findings suggest that most students deepened their understanding of personal assumptions. They recognized the need to remain open to understanding and showing more empathy toward individuals from diverse backgrounds. Implications Our results highlight the opportunity for instructors to be intentional in sequencing instructional activities, promoting respectful peer-driven learning and dialogue, recognizing students' worldview, and being open to faculty development opportunities.

T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
M3  - Retracted Publication
AB  - North Gulf is China's important sea route to Asia and Europe, and the seabed is rich in resources. For various reasons, the detection and mapping of submarine terrain are blank. The traditional multi-beam measurement method has high accuracy but uneven spatial distribution. Although the detection line process has high sampling and measurement accuracy, there is a large blank area between adjacent routes, which is difficult to achieve full-scale large area measurement due to environmental, time and budget constraints. On the other hand, the accuracy of the remote sensing inversion depth method is not high, but it can achieve a wide range of coverage, which is characterized by low cost, short cycle and convenient dynamic monitoring. This paper takes North Gulf as the research area, uses remote sensing data to construct the seabed topography, uses multi-beam data for checksum correction and uses distributed computing technology to distribute big data in different computing nodes, and the data are refined and reconstructed in three dimensions to form a 3D seabed topography. The method improves the efficiency and accuracy of multi-beam data processing and can construct a large area, high-resolution submarine DEM and realize database management.

TI  - The fragile spirituality of parents whose children died in the pediatric intensive care unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE CHAPLAINCY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spiritual care is recognized as a relevant dimension of health care. In the context of pediatric palliative end-of-life care, spirituality entails more than adhering to a spiritual worldview or religion. Interviews with parents whose critically ill child died in the pediatric intensive care unit revealed features of a spirituality that is fragmentary and full of contradictions. This type of spirituality, which we refer to as fragile, speaks of parents? connectedness with the deceased child and the hope of some kind of reuniting after one?s own death. Acknowledging that fragments of spirituality can be part of parents? experiences in their child?s end-of-life stage can be a meaningful contribution to compassionate care.

TI  - Discovery of an <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>albopictus</i> population and first records of <i>Aedes</i> (<i>Stegomyia</i>) <i>aegypti</i> in Canada
T2  - MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A population of Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae), a vector of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever, and Zika and West Nile viruses, has been detected in Windsor, Ontario, Canada from 2016 onwards. Here, we describe its seasonal distribution, as well as the various aquatic habitats from which this species was collected and its larval co-habitation. We collected immatures from tires, treeholes, extruded polystyrene foam containers, discarded plastic cups, old recycling bins and oviposition traps. Aedes albopictus larvae were collected with Aedes japonicus (Theobald), Anopheles punctipennis (Say), Culex pipiens Linnaeus, Ochlerotatus hendersoni (Cockerell), Ochlerotatus triseriatus (Say) and Orthopodomyia signifera (Coquillett). Adult female and male specimens were collected from Biogents sentinel traps (Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany), as well as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention miniature light traps (CDC, Atlanta, GA, U.S.A.), and also as they alighted on the investigators. Peak adult collections occurred in September during epidemiological week 37. We also collected Aedes (Stegomyia) aegypti (Linnaeus), a new record for Canada, in 2016 and from two new collection sites in 2017. The 2017 collections were 3.5 km north and 19.4 km south of the index site. The present study adds to the increasing number of studies reporting range expansions of these mosquito species.

TI  - Radiomics Analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To investigate whether a combination of radiomics and automatic machine learning applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of primary breast cancer can non-invasively predict axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis.Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (similar to 80%) and a validation set (similar to 20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds.Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively.Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application.

TI  - Model for deriving benthic irradiance in the Great Barrier Reef from MODIS satellite imagery
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate a simple, spectrally resolved ocean color remote sensing model to estimate benthic photosynthetically active radiation (bPAR) for the waters of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia. For coastal marine environments and coral reefs, the underwater light field is critical to ecosystem health, but data on bPAR rarely exist at ecologically relevant spatio-temporal scales. The bPAR model presented here is based on Lambert-Beer's Law and uses: (i) sea surface values of the downwelling solar irradiance, E-s(lambda); (ii) high-resolution seafloor bathymetry data; and (iii) spectral estimates of the diffuse attenuation coefficient, K-d(lambda), calculated from GBR-specific spectral inherent optical properties (IOPs). We first derive estimates of instantaneous bPAR. Assuming clear skies, these instantaneous values were then used to obtain daily integrated benthic PAR values. Matchup comparisons between concurrent satellite-derived bPAR and in situ values recorded at four optically varying test sites indicated strong agreement, small bias, and low mean absolute error. Overall, the matchup results suggest that our benthic irradiance model was robust to spatial variation in optical properties, typical of complex shallow coastal waters such as the GBR. We demonstrated the bPAR model for a small test region in the central GBR, with the results revealing strong patterns of temporal variability. The model will provide baseline datasets to assess changes in bPAR and its external drivers and may form the basis for a future GBR water-quality index. This model may also be applicable to other coastal waters for which spectral IOP and high-resolution bathymetry data exist.

TI  - Identification of novel, immune-mediating extracellular vesicles in human lymphatic effluent draining primary cutaneous melanoma
T2  - ONCOIMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Epithelial tumors including melanoma often first metastasize to regional, sentinel lymph nodes (SLN). Thus, the presence of SLN metastases is a critical prognostic factor of survival. Prior to metastasis, accumulating evidence suggests the SLN is immunologically compromised; however, the process by which pre-metastatic niche formation occurs remains unknown. In this prospective study, freshly dissected, afferent lymphatic fluid was obtained during SLN biopsy in three patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Lymphatic extracellular vesicles (L-EV) were visualized by transmission electron microscopy and proteomic cargo profiled by mass spectrometry. Flow cytometry assessed L-EV effects on autologous dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Immunogold electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry visualized expression of EV cargo within the primary tumor and SLN. Lymphatic extracellular vesicles from each afferent lymphatic channel demonstrated inhibition of autologous dendritic cell maturation. Proteomic profiling identified 81 peptides shared among the L-EV preparations including a signature of 18 immune-modulating proteins including previously established inhibitor of dendritic cell maturation, S100A9. Immunohistochemistry and immunogold electron microscopy confirmed S100A9 tracking along the lymphatic path, from keratinocytes in the primary tumor to sub-capsular macrophages in the SLN. Our findings suggest L-EV cargo may serve as early mediators of tumor-induced immune subversion in regional lymph nodes, by preceding malignant cells and trafficking within the lymphatic vasculature to harbor the first pre-metastatic niche.

TI  - Improving risk assessment of the emergence of novel influenza A viruses by incorporating environmental surveillance
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reassortment is an evolutionary mechanism by which influenza A viruses (IAV) generate genetic novelty. Reassortment is an important driver of host jumps and is widespread according to retrospective surveillance studies. However, predicting the epidemiological risk of reassortant emergence in novel hosts from surveillance data remains challenging. IAV strains persist and co-occur in the environment, promoting co-infection during environmental transmission. These conditions offer opportunity to understand reassortant emergence in reservoir and spillover hosts. Specifically, environmental RNA could provide rich information for understanding the evolutionary ecology of segmented viruses, and transform our ability to quantify epidemiological risk to spillover hosts. However, significant challenges with recovering and interpreting genomic RNA from the environment have impeded progress towards predicting reassortant emergence from environmental surveillance data. We discuss how the fields of genomics, experimental ecology and epide miological modelling are well positioned to address these challenges. Coupling quantitative disease models and natural transmission studies with new molecular technologies, such as deep-mutational scanning and single-virus sequencing of environmental samples, should dramatically improve our understanding of viral co-occurrence and reassortment. We define observable risk metrics for emerging molecular technologies and propose a conceptual research framework for improving accuracy and efficiency of risk prediction.This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

TI  - Changes of the tropical glaciers throughout Peru between 2000 and 2016-mass balance and area fluctuations
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers in tropical regions are very sensitive to climatic variations and thus strongly affected by climate change. The majority of the tropical glaciers worldwide are located in the Peruvian Andes, which have shown significant ice loss in the last century. Here, we present the first multi-temporal, region-wide survey of geodetic mass balances and glacier area fluctuations throughout Peru covering the period 2000-2016. Glacier extents are derived from Landsat imagery by performing automatic glacier delineation based on a combination of the NDSI and band ratio method and final manual inspection and correction. The mapping of debriscovered glacier extents is supported by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) coherence information. A total glacier area loss of - 548.5 +/- 65.7 km(2) (-29 %, -34.3 km(2) a(-1)) is obtained for the study period. Using interferometric satellite SAR acquisitions, bi-temporal geodetic mass balances are derived. An average specific mass balance of -296 +/- 41 kg M-2 a(-1) is found throughout Peru for the period 2000-2016. However, there are strong regional and temporal differences in the mass budgets ranging from 45 +/- 97 to -752 +/- 452 kg m(-2) a(-1). The ice loss increased towards the end of the observation period. Between 2013 and 2016, a retreat of the glacierized area of -203.8 +/- 65.7 km(2) (-16 %, -101.9 km(2) a(-1)) is mapped and the average mass budget amounts to -660 +/- 178 kg m(-2) a(-1). The glacier changes revealed can be attributed to changes in the climatic settings in the study region, derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis data and the Oceanic Nino Index. The intense El Nifio activities in 2015/16 are most likely the trigger for the increased change rates in the time interval 2013-2016. Our observations provide fundamental information on the current dramatic glacier changes for local authorities and for the calibration and validation of glacier change projections.

TI  - Vicarious calibration of COCTS-HY1C at visible and near-infrared bands for ocean color application
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing reflectance obtained from space-borne ocean color sensors is of great importance to carbon cycle and ocean-atmospheric interactions by providing biogeochemical parameters on the global scale using specific algorithms. Vicarious calibration is necessary for obtaining accurate remote sensing reflectance that meets the application demands of atmospheric correction algorithms. For ocean color sensors, vicarious calibration must be done prior to atmospheric correction. The third Chinese Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner (COCTS) aboard the HY1C satellite was launched on September 7, 2018, and it will provide essential ocean color data that will complement those of existing missions. We used field measurements from the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) and aerosol information provided by the MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra satellite to calculate vicarious calibration coefficients, and we further evaluated the applicability of the established vicarious calibration approach by cross-calibration using MODIS data on the global scale. Finally, the established vicarious calibration coefficients were used to retrieve the aerosol optical depth and remote sensing reflectance, which were compared to Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC) data and MODIS-Terra and Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI)-Sentinel-3A operational products. The results show that the vicarious calibration coefficients are relatively stable and reliable for all bands ranging from visible to near-infrared and can be used to obtain accurate high-quality data.

TI  - Deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) and slow-moving landslides in the southern Tien Shan Mountains: new insights from InSAR, tectonic and geomorphic analysis
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) and slow mass movements in the southern Tien Shan Mountains front using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time-series data obtained by the ALOS/PALSAR satellite. DSGSD evolves with a variety of geomorphological changes (e.g. valley erosion, incision of slope drainage networks) over time that affect earth surfaces and, therefore, often remain unexplored. We analysed 118 interferograms generated from 20 SAR images that covered about 900 km(2). To understand the spatial pattern of the slope movements and to identify triggering parameters, we correlated surface dynamics with the tectono-geomorphic processes and lithologic conditions of the active front of the Alai Range. We observed spatially continuous, constant hillslope movements with a downslope speed of approximately 71 mm year(-1) velocity. Our findings suggest that the lithological and structural framework defined by protracted deformation was the main controlling factor for sustained relief and, consequently, downslope mass movements. The analysed structures revealed integration of a geological/structural setting with the superposition of Cretaceous-Paleogene alternating carbonatic and clastic sedimentary structures as the substratum for younger, less consolidated sediments. This type of structural setting causes the development of large-scale, gravity-driven DSGSD and slow mass movement. Surface deformations with clear scarps and multiple crest lines triggered planes for large-scale deep mass creeps, and these were related directly to active faults and folds in the geologic structures. Our study offers a new combination of InSAR techniques and structural field observations, along with morphometric and seismologic correlations, to identify and quantify slope instability phenomena along a tectonically active mountain front. These results contribute to an improved natural risk assessment in these structures. (c) 2019 The Authors. Earth Surface Processes and Landforms Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

TI  - Mobile phone-based surveillance for animal disease in rural communities: implications for detection of zoonoses spillover
T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the speed of outbreak detection and reporting at the community level are critical in managing the threat of emerging infectious diseases, many of which are zoonotic. The widespread use of mobile phones, including in rural areas, constitutes a potentially effective tool for real-time surveillance of infectious diseases. Using longitudinal data from a disease surveillance system implemented in 1500 households in rural Kenya, we test the effectiveness of mobile phone animal syndromic surveillance by comparing it with routine household animal health surveys, determine the individual and household correlates of its use and examine the broader implications for surveillance of zoonotic diseases. A total of 20 340 animal and death events were reported from the community through the two surveillance systems, half of which were confirmed as valid disease events. The probability of an event being valid was 2.1 times greater for the phone-based system, compared with the household visits. Illness events were 15 times (95% CI 12.8, 17.1) more likely to be reported through the phone system compared to routine household visits, but not death events (OR 0.1 (95% CI 0.09, 0.11)). Disease syndromes with severe presentations were more likely to be reported through the phone system. While controlling for herd and flock sizes owned, phone ownership was not a determinant of using the phone-based surveillance system, but the lack of a formal education, and having additional sources of income besides farming were associated with decreased likelihood of reporting through the phone system. Our study suggests that a phone-based surveillance system will be effective at detecting outbreaks of diseases such as Rift Valley fever that present with severe clinical signs in animal populations, but in the absence of additional reporting incentives, it may miss early outbreaks of diseases such as avian influenza that present primarily with mortality.This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

TI  - Daily metre-scale mapping of water turbidity using CubeSat imagery
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential for mapping of turbidity in inland and coastal waters using imagery from the PlanetScope (PS) and RapidEye (RE) constellations is evaluated. With > 120 PS and 5 RE satellites in orbit these constellations are able to provide metre scale imagery on a daily basis and could significantly enhance high spatial resolution monitoring of turbidity worldwide. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction is adapted to the PS and RE imaging systems to retrieve surface reflectances. Due to the large amount of imagery and the limited band sets on these sensors, automated pixel classification is required. This is here performed using a neural network approach, which is able to classify water pixels for clear to moderately turbid waters. Due to the limited band set and sensor performance, some issues remain with classifying extremely turbid waters and cloud shadows based on a spectral approach. Surface reflectance data compares well with in situ measurements from the AERONET-OC network. Turbidity is estimated from the Red, RedEdge (RE only) and NIR bands and is compared with measurements from autonomous stations in the San Francisco Bay area and the coastal waters around the United Kingdom. Good performance is found for Red band derived turbidity from PS data, while the NIR band performance is mediocre, likely due to calibration issues. For RE, all three turbidity products give reasonable results. A high revisit density allows for the mapping of temporal variability in water turbidity using these satellite constellations. Thanks to the RedEdge band on RE, chlorophyll a absorption can be avoided, and perhaps even estimated. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Improved atmospheric correction algorithm for Landsat 8-OLI data in turbid waters: a case study for the Lake Taihu, China
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Several atmospheric correction algorithms for turbid waters have been developed based on an assumption of zero reflection in short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands. However, for the Landsat8-Operational Land Imager (OLI), some water reflections are so strong in the 1609 nm band that they cannot be ignored. In this study, we developed a novel atmospheric correction algorithm based on a zero assumption for the short-wave infrared band (ACZI). The ACZI algorithm uses the black pixel index (BPI) and the floating algae index (FAI) to distinguish black pixels, which are used to estimate the aerosol scattering of non-black pixels based on the assumption of spatial homogeneity of aerosol types. In Lake Taihu, compared with the SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System) -SWIR algorithm, the ACZI algorithm achieved better precision for visible bands MAPE (the mean absolute percentage error), < 30%, RMSE (the root mean square error) < 0.0117 sr(-1)) and provided more available water pixels. The accuracy of ACZI was close to that of the DSF (dark spectrum fitting) algorithm and was better than that of the EXP (exponential extrapolation) algorithm and L8SR (Landsat 8 OLI Surface Reflectance) product. The ACZI algorithm showed good applicability in turbid waters. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Semi-Empirical Algorithm for Wind Speed Retrieval from Gaofen-3 Quad-Polarization Strip Mode SAR Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a suitable tool to obtain reliable wind retrievals with high spatial resolution. The geophysical model function (GMF), which is widely employed for wind speed retrieval from SAR data, describes the relationship between the SAR normalized radar cross-section (NRCS) at the copolarization channel (vertical-vertical and horizontal-horizontal) and a wind vector. SAR-measured NRCS at cross-polarization channels (horizontal-vertical and vertical-horizontal) correlates with wind speed. In this study, a semi-empirical algorithm is presented to retrieve wind speed from the noisy Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR data with noise-equivalent sigma zero correction using an empirical function. GF-3 SAR can acquire data in a quad-polarization strip mode, which includes cross-polarization channels. The semi-empirical algorithm is tuned using acquisitions collocated with winds from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. In particular, the proposed algorithm includes the dependences of wind speed and incidence angle on cross-polarized NRCS. The accuracy of SAR-derived wind speed is around 2.10 m s(-1) root mean square error, which is validated against measurements from the Advanced Scatterometer onboard the Metop-A/B and the buoys from the National Data Buoy Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The results obtained by the proposed algorithm considering the incidence angle in a GMF are relatively more accurate than those achieved by other algorithms. This work provides an alternative method to generate operational wind products for GF-3 SAR without relying on ancillary data for wind direction.

TI  - Is Regional Lymph Node Metastasis of Head and Neck Paraganglioma a Sign of Aggressive Clinical Behavior: A Clinical/Pathologic Review
T2  - ENT-EAR NOSE & THROAT JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Head and neck paraganglioma is a rare neoplasm of the paraganglia. It accounts for <1% of all head and neck tumors. It usually has benign clinical course; however, malignant paraganglioma can only be diagnosed by showing metastatic disease. We undertook a retrospective study to assess the clinical significance of regional lymph nodes metastases in head and neck paragangliomas. Design: From 1993 to 2016, primary head and neck paragangliomas are identified. The patient clinical and histopathologic materials were reviewed. Results: Sixty-five specimens from 62 patients (3 patients with more than 1 specimens) with head and neck paragangliomas were recorded (49 female and 13 males) with mean age of 54 (24-78 years). The locations of the tumors were as follows: carotid body: 30, glomus tympanicum: 11, glomus jugulare: 14, parapharyngeal space: 3, and 1 case each of larynx, skull base, paraglottic area, infratemporal fossa, mastoid, cerebellopontine (CP) angle, and pyriform sinus. On histopathology, we found 5 cases of sclerosing variant. Thirty-two (52%) of the 62 patients had regional lymph node biopsy. Four (12%) of the 32 show metastatic paraganglioma (3 females and 1 male with mean age = 35). Two of the 5 cases of sclerosing variant had positive lymph nodes. No evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis in the patients with positive lymph nodes with a 6 to 11 years follow-up. One of the 28 patients with negative lymph nodes developed metastatic disease to lumbar spine in 5 years. Conclusion: Metastatic paraganglioma to regional lymph nodes may have indolent clinical behavior, with disease-free survival of up to 11 years. The incidence of metastatic disease in lymph nodes was 4 (12%) of 32. Forty percent (2/5) of the cases with sclerosing variant of paraganglioma had lymph node metastases indicating that this tumor may have a more aggressive histological behavior.

TI  - Examining the prospects of sentinel-2 multispectral data in detecting and mapping maize streak virus severity in smallholder Ofcolaco farms, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop diseases monitoring is critical in understanding the effects of diseases on crop production and associated implications on food security. The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the 10?m resolution Sentinel 2 data set, in detecting and mapping Maize Streak Virus (MSV) disease in Ofcolaco farms in Tzaneen, South Africa. Specifically, the study sought to spectrally discriminate and map maize infected with MSV from other land-cover classes. To achieve this objective two analysis approaches were used: spectral analysis (Test I: spectral bands; Test II: spectral bands?+?spectral vegetation indices) using random forest algorithm in a supervised classification approach. The indices combined with spectral bands were EVI, SAVI, NDVI, GNDVI, GLI and MSAVI. Results indicated that infected maize was highly separable from health maize and other land cover classes (TDSI > 1.8). The mapping accuracy was high using spectral data (Overall accuracy = 85.29% and Kappa = 0.79) and even higher when spectral bands were combined with derived vegetation indices (Overall accuracy = 89.43% and Kappa = 0.84). The results of the study show that the 10?m resolution multispectral Sentinel 2 data set can be used to detect and map maize infected by MSV. The findings are important in showing the value of combining 10?m spectral data with derived indices from Sentinel 2 in improving monitoring of maize steak virus in resource-constrained nations.

TI  - Combining unmanned aerial vehicle and multispectral Pleiades data for tree species identification, a prerequisite for accurate carbon estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest carbon estimation currently largely relies on remote sensing techniques in combination with field measurement. High-resolution images, which are commonly utilized for carbon estimation, are not readily available, and their cost prohibits communities from reaping the benefits of maintaining their forest under the UN reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation program. Our study explores the combination of readily available and relatively cheaper unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (4-cm resolution) and multispectral Pleiades (50-cm resolution) images for species classification robustness in view for carbon estimation through object-based image analysis. The images are resampled and used to evaluate the effect of combining multispectral Pleiades image on the accuracies of segmenting UAV images for tree crown projection area (CPA) estimation and species classification. RGB images from a UAV platform are processed in a photogrametric software and combined with the near-infrared band of a Pleiades image to get a UAV-Pleiades image composite. The images are segmented using the ESP 2 tool and the segmentation accuracy compared using a paired t-test. The segmented tree crowns are classified using random trees (RT), support vector machines (SVM), and maximum likelihood (ML) classifiers, and the classification accuracies of the three classifiers are compared using the McNemar's chi-squared test. Our study demonstrates a 93.5% accuracy of segmenting UAV-Pleiades image composite, which is significantly higher than the 84.8% accuracy of segmenting UAV images (p < 0.05). Also an 84% classification accuracy of UAV-Pleiades image composite is significantly higher than the 54% classification accuracy of the UAV images (p < 0.05). Of the three classifiers used, the classification accuracies of SVM and RT are significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that of the ML classifier. Given the significantly high accuracies observed from this study for tree CPA extraction and tree species classification, carbon/above ground biomass modeling is possible with significantly high accuracy using the combination of multispectral Pleiades and UAV images.

TI  - Efficient hyper-parameter determination for regularised linear BRDF parameter retrieval
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Linear kernel driven models of the surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) are valuable tools for exploiting Earth observation data acquired at different sun-sensor geometries. Here we present a method that efficiently determines linear BRDF model weights using Tikhonov smoothing where the smoothing parameter lambda is determined via a Generalized Singular Value Decomposition with the root mean square error prescribed depending on the MODIS band. We applied this method to twenty-six different deciduous broadleaf sites across an entire year using the MODIS Terra and Aqua reflectance data products. Kernel weights and white sky albedo derived from this GSVD method were generally consistent with those provided by the MCD43 data products. The GSVD derived results had less sample variability compared to the MCD43 data products, attributable to the assumed smoothness between kernel weights in the Tikhonov smoothing method. The GSVD technique consistently outperforms MCD43 in the reconstruction of observed MODIS reflectance data, of which retrievals from this method will do a better job of estimating albedo and normalizing data to specified geometries.

TI  - <i>De novo</i> transcriptomes of 14 gammarid individuals for proteogenomic analysis of seven taxonomic groups
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Gammarids are amphipods found worldwide distributed in fresh and marine waters. They play an important role in aquatic ecosystems and are well established sentinel species in ecotoxicology. In this study, we sequenced the transcriptomes of a male individual and a female individual for seven different taxonomic groups belonging to the two genera Gammarus and Echinogammarus: Gammarus fossarum A, G. fossarum B, G. fossarum C, Gammarus wautieri, Gammarus pulex, Echinogammarus berilloni, and Echinogammarus marinus. These taxa were chosen to explore the molecular diversity of transcribed genes of genotyped individuals from these groups. Transcriptomes were de novo assembled and annotated. High-quality assembly was confirmed by BUSCO comparison against the Arthropod dataset. The 14 RNA-Seq-derived protein sequence databases proposed here will be a significant resource for proteogenomics studies of these ecotoxicologically relevant non-model organisms. These transcriptomes represent reliable reference sequences for whole-transcriptome and proteome studies on other gammarids, for primer design to clone specific genes or monitor their specific expression, and for analyses of molecular differences between gammarid species.

TI  - Heterogeneous spatial and temporal pattern of surface elevation change and mass balance of the Patagonian ice fields between 2000 and 2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern and southern Patagonian ice fields (NPI and SPI) have been subject to accelerated retreat during the last decades, with considerable variability in magnitude and timing among individual glaciers. We derive spatially detailed maps of surface elevation change (SEC) of NPI and SPI from bistatic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry data of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurements (TanDEM-X) for two epochs, 2000-2012 and 2012-2016, and provide data on changes in surface elevation and ice volume for the individual glaciers and the ice fields at large. We apply advanced TanDEM-X processing techniques allowing us to cover 90 % and 95 % of the area of NPI and 97 % and 98 % of SPI for the two epochs, respectively. Particular attention is paid to precisely co-registering the digital elevation models (DEMs), accounting for possible effects of radar signal penetration through backscatter analysis and correcting for seasonality biases in case of deviations in repeat DEM coverage from full annual time spans. The results show a different temporal trend between the two ice fields and reveal a heterogeneous spatial pattern of SEC and mass balance caused by different sensitivities with respect to direct climatic forcing and ice flow dynamics of individual glaciers. The estimated volume change rates for NPI are -4.26 +/- 0.20 km(3) a(-1) for epoch 1 and -5.60 +/- 0.74 km(3) a(-1) for epoch 2, while for SPI these are -14.87 +/- 0.52 km(3) a(-1) for epoch 1 and -11.86 +/- 1.99 km(3) a(-1) for epoch 2. This corresponds for both ice fields to an eustatic sea level rise of 0.048 +/- 0.002 mm a(-1) for epoch 1 and 0.043 +/- 0.005 mm a(-1) for epoch 2. On SPI the spatial pattern of surface elevation change is more complex than on NPI and the temporal trend is less uniform. On terminus sections of the main calving glaciers of SPI, temporal variations in flow velocities are a main factor for differences in SEC between the two epochs. Striking differences are observed even on adjoining glaciers, such as Upsala Glacier, with decreasing mass losses associated with slowdown of flow velocity, contrasting with acceleration and increase in mass losses on Viedma Glacier.

TI  - Conjugate utilization of Landsat-8 OLI, ground gravity and magnetic data for targeting mafic cumulates within anorthositic-layered complex of Sittampundi, India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we have processed Landsat-8 spectral bands, ground gravity, and magnetic data for delineating the mafic cumulates within the anorthositic-layered complex in Sittampundi, Tamilnadu, India. In this regard, surface anomaly map of mafic cumulates was derived by processing spectral bands of Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor using matched filtering method. Residual gravity, magnetic anomaly maps are also derived. Spatial position of geophysical anomalies corroborate well with the spectral anomalies. A promising zone of chromitite occurrences is identified at the eastern fringe of the study area based on the concurrence of spectral and geophysical anomalies. Spatial profiles of geophysical and spectral anomalies around this promising zone are similar to the respective spatial profiles observed around the known chromite bearing mafic cumulates. Depth continuity of the mafic cumulates is confirmed by deriving of gravity and magnetic anomaly map at different depth using upward continuation filters to confirm concealed deposit.

TI  - Outcomes with intraoperative radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Adjuvant radiation therapy has been associated with improved local control following breast-conserving surgery. Traditionally, treatment has been delivered with whole breast irradiation over 3-6 weeks or partial breast irradiation over 1-3 weeks. However, intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) has emerged as a technique that delivers a single dose of radiotherapy at the time of surgery for early-stage breast cancers. We report initial outcomes and acute toxicities with intraoperative radiation from a single institution. Patients with DCIS or Stage I-II breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (nodal sampling excluded in some cases) were included. All patients in this analysis were treated with IORT as at the time of surgery, 20 Gy in 1 fraction with 50 kV x-ray. Patients were treated at a single institution between 2011 and 2019. Follow-up was per standard institutional protocol. Two hundred and one patients were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up of 23 months (range: 0-73 months). Median age was 71 years old. Overall, 4 (2.0%) patients had DCIS, 186 (92.5%) patients had Stage 1 disease, and 11 patients had (5.5%) Stage 2 disease. All patients were estrogen receptor-positive, 175 (87.9%) progesterone receptor-positive, and 1 (0.5%) HER2 amplified. The crude rate of local recurrence was 2.0% (n = 4) and distant metastasis rate was 0.5% (n = 1). The rate of arm lymphedema was 0.5% (n = 1) and chronic telangiectasia rate was 1.1% (n = 2). Intraoperative radiation therapy, in a cohort of low-risk patients, demonstrated low rates of recurrence and reproducibility in a multi-disciplinary setting. Further follow-up, analysis of patient satisfaction and cosmesis, and comparison to whole breast irradiation and partial breast techniques is necessary in order to further validate these findings.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in Alpine glacier forelands tackled from space
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of plant succession in glacier forelands has so far been restricted to field sampling. In this study, in situ vegetation sampling along a chronosequence between Little Ice Age (LIA) maximum extent and the recent glacier terminus at Jamtalferner in the Austrian Alps is compared to time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from 13 Landsat scenes (1985-2016). The glacier terminus positions at 16 dates between the LIA maximum and 2015 were analysed from historical maps, orthophotos and LiDAR images. We sampled plots of different ages since deglaciation, from very recent to approx. 150 years: after 100 years, roughly 80% of the ground is covered by plants and ground cover does not increase significantly thereafter. The number of species increases from 10-20 species on young sites to 40-50 species after 100 years. The NDVI increases with the time of exposure from a mean of 0.11 for 1985-1991 to 0.20 in 2009 and 0.27 in 2016. As the increase in ground cover is clearly reproduced by the NDVI (R-2 ground cover/NDVI 0.84)- even for sparsely vegetated areas -, we see a great potential of satellite-borne NDVI to perform regional characterizations of glacier forelands for hydrological, ecological and hazard management-related applications.

TI  - Dose effect of influenza vaccine on protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza illness among children aged 6 months to 8 years of age in southern China, 2013/14-2015/16 seasons: a matched case-control study
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We conducted a matched case-control study in China during the 2013/14-2015/16 influenza seasons to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) by dose among children aged 6 months to 8 years.Methods Cases were laboratory-confirmed influenza infections identified through the influenza-like illness sentinel surveillance network in Guangzhou. Age- and sex-matched community controls were randomly selected through the expanded immunization program database. We defined priming as receipt of >= 1 dose of influenza vaccine during the immediate prior season.Results In total, 4,185 case-control pairs were analyzed. Among children 6-35 months, VE for current season dose(s) across the three seasons during 2013/14-2015/16 were 59% (95% Confidence Interval: 44-71%), 12% (-11%, 30%), 54% (32-69%); among unprimed children 6-35 months, VE for 1 vs 2 current season doses were 45% (8-67%) vs 65% (46-78%), -2% (-53%, 32%) vs 19% (-11%, 40%), and 37% (-24%, 68%) vs 61% (32-78%). Among children aged 3-8 years, VE for current season dose(s) across study seasons were 62% (36-78%), 43% (22-58%), 32% (1-53%). VE for unprimed children receiving 1 dose only in current season was insignificant or lower than among all children.Conclusion Findings support utility of providing second dose ("booster dose") of seasonal influenza vaccine to unprimed children aged 6-35 months, and the need to study further dose effect of a booster dose among unprimed children aged 3-8 years in China.

TI  - A hyperspectral experiment over tropical forests based on the EO-1 orbit change and PROSAIL simulation
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We designed a unique hyperspectral experiment from the Earth Observing One (EO-1) orbit change to evaluate solar illumination effects over tropical forests in Brazil. Ten nadir-viewing Hyperion images collected over a fixed site and period of the year (July to August) were selected for analysis. We evaluated variations in reflectance and in 16 narrowband vegetation indices (VIs) with increasing solar zenith angle (SZA) from the pre-drift (2004-2008) to the EO-1 drift period (2011-2016). To detect changes in reflectance and shadows, we applied spectral mixture analysis (SMA) and principal component analysis (PCA) and calculated the similarity spectral angle (theta) between the vegetation spectra measured with variable SZA. The magnitude of the illumination effects was also evaluated from change-point analysis and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U tests applied over the time series. Finally, we complemented our experiment using the PROSAIL model to simulate the VIs variation with increasing SZA resultant from satellite drift. The results showed significant changes in Hyperion reflectance and VIs, especially when the EO-1 crossed the study area at earlier times and larger SZA in 2015 (9:05 a.m.; SZA = 59 degrees) and 2016 (8:30 a.m.; SZA = 67 degrees). Compared to the pre-drift period (10:30 a.m.; SZA = 45 degrees), the SZA differences of 14 degrees (2015) and 22 degrees (2016) increased the shade fractions and decreased the vegetation brightness. PCA separated the pre-drift and drift reflectance datasets, showing shifts in scores due to changes in brightness. theta increased with SZA, indicating changes in the shape of the vegetation spectra with drift. For most VIs, the change-point analysis indicated 2015 (SZA = 59 degrees) as the predominant year of detected changes. Compared to the EO-1 original orbit, the Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), Anthocyanin Reflectance Index (ARI) and Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI) presented the largest positive changes during drift, while the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) had the largest negative changes. The effect size of the illumination geometry on these VIs was large, as indicated by increasing values of the Cohen's r metric toward 2016. The anisotropy of the Hyperion VIs was generally consistent with that from PROSAIL in the simulated pre-drift and drift periods. Focusing on structural indices, it affected the relationships between VIs and simulated leaf area index (LAI) at large SZA.

TI  - A Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration model with bulk surface conductance derived from remotely sensed spatial contextual information
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach involving the use of the contextual information in a scatter plot of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) derived Land Surface Temperature versus Fraction of Vegetation (LST vs. F-v) has been proposed in this study to obtain pixel-wise values of bulk surface conductance (G(s)) for use in the Penman-Monteith (PM) model for latent heat flux (lambda(ET)) estimation. Using a general expression for G(s) derived by assuming a two-source total lambda(ET) (canopy transpiration plus soil evaporation) approach proposed by previous researchers, minimum and maximum values of G(s) for a given region can be inferred from a trapezoidal scatter plot of pixel-wise values of LST and corresponding F-v. Using these as limiting values, G(s) values for each pixel can be derived through interpolation and subsequently used with the PM model to estimate lambda(ET) for each pixel. The proposed methodology was implemented in 5 km x 5 km areas surrounding each of four flux towers located in tropical south-east Asia. Using climate data from the tower and derived G(s) values the PM model was used to obtain pixel-wise instantaneous lambda(ET) values on six selected dates/times at each tower. Excellent comparisons were obtained between tower measured lambda(ET) and those estimated by the proposed approach for all four flux tower locations (R-2 = 0.85-0.96; RMSE = 18.27-33.79 W m(-2)). Since the LST- F-v trapezoidal method is simple, calibration-free and easy to implement, the proposed methodology has the potential to provide accurate estimates of regional evapotranspiration with minimal data inputs.

TI  - Practical approach for synthetic aperture radar change analysis in urban environments
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection using remote sensing imagery is a broad and highly active field of research that has produced many different technical approaches for multiple applications. The majority of these approaches have in common that they do not deliver any detailed information concerning the type, category, or class of the detected changes. With respect to the extraction of such information, recent research often suggests that a land use classification is required. This classification can be accomplished in an unsupervised or supervised way, whereas the practicability of both strategies is more or less limited by the usage of reference or training data. Moreover, expert knowledge is needed to arrive at meaningful land use classes. An approach is presented that overcomes these drawbacks. A time series of synthetic aperture radar amplitude images is considered, enabling the detection of so-called high activity objects in urban environments. Such objects represent the basis of the investigations and denote the input for unsupervised categorization and classification procedures. The method supports even the unexperienced user in learning the actual information content leading to the capability to define a suitable scheme for change classification. Tests carried out on two different datasets suggest that the method is both practical and robust. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported License.

TI  - Pre-Launch Assessment of RADARSAT Constellation Mission Medium Resolution Modes for Sea Oil Slicks and Lookalike Discrimination
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is a Canadian Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission, providing C-band SAR data continuity of the RADARSAT-1 and RADARSAT-2 satellite missions. The RCM which was recently launched (June 2019) will provide compact polarimetry (CP) as a polarization option for all non-quad-polarization imaging modes. Maritime pollution monitoring is one of the RCM core applications. Thus, the purpose of this study is to provide an initial evaluation of the expected potential of the RCM mission for maritime pollution monitoring. Herein, we investigate simulated CP SAR data of three RCM Medium Resolution (MR) SAR modes for oil slick detection and discrimination from lookalike (LA) features. Results of our study indicated that the steeper radar incidence angle seems to be preferable for oil slick detection in all examined modes. The ScanSAR 50 m resolution (SC50M) mode showed the highest overall performance in terms of LA and Emulsion (EM) classification (95.4%). This was also valid for LA and Crude Oil (CO) classification (96.7%). The performance of the SC50M mode was slightly higher than that of the ScanSAR 30 m resolution (SC30M) mode.

TI  - Aerosol direct radiative effect over clouds from a synergy of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectances
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of geophysical parameters is increasingly dependent on synergistic use of satellite instruments. More sophisticated parameters can be retrieved and the accuracy of retrievals can be increased when more information is combined. In this paper, a synergistic application of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), on the Aura platform, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), on the Aqua platform, Level 1B reflectances is described, enabling the retrieval of the aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE) over clouds using the differential aerosol absorption (DAA) technique. This technique was first developed for reflectances from the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) on the Environmental Satellite (Envisat), which had the unique capability of measuring contiguous radiances from the ultraviolet (UV) at 240 to 1750 nm in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR), at a moderate spectral resolution of 0.2 to 1.5 nm. However, the spatial resolution and global coverage of SCIAMACHY was limited, and Envisat stopped delivering data in 2012. In order to continue the DRE data retrieval, reflectances from OMI and MODIS, flying in formation, were combined from the UV to the SWIR. This resulted in reflectances at a limited but sufficient spectral resolution, available at the OMI pixel grid, which have a much higher spatial resolution and coverage than SCIAMACHY. The combined reflectance spectra allow the retrieval of cloud microphysical parameters in the SWIR, and the subsequent retrieval of aerosol DRE over cloud scenes using the DAA technique. For liquid cloud scenes in the south-east Atlantic region with cloud fraction (CF) > 0.3, the area-averaged instantaneous aerosol DRE over clouds in June to August 2006 was 25 Wm(-2) with a standard deviation of 30 Wm(-2). The maximum area-averaged instantaneous DRE from OMI-MODIS in August 2006 was 75.6 +/- 13 Wm(-2). The new aerosol DRE over-cloud dataset from OMI-MODIS is compared to the SCIAMACHY dataset for the period 2006 to 2009, showing a very high correlation. The OMI-MODIS DRE dataset over the Atlantic Ocean is highly correlated to above-cloud AOT measurements from OMI and MODIS. It is related to AOT measurements over Ascension Island in 2016, showing the transport of smoke all the way from its source region in Africa over the Atlantic to Ascension and beyond.

TI  - The influence of water table depth on evapotranspiration in the Amazon arc of deforestation
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon rainforest evapotranspiration (ET) flux provides climate-regulating and moisture-provisioning ecosystem services through a moisture recycling system. The dense complex canopy and deep root system creates an optimum structure to provide large ET fluxes to the atmosphere, forming the source of precipitation. Extensive land use and land cover change (LULCC) from forest to agriculture in the arc of deforestation breaks this moisture recycling system. Crops such as soybean are planted in large homogeneous monocultures and the maximum rooting depth of these crops is far shallower than forest. This difference in rooting depth is key as forests can access deep soil moisture and show no signs of water stress during the dry season, while in contrast crops are highly seasonal with a growing season dependent on rainfall. As access to soil moisture is a limiting factor in vegetation growth, we hypothesised that if crops could access soil moisture, they would undergo less water stress and therefore would have higher evapotranspiration rates than crops which could not access soil moisture.We combined remote-sensing data with modelled groundwater table depth (WTD) to assess whether vegetation in areas with a shallow WTD had higher ET than vegetation in deep WTD areas. We randomly selected areas of forest, savanna, and crop with deep and shallow WTD and examined whether they differ on MODIS Evapotranspiration (ET), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), from 2001 to 2012, annually and during transition periods between the wet and dry seasons. As expected, we found no differences in ET, LST, and EVI for forest vegetation between deep and shallow WTD, which because of their deep roots could access water and maintain evapotranspiration for moisture recycling during the entire year. We found significantly higher ET and lower LST in shallow WTD crop areas than in deep WTD during the dry season transition, suggesting that crops in deep WTD undergo higher water stress than crops in shallow WTD areas.The differences found between crop in deep and shallow WTD, however, are of low significance with regards to the moisture recycling system, as the difference resulting from conversion of forest to crop has an overwhelming influence (ET in forest is approximate to 2 mm d(-1) higher than that in crops) and has the strongest impact on energy balance and ET. However, access to water during the transition between wet and dry seasons may positively influence growing season length in crop areas.

AB  - This study analyses the status and temporal dynamics of the tropical forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We used an integrated geospatial approach incorporating satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with a continuous forest inventory over a ten-year period utilizing statistical up-scaling procedure over a tropical deciduous forest of India as a case study. Logarithmic regression relationship was observed as the best fit model to derive the aboveground biomass from SAR backscatter coefficients with an absolute model accuracy of 80.61%. This was further employed to model the change in forest AGC stock from 2007 to 2016. Results show a significant decrease in carbon stock and the release of 918.5 Gg of carbon in the atmosphere from deforestation and forest degradation in the study area within the ten-year period.

TI  - Proteomics-Based Monitoring of Pathway Activity Reveals that Blocking Diacylglycerol Biosynthesis Rescues from Alpha-Synuclein Toxicity
T2  - CELL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Proteinaceous inclusions containing alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) have been implicated in neuronal toxicity in Parkinson's disease, but the pathways that modulate toxicity remain enigmatic. Here, we used a targeted proteomic assay to simultaneously measure 269 pathway activation markers and proteins deregulated by alpha-Syn expression across a panel of 33 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that genetically modulate alpha-Syn toxicity. Applying multidimensional linear regression analysis to these data predicted Pah1, a phosphatase that catalyzes conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, as an effector of rescue. Follow-up studies demonstrated that inhibition of Pahl activity ameliorates the toxic effects of alpha-Syn, indicate that the diacylglycerol branch of lipid metabolism could enhance alpha-Syn neuronal cytotoxicity, and suggest a link between alpha-Syn toxicity and the biology of lipid droplets.

TI  - Widespread distribution of supraglacial lakes around the margin of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes are important to ice sheet mass balance because their development and drainage has been linked to changes in ice flow velocity and ice shelf disintegration. However, little is known about their distribution on the world's largest ice sheet in East Antarctica. Here, we use similar to 5 million km(2) of high-resolution satellite imagery to identify >65,000 lakes (>1,300 km(2)) that formed around the peak of the melt season in January 2017. Lakes occur in most marginal areas where they typically develop at low elevations (<100 m) and on low surface slopes (<1 degrees), but they can exist 500 km inland and at elevations >1500 m. We find that lakes often cluster a few kilometres down-ice from grounding lines and similar to 60% (>80% by area) develop on ice shelves, including some potentially vulnerable to collapse driven by lake-induced hydro-fracturing. This suggests that parts of the ice sheet may be highly sensitive to climate warming.

TI  - Assessing the Responsive Relationships Between Straw Burning From MODIS Data and Air Quality in Shandong Province
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Among various sources of pollution, outdoor straw burning has a great impact on air quality through releasing various kinds of air pollutants and fine particles, shaping one of the sources of air pollution. MODIS instrument has the advantages of high sensitivity, timeliness and wide spatial coverage and using its data to monitor straw burning events can quickly identify the location, amount and severity of fire spots across a wide region. MODIS data in partnership with the contextual algorithm was used to extract fire spots in Shandong Province in the current work. The values of six air quality indices including PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O-3, as well as the meteorological data were collected. Additionally, 17 cities in Shandong Province were grouped into two categories, coastal region and inland region according to their proximity to the coastlines to derive a targeted analysis that focuses on the influential differences in air quality imposed by straw burning. Specifically, by carrying out the spatial interpolation with daily air quality data for the two regions, the correlation between the fire points and the total air quality index of all grid points in the region was analyzed. And then the impact of contamination caused by burning straws on environmental air quality, as well as differences of air quality between coastal and inland region were discussed. As a result, a significantly positive correlation between the amount of fire spots and the total air quality index was observed. Of which, there was a significant correlation between straw burning and AQI, PM2.5, PM10 and O-3, indicating that the increase in fire spots leads to an increase of air quality indices, accordingly, a poor air quality gained. Furthermore, the correlation presented in the coastal region was stronger than that presented in the inland region, indicating that the atmospheric spread condition is one of the important prerequisites when examining the environmental impacts of straw burning.

TI  - Satellite data cloud detection using deep learning supported by hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning methods can play an important role in satellite data cloud detection. The number and quality of training samples directly affect the accuracy of cloud detection based on deep learning. Therefore, selecting a large number of representative and high-quality training samples is a key step in cloud detection based on deep learning. For different satellite data sources, choosing sufficient and high-quality training samples has become an important factor limiting the application of deep learning in cloud detection. This paper presents a fast method for obtaining high-quality learning samples, which can be used for cloud detection of different satellite data with deep learning methods. AVIRIS (Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data, which have 224 continuous bands in the spectral range from 400-2500 nm, are used to provide cloud detection samples for different types of satellite data. Through visual interpretation, a sufficient number of cloud and clear sky pixels are selected from the AVIRIS data to construct a hyperspectral data sample library, which is used to simulate different satellite data (such as data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellites) as training samples. This approach avoids selecting training samples for different satellite sensors. Based on the Keras deep learning framework platform, a backpropagation (BP) neural network is employed for cloud detection from Landsat 8 OLI, National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Terra MODIS data. The results are compared with cloud coverage results interpreted via artificial vision. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves good cloud detection results for the above data, and the overall accuracy is greater than 90%.

TI  - Variable Rate Irrigation of Maize and Soybean in West-Central Nebraska Under Full and Deficit Irrigation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable rate irrigation (VRI) may improve center pivot irrigation management, including deficit irrigation. A remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration model was implemented with Landsat imagery to manage irrigations for a VRI equipped center pivot irrigated field located in West-Central Nebraska planted to maize in 2017 and soybean in 2018. In 2017, the study included VRI using the model, and uniform irrigation using neutron attenuation for full irrigation with no intended water stress (VRI-Full and Uniform-Full treatments, respectively). In 2018, two deficit irrigation treatments were added (VRI-Deficit and Uniform-Deficit, respectively) and the model was modified in an attempt to reduce water balance drift; model performance was promising, as it was executed unaided by measurements of soil water content throughout the season. VRI prescriptions did not correlate well with available water capacity (R-2 < 0.4); however, they correlated better with modeled ET in 2018 (R-2 = 0. 69, VRI-Full; R-2 = 0.55, VRI-Deficit). No significant differences were observed in total intended gross irrigation depth in 2017 (VRI-Full = 351 mm, Uniform Full = 344). However, in 2018, VRI resulted in lower mean prescribed gross irrigation than the corresponding uniform treatments (VRI-Full = 265 mm, Uniform Full = 282 mm, VRI-Deficit = 234 mm, and Uniform Deficit = 267 mm). Notwithstanding the differences in prescribed irrigation (in 2018), VRI did not affect dry grain yield, with no statistically significant differences being found between any treatments in either year (F = 0.03, p = 0.87 in 2017; F = 0.00, p = 0.96 for VRI/Uniform and F = 0.01, p = 0.93 for Full/Deficit in 2018). Likewise, any reduction in irrigation application apparently did not result in detectable reductions in deep percolation potential or actual evapotranspiration. Additional research is needed to further vet the model as a deficit irrigation management tool. Suggested model improvements include a continuous function for water stress and an optimization routine in computing the basal crop coefficient.

TI  - Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines gene polymorphisms and malaria in Mangaluru, India
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Duffy blood group antigens serve as receptors for Plasmodium vivax invasion into erythrocytes, and they are determined by polymorphisms of the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), also known as Fy glycoprotein (FY). Duffy negativity, i.e., absence of the antigens, protects against P. vivax infection and is rare among non-African populations. However, data on DARC polymorphisms and their impact on Plasmodium infection in India are scarce. Methods In a case-control study among 909 malaria patients and 909 healthy community controls in Mangaluru, southwestern India, DARC polymorphisms T-33C (rs2814778), G125A (rs12075), C265T (rs34599082), and G298A (rs13962) were genotyped. Associations of the polymorphisms with the odds of malaria, parasite species and manifestation were assessed. Results Among patients, vivax malaria (70%) predominated over falciparum malaria (9%) and mixed species infections (21%). DARC T-33C was absent and C265T was rare (1%). FYB carriage (deduced from DARC G125A) was not associated with the risk of malaria per se but it protected against severe falciparum malaria (P = 0.03), and hospitalization (P = 0.006) due to falciparum malaria. Vice versa, carriage of DARC 298A was associated with increased odds of malaria (aOR, 1.46 (1.07-1.99), P = 0.015) and vivax malaria (aOR, 1.60 (1.14-2.22), P = 0.006) and with several reported symptoms and findings of the patients. Conclusion This report from southern India is the first to show an independent effect of the DARC 298A polymorphism on the risk of malaria. Functional studies are required to understand the underlying mechanism. Moreover, FYB carriage appears to protect against severe falciparum malaria in southern India.

TI  - Assessment of regional aerosol radiative effects under the SWAAMI campaign - Part 1: Quality-enhanced estimation of columnar aerosol extinction and absorption over the Indian subcontinent
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of regional aerosol climate impact assessment calls for improvement in the accuracy of regional aerosol radiative effect (ARE) estimation. One of the most important means of achieving this is to use spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets of critical aerosol properties, such as spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA), which are the most important parameters for estimating aerosol radiative effects. However, observations do not provide the above; the space-borne observations though provide wide spatial coverage, are temporal snapshots and suffer from possible sensor degradation over extended periods. On the other hand, the ground-based measurements provide more accurate and temporally continuous data but are spatially near-point observations. Realizing the need for spatially homogeneous and temporally continuous datasets on one hand and the near non-existence of such data over the south Asian region (which is one of the regions where aerosols show large heterogeneity in most of their properties), construction of accurate gridded aerosol products by synthesizing the long-term space-borne and ground-based data has been taken up as an important objective of the South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI), a joint Indo-UK field campaign, aiming at characterizing aerosol-monsoon links and their variabilities over the Indian region.In Part 1 of this two-part paper, we present spatially homogeneous gridded datasets of AOD and absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), generated for the first time over this region. These data products are developed by merging the highly accurate aerosol measurements from the dense networks of 44 (for AOD) and 34 (for AAOD) ground-based observatories of Aerosol Radiative Forcing over India NETwork (ARFINET) and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) spread across the Indian region, with satellite-retrieved AOD and AAOD, following statistical assimilation schemes. The satellite data used for AOD assimilation include AODs retrieved from MODerate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) over the same domain. For AAOD, the ground-based black carbon (BC) mass concentration measurements from the network of 34 ARFINET observatories and satellite-based (Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A) infrared (IR) radiance measurements are blended with gridded AAODs (500?nm, monthly mean) derived from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-retrieved AAODs (at 354 and 388?nm). The details of the assimilation methods and the gridded datasets generated are presented in this paper.The merged gridded AOD and AAOD products thus generated are validated against the data from independent ground-based observatories, which were not used for the assimilation process but are representative of different subregions of the complex domain. This validation exercise revealed that the independent ground-based measurements are better confirmed by merged datasets than the respective satellite products. As ensured by assimilation techniques employed, the uncertainties in merged AODs and AAODs are significantly less than those in corresponding satellite products. These merged products also all exhibit important large-scale spatial and temporal features which are already reported for this region. Nonetheless, the merged AODs and AAODs are significantly different in magnitude from the respective satellite products. On the background of above-mentioned quality enhancements demonstrated by merged products, we have employed them for deriving the columnar SSA and analysed its spatiotemporal characteristics. The columnar SSA thus derived has demonstrated distinct seasonal variation over various representative subregions of the study domain. The uncertainties in the derived SSA are observed to be substantially less than those in OMI SSA. On the backdrop of these benefits, the merged datasets are employed for the estimation of regional aerosol radiative effects (direct), the results of which would be presented in a companion paper, Part 2 of this two-part paper.

TI  - Flexibility in Existential Beliefs and Worldview: Testing Measurement Invariance and Factorial Structure of the Existential Quest Scale in an Italian Sample of Adults
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the psychometric properties of the Existential Quest (EQ) Scale, a nine-items instrument developed to assess openness to changing one's own convictions concerning existential issues. We developed the Italian version of the scale and examined factorial structure, internal consistency, discriminant validity, and measurement invariance across gender and age groups. A total of 291 Italian adults were recruited, and they completed a self-report questionnaire comprising measures of authoritarianism, cognitive closure, well-being, and religiousness, alongside the EQ. Confirmatory factor analysis showed that the original one-factor structure was replicated in this study, except for one-item that was removed from the subsequent analyses. Both the internal consistency of the eight-item scale as assessed by Cronbach's a and discriminant validity were in line with those of the original study. However, McDonald's reliability coefficient were quite low, and further researches employing repeated measures are needed in order to comprehend the contribution of the random error and that of the item specificity in lowering McDonald's coefficient. Finally, evidence of full measurement invariance across gender and partial measurement invariance across age was obtained. Overall, these findings suggest that the Italian version of the EQ is a promising tool for assessing flexibility about existential issues.

TI  - Slow Slip Event On the Southern San Andreas Fault Triggered by the 2017 <i>M</i><sub><i>w</i></sub>8.2 Chiapas (Mexico) Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of shallow fault creep reveal increasingly complex time-dependent slip histories that include quasi-steady creep and triggered as well as spontaneous accelerated slip events. Here we report a recent slow slip event on the southern San Andreas fault triggered by the 2017 M(w)8.2 Chiapas (Mexico) earthquake that occurred 3,000 km away. Geodetic and geologic observations indicate that surface slip on the order of 10 mm occurred on a 40-km-long section of the southern San Andreas fault between the Mecca Hills and Bombay Beach, starting minutes after the Chiapas earthquake and continuing for more than a year. Both the magnitude and the depth extent of creep vary along strike. We derive a high-resolution map of surface displacements by combining Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar acquisitions from different lines of sight. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar-derived displacements are in good agreement with the creepmeter data and field mapping of surface offsets. Inversions of surface displacement data using dislocation models indicate that the highest amplitudes of surface slip are associated with shallow (<1 km) transient slip. We performed 2-D simulations of shallow creep on a strike-slip fault obeying rate-and-state friction to constrain frictional properties of the top few kilometers of the upper crust that can produce the observed behavior.

TI  - Synergistic RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR Images for Ocean Feature Analysis
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a case study approach, the utility of synergistic RADARSAT-2 (R2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is demonstrated for ocean feature signature analysis in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream. The R2 and S1 images considered are either spatially adjacent or spatially overlapping, and were quasi-simultaneously collected (i.e., within minutes of each other). Spatially adjacent R2 and S1 imagery allows ocean feature signatures to be delineated over large spatial areas, while spatially overlapping R2 and S1 imagery collected within short time intervals provides independent 'looks' at the same ocean features. This permits determination of the surface displacement of features, potentially leading to improved classification of the origin of ocean feature signatures (quasi-stationary features are likely related to sea surface temperature fronts, while mobile features are likely related to atmospheric conditions). Further, we demonstrate how the use of S1 Level-2 products (i.e. radial velocity datasets) can be leveraged as contextual data to improve the interpretation and classification of ocean feature signatures extracted from R2 imagery. Despite the straight-forward approach taken here, this work demonstrates that there are practical, real-world applications that would benefit from exploiting these on-going imaging opportunities in operational environments.

TI  - Estimation of PM2.<i>5</i> Concentrations in China Using a Spatial Back Propagation Neural Network
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for estimating the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations have been developed but have not yet been able to effectively include spatial correlation. We report on the development of a spatial back-propagation neural network (S-BPNN) model designed specifically to make such correlations implicit by incorporating a spatial lag variable (SLV) as a virtual input variable. The S-BPNN fits the nonlinear relationship between ground-based air quality monitoring station measurements of PM2.5, satellite observations of aerosol optical depth, meteorological synoptic conditions data and emissions data that include auxiliary geographical parameters such as land use, normalized difference vegetation index, elevation, and population density. We trained and validated the S-BPNN for both yearly and seasonal mean PM2.5 concentrations. In addition, principal components analysis was employed to reduce the dimensionality of the data and a grid of neural network models was run to optimize the model design. The S-BPNN was cross-validated against an analogous but SLV-free BPNN model using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean squared error (RMSE) as statistical measures of goodness of fit. The inclusion of the SLV led to demonstrably superior performance of the S-BPNN over the BPNN with R-2 values increasing from 0.80 to 0.89 and with the RMSE decreasing from 8.1 to 5.8 mu g/m(3). The yearly mean PM(2.5 )concentration in China during the study period was found to be 41.8 mu g/m(3) and the model estimated spatial distribution was found to exceed Level 2 of the China Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) enacted in 2012 (>35 mu g/m(3)) in more than 70% of the Chinese territory. The inclusion of spatial correlation upgrades the performance of conventional BPNN models and provides a more accurate estimation of PM(2.5 )concentrations for air quality monitoring.

TI  - On the multi-fractal scaling properties of sea ice deformation
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we evaluate the neXtSIM sea ice model with respect to the observed scaling invariance properties of sea ice deformation in the spatial and temporal domains. Using an Arctic setup with realistic initial conditions, state-of-the-art atmospheric reanalysis forcing and geostrophic currents retrieved from satellite data, we show that the model is able to reproduce the observed properties of this scaling in both the spatial and temporal domains over a wide range of scales, as well as their multi-fractality. The variability of these properties during the winter season is also captured by the model. We also show that the simulated scaling exhibits a space-time coupling, a suggested property of brittle deformation at geophysical scales. The ability to reproduce the multi-fractality of this scaling is crucial in the context of downscaling model simulation outputs to infer sea ice variables at the sub-grid scale and also has implications for modeling the statistical properties of deformation-related quantities, such as lead fractions and heat and salt fluxes.

TI  - Landsat 8-observed water quality and its coupled environmental factors for urban scenery lakes: A case study of West Lake
T2  - WATER ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Urban scenery lakes are not only popular sites for recreation, water sport, and visit of citizens and tourists, but also function for urban water drainage and storage, and hence, their water quality is a sensitive indicator of urban aquatic environment. This study focused on two important water quality parameters, TSM (total suspended matter) and CDOM (colored dissolved organic matter) in West Lake, a world famous urban scenery lake in Hangzhou, China. Based on Landsat 8 images, remote sensing inversion models for TSM and CDOM in West Lake were compared and the best ones were determined using exponential functions and green/red band ratios. Results show that the accuracy of TSM models is relatively better while CDOM models performed relatively poor, indicating that empirical estimation of CDOM for inland complex waters remains a challenge. The Landsat 8-derived results in West Lake from 2013 to 2017 show that TSM presented diverse distributions in different sections and months/seasons-the relatively high-concentration TSM was usually found in the north section and during spring festivals, holidays and summer vacations. These spatiotemporal patterns demonstrate the evidence that TSM in West Lake was highly linked to anthropogenic impacts, such as tourist visits, commercial activities, and urban drainage projects in Hangzhou. The relations between TSM and precipitation were also examined, but no significant correlations were found, showing that the impacts of rainfall on water quality of urban lakes are complicated, and using remote sensing for such studies is still with limitations. Practitioner pointsWater quality (TSM and CDOM) of urban scenery lakes is highly influenced by urban tourist activities. Precipitation and TSM have not found significant relations in urban scenery lakes. An exponential model based on Landsat 8's bands 3 and 4 is good for TSM estimation. CDOM estimation remains a challenge for water color remote sensing in urban scenery lakes.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics in the face of a major land-use change: a 30-year case study from semi-arid South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wildlife production is widely considered beneficial for semi-arid environments, few studies have reported on the long-term environmental effects of converting from livestock production to game ranching. Asante Sana Game Reserve in South Africa was stocked with domestic livestock for centuries. However, after 1996 game ranching was adopted in the reserve. We investigated the long-term (1987-2017) spatial and temporal change in vegetation productivity and type on the reserve using Landsat multispectral data and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and explored the relationship between changes in vegetation productivity and the potential drivers. The results show that while Thicket has decreased overall, it has expanded into parts of Grassland and Shrubland, and Bare-ground has expanded into parts of Shrubland and Thicket. Overall vegetation productivity increased over time, with the greatest increases in Thicket and Grazing lawn and the lowest in Shrubland and Bare-ground. Changes in rainfall, fire and stocking rates were all significant predictors of the observed changes in vegetation productivity, but rainfall had the strongest effect. This research highlights some of the complex responses that arise in semi-arid vegetation when domestic livestock production is replaced by game ranching, and points towards key issues that can be addressed by management.

TI  - Empirical habitat suitability model for immature albacore tuna in the North Pacific Ocean obtained using multisatellite remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study developed an empirical habitat suitability model for identifying the optimal habitat of immature albacore tuna in the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) by using multisatellite remote sensing data and Taiwanese longline fisheries data between 2009 and 2016. An arithmetic mean model with five environmental variables is suggested to be appropriate for explaining the habitat variance of albacore in the NPO. A monthly albacore mean catch per unit effort (CPUE) of larger than 29.5 individuals/1,000 hooks occurred from November to March and was distributed over 25-40 degrees N. The optimal range of environmental variables in the sea surface temperature, sea surface height, mixed layer depth, sea surface chlorophyll-a concentration of the previous month, and eddy kinetic energy for the habitat of albacore are suggested to be approximately 17-21 degrees C, 0.24-0.84 m, 15-100 m, 0.07-0.29 mg m(-3), and 0.0001-0.0031 m(2) s(-2), respectively. We discovered a significant positive relationship between the suitable habitat area and nominal CPUE of immature albacore in the NPO (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.982). The mean position of the optimum habitat shifted southwardly from near 38 degrees N in November to near 28-31 degrees N during February to March. Overall, frontal structures play a major role in the stimulation of potential albacore habitats.

AB  - With the increasing diversity of applications based on the Gaofen-2 satellite imagery, broadly applicable methods to generate high quality fused images is a significant problem to investigate. To obtain an image with high spatial and spectral resolutions from given panchromatic (Pan) images and multispectral (MS) images, most existing fusion algorithms adopt a unified strategy for the whole image. However, regions have distinct characteristics that impact the spatial and spectral resolution processing, on account of their varying regional features. In this article, to satisfy the diverse needs of different regions, a novel fast IHS (Intensity-Hue-Saturation) transform fusion method driven by regional spectral characteristics is proposed to fuse Gaofen-2 imagery. First, by the fast IHS transform framework, the original intensity component is obtained from the upsampled MS imagery. Then, numerous independent regions of upsampled MS imagery are generated by a novel superpixel merging strategy, and the spectral characteristics of these regions are utilized for generating a fusion factor. Next, to acquire a new fused intensity component, the fusion factor is applied to guide the injection of details in the fusion procedure. This fusion factor adapts the method to meet the spatial and spectral resolution needs for each region. Finally, the difference between the new fused intensity component and the original one is regarded as the detail that needs to be injected; these are added equally to the different bands of the upsampled MS imagery to yield the final fused multispectral image. In comparison with other classical algorithms, the visual and statistical analysis reveal that our proposed method can provide better results in improving spatial detail and preserving spectral information.

TI  - An Alternative Approach for Deriving Emission Inventories Solely From Satellite Data: Demonstration for NO<sub>2</sub> Over China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate an alternative method for deriving of emission estimates for pollutants using solely columnar satellite data. The method, which we term Lifetime-Modified Accumulation Method (LMAM), does not require any ancillary model run or other data to estimate emissions, but needs only the measured columnar amounts. It employs lifetime calculations from measured daily columnar amounts. The method is applied to nitrogen dioxide over China on a 0.25 x 0.25 and a 1 x 1 degrees grid, and emission estimates are derived and compared with a more traditional method. The emission estimates thus derived appear to be consistent with traditional methods, both in their spatial distribution and their magnitude, and correlate well with existing inventories. Ways for refining the method are discussed. The method can be improved, we only wanted to demonstrate here it is feasible to derive inventories solely from satellite data using lifetime calculations.

TI  - Rapid estimation of bathymetry from multispectral imagery without <i>in situ</i> bathymetry data
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimization-based semi-analytical methods (OSMs) and empirical methods (EMs) have been developed to derive bathymetry maps from satellite-based multispectral data of coral reefs, allowing for the management, monitoring, and protection of coral reefs. However, OSMs are often criticized due to the time-consuming requirements of iterative computations, yet they are praised for working without the need for in situ bathymetry data. EMs are praised for their time-saving characteristics and criticized for their need for in situ measurements. To estimate the water depth from multispectral data quickly without in situ bathymetry data, we provide a new EM that combines our previously developed OSM called the unmixing-based multispectral optimization process exemplar method (UMOPE) and an EM called Stumpfs ratio method (SRM). In the new method, reflectance values from a small number of sampled pixels and the corresponding water depths estimated by UMOPE are used to determine the regression parameters for SRM. Thus, SRM determines the upper limit of accuracy for the new method, and UMOPE determines the possibility of reaching the upper limit. The new method was evaluated using three types of imagery of Xisha Islands, namely, WorldView-2 imagery with three traditional visible bands (WV-2a), Landsat 8 imagery with four visible bands, and WV-2 imagery with six visible bands (WV-2b). The results show that the new method can perform as well as SRM for Landsat 8 data and WV-2b data with similar root mean square error values at different depths. The lack of a coastal band in WV-2a imagery may cause large errors for the new method in deep water regions, especially when the water-leaving reflectance is noise perturbed. We found that even though the depths estimated by UMOPE are not error free at different ranges of water depth, if the regression line between the depths estimated by UMOPE and the measured depths is near the 1:1 line, the new method can perform as well as SRM. The new method may facilitate the rapid estimation of bathymetry from free Landsat 8 data of optically shallow waters around the world without in situ bathymetry data.

TI  - 4T1 Mammary Carcinoma Colonization of Metastatic Niches Is Accelerated by Obesity
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women, and the chances to develop it are duplicated by obesity. Still, the impact of obesity during BC progression remains less understood. We investigated the role of obesity in tumor progression using the murine model of 4T1 mammary carcinoma in BALB/c female mice, previously high-fat-diet (HFD) fed. HFD induced obesity, metabolic impairment, and high serum and fat leptin levels. After injection of 4T1-cells, HFD-mice accelerated tumor progression and metastasis. 4T1-cells found within HFD-mice metastatic niches presented higher clonogenic potential. 4T1-cells treated in vitro with fat-conditioned medium derived from HFD-mice, increased migration capacity through CXCL12 and CCL25 gradients. In HFD-mice, the infiltration and activation of immune cells into tumor-sentinel lymph nodes was overall reduced, except for activated CD4(+) T cells expressing low CD25 levels. Within the bone marrow, the levels of haematopoiesis-related IL-6 and TNF-alpha decreased after 4T1-cells injection in HFD-mice whereas increased in the controls, suggesting that upregulation of both cytokines, regardless of the tumor, is disrupted by obesity. Finally, the expression of genes for leptin, CXCR4, and CCR9 (receptors of CXCL12 and CCL25, respectively) was negatively correlated with the infiltration of CD8 T cells in human triple-negative BC tumors from obese patients compared to non-obese. Together, our data present early evidence of systemic networks triggered by obesity that promote BC progression to the metastatic niches. Targeting these pathways might be useful to prevent the rapid BC progression observed among obese patients.

TI  - Timeliness of rotavirus vaccination at sentinel sites in four early-adopter African countries
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The majority of countries with the highest rotavirus-associated death rates are in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended routine vaccination against rotavirus worldwide, with unique age recommendations to administer the first dose before 15 weeks of age and last dose by 32 weeks of age. These age restrictions were relaxed in January 2013, but they may still lead to lower rotavirus vaccine coverage.Methods: Children age-eligible to have received rotavirus vaccine that were enrolled in Ghana, Zimbabwe, Rwanda or Burkina Faso's active rotavirus surveillance platforms from 2013 to 2017 and had a stool specimen that tested rotavirus-negative were included in the analysis. Proportion vaccinated and timeliness of rotavirus vaccine versus DTPw-HepB-Hib (pentavalent) first dose and last dose were compared at weeks 15 and 32, respectively, using Chi-square analyses. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression.Results: Among children who received rotavirus vaccine dose 1, 96-99% received this dose by 15 weeks of age and among children who received the last dose, 98-99% received it by 32 weeks of age. In all four countries, there was no significant difference in the proportion of children who received first dose rotavirus versus pentavalent vaccine by week 15, or last dose rotavirus versus concordant pentavalent vaccine by week 32. Delayed administration of first dose pentavalent vaccine was significantly associated with missing first dose of rotavirus vaccine in 3 of the 4 countries studied, although delays in administration were rare (1-4%).Conclusions: Rotavirus vaccination was timely among sentinel sites in these four early rotavirus vaccine-introducing countries in Africa. Late presentation for vaccination may have resulted in some children with access to care missing first dose of rotavirus vaccine; however, vaccination delays were infrequent and therefore the potential impact of the age restrictions on overall proportion vaccinated was minimal.

TI  - An Automated Approach for Estimating Snowline Altitudes in the Karakoram and Eastern Himalaya From Remote Sensing
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation of fresh snow, exposed glacier ice and debris covered ice on glacier surfaces is needed for hydrologic applications and for understanding the response of glaciers to climate variability. The end-of-season snowline altitude (SLA) is an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of a glacier and is often used to infer the mass balance of a glacier. Regional snowline estimates are generally missing from glacier inventories for remote, high-altitude glacierized areas such as High Mountain Asia. In this study, we present an automated, decision-based image classification algorithm implemented in Python to separate snow, ice and debris surfaces on glaciers and to extract glacier snowlines at monthly and annual time steps and regional scales. The method was applied in the Hunza basin in the Karakoram and the Trishuli basin in eastern Himalaya. We automatically partitioned the various types of surfaces on glaciers at each time step using image band ratios combined with topographic criteria based on two versions of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation dataset. SLAs were extracted on a pixel-by-pixel basis using a "buffer" method adapted for each elevation dataset. Over the period studied (2000-2016), end-of-the-ablation season annual ELAs fluctuated from 4,917 to 5,336 m a.s.l. for the Hunza, with a 16-year average of 5,177 +/- 108 m a.s.l., and 5,395-5,565 m a.s.l. for the Trishuli, with an average of 5,444 +/- 63 m a.s.l. Snowlines were sensitive to the manual corrections of the partition, the topographic slope, the elevation dataset and the band ratio thresholds particularly during the spring and winter months, and were not sensitive to the size of the buffer used to extract the snowlines. With further refinement and calibration with field measurements, this method can be easily applied to higher resolution Sentinel-2 data (5 days temporal resolution) as well as daily PlanetScope to derive sub-monthly snowlines.

TI  - Towards a religiously literate curriculum - religion and worldview literacy as an educational model
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The phrase 'religious literacy' whilst contested, is increasingly used both within Religious Education and more broadly in a range of professions and settings to describe a level of knowledge and understanding about the diverse religion and belief landscape and the skills to be able to engage with that diversity in a positive way. Taking as a starting point a four-part theoretical framework for religious literacy, consisting of a) category b) disposition c) knowledge and d) skills, this is examined in relation to learning about religion and worldviews in schools and developed into an educational model. Drawing on data from a national study into stakeholders' views on the future of teaching and learning about religion and worldviews in schools, this article explores the potential of 'religion and worldview literacy' to reconcile stakeholders' aspirations for the purpose and content of learning in RE. Religion and worldview literacy is presented as a model with potential to bridge perceived tensions between intrinsic and instrumental aims of RE and concerns around its knowledge-base.

TI  - Impacts of land use/land cover on runoff and energy budgets in an East Asia ecosystem from remotely sensed data in a community land model
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) conditions on the global water and energy budgets are essential to understanding climate intensification in the 21st century. This study evaluated latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and runoff in four climate regions (temperate, continental, arid, and tropical) in East Asia from 2001 to 2015. Two community land model (CLM) experiments were performed using default LULC data (CLM 4.0) and newly created Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based LULC data from 2010 (CLM 2010) to assess the impact of LULC changes on climate. Anthropogenic LULC changes have considerable impacts on the climate and its extremes. For the whole East Asia region, area-averaged runoff decreased by 2.10%. The temperate region experienced a 3.16% decrease in runoff and a 422% increase in LE due to an increase in irrigation activities that could lead to the drying of soil moisture and drought in the future. In contrast, the arid region experienced a 630% increase in runoff despite dry conditions and a 5.70% reduction in LE, which ultimately increased H by 2.25% and caused an intensification of the climate in the form of strong heat waves and floods. The continental region followed the same trend as the temperate region with a noticeable decrease in winter H, which caused severe cold weather. The tropical region showed a slight impact of LULC change on energy fluxes due to high precipitation and intense solar radiations. Overall, the results of this research follow the 'dry gets drier and wet gets wetter' paradigm due to LULC changes in the study region. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping precipitation-corrected NDVI trends across Namibia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannas comprise a major component of the Earth system and contribute ecosystem services and functions essential to human livelihoods. Monitoring spatial and temporal trends in savanna vegetation and understanding change drivers is therefore crucial. Widespread greening has been identified across southern Africa; yet its drivers and manifestations on the ground remain ambiguous. This study removes the effects of precipitation on an NDVI time-series, thereby identifying trends not driven by rainfall. It utilizes the significant correlation between vegetation and precipitation as captured using MODIS and rainfall estimates. A linear regression between variables was used to derive its residual (corrected) time-series, and the rate and spatial extent of trends were evaluated in relation to biomes. A random sample-based qualitative interpretation of high spatial resolution imagery was then used to evaluate the nature of the trend on the ground. 23.25% of the country, including all biomes exhibited positive trends. We propose that greening may be related to a reduction in woody species richness, loss of the large trees and a shift towards drought tolerant shrub species, as has been shown in other sub-Saharan environments. 3.23% of the country exhibited negative trends, which were mostly associated with more humid (forested) regions pointing to deforestation as a cause; these manifested as vegetation clearing, identifiable using high resolution multi-temporal imagery. Greening trends could not be identified using this approach; instead, they point to the occurrence of gradual vegetation change caused by indirect drivers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - High-fidelity Imaging of the Inner AU Mic Debris Disk: Evidence of Differential Wind Sculpting?
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new high-fidelity optical coronagraphic imagery of the inner similar to 50 au of AU Mic's edge-on debris disk using the BAR5 occulter of the Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS) obtained on 2018 July 26-27. This new imagery reveals that "feature A," residing at a projected stellocentric separation of 14.2 au on the southeast side of the disk, exhibits an apparent "loop-like" morphology at the time of our observations. The loop has a projected width of 1.5 au and rises 2.3 au above the disk midplane. We also explored Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometric observations of AU Mic that are consistent with evidence of two starspot complexes in the system. The likely co-alignment of the stellar and disk rotational axes breaks degeneracies in detailed spot modeling, indicating that AU Mic's projected magnetic field axis is offset from its rotational axis. We speculate that small grains in AU Mic's disk could be sculpted by a time-dependent wind that is influenced by this offset magnetic field axis, analogous to co-rotating solar interaction regions that sculpt and influence the inner and outer regions of our own Heliosphere. Alternatively, if the observed spot modulation is indicative of a significant misalignment of the stellar and disk rotational axes, we suggest that the disk could still be sculpted by the differential equatorial versus polar wind that it sees with every stellar rotation.

T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Having enjoyed remarkable economic success, China's natural environment is being increasingly degraded, and with it, the quality of life. Researchers and environmentalists have responded by exploring whether cultural resources can provide a means of understanding ecological systems. This article reviews philosophical Chinese concepts of tian-ren-he-yi and ecological time, and ponders their implications for understanding current ecological challenges. A motif of ancient Chinese thought, tian-ren-he-yi perceives the cosmos as an organic, mutually reciprocal entity in which human beings coexist harmoniously with nature. This entity does not unfold by following a cyclical pattern, but rather through a process of transformative harmony with the flow of time. In contrast to the linear time constructed by community life, this view of ecological time can reveal the new dimension of rhythm. To enhance children's awareness of their responsibility for caring for the environment, we must protect their rights to a safe and healthy place to live, ensure that they have free access to nature, and demonstrate the pedagogic value of an anthropocosmic worldview and ecological time.

TI  - Distribution of the Duffy genotypes in Malaysian Borneo and its relation to <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> malaria susceptibility
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Duffy blood group plays a key role in Plasmodium knowlesi and Plasmodium vivax invasion into human erythrocytes. The geographical distribution of the Duffy alleles differs between regions with the FY* A allele having high frequencies in many Asian populations, the FY*B allele is found predominately in European populations and the FY*Bes allele found predominantly in African regions. A previous study in Peninsular Malaysia indicated high homogeneity of the dominant FY* A/FY* A genotype. However, the distribution of the Duffy genotypes in Malaysian Borneo is currently unknown. In the present study, the distribution of Duffy blood group genotypes and allelic frequencies among P. knowlesi infected patients as well as healthy individuals in Malaysian Borneo were determined. A total of 79 P. knowlesi patient blood samples and 76 healthy donor samples were genotyped using allele specific polymerase chain reaction (ASP-PCR). Subsequently a P. knowlesi invasion assay was carried out on FY* AB/ FY* A and FY* A/ FY* A Duffy genotype blood to investigate if either genotype conferred increased susceptibility to P. knowlesi invasion. Our results show almost equal distribution between the homozygous FY*A/FY*A and heterozygous FY*A/ FY* B genotypes. This is in stark contrast to the Duffy distribution in Peninsular Malaysia and the surrounding Southeast Asian region which is dominantly FY*A/FY*A. The mean percent invasion of FY*A/FY*A and FY*A/FY*B blood was not significantly different indicating that neither blood group confers increased susceptibility to P. knowlesi invasion.

TI  - Use of spectral cloud emissivities and their related uncertainties to infer ice cloud boundaries: methodology and assessment using CALIPSO cloud products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-imager-based operational cloud property retrievals generally assume that a cloudy pixel can be treated as being plane-parallel with horizontally homogeneous properties. This assumption can lead to high uncertainties in cloud heights, particularly for the case of optically thin, but geometrically thick, clouds composed of ice particles. This study demonstrates that ice cloud emissivity uncertainties can be used to provide a reasonable range of ice cloud layer boundaries, i.e., the minimum to maximum heights. Here ice cloud emissivity uncertainties are obtained for three IR channels centered at 11, 12, and 13.3 mu m. The range of cloud emissivities is used to infer a range of ice cloud temperature and heights, rather than a single value per pixel as provided by operational cloud retrievals. Our methodology is tested using MODIS observations over the western North Pacific Ocean during August 2015. We estimate minimum-maximum heights for three cloud regimes, i.e., single-layered optically thin ice clouds, single-layered optically thick ice clouds, and multilayered clouds. Our results are assessed through comparison with CALIOP version 4 cloud products for a total of 11873 pixels. The cloud boundary heights for single-layered optically thin clouds show good agreement with those from CALIOP; biases for maximum (minimum) heights versus the cloud-top (base) heights of CALIOP are 0.13 km (-1.01 km). For optically thick and multilayered clouds, the biases of the estimated cloud heights from the cloud top or cloud base become larger (0.30/-1.71 km, 1.41/-4.64 km). The vertically resolved boundaries for ice clouds can contribute new information for data assimilation efforts for weather prediction and radiation budget studies. Our method is applicable to measurements provided by most geostationary weather satellites including the GK-2A advanced multichannel infrared imager.

TI  - Percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound for localization and diagnosis of sentinel lymph node in early breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the efficacy of percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in localization sentinel lymph node (SLNs) for biopsy and diagnosis of metastatic SLNs in patients with early breast cancer. From January to November 2017, seventy-five patients with early breast cancer confirmed by pathology were enrolled in this study. CEUS was performed after subdermal injection of ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue, 2.0 ml in total dose) around the areola on the ipsilateral side of the breast. The contrast-enhanced lymphatic vessels and associated SLNs were observed and traced in real time. The lymphatic vessels and SLN were mapped and labeled on the skin surface. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was performed after injection of 2.0 ml methylene blue at same injection site of SonoVue. The accuracy of percutaneous CEUS localization of SLNs was determined compared to blue dye injection technique. The pathological results under blue dye guided biopsy were used as the reference standard to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for the diagnosis of SLNs. A total of 163 SLNs obtained through SLNB following methylene blue tracing in 75 patients. There were 116 SLNs identified by percutaneous CEUS. The difference of detection rates between blue dye and CEUS was statistically significant (Z = -2.651, P = 0.008). The identification rate of SLNs by CEUS was 71.17% (116/163). The accuracy of percutaneous CEUS localization of axillary SLNs was 94.67% (71/75) compared to blue dye-guided biopsy. Among the 116 SLNs detected by percutaneous CEUS, pathologic results showed 51 positive SLNs and 65 negative SLNs whiles CEUS findings indicated 83 positive SLNs and 33 negative SLNs. Only 50 of 83 SLNs had metastasis on pathology, while 33 were detected as false positive. The sensitivity and specificity of CEUS for the diagnosis of metastatic SLN was 98.04%(50/51) and 49.23%(32/65), respectively. Percutaneous CEUS can be used as an effective method to localize the SLNs for guiding SLNB. This method has excellent sensitivity for identifying the SLNs but lower specificity for detecting metastatic SLNs in patients with early stage breast cancer.

TI  - Changes in Antarctic coastline between 1997 and 2016 using RADARSAT and MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have already indicated more disintegrations and calving of ice margins and a significant negative ice balance at certain parts of Antarctica in recent times. Changes in extent of ice shelves as well as glacier fronts are indeed good signatures of climate change. This paper essentially discusses the changes in Antarctic ice margins between 1997 and 2016. Change-detection technique has been employed using the Radar Satellite (RADARSAT) mosaic of 1997 and the mosaic of Antarctic ice margins generated using MODerate resolution Imaging Satellite (MODIS) images of 2016, with the help of Earth Resources Development Assessment system (ERDAS) Imagine software. Hotspots, where significant changes occurred, have been identified. Most part of the Antarctic coast between 75 degrees E and 45 degrees W, covering all West Antarctica and about half of East Antarctica, has shown definite retreat during this period. Major retreats are observed over the both sides of Ross ice shelf, Ronne ice shelf, Thwaites glacier, and Mertz glacier. Major advancements are observed over Filchner ice shelf, Amery ice shelf, middle portion of Ross ice shelf, and Stancomwills glacier tongue. Over the East Antarctica, areas of advancement and retreat are nearly same. But, over the West Antarctica, the area of retreat is significantly higher than area of advancement.

TI  - Advanced Nanotechnology Leading the Way to Multimodal Imaging-Guided Precision Surgical Therapy
T2  - ADVANCED MATERIALS
M3  - Review
AB  - Surgical resection is the primary and most effective treatment for most patients with solid tumors. However, patients suffer from postoperative recurrence and metastasis. In the past years, emerging nanotechnology has led the way to minimally invasive, precision and intelligent oncological surgery after the rapid development of minimally invasive surgical technology. Advanced nanotechnology in the construction of nanomaterials (NMs) for precision imaging-guided surgery (IGS) as well as surgery-assisted synergistic therapy is summarized, thereby unlocking the advantages of nanotechnology in multimodal IGS-assisted precision synergistic cancer therapy. First, mechanisms and principles of NMs to surgical targets are briefly introduced. Multimodal imaging based on molecular imaging technologies provides a practical method to achieve intraoperative visualization with high resolution and deep tissue penetration. Moreover, multifunctional NMs synergize surgery with adjuvant therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, immunotherapy, phototherapy) to eliminate residual lesions. Finally, key issues in the development of ideal theranostic NMs associated with surgical applications and challenges of clinical transformation are discussed to push forward further development of NMs for multimodal IGS-assisted precision synergistic cancer therapy.

TI  - The potential of satellite remote sensing for monitoring the onset of volcanic activity on Taipei's doorstep
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tatun Volcanic Group (TVG) in northern Taiwan is the sole volcanic region on the island, with its last eruptive episode around 5,500 years ago. It has been suggested that the TVG retains the capacity for volcanic explosivity which has the potential to devastate the nearby Taipei metropolitan area of 7 million inhabitants. Though the probability of future eruption is low by probabilistic estimation, the vulnerability to volcanic hazards is high for Taipei given that it is the centre of population, industry, and government for the island. An assessment of any activity precursors is thus vital but also particularly challenging. Here, we perform an eruption-potential assessment based on the analysis of a sixteen-year Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series of data derived from satellite-retrieved thermal imagery. A Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) is applied to decompose oscillatory components of various timescales within the LST time series. The annual-period components are compared with those fromtwo active volcanoes in the Philippines to assess the potential oferuption cycles in the TVG. Results from the Philippine volcanoesshow that annual-period components of LST tend to lose theirregularity following an eruption. By contrast, the regular annualperiodcomponent of LST of the TVG Taiwan suggests a quiet andresting status with no sign of an imminent eruption.

TI  - Vegetation structural change since 1981 significantly enhanced the terrestrial carbon sink
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show that leaf area index (LAI) has increased globally since 1981, but the impact of this vegetation structural change on the global terrestrial carbon cycle has not been systematically evaluated. Through process-based diagnostic ecosystem modeling, we find that the increase in LAI alone was responsible for 12.4% of the accumulated terrestrial carbon sink (95 +/- 5 Pg C) from 1981 to 2016, whereas other drivers of CO2 fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and climate change (temperature, radiation, and precipitation) contributed to 47.0%, 1.1%, and - 28.6% of the sink, respectively. The legacy effects of past changes in these drivers prior to 1981 are responsible for the remaining 65.5% of the accumulated sink from 1981 to 2016. These results refine the attribution of the land sink to the various drivers and would help constrain prognostic models that often have large uncertainties in simulating changes in vegetation and their impacts on the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Detecting influenza and emerging avian influenza virus by influenza and pneumonia surveillance systems in a large city in China, 2005 to 2016
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Detecting avian influenza virus has become an important public health strategy for controlling the emerging infectious disease. Methods The HIS (hospital information system) modified influenza surveillance system (ISS) and a newly built pneumonia surveillance system (PSS) were used to monitor the influenza viruses in Changsha City, China. The ISS was used to monitor outpatients in two sentinel hospitals and to detect mild influenza and avian influenza cases, and PSS was used to monitor inpatients in 49 hospitals and to detect severe and death influenza cases. Results From 2005 to 2016, there were 3,551,917 outpatients monitored by the ISS system, among whom 126,076 were influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, with the ILI proportion (ILI%) of 3.55%. After the HIS was used, the reported incident cases of ILI and ILI% were increased significantly. From March, 2009 to September, 2016, there were 5,491,560 inpatient cases monitored by the PSS system, among which 362,743 were pneumonia cases, with a proportion of 6.61%. Among pneumonia cases, about 10.55% (38,260/362,743) of cases were severe or death cases. The pneumonia incidence increased each year in the city. Among 15 avian influenza cases reported from January, 2005 to September, 2016, there were 26.7% (4/15) mild cases detected by the HIS-modified ISS system, while 60.0% (9/15) were severe or death cases detected by the PSS system. Two H5N1 severe cases were missed by the ISS system in January, 2009 when the PSS system was not available. Conclusions The HIS was able to improve the efficiency of the ISS for monitoring ILI and emerging avian influenza virus. However, the efficiency of the system needs to be verified in a wider area for a longer time span in China.

TI  - Remote Sensing Landslide Recognition Based on Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a type of frequent and widespread natural disaster. It is of great significance to extract location information from the landslide in time. At present, most articles still select single band or RGB bands as the feature for landslide recognition. To improve the efficiency of landslide recognition, this study proposed a remote sensing recognition method based on the convolutional neural network of the mixed spectral characteristics. Firstly, this paper tried to add NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) and NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy) to enhance the features. Then, remote sensing images (predisaster and postdisaster images) with same spatial information but different time series information regarding landslide are taken directly from GF-1 satellite as input images. By combining the 4 bands (red + green + blue + near-infrared) of the prelandslide remote sensing images with the 4 bands of the postlandslide images and NDVI images, images with 9 bands were obtained, and the band values reflecting the changing characteristics of the landslide were determined. Finally, a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was introduced to solve the problem. The proposed method was tested and verified with remote sensing data from the 2015 large-scale landslide event in Shanxi, China, and 2016 large-scale landslide event in Fujian, China. The results showed that the accuracy of the method was high. Compared with the traditional methods, the recognition efficiency was improved, proving the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

TI  - Comparisons of snowmelt detected by microwave sensors on the Shackleton Ice Shelf, East Antarctica
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface snowmelt is of great importance to the ice sheet's mass and energy balance. Microwave sensors, including radiometer and scatterometer can be used to map snowmelt. Two new microwave sensors, including the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT), were compared in terms of their behaviours in snowmelt detection on the Shackleton Ice Shelf (SIS) in East Antarctica. Melt signals were determined by identifying the sharp changes in AMSR2 brightness temperature and ASCAT backscatter. The results suggest that the SIS began to melt in December, melt area shrank quickly in February after reaching the peak in January. Melt area mapped by the two sensors agreed with each other on the SIS, however, also shows local discrepancies in the places with complex terrains. ASCAT failed to recognized melt signals in the regions with blue ice and rock outcrops where extensive melt ponds were observed based on Landsat 8 images. Snowmelt detected by radiometer and scatterometer shows complementary nature, the combination of multisource remote sensing images is expected to provide a better view of the ice sheet surface melting conditions.

TI  - History and future perspectives in Japanese guidelines for endoscopic resection of early gastric cancer
T2  - DIGESTIVE ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Japanese guidelines for gastric cancer treatment were first published in 2001 for the purpose of showing the appropriate indication for each treatment method, thereby reducing differences in the therapeutic approach among institutions, and so on. With the accumulation of evidence and the development and prevalence of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), the criteria for the indication and curability of endoscopic resection (ER) for early gastric cancer (EGC) have expanded. However, several problems still remain. Although a risk-scoring system (eCura system) for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) may help treatment decision in patients who do not meet the curative criteria for ER of EGC, which is referred to as eCura C-2 in the latest guidelines, additional gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy may be excessive for many patients, even those at high risk for LNM. Less-invasive function-preserving surgery, such as non-exposed endoscopic wall-inversion surgery with laparoscopic sentinel node sampling, may overcome this problem. In addition, further less-invasive treatment, such as ER with chemotherapy, should be established for patients who prefer not to undergo additional gastrectomy.

TI  - From <i>In Situ</i> to satellite observations of pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> distribution and aggregation in the Tropical North Atlantic Ocean
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports on observations carried out in the Tropical North Atlantic in summer and autumn 2017, documenting Sargassum aggregations using both ship-deck observations and satellite sensor observations at three resolutions (MSI-10 m, OLCI-300 m, VIIRS-750 m and MODIS-1 km). Both datasets reported that in summer, Sargassum aggregations were mainly observed off Brazil and near the Caribbean Islands, while they accumulated near the African coast in autumn. Based on in situ observations, we propose a five-class typology allowing standardisation of the description of in situ Sargassum raft shapes and sizes. The most commonly observed Sargassum raft type was windrows, but large rafts composed of a quasi-circular patch hundreds of meters wide were also observed. Satellite imagery showed that these rafts formed larger Sargassum aggregations over a wide range of scales, with smaller aggregations (of tens of m(2) area) nested within larger ones (of hundreds of km(2)). Match-ups between different satellite sensors and in situ observations were limited for this dataset, mainly because of high cloud cover during the periods of observation. Nevertheless, comparisons between the two datasets showed that satellite sensors successfully detected Sargassum abundance and aggregation patterns consistent with in situ observations. MODIS and VIIRS sensors were better suited to describing the Sargassum aggregation distribution and dynamics at Atlantic scale, while the new sensors, OLCI and MSI, proved their ability to detect Sargassum aggregations and to describe their (sub-) mesoscale nested structure. The high variability in raft shape, size, thickness, depth and biomass density observed in situ means that caution is called for when using satellite maps of Sargassum distribution and biomass estimation. Improvements would require additional in situ and airborne observations or very high-resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - A global estimate of terrestrial net secondary production of primary consumers
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Net secondary production (NSP) emerges from the consumption of net primary production (NPP) by all heterotrophic organisms. There has been sporadic interest in the importance of NSP, but no global estimates have been produced. Here, we examine NSP and attempt a global estimate using contemporary NPP data combined with modern metabolic scaling theory for consumption rates. We distinguish between potential NSP, as the amount of secondary production that could be supported by NPP, and realized NSP, as the amount remaining after anthropogenic habitat disruption. Location Global. Time period 2000-2014. Methods We present a metabolic model of NSP, implementing a type II functional response for consumption rates, wherein search efficiency and handling time are calculated based on consumer mass and ambient temperature. We solve this model for each 0.05-decimal-degree pixel in the global terrestrial biosphere, using as data inputs NPP (MOD17A3) and land-surface temperature (MOD11C3). We aggregate estimates within global land-cover classifications (MCD12C1) to obtain cover-specific and global estimates of NSP. We also correct our estimates based on declines in consumer abundance reported in Living planet report 2014. Results We estimate that potential NSP is 4.74 Pg C/year globally (95% CI: 3.75-5.75). When we correct for global consumer population declines, realized NSP is estimated at 2.37 Pg C/year (95% CI: 1.86-2.89), a loss of 50% in the rate of carbon flux through secondary consumers. Main conclusions Our estimates should not be viewed as the last word on NSP but are sufficient to suggest that the flux of carbon through consumers is of a similar magnitude to many other fluxes crucial to the global carbon cycle. We view this as a hypothesis to be tested that suggests NSP deserves significantly more attention in Earth systems, macroecology and biogeochemical research.

TI  - Estimation of maize above-ground biomass based on stem-leaf separation strategy integrated with LiDAR and optical remote sensing data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) is an important indicator for effectively assessing crop growth and yield and, in addition, is an important ecological indicator for assessing the efficiency with which crops use light and store carbon in ecosystems. However, most existing methods using optical remote sensing to estimate AGB cannot observe structures below the maize canopy, which may lead to poor estimation accuracy. This paper proposes to use the stem-leaf separation strategy integrated with unmanned aerial vehicle LiDAR and multispectral image data to estimate the AGB in maize. First, the correlation matrix was used to screen optimal the LiDAR structural parameters (LSPs) and the spectral vegetation indices (SVIs). According to the screened indicators, the SVIs and the LSPs were subjected to multivariable linear regression (MLR) with the above-ground leaf biomass (AGLB) and above-ground stem biomass (AGSB), respectively. At the same time, all SVIs derived from multispectral data and all LSPs derived from LiDAR data were subjected to partial least squares regression (PLSR) with the AGLB and AGSB, respectively. Finally, the AGB was computed by adding the AGLB and the AGSB, and each was estimated by using the MLR and the PLSR methods, respectively. The results indicate a strong correlation between the estimated and field-observed AGB using the MLR method (R-2 = 0.82, RMSE = 79.80 g/m(2), NRMSE = 11.12%) and the PLSR method (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 72.28 g/m(2), NRMSE = 10.07%). The results indicate that PLSR more accurately estimates AGB than MLR, with R-2 increasing by 0.04, root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing by 7.52 g/m(2), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) decreasing by 1.05%. In addition, the AGB is more accurately estimated by combining LiDAR with multispectral data than LiDAR and multispectral data alone, with R-2 increasing by 0.13 and 0.30, respectively, RMSE decreasing by 22.89 and 54.92 g/m(2), respectively, and NRMSE decreasing by 4.46% and 7.65%, respectively. This study improves the prediction accuracy of AGB and provides a new guideline for monitoring based on the fusion of multispectral and LiDAR data.

TI  - Influenza epidemiology in patients admitted to sentinel Australian hospitals in 2017: the Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN)
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Influenza Complications Alert Network (FluCAN) is a sentinel-hospital-based surveillance program that operates at sites in all jurisdictions in Australia. This report summarises the epidemiology of hospitalisations with laboratory- confirmed influenza during the 2017 influenza season.In this observational surveillance system, cases were defined as patients admitted to any of the 17 sentinel hospitals with influenza confirmed by nucleic acid detection. Data are also collected on a frequency-matched control group of influenza-negative patients admitted with acute respiratory infection.During the period 3 April to 31 October 2017 (the 2017 influenza season), 4,359 patients were admitted with confirmed influenza to one of 17 FluCAN sentinel hospitals. Of these, 52% were elderly (>= 65 years), 14% were children (<16 years), 6.5% were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, 1.6% were pregnant and 78% had chronic comorbidities. A significant proportion were due to influenza B (31%). Estimated vaccine coverage was 72% in the elderly (>= 65 years), 50% in non-elderly adults with medical comorbidities and 24% in children (<16 years) with medical comorbidities. The estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) in the target population was 23% (95% CI: 7%, 36%).There were a large number of hospital admissions detected with confirmed influenza in this national observational surveillance system in 2017, with case numbers more than twice that reported in 2016.

TI  - Easing the journey home: creating sanctuary for military veterans
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - While most recovery programmes serving veterans include evidence-based treatment practices for PTSD and substance use, they overlook two essential elements of healing that are specific to the needs of veterans: restoring purpose and the capacity for trust. Simplistic definitions of recovery from trauma and substance use for veterans often describe the absence of PTSD symptoms and abstinence from substance use. A fuller and more accurate definition of recovery requires not just the absence of symptoms, but honours how a veteran has been changed by his or her experience, and includes reintegration back into his or her home community. This article will explore how the Sanctuary Model (R), an evidence-supported, clinically grounded organisational intervention implemented in a residential substance use treatment programme, provides a vehicle for reshaping a trauma-organised worldview to a trauma-integrated worldview for veterans.

TI  - Comparing Remote Sensing Methods for Monitoring Karst Rocky Desertification at Sub-pixel Scales in a Highly Heterogeneous Karst Region
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rugged karst terrain relief that creates shadows in satellite imagery, combined with high karst landscape heterogeneity stand in the way of fractional cover retrieval on karst rocky desertification (KRD) monitoring. In this study, we explored the feasibility of applying multispectral high spatial resolution Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) imagery for the fractional cover extraction of rocky outcrops. Dimidiate pixel model (DPM) and spectral mixture analysis (SMA) approaches (including simple endmember spectral mixture analysis and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis) were selected to explore their feasibility for KRD monitoring through accuracy improvement for fraction estimation. Results showed fractional cover retrievals at the sub-pixel scale is essential in highly heterogeneous karst landscapes. Indeed, mixed pixels accounted for 93.7% of the study area in southwest China. Multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis achieved high overall accuracy (80.5%) in monitoring the percentage of rocky outcrop land cover. Furthermore, the predicted exposed bedrock coverage via spectral mixture analysis were similar in sunlit and shadow areas for the same surface types. This reflected that SMA methods could effectively reduce topographic effects of satellite imagery to improve the accuracy of fractional cover extraction at sub-pixel level in heterogeneous and rugged landscapes.

TI  - Comparison of classification methods for urban green space extraction using very high resolution worldview-3 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) plays a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of a city and in ensuring healthy living of the city inhabitants. It is generally suggested that one-third of the city should be covered by green and to ensure this, the city administrators must have an accurate map of the existing UGS. Such a map would be useful to visualize the distribution of the existing green cover and also to find out the areas that can possibly be converted to UGS. Reported studies on UGS mapping have mostly used medium and high resolution images such as Landsat-TM, ETM+, Sentinel-2A, IKONOS, etc. However, studies on the use of very high resolution images for UGS extraction are very limited. The present study is a first attempt in utilizing the very high resolution Worldview-3 image for UGS extraction. Performance of different classification methods such as unsupervised, supervised, object based and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were compared using the pan sharpened Worldview-3 image covering part of New Delhi in India. It was found that the unsupervised classification followed by manual recoding method showed superior performance with overall accuracy (OA) of 99% and kappa coefficient of 0.98. Also, the OA achieved in the present study is the highest when compared to other reported studies on UGS extraction. The map of UGS revealed that almost 40% of the study area is covered by green which is more than the recommended value of 33% (one-third). In order to check the universality of the unsupervised classification approach in extracting UGS, Worldview-3 image covering Rio in Brazil was tested. It was found that an OA of 98% and kappa coefficient of 0.95 were obtained which clearly indicate that the proposed approach would work very well in extracting UGS from any Worldview-3 imagery.

TI  - Forest drought-induced diversity of Hyrcanian individual-tree mortality affected by meteorological and hydrological droughts by analyzing moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer products and spatial autoregressive models over northeast Iran
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study sought to assess the spatial variations of physiological responses of Hyrcanian forests to the hazard intensity of meteorological and hydrological droughts for properly assessing drought-induced tree mortality in northeastern Iran. A variety of time series moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and ground-based measurements were applied to derive the multiple dimensions of droughts and forest stresses. Drought hazard intensity was computed with the combination of the severity, frequency and duration of drought dimensions for each variable. The intensity of tree mortality was calculated by Simpson's diversity index with surveying 30,000 individuals of commercial species suspected to dieback within 100 intact parcels. Spatial autoregressive models were carried out to determine significant meteorological and hydrological drivers that controlling biological responses of forests to drought events and associations of the diversity of tree mortality with these forest responses. Results showed that the hazard intensity of forest water-content-deficit and greenness loss showed higher relationships with the high land surface temperatures and actual evapotranspiration than the precipitation and surface water deficits, however, they did not show significant relationships with the groundwater deficit. Moreover, diversity of tree mortality was associated with forest water content-deficit from moderate to death stages and with forest greenness loss in the only very high defoliation stage. The critical values of forest droughts and diversity of mortality were recorded for the climax tree species. Understanding satellite-derived physiological responses of forests to droughts might help to assess the intensity of tree mortality widely to adopt appropriate strategies for mitigating the impacts of droughts on the tree species.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM) remains an important cause of disease in children in Africa. We describe findings from sentinel site bacterial meningitis surveillance in children <5 years of age in the Republic of Benin, 2011-2016.Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from children admitted to Parakou, Natitingou, and Tanguieta sentinel hospitals with suspected meningitis. Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) was performed by rapid diagnostic tests, microbiological culture, and/or polymerase chain reaction; where possible, serotyping/grouping was performed.Results. A total of 10 919 suspected cases of meningitis were admitted to the sentinel hospitals. Most patients were 0-11 months old (4863 [44.5%]) and there were 542 (5.0%) in-hospital deaths. Overall, 4168 CSF samples were screened for pathogens and a total of 194 (4.7%) PBM cases were confirmed, predominantly caused by pneumococcus (98 [50.5%]). Following pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction in 2011, annual suspected meningitis cases and deaths (case fatality rate) progressively declined from 2534 to 1359 and from 164 (6.5%) to 14 (1.0%) in 2012 and 2016, respectively (P < .001). Additionally, there was a gradual decline in the proportion of meningitis cases caused by pneumococcus, from 77.3% (17/22) in 2011 to 32.4% (11/34) in 2016 (odds ratio, 7.11 [95% confidence interval, 2.08-24.30]). Haemophilus influenzae meningitis fluctuated over the surveillance period and was the predominant pathogen (16/34 [47.1%]) by 2016.Conclusions. The observed decrease in pneumococcal meningitis after PCV introduction may be indicative of changing patterns of PBM etiology in Benin. Maintaining vigilant and effective surveillance is critical for understanding these changes and their wider public health implications.

TI  - Impact of 10-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine on Bacterial Meningitis in Madagascar
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced in Madagascar in 2012. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of PCV10 on bacterial meningitis in hospitalized children <5 years of age.Methods. During 2010-2017, data from the hospital admission logbook were recorded for bacterial meningitis and pneumonia hospitalizations in children <5 years of age. Between April 2011 and December 2017, 3312 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from children who fulfilled the World Health Organization case definition of suspected bacterial meningitis were analyzed at the sentinel site laboratory (SSL) by microscopy, culture, and antigen detection tests. A total of 2065 CSF samples were referred to the regional reference laboratory for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. 2010-2011 was defined as the prevaccine period, 2012 as vaccine introduction year, and 2013-2017 the postvaccine period. The number of cases, causative agent, and pneumonia hospitalizations were compared before and after PCV10 introduction.Results. In the prevaccine period, bacterial meningitis and pneumonia hospitalizations accounted for 4.5% and 24.5% of all hospitalizations while there were 2.6% and 19%, respectively, in the postvaccine period (P < .001). In samples tested at the SSL, 154 were positive with 80% Streptococcus pneumoniae and 20% other bacteria. Pneumococcal meningitis diagnosed by RT-PCR declined from 14% in 2012 to 3% in 2017. Also, 14% of children with pneumococcal meningitis died.Conclusions. Following PCV10 introduction, pneumococcal meningitis, bacterial meningitis, and pneumonia hospitalizations declined. Surveillance should continue to monitor the impact of PCV10.

T2  - Ecological Modelling
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton species are among the most abundant and diverse organisms in marine ecosystems and are highly sensitive to physical-chemical variable changes, so they show high spatial and temporal variability related to environmental changes. This study applied Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to describe the effect of environmental factors on abundance of four phytoplankton genera recorded in a small coastal water body of northwestern Mexico. The most influential variables in order of importance were sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a concentration, pH, salinity and dissolved oxygen. Predictions of the GAM suggested that abundance had strong spatial and seasonal variability; abundance of Tripos and Gymnodinium was higher in spring (Apr-Jun) and lower in summer (Jul-Sep); Prorocentrum was higher in autumn (Oct-Dec) and lower in winter (Jan-Mar); Pseudo-nitzschia was higher in winter and lower in autumn. The approach in this study represents one of the first efforts to use species distribution models (SDM) in phytoplankton communities using high spatial resolution environmental factors that derived from Landsat imagery. Therefore, this technique could be a useful tool with the potential to transform environmental monitoring and serve as a valuable resource in the study and application of management strategies in a wide range of activities in coastal environments, such as aquaculture, fisheries and public health.

TI  - Patterns of forest cover change and their association with forest management regimes of forest reserves in the high forest zone of Ghana
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAND USE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper sought to determine how different forest management regimes influence the pattern of forest degradation at different periods in Ghana. The paper tested the hypotheses that timber production forests degrade faster than protection forests and forest degradation slows down with time. For monitoring the changes in forest cover, Landsat TM, ETM+ and Landsat 8 with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used in the mapping of land use/land cover for the periods 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2014 using supervised classi?cation technique. The results showed that forest degradation occurred at different rates within the period and was more rapid from 1990 to 2000 than from 2000 to 2010. Protected forests and Globally Significant Biodiversity Areas (GSBAs) declined in forest quality at the same rate as timber production forests and did not benefit from any extra protective measures. New strategies should be found to manage protection forests and GSBAs to ensure their optimum protection.

TI  - Etiology of Bacterial Meningitis Among Children &lt;5 Years Old in Cote d'Ivoire: Findings of Hospital-based Surveillance Before and After Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Introduction
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Bacterial meningitis remains a major disease affecting children in Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, with support from the World Health Organization (WHO), Cote d'Ivoire has implemented pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM) surveillance at 2 sentinel hospitals in Abidjan, targeting the main causes of PBM: Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus). Herein we describe the epidemiological characteristics of PBM observed in Cote d'Ivoire during 2010-2016.Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from children aged <5 years admitted to the Abobo General Hospital or University Hospital Center Yopougon with suspected meningitis. Microbiology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques were used to detect the presence of pathogens in CSF. Where possible, serotyping/grouping was performed to determine the specific causative agents.Results. Overall, 2762 cases of suspected meningitis were reported, with CSF from 39.2% (1083/2762) of patients analyzed at the WHO regional reference laboratory in The Gambia. In total, 82 (3.0% [82/2762]) CSF samples were positive for bacterial meningitis. Pneumococcus was the main pathogen responsible for PBM, accounting for 69.5% (52/82) of positive cases. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes 5, 18C, 19F, and 6A/B were identified post-vaccine introduction. Emergence of H. influenzae nontypeable meningitis was observed after H. influenzae type b vaccine introduction.Conclusions. Despite widespread use and high coverage of conjugate vaccines, pneumococcal vaccine serotypes and H. influenzae type b remain associated with bacterial meningitis among children aged <5 years in Cote d'Ivoire. This reinforces the need for enhanced surveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases to determine the prevalence of bacterial meningitis and vaccine impact across the country.

TI  - Remote detection of cyanobacteria blooms in an optically shallow subtropical lagoonal estuary using MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread and persistent Ecosystem Disruptive Algal Blooms dominated by marine picocyanobacteria (Synechococcus) commonly occur in the subtropical lagoonal estuary of Florida Bay (U.S.A). These blooms have been linked to a decline in natural sheet flow over the past century from upstream Everglades National Park. Remote sensing algorithms for monitoring cyanobacteria blooms are highly desired but have been mainly developed for freshwater and coastal systems with minimal bottom reflectance contributions in the past. Examination of in situ optical properties revealed that Synechococcus blooms in Florida Bay exhibit unique spectral absorption and reflectance features that form the basis for algorithm development. Using a large, multi-year match-up dataset (2002-2012; n = 682) consisting of in situ pigment concentrations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc(lambda)), classification criteria for detecting cyanobacteria blooms with chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) similar to 5-40 mg m(-3) were determined based on a new approach to combine the MODIS Cyanobacteria Index, CIMODIS, and spectral shape around 488 nm, SS(488). The inclusion of SS(488) was required to prevent false positive classifications in seagrass-rich, non-bloom waters with high bottom reflectance contributions. 75% of cyanobacteria blooms were classified accurately based on this modified CI approach with < 1% false positives. A strong correlation observed between cyanobacteria bloom in situ Chl-a and CIMODIS r(2) = 0.80, n = 32) then allowed cyanobacterial chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl(cl)) to be estimated. Model simulations and image-based analyses showed that this technique was insensitive to variable aerosol properties and sensor viewing geometry. Application of the approach to the entire MODIS time-series (2000 present) may help identify factors controlling blooms and system responses to ongoing management efforts aimed at restoring flow to pre-drainage conditions. The method may also provide insights for algorithm development for other lagoonal estuaries that experience similar blooms.

TI  - Simulations of the inner magnetospheric energetic electrons using the IMPTAM-VERB coupled model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present initial results of the coupling between the Inner Magnetospheric Particle Transport and Acceleration Model (IMPTAM) and the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB-3D) code. IMPTAM traces electrons of 10-100 keV energies from the plasma sheet (L = 9 Re) to inner L-shell regions. The flux evolution modeled by IMPTAM is used at the low energy and outer L* computational boundaries of the VERB code (assuming a dipole approximation) to perform radiation belt simulations of energetic electrons. The model was tested on the March 17th, 2013 storm, for a six-day period. Four different simulations were performed and their results compared to satellites observations from Van Allen probes and GOES. The coupled IMPTAM-VERB model reproduces evolution and storm-time features of electron fluxes throughout the studied storm in agreement with the satellite data (within similar to 0.5 orders of magnitude). Including dynamics of the low energy population at L* = 6.6 increases fluxes closer to the heart of the belt and has a strong impact in the VERB simulations at all energies. However, inclusion of magnetopause losses leads to drastic flux decreases even below L* = 3. The dynamics of low energy electrons (max. 10s of keV) do not affect electron fluxes at energies >= 900 keV. Since the IMPTAM-VERB coupled model is only driven by solar wind parameters and the Dst and Kp indexes, it is suitable as a forecasting tool. In this study, we demonstrate that the estimation of electron dynamics with satellite-data-independent models is possible and very accurate.

TI  - Assessing consistency of spring phenology of snow-covered forests as estimated by vegetation indices, gross primary production, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate phenology characterization is of great importance for measuring ecosystem dynamics, especially for carbon and water exchange between land and the atmosphere. Vegetation indices (VIs), calculated from land surface reflectance, are widely used to estimate phenology from the leaf and canopy structure perspective. Gross Primary Production (GPP) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are used to estimate phenology from the canopy functional (physiological) perspective. To what degree are the spring phenology estimated from these different perspectives consistent with each other? In this study, we evaluated the consistency of the start of the growing season (SOS) in spring for snow-covered evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF) and deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF) using three vegetation indices, in-situ GPP data from the eddy covariance flux towers (GPP(EC)), GPP data from the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (GPP(VPM)), and SIF data from the GOME-2. Results showed that SOSNDVI dates were much earlier than SOS dates from EVI (SOSEVI), land surface water index (LSWI) (SOSLSWI), GPP (SOSGPP; SOSGPP-EC, SOSGPP_VPM) and SIF (SOSSIF) for both snow-covered evergreen needleleaf forest (ENF) and deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF). SOSLSWI dates were more linearly correlated with SOSGPP and SOSSIF than SOS dates from NDVI and EVI. At ENF sites, SOSLSWI dates were 17 (+/- 27) days later and SOSEVI were 25 (+/- 34) days later than SOSGPP_EC dates. At DBF sites, SOSLSWI and SOSEVI dates were 1-week (+/- 13 days) later than SOSGPP_EC dates. In the snow-covered regions at mid- to high-latitude in the Northern Hemisphere, SOSLSWI dates were 2(similar to)3 weeks (+/- 5 days) later than those of SOSGPP_VPM and SOSSIF for both ENF and DBF. Our results clearly highlight the need for further investigation of NDVI-based SOS dates, which were likely affected by snowmelt in snow-covered forests, and the potential of LSWI for tracking the effects of snow on SOS dates. Estimations of SOS dates in snow-covered forests should consider the effects of both snow cover and temperature on leaf emergence (green-up) and gross primary production.

TI  - Deep learning based retrieval algorithm for Arctic sea ice concentration from AMSR2 passive microwave and MODIS optical data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applies deep learning (DL) to retrieve Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) from AMSR2 data. MODIS-derived SICs are calculated based on spectral unmixing with a new ice/water endmember extraction algorithm that exploits global/local representatives, and then used to train a DL network with AMSR2 data. The resulting SIC maps outperform popular SIC products both regionally and globally. The RMSE of the proposed DL model is 5.19, whereas those of the widely used Bootstrap and ASI-based SIC images are 6.54 and 7.38, respectively, with respect to MODIS-derived SICs at global scale. In particular, our proposed method better describes regions of low-SIC and melting ice in summer, which are generally difficult-to-estimate. As the DL-based model consistently generates accurate SIC values that are not time-or region-dependent, it is considered to be an operational system. Additionally, our SICs can be used to generate initial conditions facilitating development of more accurate climate models.

TI  - Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma in a boar who lived in Calabria (Italy): Wild animal as sentinel system of human health
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesothelioma is a tumor of the serosal membranes described both in human and veterinary medicine. While in humans the relationship between mesothelioma and exposure to asbestos and some other asbestiform minerals is well known, in animals it is still difficult to establish. In this paper a case of malignant peritoneal mesothelioma probably related to asbestos exposure in a wild boar is described. At post-mortem evaluation the peritoneum, diaphragm and serosal surface of liver and kidneys showed isolated to coalescent multiple nodular lesions. Samples from diaphragm, liver and lung were collected to perform microbiological and histological investigations. To assess the presence of asbestos and/or other asbestiform minerals, SEM-EDS investigations were performed on organs and soil samples collected from the area where the wild boar lived.Microbiological investigations were negative for Mycobacterium species. Gross and histological examination were compatible with a biphasic mesothelioma, with nodules composed of epithelioid and sarcomatoid elements with high pleomorphism. Immunohistochemistry revealed only multifocal scattered positivity for WT-1 and D2-40. Asbestos fibres were detected in all samples (organs and soil) by SEM-EDS, demonstrating a potential relationship between the neoplasia and the exposure to naturally occurring asbestos (NOA).In conclusion, the results of the present study are further confirmation that wild animals, such as the boar, are suitable sentinels to indicate the risk of environmental exposure to asbestos for human populations.

TI  - Community-acquired Invasive Bacterial Disease in Urban Gambia, 2005-2015: A Hospital-based Surveillance
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Invasive bacterial diseases cause significant disease and death in sub-Saharan Africa. Several are vaccine preventable, although the impact of new vaccines and vaccine policies on disease patterns in these communities is poorly understood owing to limited surveillance data.Methods. We conducted a hospital-based surveillance of invasive bacterial diseases in The Gambia where blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of hospitalized participants were processed. Three surveillance periods were defined in relation to the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), before (2005-2009), during (2010-2011) and after (2012-2015) PCV introduction. We determined the prevalences of commonly isolated bacteria and compared them between the different surveillance periods.Results. A total of 14 715 blood and 1103 CSF samples were collected over 11 years; overall, 1045 clinically significant organisms were isolated from 957 patients (972 organisms [6.6%] from blood and 73 [6.6%] from CSF). The most common blood culture isolates were Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (22.0%), Escherichia coli (10.9%), and nontyphoidal Salmonella (10.0%). Between the pre-PCV and post-PCV eras, the prevalence of S. pneumoniae bacteremia dropped across all age groups (from 32.4% to 16.5%; odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, .29-.58) while S. aureus increased in prevalence, becoming the most prevalent bacteria (from 16.9% to 27.2%; 1.75; 1.26-2.44). Overall, S. pneumoniae (53.4%), Neisseria meningitidis (13.7%), and Haemophilus influenzae (12.3%) were the predominant isolates from CSF. Antimicrobial resistance to common antibiotics was low.Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that surveillance data on the predominant pathogens associated with invasive disease is necessary to inform vaccine priorities and appropriate management of patients.

TI  - Space-time analysis of vegetation trends and drought occurrence in domain area of tropical forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate temporal trends in changes in vegetation patterns within the Sooretama Biological Reserve and its surroundings, located in Espirito Santo State, Brazil. The evaluation will be performed using the EVI and NDVI index of the MODIS sensor, the Mann-Kendall monotonic trend, Seasonal Trend Analysis methods, and monitoring drought events through the VCI drought index for the years 2007 through 2015. The tools utilized were the EVI and NDVI indexes of the MOD13Q1 product and LST from the MOD11A2 product. These indices were used in order to represent the dynamics of the study area biomass and then to analyze the drought occurrence using the index best-suited to the area of study, identified as VCI. The temporal trends in the data set were examined, pixel by pixel, by application of the Mann-Kendall monotonic technique, treating each pixel in space as a one-dimensional temporal series of 16-day cycles. To evaluate the seasonal trend, the analysis used the STA technique (Seasonal Trend Analysis) implemented in the ETM module. The characterization and spatial distribution of drought events were performed through the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI). The use of (a) images and seasonal curves produced by the monotonic trend of Mann-Kendall and (b) analysis of seasonal trends generated the response of the vegetation to climate variations. The VCI indicated a potential for drought occurrence analysis in regions and areas with different vegetation densities. So, the VCI can be used as a powerful tool to compose a comprehensive and early system alert of drought that can accompany the changes in spatial coverage of vegetation and severity of change. Lastly, the analysis of the data from the MODIS NDVI, EVI, and TST images indicated that the data is suitable to a space-time analysis of drought occurrences and vegetation trends.

TI  - Evaluating the seasonal and decadal performance of red band difference algorithms for chlorophyll in an optically complex estuary with winter and summer blooms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Standard ocean color chlorophyll algorithms, including normalized fluorescence line height algorithms, over-estimate summer blooms and often miss large winter blooms in mid-latitude estuaries such as Long Island Sound (LIS). Thus, they are unable to accurately determine year-round chlorophyll concentrations. Here, we show that winter phytoplankton blooms cannot be retrieved using MODIS' 667 and 678 nm bands. Although MERIS' equivalent 665 and 681 nm bands are able to better characterize chlorophyll a concentrations at LIS compared to MODIS, we show that it is a red band difference (RBD) algorithm relying on observing the maximum spectral difference between R-rs681nm-R-rs665nm and R-rs709nm-R-rs665nm from the MERIS sensor that is able to successfully capture the seasonal chlorophyll dynamics measured in situ. Such switching algorithms are useful in areas where the shape of the reflectance spectrum changes throughout the seasons associated with changes in the phytoplankton community structure, and provide seamless implementation compared to algorithms based on seasonal tunings. We apply the switching RBD algorithm to the 10 years of available MERIS data, and results reveal important spatial and temporal patterns that cannot be assessed from in situ data alone. These include the observation that the decreasing trend in surface chlorophyll concentrations between 2002 and 2012 is localized, and may be related to changes in the flow of Atlantic waters into the estuary rather than a result of active management against eutrophication. Following from past studies, we demonstrate how high sensitivity red bands are valuable to successfully determine proxies for phytoplankton biomass in coastal areas where optical properties are dominated by dissolved organic matter, and where the fluorescence peak may not accurately capture the dynamics of productive waters. Such switching RBD algorithms applied to data from the Sentinel or PACE missions may allow distribution of near-real time chlorophyll a products for coastal waters across winter and summer seasons.

Abu (24.5 degrees N, 72.7 degrees E) is studied using the temperature measurements from ground based Rayleigh Lidar and space borne satellite observations. The slope values are lesser over Gadanki than at Mt. Abu for almost all the altitudes except for 40-50 km where it is nearly same and 60-70 km exhibiting opposite nature. Unusual spectral slope of -6.97 (Mt. Abu) and -0.09 (Gadanki) is seen at the altitude of 40-50 km in satellite temperature. Characteristics of wave oscillations perceived over both the stations are described.

TI  - Assessing the radiative impacts of an extreme desert dust outbreak and the potential improvements on short-term weather forecasts: The case of February 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 1st and 2nd February 2015, the central and eastern Mediterranean, as well as parts of the Black Sea, were affected by an extreme desert dust outbreak. This exceptional dust event took place under the prevalence of a strong southwesterly airflow over the region, with maximum wind speeds up to 70 (36 ms(-1)) and 35 knots (18 ms(-1)) at 700 hPa and at mean sea-level pressure, respectively. Based on MODIS-Terra/Aqua aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals, the intensity of the transported dust loads maximized over the central Mediterranean (4.2) while very high AODs (up to 2.5) were recorded over Greece and the Black Sea. In addition, according to in-situ measurements obtained at Finokalia (Crete, southern Greece), the maximum PM10 concentrations reached up to 758 mu gr m(-3) (maximum levels for 2015). Through the implementation of the WRF-Chem model, the clear-sky direct radiative effects (DREs) have been computed for the SW, LW and NET (SW + LW) radiation, at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), within the atmosphere (ATM) as well as for the downwelling (SURF) and the absorbed (NETSURF) radiation at the ground. According to our simulations, during daytime, the instantaneous NET DREs reach down to -278.1 Wm(-2) (Solar Zenith Angle (SZA) = 53 degrees) and - 252.2 Wm(-2) for SURF and NETSURF, respectively, indicating a strong surface cooling, while the corresponding values for ATM can be as large as 147.3 Wm(-2) (SZA = 50 degrees) revealing a strong atmospheric warming. At TOA, the computed DREs vary from -120.1 Wm(-2) (planetary cooling; SZA = 51 degrees) to 59.4 Wm(-2) (planetary warming; SZA = 64 degrees) being negative and positive over dark and bright surfaces, respectively. During nighttime, reverse effects of lower magnitude are found at all levels of the Earth-Atmosphere system. At a regional scale, throughout the forecast period, the clear-sky NET DREs range from - 16.60 Wm(-2) to -0.76 Wm(-2), from -46.18 Wm(-2) to 16.11 Wm(-2), from -32.31 Wm(-2) to 13.70 Wm(-2) and from -14.63 Wm(-2) to 20.40 Wm(-2) for TOA, SURF, NETSURF and ATM, respectively. As a response to the perturbation of the surface radiation budget, the 2 m air temperature decreases/increases by up to 1.5 degrees C (5.3 degrees C) during daytime/nighttime. Moreover, at noon, the low-level dust layer (up to 3 km above sea level), cools (heats) the lowest troposphere by up to 0.5 degrees C (1.4 degrees C) over land (sea). At night, the temperature of the atmospheric layers where the dust aerosols are confined decreases (by up to -1.8 degrees C), whereas a warming effect (by up to 2.8 degrees C) is evident in the air masses beneath the dust layer. Through the inclusion of dust-radiation interactions in the numerical simulations, the model's predictive skill in terms of reproducing the downwelling SW radiation at the ground is improved. This is justified via the comparison of the RADON (dust-radiation interactions are activated) and RADOFF (dust-radiation interactions are deactivated) outputs against cloud-free observations derived by 31 NOAAN stations. More specifically, from RADOFF to RADON, the bias reduces from 157.63 to 26.02 Wm(-2) and the slope decreases from 1.25 to 0.98.On the contrary, the evaluation analysis of the temperature at 2 m does not reveal a remarkably better performance of the RADON run, particularly during sunlight hours, reflecting thus the predominance of first order model errors over the expected improvements attributed to dust-radiation interactions.

TI  - Determining variable weights for an Optimal Scaled Drought Condition Index (OSDCI): Evaluation in Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Scaled Drought Condition Index (SDCI) is an agricultural drought index derived from multiple remote sensing datasets including precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and temperature and vegetation index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The SDCI can be used for large-scale drought monitoring at a high spatial resolution in dry and humid regions. However, it is not applicable to certain areas for numerous reasons, including the discontinued service and limited coverage of the TRMM, uncertainties associated with the coarse resolution of precipitation input, the fixed lag time between precipitation deficit and vegetation responses, experimental weights and an arbitrary classification scheme. Therefore, this study aims to propose an optimal SDCI (OSDCI) using an alternative Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) as precipitation input, adding a varied lag time between precipitation and vegetation response, determining the optimal weights of variables and revising the severity classification. In Central Asia, OSDCI is calibrated using the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) during the 2001-2008 growing seasons as drought reference. The SPEI from 2009 to 2016, soil moisture anomalies (SMAs) derived from both the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and the annual crop production of wheat and barley are used for cross-validation. For comparison, three original SDCIs are also included. The results show that the OSDCI displays better performance than the three experimental SDCIs with higher correlation coefficients relative to SPEI and SMA from the CPC for different cover types, and performance is comparable to that of SMA from the GLDAS and annual crop production. Additionally, the OSDCI based on the revised classification scheme (OSDCI_rev) shows significant superiority over the OSDCI based on the original classification system (OSDCI org) with lower drought frequency and area error. Furthermore, the OSDCI_rev can capture both the temporal evolution and the spatial patterns of droughts exemplified by the SPEI and SMAs. Overall, the results of this study show the potential use of the OSDCI with a revised classification scheme as a remote sensing drought index for agricultural drought monitoring.

TI  - Integrating multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling to map the spread of emerging forest disease and tree mortality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems have been increasingly affected by a variety of disturbances, including emerging infectious diseases (ElDs), causing extensive tree mortality in the Western United States. Especially over the past decade, EID outbreaks occurred more frequently and severely in forest landscapes, which have killed large numbers of trees. While tree mortality is observable from remote sensing, its symptom may be associated with both disease and non-disease disturbances (e.g., wildfire and drought). Species distribution modeling is widely used to understand species spatial preferences for certain habitat conditions, which may constrain uncertain remote sensing approaches due to limited spatial and spectral resolution. In this study, we integrated multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling to map disease-caused tree mortality in a forested area of 80,000 ha from 2005 to 2016. We selected sudden oak death (caused by pathogen P. ramorum) as a case study of a rapidly spreading emerging infectious disease, which has killed millions of oak (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densifiorus) in California over the past decades. To balance the needs for fine-scale monitoring of disease distribution patterns and satisfactory coverage at broad scales, our method applied spectral unmixing to extract sub-pixel disease presence using yearly Landsat time series. The results were improved by employing the probability of disease infection generated from a species distribution model. We calibrated and validated the method with image samples from high-spatial resolution NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program), and hyperspectral AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) sensors, Google Earth (R) imagery, and field observations. The findings reveal an annual sudden oak death infection rate of 7% from 2005 to 2016, with overall mapping accuracies ranging from 76% to 83%. The integration of multi-sensor remote sensing and species distribution modeling considerably reduced the overestimation of disease effects as compared to the use of remote sensing alone, leading to an average of 26% decrease in detecting disease-affected trees. Such integration strategy proved the effectiveness of mapping long-term, disease-caused tree mortality in forest landscapes that have experienced multiple disturbances.

TI  - Remote sensing of forest die-off in the Anthropocene: From plant ecophysiology to canopy structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have fundamentally changed Earth's climate and land surface in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to the proposal of a new geologic epoch known as the Anthropocene. One major ecological perturbation underway over the past several decades of the Anthropocene is extensive tree and shrub mortality, or forest die-off, triggered by elevated temperatures and prolonged drought, and/or insect and pathogen outbreaks. This increasingly common disturbance has affected forests and woodlands on all vegetated continents and may alter terrestrial carbon fluxes in the biosphere. Remote sensing has enabled mapping of the extent and ecological patterns of tree loss and damage, assessing potential carbon emissions and monitoring ecosystem trajectories after tree mortality. In this review article, we cover drought-induced changes in plant physiology, chemistry, and structure that occur as an individual tree progresses from healthy to stressed to standing dead or coarse woody debris, and corresponding responses in remotely sensed data that provide the opportunity and potential for observation and analysis at large spatial scales and early detection. The linkages between changes associated with tree mortality and remote sensing show exceptional promise for strategic and adaptive natural resource management as climate models project warmer and drier climates in the coming decades.

TI  - Assessing the spatial, spectral, and temporal consistency of topographically corrected Landsat time series composites across the mountainous forests of Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In mountainous regions slope and aspect result in variations in the illumination condition and the same land cover type can therefore show differences in the reflectance depending on the orientation of the terrain slope towards the sun and the sensor of the satellite. Different topographic illumination correction methods exist and their performance varies depending on e.g. sun zenith and land cover type. Similarly a variety of evaluation criteria exist to assess the performance of the topographic correction methods and each evaluation criteria usually only considers certain aspects of the ability of the topographic correction method in reducing signal-to-noise. In this article we present a novel framework for the evaluation of topographically corrected image composites using cloud computing. We evaluated six topographic correction methods (Bin Tan, C-Correction, Minnaert with slope, Sun-Canopy-Sensor plus C-Correction, Statistical-Empirical, and Variable Empirical Coefficient Algorithm) in forest areas of four Landsat footprints in Nepal for a time series of image composites from 1988 to 2016. Our evaluation shows that the Statistical-Empirical topographic correction method provides the best overall performance, but in some years and footprints also other methods can show the best performance. We discuss these differences and related reasons in detail and give recommendations on the best use and evaluation of topographic correction methods.

TI  - Global mapping of soil salinity change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity increase is a serious and global threat to agricultural production. The only database that currently provides soil salinity data with global coverage is the Harmonized World Soil Database, but it has several limitations when it comes to soil salinity assessment. Therefore, a new assessment is required. We hypothesized that combining soil properties maps with thermal infrared imagery and a large set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a global soil salinity map. The thermal infrared imagery acts as a dynamic variable and allows us to characterize the soil salinity change. For this purpose we used Google Earth Engine computational environment. The random forest classifier was trained using 7 soil properties maps, thermal infrared imagery and the ECe point data from the WoSIS database. In total, six maps were produced for 1986, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2016. The validation accuracy of the resulting maps was in the range of 67-70%. The total area of salt affected lands by our assessment is around 1 billion hectares, with a clear increasing trend. Comparison with 3 studies investigating local trends of soil salinity change showed that our assessment was in correspondence with 2 of these studies. The global map of soil salinity change between 1986 and 2016 was produced to characterize the spatial distribution of the change. We conclude that combining soil properties maps and thermal infrared imagery allows mapping of soil salinity development in space and time on a global scale.

TI  - Extending the SMAP 9-km soil moisture product using a spatio-temporal fusion model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - SMAP satellite has provided us the first 9-km global soil moisture (SM) product, which is retrieved from the combined L-band radiometer and radar observations with a balance between accuracy and resolution. However, SMAP's radar failed on July 7, 2015, making the continuous production of the 9-km SM impossible, which has considerably affected the application of SMAP in hydrological monitoring. This study was aimed at extending the SMAP 9-km SM by developing a non-local filter based spatio-temporal fusion model (STFM). With the auxiliary of the historical 9-kmand 36-km products, the STFM was used to downscale the daily 36-km product to 9-km. Two-year 9-km product was estimated using STFM in the study. It shows that the estimated product has the detailed information retention of 9-km product and the comparable accuracy with 36-km product, which makes it feasible to improve the application potential of the current SMAP SM products.

TI  - Delineating northern peatlands using Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices from local and regional digital elevation models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent of northern peatlands remains highly uncertain in spite of rapidly developing satellite observation datasets. This is limiting progress in the understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes, such as the global carbon (C) cycle and climate feedback effects on C fluxes.In this study, we evaluated the capabilities of two new satellite datasets that enable regional scale mapping of peatland extent at high spatial resolution, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Arctic digital elevation model (ArcticDEM). Terrain indices and temporal features derived from these datasets provided input to Random Forest models for delineating four main land cover classes (forest, open upland, water and peatland) in an area in northern Sweden consisting of both lowland and mountainous terrain. The contribution of ArcticDEM to the classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the results with those derived when a high quality LiDAR based DEM (LiDEM) was used as alternative model input.This study shows that multi-seasonal SAR alone can produce reasonable classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA; 81.6%), but also that it has limitations. The inclusion of terrain indices improved classification performance substantially. OA increased to 87.5% and 90.9% when terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM and LiDEM were included, respectively. The largest increase in accuracy was achieved for the peatland class, which suggests that terrain indices do have the ability to capture the features in the geographic context that aid the discrimination of peatland from other land cover classes.The relatively small difference in classification accuracy between LiDEM and ArcticDEM is encouraging since the latter provides circumpolar coverage. Thus, the combination of Sentinel-1 time series and terrain indices derived from ArcticDEM presents opportunities for substantially improving regional estimates of peatland extent at high latitudes.

TI  - Retrieving shallow stream bathymetry from UAV-assisted RGB imagery using a geospatial regression method
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetric mapping is a prerequisite procedure to conduct assessments of water quality, habitat and environmental flow for riverine ecosystems using hydraulic modelling. This study evaluates the capability of a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, which can capture a spatially heterogeneous relationship between inputs and an output, to retrieve bathymetry of a shallow stream, of which water depth is less than about 1 m from simple RGB imagery. A field experiment was performed for measuring water depth and simultaneously for acquiring remotely-sensed data with RGB digital numbers (DN) using a digital camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). A 2D shallow water model, which was validated by comparison with the field-surveyed data, was used to simulate the water depth of unmeasured regions. Band ratios of ln(DNG/DNR) was selected as an optimal spectral input of bathymetric inversion models through the principal component analysis (PCA). Results showed that global inversion models based on multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) resulted in large discrepancy between estimation and observation due to the spatially varying response of the PCA-selected band ratio to water depth over the experimental channel. In contrast, the GWR model successfully alleviated the biases of the conventional models as R-2 increased to 0.85 from 0.60 by accurately modelling the effect of spatial heterogeneity, which arose from variable bottom types attributed to submerged vegetation, on the remote-sensing radiance-water depth relationship.

TI  - A model of gross primary productivity based on satellite data suggests formerly afforested peatlands undergoing restoration regain full photosynthesis capacity after five to ten years
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are an important terrestrial carbon store, but disturbance has resulted in the degradation of many peatland ecosystems and caused them to act as a net carbon source. Restoration work is being undertaken but monitoring the success of these schemes can be difficult and costly using traditional field-based methods. A landscape-scale alternative is to use satellite data to assess the condition of peatlands and to estimate gaseous carbon fluxes. In this study we used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products to model Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) over peatland sites at various stages of restoration. We found that the MOD17A2H GPP product overestimates GPP modelled from data collected by eddy covariance towers situated at two ex-forestry sites undergoing restoration towards blanket bog at the Forsinard Flows RSPB reserve, Scotland, UK (one full year of data), and a near-natural Atlantic blanket bog site in Glencar, Ireland (ten-year data series). We calibrated a Temperature and Greenness (TG) model for the Forsinard sites and found it to be more accurate than the MODIS GPP product at local scale. We also found that inclusion of a wetness factor using the Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) improved inter-annual accuracy of the model. This TGWa (annual Temperature, Greenness and Wetness) model was then applied to six control sites comprising near-natural bog across the reserve, and to six sites on which restoration began between 1998 and 2006. GPP from 2005 to 2016 was estimated for each site using the model. The resulting modelled trends are positive at all six restored sites, increasing by approximately 5.5 g C/m(2)/yr every year since restoration began in the Forsinard Flows reserve. The results suggest that peatland sites undergoing restoration at Forsinard Flows reach the carbon assimilation potential of near-natural bog sites between 5 and 10 years after restoration was begun.

TI  - Mapping Moso bamboo forest and its on-year and off-year distribution in a subtropical region using time-series Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Moso bamboo is the most widely distributed bamboo forest type in tropical and subtropical areas. Increasing trends in both expansion and logging of Moso bamboo have occurred over the past four decades due to its rapid growth rate and short harvest rotation period. The spatial and temporal distribution of bamboo forest is the basis for the study of the carbon cycle in bamboo forest ecosystems. Previous studies have consistently focused on different influences of scale, data and algorithms for bamboo forest mapping; however, there is still considerable uncertainty in bamboo forest mapping due to the unique on-year and off-year phenomena and their significant differences in spectral characteristics. Northwestern Zhejiang Province has the most widely distributed bamboo forest and was selected as the study area. Based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 time-series data, changes in the spectral characteristics during the growth cycle of bamboo forest were analyzed and the optimum time window for the classification of the bamboo forest was determined. The seasonal index of the bamboo forest based on spectral differences was the proposed approach, and on-year and off-year bamboo forest mapping was conducted seasonally using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data. The results show that (1) the best period to distinguish bamboo forest from other forest types is April May, followed by December February, and the best month for distinguishing between on-year and off-year bamboo forests is May; (2) the spectral differences between bamboo forest and other forest types are mainly reflected in the red-edge 3 near-infrared (NIR) and NIR narrow bands (740-865 nm); (3) Sentinel-2 data have obvious advantages over Landsat 8 data in distinguishing the bamboo forest because of better spectral, temporal and spatial resolutions; and (4) the multi-temporal bamboo forest index has a better overall classification accuracy (OA = 91.2) for distinguishing on-year and off-year bamboo forests than the mono-temporal index and can be applied to other regions.

TI  - Using aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies for mapping peatland belowground carbon stocks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands are key reservoirs of belowground carbon (C) and their monitoring is important to assess the rapid changes in the C cycle caused by climate change and direct anthropogenic impacts. Frequently, information of peatland area and vegetation type estimated by remote sensing has been used along with soil measurements and allometric functions to estimate belowground C stocks. Despite the accuracy of such approaches, there is still the need to find mappable proxies that enhance predictions with remote sensing data while reducing field and laboratory efforts. Therefore, we assessed the use of aboveground vegetation attributes as proxies to predict peatland belowground C stocks. First, the ecological relations between remotely detectable vegetation attributes (i.e. vegetation height, aboveground biomass, species richness and floristic composition of vascular plants) and belowground C stocks were obtained using structural equation modeling (SEM). SEM was formulated using expert knowledge and trained and validated using in-situ information. Second, the SEM latent vectors were spatially mapped using random forests regressions with UAV-based hyperspectral and structural information. Finally, this enabled us to map belowground C stocks using the SEM functions parameterized with the random forests derived maps.This SEM approach resulted in higher accuracies than a direct application of a purely data-driven random forests approach with UAV data, with improvements of r(2) from 0.39 to 0.54, normalized RMSE from 31.33% to 20.24% and bias from -0.73 to 0.05. Our case study showed that: (1) vegetation height, species richness and aboveground biomass are good proxies to map peatland belowground C stocks, as they can be estimated using remote sensing data and hold strong relationships with the belowground C gradient; and (2) SEM is facilitates to incorporate theoretical knowledge in empirical modeling approaches.

TI  - Landslide mapping from multi-sensor data through improved change detection-based Markov random field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate landslide inventory mapping is essential for quantitative hazard and risk assessment. Although multi temporal change detection techniques have contributed greatly to landslide inventory preparation, it is still challenging to generate quality change detection images (CDIs) for accurate landslide mapping. The recently proposed change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) provides an effective approach for rapid mapping of landslides with minimum user interventions. However, when CDI is generated by change vector analysis (CVA) alone, the CDMRF method may suffer from noise especially when the pre- and post-event remote sensing images are acquired under different atmospheric, illumination, and phenological conditions. This paper improved such CDMRF approach by integrating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA) generated CDIs with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. To justify the effectiveness and applicability, the improved methods were applied to map rainfall-, typhoon-, and earthquake-triggered landslides from the pre- and post-event satellite images acquired by very high resolution QuickBird, high resolution FORMOSAT-2, and moderate resolution Sentinel-2. Moreover, they were tested on pre-event Landsat-8 and post-event Sentinel-2 datasets, indicating that they are operational for landslide inventory mapping from combined multi-temporal and multi sensor data. The results demonstrate that the improved delta NDVI-, PCA-, and ICA-based approaches perform much better than CVA-based CDMRF in terms of completeness, correctness, Kappa coefficient, and F-measures. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that NDVI, PCA, and ICA are integrated with MRF for landslide inventory mapping from multi-sensor data. It is anticipated that this research can be a starting point for developing new change detection techniques that can readily generate quality CDI and for applying advanced machine learning algorithms (e.g., deep learning) to automatic detection of natural hazards from multi-sensor time series data.

TI  - Detecting intercepted snow on mountain needleleaf forest canopies using satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow interception in cold regions needleleaf forest canopies is a crucial process that controls local snow accumulation and redistribution over > 20% of the Earth's land surface. Various ground-based methods exist to measure intercepted snow load, however all are based on single-tree measurements and are difficult to implement. No research has focussed on detecting large areal intercepted snow loads and no studies have assessed the use of satellite observations. In this study, four remote sensing indices (NDSI, NDVI, albedo, and land surface temperature (LST)) were retrieved from Landsat images to study their sensitivity to canopy intercepted snow and the possibility of using them to detect the presence of intercepted snow. The results indicate that presence of intercepted snow on canopy increased NDSI and albedo, but decreased NDVI. Intercepted snow presence also decreased the areal variability of NDSI and NDVI while increasing that of albedo. For these three indices, the differences between snow-free and snowcovered canopies were correlated to topography and forest canopy cover. Of these indices, NDSI changed the greatest. Intercepted snow noticeably decreased the LST difference between forest and open areas in springtime while the influence in wintertime was relatively smaller. An intercepted snow detection approach that uses both NDSI and NDVI to classify pixels into either snowcovered canopy or other (snow-free canopy and non-forest areas) is proposed here. A case study applying this approach compared remote sensing detection to simulations by the snow interception and sublimation model implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform (CRHM). This used local meteorological observations from the pine, spruce and fir forest covered Marmot Creek Research Basin in the Canadian Rockies. The remote sensing detection of intercepted snow agreed well with CRHM simulations for continuous forests (83%) and less well for sparse forests (72%) and clearings with small trees (70%). Therefore, the approach is suitable for intercepted snow detection over continuous evergreen canopies. This technique provides a new capability for large-scale snow interception model validation and data assimilation to cold regions hydrological forecasting models.

TI  - ARBOR: A new framework for assessing the accuracy of individual tree crown delineation from remotely-sensed data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the accuracy of individual tree crown (ITC) delineation techniques the same tree needs to be identified in two different datasets, for example, ground reference (GR) data and crowns delineated from LiDAR. Many studies use arbitrary metrics or simple linear-distance thresholds to match trees in different datasets without quantifying the level of agreement. For example, successful match-pairing is often claimed where two data points, representing the same tree in different datasets, are located within 5 m of one another. Such simple measures are inadequate for representing the multi-variate nature of ITC delineations and generate misleading measures of delineation accuracy. In this study, we develop a new framework for objectively quantifying the agreement between GR and remotely-sensed tree datasets: the Accuracy of Remotely-sensed Biophysical Observation and Retrieval (ARBOR) framework. Using common biophysical properties of ITC delineated trees (location, height and crown area), trees represented in different data sets were modelled as overlapping Gaussian curves to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the level of agreement. Extensive testing quantified the limitations of some frequently used match-pairing methods, in particular, the Hausdorff distance algorithm. We demonstrate that within the ARBOR framework, the Hungarian combinatorial optimisation algorithm improves the match between datasets, while the Jaccard similarity coefficient is effective for measuring the correspondence between the matched data populations. The ARBOR framework was applied to GR and remotely-sensed tree data from a woodland study site to demonstrate how ARBOR can identify the optimum ITC delineation technique, out of four different methods tested, based on two measures of statistical accuracy. Using ARBOR will limit further reliance on arbitrary thresholds as it provides an objective approach for quantifying accuracy in the development and application of ITC delineation algorithms.

AB  - Background. Bacterial meningitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. We analyzed data from the World Health Organization's (WHO) Invasive Bacterial Vaccine-preventable Diseases Surveillance Network (2011-2016) to describe the epidemiology of laboratory-confirmed Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae meningitis within the WHO African Region. We also evaluated declines in vaccine-type pneumococcal meningitis following pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) introduction.Methods. Reports of meningitis in children <5 years old from sentinel surveillance hospitals in 26 countries were classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed. Confirmed meningitis cases were analyzed by age group and subregion (South-East and West-Central). We described case fatality ratios (CFRs), pathogen distribution, and annual changes in serotype and serogroup, including changes in vaccine-type Spn meningitis following PCV introduction.Results. Among 49 844 reported meningitis cases, 1670 (3.3%) were laboratory-confirmed. Spn (1007/1670 [60.3%]) was the most commonly detected pathogen; vaccine-type Spn meningitis cases declined over time. CFR was the highest for Spn meningitis: 12.9% (46/357) in the South-East subregion and 30.9% (89/288) in the West-Central subregion. Meningitis caused by N. meningitidis was more common in West-Central than South- East Africa (321/954 [33.6%] vs 110/716 [15.4%]; P < .0001). Haemophilus influenzae (232/1670 [13.9%]) was the least prevalent organism.Conclusions. Spn was the most common cause of pediatric bacterial meningitis in the African region even after reported cases declined following PCV introduction. Sustaining robust surveillance is essential to monitor changes in pathogen distribution and to inform and guide vaccination policies.

TI  - A harmonized image processing workflow using Sentinel-2/MSI and Landsat-8/OLI for mapping water clarity in optically variable lake systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the applicability of harmonizing Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite imagery products to enable the monitoring of inland lake water clarity in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment. Processing steps include (1) atmospheric correction and masking of MSI and OLI imagery, and (2) generating scene-based water clarity maps in terms of Secchi depth (SD). We adopted ocean-color based atmospheric correction theory for MSI and OLI sensors modified with associated scene-specific metadata and auxiliary datasets available in GEE to generate uniform remote sensing reflectances (R-rs) products over optically variable freshwater lake surfaces. MSI-R-rs products derived from the atmospheric correction were used as input predictors in a bootstrap forest to determine significant band combinations to predict water clarity. A SD model for MSI (SDMSI) was then developed using a calibration dataset consisting of log-transformed SDin situ measurements (InSDin situ) from 79 optically variable freshwater inland lakes collected within +/- 1 day of satellite overpass on 23-Aug 2017 (MAE = 0.53 m) and validated with 276 samples collected within +/- 1 day of a 12-Sep 2017 image (MAE = 0.66 m) across three ecoregions in Minnesota, USA. A separate SD model for MSI was also developed using similar spectral bands present on the OLI sensor (SDsOLI) where cross sensor performance can be evaluated during coincident overpass events. SDsOLI applied to both MSI and OLI (SDOLI) models were further validated using two coincident overpass sets of imagery on 27-Sep 2017 (n = 18) and 13-Aug 2018 (n = 43), yielding a range of error from 0.25 to 0.67 m. Potential sources of model errors and limitations are discussed. Data derived from this multi-sensor methodology is anticipated to be used by researchers, lake resource managers, and citizens to expedite the pre-processing steps so that actionable information can be retrieved for decision making.

TI  - Monitoring, forecasting collapse events, and mapping pyroclastic deposits at Sinabung volcano with satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the ongoing (2013-present) eruption of Sinabung volcano, north Sumatra, we have routinely used a variety of satellite remote sensing data to observe and forecast lava dome and lava flow collapse events, to map the resulting pyroclastic deposits, and to estimate effusion rates. In this paper, we focus on the first two years of the current eruption (September 2013-December 2015), and we summarize major events in 2016. We divide the eruption into 5 major phases: 1) phreatomagmatic (July 2013-18 December 2013), 2) first dome growth and collapse (18 December 2013-10 January 2014), 3) lava-flow (10 January 2014-midSeptember 2014), 4) second lava dome and collapse (mid-September 2014-July 2015), 5) lava dome collapse and ash explosion phase (August 2015-present). Throughout the eruption, remotely sensed information has been instrumental in assessing the stability of the lava dome and flow and to forecast collapse events that produce pyroclastic density currents (PDCs: block-and-ash flows, co-ignimbrite surges, and blasts). Forecasts based on remote sensing data in combination with seismic, geodetic and gas-monitoring data have also helped inform decisions related to alert levels and evacuations. Relatively unusual aspects of the Sinabung eruption include the transition from dome to flow morphology (phase 2 to phase 3 transition) and the frequent occurrence during phase 3 of collapses from the lava flow-front and flow-margins-collapses that produced extensive pyroclastic density currents. By analogy to the well-known "Merapi type" collapses and pyroclastic deposits, we propose that lava flow-front and flow-margin collapses with associated PDCs be known as "Sinabung type." Although detailed study of deposits has not been possible due to continuing hazards, our observations suggest that the transition from lava dome to lava flow and the occurrence of flow-front and flow-margin collapses reflect a particular combination of lava viscosity and steepness of slope. Our observations also show clear evidence of at least one slope-parallel high-velocity and dilute PDC (a "blast") that emanated from a lava-margin collapse site 500 m downslope from the vent. This 1 February 2014 blast downed and singed a forest out to at least 3.9 km from the collapse site and killed 16 people. We also use a combination of field and remotely sensed data to map the distribution of Sinabung deposits. We estimate eruptive volumes and extrusion rates by combining sequential measurements of lava surface and pyroclastic flow areas with thickness estimates derived from simple geometric assumptions, oblique photographs and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from remotely sensed data. Our estimates of short-term effusion rates vary widely on a daily to weekly basis, from <1 to >20 m(3) s(-1). In a few cases, periods of increased extrusion precede lava flow-front collapses by a few days to a week, suggesting delays in transmittance of effusion pulses as lava moves from vent to flow front. We find that, as of 1 January 2016, the total area of deposits is 10(7) m(2), and their approximate deposit volume is about 0.3 km(3), equivalent to 0.2 km(3) Dense Rock Equivalent (DRE). We anticipate that our deposit maps will be valuable in the future as a framework for the study of the magmatic and textural evolution of eruptive products through time. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Delineation of agricultural fields in smallholder farms from satellite images using fully convolutional networks and combinatorial grouping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information of agricultural fields in smallholder farms is important for providing actionable information to farmers, managers, and policymakers. Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite images can capture such information. However, the automated delineation of fields in smallholder farms is a challenging task because of their small size, irregular shape and the use of mixed-cropping systems, which make their boundaries vaguely defined. Physical edges between smallholder fields are often indistinct in satellite imagery and contours need to be identified by considering the transition of the complex textural pattern between fields. In these circumstances, standard edge-detection algorithms fail to extract accurate boundaries. This article introduces a strategy to detect field boundaries using a fully convolutional network in combination with a globalisation and grouping algorithm. The convolutional network using an encoder-decoder structure is capable of learning complex spatial-contextual features from the image and accurately detects sparse field contours. A hierarchical segmentation is derived from the contours using the oriented watershed transform and by iteratively merging adjacent regions based on the average strength of their common boundary. Finally, field segments are obtained by adopting a combinatorial grouping algorithm exploiting the information of the segmentation hierarchy. An extensive experimental analysis is performed in two study areas in Nigeria and Mali using WorldView-2/3 images and comparing several state-of-the-art contour detection algorithms. The algorithms are compared based on the precision-recall accuracy assessment strategy which is tolerating small localisation errors in the detected contours. The proposed strategy shows promising results by automatically delineating field boundaries with F-scores higher than 0.7 and 0.6 on our two test areas, respectively, outperforming alternative techniques.

TI  - Optical properties of Forel-Ule water types deduced from 15 years of global satellite ocean color observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Forel-Ule (FU) color comparator scale is the oldest set of optical water types (OWTs). This scale was originally developed for visual comparison and generated an immense amount of data, with hundreds of thousands of observations being gathered from the last 130 years. Since recently, the FU scale is also applicable to remote sensing data. This has been possible thanks to an optical characterization of the 21 FU colors in terms of the (x,y) CIE standards and new algorithms that convert remote-sensing reflectances (R-rs) from satellite-borne ocean color sensors to FU. R-rs-derived hue angle and FU have been recently applied with success in the assessment of color variability of lakes and specific shelf areas, but an evaluation over global oceanic waters is still missing. By clustering global climatological ESAOC-CCI v2.0 R-rs with the derived FU, we obtain a set of R-rs to be used as optical water types (OWTs). Diffuse attenuation coefficient, Secchi disk depth and chlorophyll concentration are also associated to the FU classes. The angular distances of a given R-rs to the two nearest FU classes are proposed as simple and robust membership indexes, adding up to one. We also evaluate the advantages and limitations of FU and the hue angle as monitoring tools over the full marine range, from the most oligotrophic areas to the turbid and productive coastal zones. The first 7 FU indexes cover 99% of global surface waters. Unlike the hue angle, that resolves all spatio-temporal color variations, the FU scale is coarse as a monitoring tool for oligotrophic waters as all the subtropical gyres saturate to FU = 1, while the color of other seas varies across 2, 3 or even 4 FU classes. We illustrate the introduction of a new "zero" FU class that increases monitoring resolution at the blue end of the color range. Finally, we show how optical diversity varies across the color range and compare several sets of OWTs from a color perspective. Overall, we provide a valuable and self-consistent dataset that enhances the usefulness of the FU scale by converting it to useful information for the oceanographic community. This OWT scheme keeps the advantages of other datasets, like being useful to study ocean color product quality and characterize the uncertainties, but also allows to continue to monitor long-term change in optical diversity over the global ocean color. Integration into the optical modules of ecosystem models can help verify past simulations that predate the satellite age, through comparisons with in-situ FU data collected at the time.

TI  - Shifts in Vegetation Cover of Southern California Deserts in Response to Recent Climate Variations.
T2  - Remote sensing in earth systems sciences
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the deserts of Southern California, air temperatures have been rising and precipitation variability has been increasing over the past several decades. These recent climate shifts may have begun to threaten the survival of certain plant and animal species in these arid ecosystems. This study was designed to quantify and characterize variations in vegetation canopy density using more than 30 consecutive years of Landsat satellite image data across the western Lower Colorado (Sonoran) and southern Mojave Desert region. Mapping of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat images (1985 to 2017), which has been closely correlated with percent cover measurements of green vegetation canopies in a variety of arid ecosystems, was used to detect periodic upslope and downslope shifts in plant cover. The change in Landsat NDVI between 1985 and 2017 within the Santa Rosa Mountains Wilderness at four elevation zones between 500 m and 2500 m showed that vegetation green cover dropped notably in below-average precipitation periods, whereas green cover increased sharply in above-average precipitation years. This same temporal pattern of shifting in NDVI was detected along steep elevation gradients in the Anza-Borrego Desert State Park and in the Little San Bernardino Mountains of Joshua Tree National Park. Although the distribution of the dominant plant species along elevation gradients may have increased by more than 60 m over several decades (prior to 2007), we found no evidence that upslope shifts in percent plant cover have yet become a permanent pattern at these mountainous desert sites.

TI  - Nocturnal, seasonal and intra-annual variability of tropospheric aerosols observed using ground-based and space-borne lidars over a tropical location of India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nocturnal, seasonal and intra-annual variation of vertical distribution of tropospheric aerosols over two nearby stations Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 degrees E) and Tirupati (13.6 degrees N, 79.4 degrees E) is investigated using ground-based Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) and space-borne Lidar (CALIPSO) systems during 2010-2017. The nocturnal variation of aerosol extinction (AE) coefficient reveal high AE below similar to 2 km in midnight hours and aerosols are slowly descending towards the surface during early morning hours. From the seasonal variation, AE values are found to be higher at lower altitudes (<2 km) during winter and post-monsoon seasons, a sharp decrease with increasing altitude is found in tandem with boundary layer and low wind speeds. Interestingly, during monsoon season, significant aerosol loading is found in the altitude range of similar to 2-5.5 km mainly due to the influence of strong Low Level Jet (LLJ). The clean environment observed below similar to 2 km during this season is attributed to the wet scavenging, downward vertical winds and existance of no strong local source. The seasonal mean AE profile derived from CALIPSO matches well with the MPL in all the seasons except in monsoon season where a large bias is noticed below 2 km. The intra-annual variation revealed more than 80% of aerosols existing above (below) the boundary layer during monsoon (winter) months contribute to the total Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). The depolarization ratio (>0.2) in the month of July shows the dominance of dust particles which includes long-range transport over this locations. Back trajectories reveals that potential sources are changing from season to season at different altitudes and confirms that the aerosols observed at higher altitudes are advected from other land and oceanic regions. Thus, aerosol vertical distribution is mainly controlled by meteorology and dynamics over this region. Further, the reasonably good correlation found between MPL and MODIS AODs suggests that MODIS could provide reliable AOD over land region also.

TI  - Fmask 4.0: Improved cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed the Function of mask (Fmask) 4.0 algorithm for automated cloud and cloud shadow detection in Landsats 4-8 and Sentinel-2 images. Three major innovative improvements were made as follows: (1) integration of auxiliary data, where Global Surface Water Occurrence (GSWO) data was used to improve the separation of land and water, and a global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was used to normalize thermal and cirrus bands; (2) development of new cloud probabilities, in which a Haze Optimized Transformation (HOT)-based cloud probability was designed to replace temperature probability for Sentinel-2 images, and cloud probabilities were combined and re-calibrated for different sensors against a global reference dataset; and (3) utilization of spectral contextual features, where a Spectral-Contextual Snow Index (SCSI) was created for better distinguishing snow/ice from clouds in polar regions, and a morphology -based approach was applied to reduce the commission error in bright land surfaces (e.g., urban/built-up and mountain snow/ice). The Fmask 4.0 algorithm showed higher overall accuracies for Landsats 4-8 imagery than the 3.3 version (Zhu et al., 2015) (92.40% versus 90.73% for Landsats 4-7 and 94.59% versus 93.30% for Landsat 8), and much higher overall accuracies for Sentinel-2 imagery than the 2.5.5 version of the Sen2Cor algorithm (Mtiller-Wilm et al., 2018) (94.30% versus 87.10%).

M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Global surveillance for vaccine preventable invasive bacterial diseases has been set up by the World Health Organization to provide disease burden data to support decisions on introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV). We present data from 2010 to 2016 collected at the 2 sentinel sites in Ghana.Methods. Data were collected from children <5 years of age presenting at the 2 major teaching hospitals with clinical signs of meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens were collected and tested first at the sentinel site laboratory with conventional microbiology methods and subsequently with molecular analysis, at the World Health Organization Regional Reference Laboratory housed at the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia, for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis, the 3 most common bacteria causing meningitis.Results. There were 4008 suspected cases of meningitis during the surveillance period, of which 31 (0.8%) were laboratory confirmed. Suspected meningitis cases decreased from 923 in 2010 to 219 in 2016. Of 3817 patients with available outcome data, 226 (5.9%) died. S. pneumoniae was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 68.5% of confirmed cases (50 of 73). H. influenzae and N. meningitidis accounted for 6.8% (5 of 73) and 21.9% (16 of 73), respectively. The proportion of pneumococcal vaccine serotypes causing meningitis decreased from 81.3% (13 of 16) before the introduction of 13-valent PCV (2010-2012) to 40.0% (8 of 20) after its introduction (2013-2016).Conclusions. Cases of suspected meningitis decreased among children <5 years of age between 2010 and 2016, with declines in the proportion of vaccine-type pneumococcal meningitis after the introduction of 13-valent PCV in Ghana.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of a permafrost landscape, Adventdalen, Svalbard, investigated by InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nordenskiold Land in Central Spitsbergen, Svalbard is characterized as a high latitude, high relief periglacial landscape with permafrost occurring both in mountains and lowlands. Freezing and thawing of the active layer causes seasonal frost heave and thaw subsidence, while permafrost-related mass-wasting processes induce downslope ground displacements on valley sides. Displacement rate varies spatially and temporally depending on environmental factors. In our study, we apply Satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) to investigate the magnitude, spatial distribution and timing of seasonal ground displacements in and around Adventdalen using TerraSAR-X StripMap Mode (2009-2017) and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Mode (2015-2017) SAR images. First, we show that InSAR results from both sensors highlight consistent patterns and provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of displacement rates. Secondly, two-dimensional (2D) TerraSAR-X InSAR results from combined ascending and descending geometries document the spatial variability of the vertical and east-west horizontal displacement rates for an average of nine thawing seasons. The remote sensing results are compared to a simplified geomorphological map enabling the identification of specific magnitudes and orientations of displacements for 14 selected geomorphological units. Finally, June to December 2017 6-day sampling interval Sentinel-1 time series was retrieved and compared to active layer ground temperatures from two boreholes. The timing of the subsidence and heave detected by InSAR matches the thawing and freeze-back periods measured by in-situ sensors. Our results highlight the value of InSAR to obtain landscape scale knowledge about the seasonal dynamics of complex periglacial environments.

TI  - Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 burned area mapping - A combined sensor multi-temporal change detection approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The free-availability of global coverage Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data provides the opportunity for systematic generation of medium spatial resolution land products. This paper presents a combined Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 burned area mapping algorithm. The data handling integrates recent research on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 preprocessing to generate registered, surface nadir BRDF-adjusted reflectance (NBAR) sensor time series that are used as an input. The different sensor data are combined through a random forest change regression, trained with synthetic data built from laboratory and field spectra and using a spectral model of fire effects on reflectance. The random forest regression is applied independently at each gridded 30 m pixel location on a temporally rolling basis considering three months of sensor data to map the central month. Temporal consistency checks are used to reduce commission errors due to non-fire related spectral changes, and a region growing algorithm is used to reduce omission errors due to temporally sparse observations. In the resulting product, each 30 m pixel is labelled as burned, unburned or unmapped. At burned pixels the estimated day of burning, and a single value that provides an estimate of the product of the subpixel fraction burned (f) and the combustion completeness (cc), henceforth termed "f.cc", and an associated quality measure, are defined. The algorithm is demonstrated using six months of every available Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A acquisition over 10 degrees x 10 degrees of Southern Africa. Experiments comparing the mapped burned areas considering Sentinel-2A only and both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data indicate a greater area burned and a smaller number of unmapped pixels when both sensors are used. The results are compared with contemporaneous NASA MODIS fire products to gain insights into their temporal and spatial reporting differences. Temporally, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product reports the day of burning on average three days later than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, because of the lower revisit frequency of the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 observations. Spatially, the Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 30 m product captures more detail than the MODIS 500 m burned area product, with systematically higher burned area estimates. Despite the areal differences, the spatial pattern of the two products is similar, as reflected by the correlation (r(2) similar to 0.7) and slope (> 0.8) of regressions of the proportions of area burned defined in coarse resolution cells between the two products, taking into account the 3 day temporal bias. A comparison with multi-date PLANET 3 m data, shows high visual agreement in the location and approximate day of burning and higher f.cc values in the interiors of distinct burns than at the edges, and lower values in areas containing mixes of burned and unburned 3 m pixels. The Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A burned area mapping results are validated by comparison with burned areas interpreted visually from two date Sentinel-2A data, over 30 km x 30 km boxes selected by systematic sampling. The results mapped less area burned than the interpreted maps, as reflected by a 0.24 omission error and a negative relative bias (0.19), with a small 0.06 commission error. Regression between the proportions of area burned defined in 1.5 km cells provide a high correlation (r(2) = 0.89) and slope close to unity (0.82) and indicate that the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2A results identified similar burned area spatial patterns as the interpreted maps.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES

AB  - Background. Acute bacterial meningitis remains a major cause of childhood mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. We document findings from hospital-based sentinel surveillance of bacterial meningitis among children <5 years of age in The Gambia, from 2010 to 2016.Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected from children admitted to the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital with suspected meningitis. Identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and Haemophilus influenzae was performed by microbiological culture and/or polymerase chain reaction where possible. Whole genome sequencing was performed on pneumococcal isolates.Results. A total of 438 children were admitted with suspected meningitis during the surveillance period. The median age of the patients was 13 (interquartile range, 3-30) months. Bacterial meningitis was confirmed in 21.4% (69/323) of all CSF samples analyzed. Pneumococcus, meningococcus, and H. influenzae accounted for 52.2%, 31.9%, and 16.0% of confirmed cases, respectively. There was a significant reduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) serotypes, from 44.4% in 2011 to 0.0% in 2014, 5 years after PCV implementation. The majority of serotyped meningococcus and H. influenzae belonged to meningococcus serogroup W (45.5%) and H. influenzae type b (54.5%), respectively. Meningitis pathogens were more frequently isolated during the dry dusty season of the year. Reduced susceptibility to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and chloramphenicol was observed. No resistance to penicillin was found.Conclusions. The proportion of meningitis cases due to pneumococcus declined in the post-PCV era. However, the persistence of vaccine-preventable meningitis in children aged <5 years is a major concern and demonstrates the need for sustained high-quality surveillance.

TI  - Early soil consolidation from magnetic extensometers and full resolution SAR interferometry over highly decorrelated reclaimed lands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reclaimed lands account for a large portion of the developable territories in Hong Kong. Towards better construction planning for the follow-up civil works, stability monitoring is usually required at these artificial sites. The Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) technique can provide bi-weekly updates of high resolution (up to 1 m) and high precision (millimeter level) ground motion maps at low costs, which overcomes the limitations of ground-based instruments. However, rapid settlement during the early stage of soil consolidation can result in significant temporal decorrelation to phase signals and impact InSAR detection, especially over newly reclaimed areas. Here, we give a first demonstration on how the introduction of in-situ extensometer measurements can help improve InSAR capabilities for signal recovery of the early consolidation process. We integrate persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) in our processing chain to establish a two-tier monitoring network. Magnetic extensometers are used to estimate local consolidation models, which are then utilized to replace the linear part in the conventional functional phase model. For nonlinear deformation, both hyperbolic and exponential models were considered. The proposed method was applied to 61 TerraSAR-X images covering the Penny's Bay Reclamation Stage 2 (PBR2) in Hong Kong. The consolidation history of the new reclamation site has been successfully extracted, with cumulative subsidence exceeding 1.6 m between May 2008 and Dec. 2011. Approximately 84% of the settlement of the non-dredged region was found to be from compaction of underlying soft marine deposits, not the filling materials. In addition to highlighting the spatiotemporal characteristics of the deformation, InSAR also helps reveal the compaction evolution of the underlying deposit. The results benefit our understanding of the early consolidation process in PBR2 and inform extra reinforcement plans if necessary.

TI  - Evolution of a debris-covered glacier in the western Himalaya during the last four decades (1971-2016): A multiparametric assessment using remote sensing and field observations
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the response of the Panchi Nala glacier, Bhaga Basin, western Himalaya to climate change by monitoring multiple glacier parameters namely, length, area, debris cover, snowline altitude (SLA), surface ice velocity (Sly), and surface elevation change (Delta h). These parameters were analysed using high-resolution satellite images (Corona KH-4B and Sentinel-2 MSI) and medium-resolution ones (Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI and Terra ASTER) acquired between 1971 and 2016, along with extensive field observations. Considering only dimensional changes, the glacier appears to have low rates of recession (4.54 +/- 2.56 m y(-1)) and deglaciation (0.11 +/- 0.04% y(-1)) over the study period (1971-2016). However, SIV and Delta h values reveal a significant slowdown (33.87%; 1992/93-2015/16), and an extensive lowering (-1.62 +/- 0.06 m y(-1); 2000-2013) on the glacier. The debris cover area and SIA also increased by 23.50 +/- 1.74% and 287.63 m, respectively, during 1971-2016. Increase in the mean winter minimum temperature, and decrease in the winter snowfall are probably the main drivers of glacier depletion. We conclude that the significant slowdown, extensive surface lowering, development of a proglacial lake and appearance of the supraglacial lakes collectively indicate a severe glacier degeneration. This forewarns that the glacier may experience an accelerated pace of wastage in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - An improved surface soil moisture downscaling approach over cloudy areas based on geographically weighted regression
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a methodological framework for downscaling AMSR-2 surface soil moisture (SSM) products over cloudy areas using MODIS LST/NDVI datasets. The experiment was conducted in a relatively large area of 430,000 km(2) in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze and Huaihe rivers in China, which is characterized by humid climate and frequent cloudy weather conditions. As MODIS LSTs suffer from serious pixel loss due to cloud interference in this area, an effective LST interpolation method was preliminarily applied to achieve daily LST datasets with quasi-full covers. And rather small RMSEs in the range 1.5 K-3.5 K were obtained when the interpolated LST datasets were validated against a reference LST dataset built from observed relationships between LST and ground-based near-surface air temperatures on clear sky days. A regression equation was then established between AMSR-2 SSM and spatially resampled MODIS datasets using "Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR)" to implement the SSM downscaling process. SSM estimates downscaled by the GWR-based method showed a better performance over those downscaled by the traditional "universal triangle feature (UTF)" based method in view of their "non-biased RMSEs (ubRMSEs)", correlation coefficients, and mean biases with respect to ground-based soil moisture validation data. Comparisons between SSM estimates from MODIS LST inputs and those from interpolated LST inputs were conducted, and they showed that the SSM estimates downscaled by interpolated LST inputs performed only slightly poorer (with an ubRMSE difference no larger than 0.02 cm(3)/cm(3)) than those by MODIS data. Time series analysis further showed that the GWR-based downscaled SSM estimates with reconstructed LST data inputs are in phase with the variation in ground-based soil moisture with the exception of areas of extremely high vegetation cover or low temperatures. The framework proposed in this study thus proved feasible for the derivation of reliable downscaled high spatial resolution SSM estimates, an essential application in mitigating pixel loss under cloudy weather conditions.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Bacterial meningitis is a major cause of mortality among children under 5 years of age. Senegal is part of World Health Organization-coordinated sentinel site surveillance for pediatric bacterial meningitis surveillance. We conducted this analysis to describe the epidemiology and etiology of bacterial meningitis among children less than 5 years in Senegal from 2010 and to 2016.Methods. Children who met the inclusion criteria for suspected meningitis at the Centre Hospitalier National d'Enfants Albert Royer, Senegal, from 2010 to 2016 were included. Cerebrospinal fluid specimens were collected from suspected cases examined by routine bacteriology and molecular assays. Serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequencing were performed.Results. A total of 1013 children were admitted with suspected meningitis during the surveillance period. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus accounted for 66% (76/115), 25% (29/115), and 9% (10/115) of all confirmed cases, respectively. Most of the suspected cases (63%; 639/1013) and laboratory-confirmed (57%; 66/115) cases occurred during the first year of life. Pneumococcal meningitis case fatality rate was 6-fold higher than that of meningococcal meningitis (28% vs 5%). The predominant pneumococcal lineage causing meningitis was sequence type 618 (n = 7), commonly found among serotype 1 isolates. An ST 2174 lineage that included serotypes 19A and 23F was resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.Conclusions. There has been a decline in pneumococcal meningitis post-pneumococcal conjugate vaccine introduction in Senegal. However, disease caused by pathogens covered by vaccines in widespread use still persists. There is need for continued effective monitoring of vaccine-preventable meningitis.

TI  - Colorectal cancer exosomes induce lymphatic network remodeling in lymph nodes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The lymphatic network remodeling may guide tumor metastasis in a sentinel lymph node (SLN). Although tumor-derived exosomes have been demonstrated to modify the microenvironment in adjacent organs and initiate a premetastatic niche, their influence on the lymphatic network in SLNs has not been explained. Here, we show that CT26 cell exosomes (Exo) promote the proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells and the formation of lymphatic network in SLN, facilitating the SLN metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Uptake of Exo by macrophages promoted VEGFC secretion both in vivo and in vitro. Exo increased the frequency of F4/80(+) macrophages in the SLN. Macrophage ablation by clodrosome prevented the exosomal effect on lymphatic network remodeling and SLN metastasis. Exosomal IRF-2 was highly expressed in serum exosomes isolated from CRC patients with LN metastasis relative to patients without LN metastasis and healthy controls. Mechanistically, exosomal IRF-2 induced the release of VEGFC by macrophages. An IRF-2 knockdown attenuated the lymphatic network remodeling in the SLN and suppressed the SLN metastasis. Our data suggest that exosomal IRF-2 remodels the lymphatic network in an SLN and may predict the development of CRC LN metastases.

TI  - Pediatric Bacterial Meningitis Surveillance in Nigeria From 2010 to 2016, Prior to and During the Phased Introduction of the 10-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Historically, Nigeria has experienced large bacterial meningitis outbreaks with high mortality in children. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and Haemophilus influenzae are major causes of this invasive disease. In collaboration with the World Health Organization, we conducted longitudinal surveillance in sentinel hospitals within Nigeria to establish the burden of pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM).Methods. From 2010 to 2016, cerebrospinal fluid was collected from children <5 years of age, admitted to 5 sentinel hospitals in 5 Nigerian states. Microbiological and latex agglutination techniques were performed to detect the presence of pneumococcus, meningococcus, and H. influenzae. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction and serotyping/grouping were conducted to determine specific causative agents of PBM.Results. A total of 5134 children with suspected meningitis were enrolled at the participating hospitals; of these 153 (2.9%) were confirmed PBM cases. The mortality rate for those infected was 15.0% (23/153). The dominant pathogen was pneumococcus (46.4%: 71/153) followed by meningococcus (34.6%: 53/153) and H. influenzae (19.0%: 29/153). Nearly half the pneumococcal meningitis cases successfully serotyped (46.4%: 13/28) were caused by serotypes that are included in the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. The most prevalent meningococcal and H. influenzae strains were serogroup W and serotype b, respectively.Conclusions. Vaccine-type bacterial meningitis continues to be common among children <5 years in Nigeria. Challenges with vaccine introduction and coverage may explain some of these finding. Continued surveillance is needed to determine the distribution of serotypes/groups of meningeal pathogens across Nigeria and help inform and sustain vaccination policies in the country.

TI  - Characterizing global forest canopy cover distribution using spaceborne lidar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed characterization of global forest dynamics requires accurate measurements of canopy cover beyond estimating the extent of forested area. Passive-optical remote sensing techniques, despite remarkable success in identifying global hotspots of forest cover loss, cannot fully satisfy observation requirements at the plot or canopy crown level. Critical issues including signal saturation and algorithm uncertainty impose limitations on capturing subtle canopy cover changes using standard products generated from satellite imagery, particularly over largely intact dense tropical forests. Spaceborne lidar remote sensing can fill this gap in contemporary Earth observation networks by providing direct measurements of 3-D canopy structure. Here we analyze global canopy cover distributions using observations from the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) onboard of NASA's Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-1). We found ICESat-based cover estimates were sensitive to canopy cover dynamics even over dense forests with cover exceeding 80% and were able to better characterize biome-level gradients and canopy cover distributions than the existing products derived from conventional optical remote sensing. At the footprint level, ICESat-1 produced almost no bias when compared with airborne estimates, and had RMSE values on the order of similar to 20% cover. Improved cover products based on lidar should allow comprehensive analysis of subtle forest structure changes at landscape scales, and provide unique information for biophysical stratification of forests and changes in vertical canopy structure. This is particularly true given the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar recently installed on the International Space Station, which will acquire higher resolution lidar data at greater sampling densities than has been available to date.

TI  - Performance of MODIS high-resolution MAIAC aerosol algorithm in China: Characterization and limitation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The MODIS Multiple Angle Implication of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm enables simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and bidirectional surface reflectance at high resolution of 1 km. Taking advantage of multi-angle and image-based information, the MAIAC algorithm has great potential for improving retrieval of aerosols over both dark and bright surfaces. Here, by comparing MAIAC aerosol products with the ground-based observations at 9 typical sites spread out in China, we gain the insights regarding the performance of MAIAC algorithm, for the first time, over Asia that has complicated surface types, diverse aerosol sources, and heavy loading of aerosols in the atmosphere. While aerosol products from MAIAC show similar spatial distribution as that from MODIS Dark-Target (DT) and Deep-Blue (DB) algorithms, they are superior to reveal numerous hotspots of high AOD values in fine scales due to their higher resolution at 1 km. Moreover, since MAIAC algorithm for cloud screening uses time series of observations, it shows higher effectiveness to mask cloudy pixels as well as the pixels of the melting and aging ice/snow surfaces. While MAIAC and ground-observed AOD values show high correlation coefficient of similar to 0.94 in two AERONET sites of Beijing and Xianghe, considerable bias is prevalent in other regions of China. Systematic underestimation is found over the deserts in western China likely due to the high bias of single scattering properties of aerosol model prescribed in MAIAC algorithm. In eastern China, the distinct positive bias is found in conditions with low-moderate AOD values and likely results from errors in regression coefficients in the surface reflectance model. Given its advantages in cloud and snow/ice screening and retrieval in fine spatial resolution, MAIAC algorithm can be improved by further refinement of regional aerosol and surface properties.

TI  - A unified approach to estimate land and water reflectances with uncertainties for coastal imaging spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal ecosystem studies using remote visible/infrared spectroscopy typically invert an atmospheric model to estimate the water-leaving reflectance signal. This inversion is challenging due to the confounding effects of turbid backscatter, atmospheric aerosols, and sun glint. Simultaneous estimation of the surface and atmosphere can resolve the ambiguity enabling spectral reflectance maps with rigorous uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate a simultaneous retrieval method that adapts the Optimal Estimation (OE) formalism of Rodgers (2000) to the coastal domain. We compare two surface representations: a parametric bio-optical model based on Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs); and an expressive statistical model that estimates reflectance in every instrument channel. The latter is suited to both land and water reflectance, enabling a unified analysis of terrestrial and aquatic domains. We test these models with both vector and scalar Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs). We report field experiments by two airborne instruments: NASA's Portable Remote Imaging SpectroMeter (PRISM) in an overflight of Santa Monica, California; and NASA's Next Generation Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-NG) in an overflight of the Wax Lake Delta and lower Atchafalaya River, Louisiana. In both cases, in situ validation measurements match remote water-leaving reflectance estimates to high accuracy. Posterior error predictions demonstrate a closed account of uncertainty in these coastal observations.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Pediatric bacterial meningitis (PBM) causes severe morbidity and mortality within Togo. Thus, as a member of the World Health Organization coordinated Invasive Bacterial Vaccine Preventable Diseases network, Togo conducts surveillance targeting Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus), and Haemophilus influenzae, at a sentinel hospital within the capital city, Lome, in the southernmost Maritime region.Methods. Cerebrospinal fluid was collected from children <5 years with suspected PBM admitted to the Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital. Phenotypic detection of pneumococcus, meningococcus, and H. influenzae was confirmed through microbiological techniques. Samples were shipped to the Regional Reference Laboratory to corroborate results by species-specific polymerase chain reaction.Results. Overall, 3644 suspected PBM cases were reported, and 98 cases (2.7%: 98/3644) were confirmed bacterial meningitis. Pneumococcus was responsible for most infections (67.3%: 66/98), followed by H. influenzae (23.5%: 23/98) and meningococcus (9.2%: 9/98). The number of pneumococcal meningitis cases decreased by 88.1% (52/59) postvaccine introduction with 59 cases from July 2010 to June 2014 and 7 cases from July 2014 to June 2016. However, 5 cases caused by nonvaccine serotypes were observed. Fewer PBM cases caused by vaccine serotypes were observed in infants <1 year compared to children 2-5 years.Conclusions. Routine surveillance showed that PCV13 vaccination is effective in preventing pneumococcal meningitis among children <5 years of age in the Maritime region. This complements the MenAfriVac vaccination against meningococcal serogroup A to prevent meningitis outbreaks in the northern region of Togo. Continued surveillance is vital for estimating the prevalence of PBM, determining vaccine impact, and anticipating epidemics in Togo.

TI  - Crop phenology retrieval via polarimetric SAR decomposition and Random Forest algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of crop phenology assists in making agricultural decisions such as appropriate irrigation and fertilization applications in order to optimize crop yield. The objective of this study is to monitor crop phenology using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric decompositions and a random forest algorithm applied to a multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 dataset, acquired during the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Validation Experiment 2016 in Manitoba (SMAPVEX16-MB). The model-based and eigen-based polarimetric parameters are used to separate the vegetation and soil scattering contributions in the total radar signal. As the crop morphological shape and structure vary with phenological growth, our study assumes that the polarimetric parameters related to the volume scattering mechanism have the potential to track the crop phenology. The sensitivity of the polarimetric parameters to the ground identified crop phenology is analyzed for different crop types. For canola, a single polarimetric parameter is sufficient to characterize the crop phenology, due to the high volume scattering power and large temporal dynamic. For corn, soybean and wheat, combinations of multiple polarimetric parameters are required. For each crop type, the Random Forest algorithm trained using 60% of the data is used to retrieve the, crop phenology. Performances are compared to Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine Regression and k-Nearest neighborhood algorithms. The Random Forest algorithm provides the best phenology retrieval with significant (p-value < 0.01) spearman correlation coefficients (between the retrieved and ground identified phenology) of 0.93, 0.90, 0.85 and 0.91 for canola, corn, soybean and wheat, respectively. While a single polarimetric parameter demonstrates limited sensitivity to corn phenology, the retrieved phenology from the Random Forest algorithm using multiple polarimetric parameters agrees well with the ground measurements. Furthermore, the importance of different polarimetric parameters for phenology retrieval using the Random Forest algorithm is quantified for different crop types. These findings will be of interest in developing future analytical retrieval models.

TI  - A review of remote sensing for mangrove forests: 1956-2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Mangrove forests are highly productive ecosystems that typically dominate the intertidal zone of tropical and subtropical coastlines. The history of mangrove remote sensing (RS) can be traced back to 1956. Over the last six decades, hot spot topics in the field of mangrove RS have evolved from mangrove distribution mapping, biophysical parameters inversion, to ecosystem process characterization. Although several review articles have been published to summarize the progress in this field, none of them highlighted the key milestones of historical developments pertinent to major research topics or key drivers that stimulate such milestones.In this review, we aim to identify key milestones in mangrove RS by associating the emergence of major research topics with the occurrence of new sensors in four historical phases, i.e. before 1989, 1990-1999, 2000-2009, and 2010-2018. For each identified research topic, an in-depth theoretical understanding was achieved by analyses of both the first published article and the most-cited article. Based on the analyses, the current state of knowledge as well as existing limitations were summarized. In addition, in order to gain insights on driving forces for emergence of new research topics, we compared the chronological evolution of mangrove RS with that of terrestrial forest RS.Interestingly, we found that key research topics in mangrove RS replicated those of forest RS yet with varying time lags. This can be attributed to the following two facts: 1) mangrove forests often appear as more elongated patches than terrestrial forests; 2) field work is more challenging in mangrove habitat. Along with the RS sensors' advancement, various topics that had been studied in terrestrial forests were later transformed to mangrove studies. Based on the projected growth of foreseeing earth observation capacity, insights on future research directions in mangrove RS were also presented.

TI  - AMSR2 snow depth downscaling algorithm based on a multifactor approach over the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate dynamic measurements of snow depth (SD) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are of great importance for understanding local climate systems and surface hydrological cycles. Currently, passive microwave remote sensing is the most effective approach used to monitor the spatiotemporal variations in SD. However, the large uncertainties and low spatial resolution of existing SD products lead to less satisfactory passive microwave remote sensing in regions with complex terrain conditions, strong seasonal transitions and great spatiotemporal heterogeneity, such as the TP. In this study, geographic location, terrain, snow cover days and brightness temperature were evaluated. Then, critical factors were used to develop an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SD downscaling model. The results indicated the following: (1) SD is greatly influenced by geographic location, snow covered days, terrain parameters and brightness temperature difference. The surface roughness exhibited the best correlations with ground observations, which reflects 44% of the variation in SD; (2) the novel multifactor power SD downscaling model, which combines AMSR2 brightness temperature data and other auxiliary data, showed higher accuracy and stability and was closely correlated with the SD ground observations, and it reflected 80% of the SD variation; (3) compared with the AMSR2 ascending and descending orbital SD products released by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the SD datasets in China from the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China (WESTDC), the proposed downscaled SD datasets for the TP were greatly improved, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and average absolute error (MAE) were greatly reduced (2.00 cm and 0.25 cm, respectively); (4) the downscaled SD datasets for the TP showed good accuracy (RMSE = 0.58 cm) in areas with a SD of < 3 cm; and (5) the worst monitoring accuracy of the downscaled SD product was for grasslands, with a RMSE of 2.07 cm. The best accuracy of the downscaling SD product was found for bare land cover conditions, with an RMSE of only 0.41 cm.

TI  - Estimating 1-km-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across China using the space-time random forest approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is closely related to the atmospheric environment and human life. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products have been widely applied in estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations over large areas using statistical regression models. However, they are often given at coarse spatial resolutions which limit their applications in small or medium scales. This study aims to produce PM2.5 concentrations at a high spatial resolution (1 km) across China based on the newly released Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD1S) Collection 6 Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD product using a newly developed space-time random forest (STRF) model. Daily PM2.5 concentrations for 2016 were estimated from in-situ surface PM2.5 measurements, and meteorological and ancillary variables. The 10-fold cross-validation (CV) approach and three popular models, including the multiple linear regression model, the geographically weighted regression model, and the two-stage model, are employed for validation and cross comparison. A sample-based CV of the STRF model shows a high and stable accuracy with a coefficient of determination equal to 0.85, a root-mean-square error of 15.57 mu g m(-3), and a mean prediction error of 9.77 mu g m(-3). This finding suggests that the STRF model can predict PM2.5 daily, monthly, and annual concentrations at an unprecedented spatial resolution and accuracy across China. It also appears to have out-performed the above popular models and the previous related studies. In general, the STRF model is robust and can accurately estimate PM2.5 concentrations by taking advantage of the ensemble regression approach, the synergy of space-time information, and the high-resolution, high-quality, and wide-spatial-coverage of the MAIAC AOD product. It may thus also be useful for applications in related air pollution studies, especially those focused on urban areas.

TI  - The capability of species-related forest stand characteristics determination with the use of hyperspectral data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary goal of this study was to bridge the gap between hyperspectral data classifications and their practical implementation for forest management. Information on the distributions and abundances of tree species can help forest managers understand the spatial coverage of tree species and manage the species composition by establishing a specific strategy. For this purpose, classification of tree species was applied to airborne hyperspectral imagery, and a determination of selected forest stand characteristics (i.e., main tree species, species cover proportions, and species mixture patterns) was made.We selected the Milicz Forest District of southwestern Poland as our study area. Sixteen airborne hyper-spectral images were acquired with the HySpex VNIR-1800 and SWIR-384 sensors on 19 August 2015. We classified four deciduous tree species (Black alder, Pedunculate oak, Silver birch, and European beech) and coniferous species using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. To properly evaluate the classification accuracy, the level of crown visibility from above was determined during ground measurements. The obtained information was used to create a reference set integrated with the Remote Sensing data.The classification accuracy was 91%. The main tree species found in the sample plots were correctly assessed based on the coverage area for 92% of the sample plots. The species cover proportions were estimated correctly for 75-94% of the sample plots with a tolerance threshold <= 10 percentage points depending on the species considered. Similarities of the species structures shown in the sample plots between the classification map and reference field data were found by Morisita's index (0.92). Spatial mixture pattern detection was performed for 316 forest stands. The results of the developed method were found to agree to field data with 69% accuracy. This study shows that airborne hyperspectral data serve as a reliable source for the precise description of forest characteristics, such as the main tree species, tree species cover proportions and mixture patterns.

TI  - The effect of thermal radiation from surrounding terrain on glacier surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing data: A case study from Qiyi Glacier, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature (LST) can be derived from satellite observations, particularly for remote high-elevated mountain glaciers where in situ observations are scarce. Our previous LST retrieval study on Qiyi Glacier of China employed a generalized single-channel algorithm and Landsat thermal infrared data, but a clear LST summertime overestimation was observed, particularly on the glacier tongue. Here we extend our previous study by calculating the thermal radiance on Qiyi Glacier that is emitted from the surrounding terrain, and incorporating this thermal radiation term into two generalized single-channel LST algorithms to analyze its influence on the errors of glacier surface temperatures retrieved from remote sensing data. In addition, we also discuss other possible causes of this overestimation in LST retrieval. The key findings of our study are as follows. (1) The surrounding terrain provides nonnegligible summertime thermal radiation to the glacier in the Landsat7 band 6 spectrum range (10.4-12.5 mu m) that is 2.6 times larger than the atmospheric down-welling thermal radiance on the glacier tongue. The retrieved LSTs yield an overestimation of up to 0.28 K when the effect of thermal radiation from the surrounding slopes is not considered. (2) The average errors due to the surrounding topographic thermal radiation and the cubic convolution resampling method (CC method) employed in the Landsat7 thermal infrared data processing are only 0.07 K and - 0.01 K, respectively. These are much smaller than the average LST errors (1.79 K), indicating that the neither the surrounding topographic thermal radiation nor the CC method are primary factors in the retrieved LST overestimation. (3) The sole dependence of the generalized single-channel algorithm on the atmospheric water vapor content may therefore be the most likely cause of this overestimation, as high-altitude regions generally possess low atmospheric water contents. Radiative transfer models (e.g., MODTRAN) may provide a solution to this problem by simulating the influence of other atmospheric constituents on LST retrieval under conditions of low water vapor, which can then indicate any additional input variables that should be incorporated into the LST algorithm.

TI  - User needs for future Landsat missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellites have been operating since 1972, providing the longest continuous observation record of the Earth's land surface. Over the past half century, the Landsat user community has grown exponentially, encompassing more diverse and evolving scientific research and operational uses. Understanding current and future user needs is crucial to informing the design of Landsat missions beyond Landsat 9. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) initiated a user needs collection process to document needs from U.S. Federal civil subject matter experts who rely on moderate-resolution land imaging data across a diverse range of scientific research and application domains. In total, 379 moderate-resolution land imaging user needs were collected through structured interviews. The findings indicate that, at present, users need continuity in Landsat capabilities with free and open data access. Improvements to future Landsat systems should include 10 m spatial resolution and at least weekly cloud-free observation frequency. Spectral enhancements should include the addition of red edge bands, and multiple, narrower visible, near infrared, shortwave infrared, and thermal infrared bands. Ideally, a variety of applications need continuous, full-spectrum coverage in 10 nm-wide bands spanning the visible to shortwave infrared (VSWIR) region (400-2500 nm) and 5 to 8 multispectral thermal infrared bands. Non-Federal (state, local, commercial, academic, and international) sources found similar results, but a more comprehensive comparison across these communities through a broader survey may provide additional insights. USGS-collected moderate-resolution land imaging user needs are an input to the Landsat 10 Architecture Study to develop and assess feasible Landsat 10 mission architectures.

TI  - Multi-climate mode interactions drive hydrological and vegetation responses to hydroclimatic extremes in Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia has experienced a large frequency of hydroclimatic events since the early 21st century, with multiple large-scale droughts and flooding rains exerting dramatic impacts on water resources and ecosystems. Despite these pronounced consequences, the coupling of ecosystem functioning to extreme climate variability remains elusive due to the lack of complete understanding of hydrological connections. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal trends of Australia's hydrological and vegetation responses to three climate modes: El Nino-Southern Oscillation, the Indian Ocean dipole and the Southern Annular Mode, utilizing climate indices, satellite-derived total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE, precipitation from TRMM and vegetation greenness from MODIS. Using partial cross-correlation and vegetation sensitivity analyses to interpret the interactions among climate modes, water resources and vegetation across Australia, three hydroclimatic extreme events from 2002 to 2017 were analyzed: (i) a prolonged drought (2002-09, colloquially known as the 'big dry'); (ii) a dramatic wet pulse (2010-11, the 'big wet'); and (iii) another anomalous El Nino event (2015).Our results showed the entire continent partitioned into three geographic zones with diverse drying and wetting trends in total water storage, precipitation and vegetation greenness, reflecting varying and fundamental influences from the individual climate modes. Ecosystem productivity was found to be better related and more sensitive to TWSA than precipitation across different hydroclimate zones and during both extreme dry and wet conditions. We also observed TWSA increased rapidly during wet extremes, and these gains in water resources persisted for an additional four years (i.e., TWSA remained positive until 2015 following the 2011 'big wet'). Lastly, findings from another hydroclimatic event (the 2015 El Nino drought) further confirmed the relationships among climate, water and ecosystems, demonstrating the feasibility of predicting ecohydrological implications of future hydroclimatic extremes in Australia.

TI  - Morphological characteristics and topographic thresholds of gullies in different agro-ecological environments
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gully erosion is an important sediment source and causes severe environmental degradation, particularly in the drought-prone regions of Ethiopia. We investigated the morphological characteristics of gullies, the topographic thresholds of gully formation, and estimated headcut retreat rates in three agro-ecologies of the Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia: highland (Guder), midland (Aba Gerima), and lowland (Dibatie). Gully morphological characteristics were analyzed using data measured in the field, whereas the topographic thresholds were estimated using slope and upslope drainage area. Average annual linear (R-l) and volumetric (V-e) headcut retreat rates were estimated by visual interpretation of very high resolution (0.5-1.5 m) satellite images (QuickBird, IKONOS, SPOT-7, and Pleiades) in a GIS environment. A significant power relationship, fitted between gully volume (V) and length (L) for the three sites, is V = 8.097 L-1.032 (R-2 = 0.902, n = 94). The average annual R-l, V-e, and soil loss rates were estimated at 0.76 m yr(-1), 6.77 m(3) yr(-1), and 8.73 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in Guder, 2.09 m yr(-1), 19.58 m(3) yr(-1), and 20.76 t ha(-)1 yr(-1) in Aba Gerima, and 3.42 m yr(-1), 42.16 m(3) yr(-1), and 49.33 t ha(-1) yr(-1) in Dibatie. The higher gully headcut retreat rate in Dibatie is mainly related to the highly erodible nature of Vertisols. The coefficients of the slope (S)-drainage area (A) relationship S = aA(-b) were a = 0.219 and b = -0.139 in Guder, a = 0.133 and b = -0.234 in Aba Gerima, and a = 0.113 and b = -0.216 in Dibatie, indicating that topographic thresholds for gully initiation varied among the agro-ecologies. The results of this study can be used to estimate gully erosion rates and identify areas for gully initiation, thereby supporting the planning of appropriate gully control measures in the study sites and other areas with similar environmental settings.

TI  - Assimilating remote sensing data into GIS-based all sky solar radiation modeling for mountain terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation is the ultimate energy resource of earth surface energy balance and the main driving force of atmospheric, ecological and hydrological processes. Solar radiation over complex terrain has large spatial and temporal variation because of terrain shading and high cloud heterogeneity. While most existing GIS-based solar radiation models only work under clear sky condition, this research presents a solar radiation model which considers both terrain shading and anisotropic cloud attenuation and diffuse radiation using MODIS atmospheric products. Specifically, we use skyshed map, sky cloud maps, and sky weight map to represent angular distribution of sky obstruction, anisotropic cloud properties, and diffuse radiance over hemispherical sky, respectively. Combining skyshed map, sky weight map and sky cloud maps, we develop a solar radiation model where 3D geometrical relationships among sun, cloud, and terrain are considered and anisotropic diffuse radiance and cloud attenuation are modeled. Model results are evaluated using field observations in the Kunlun Mountains of western China. At Terra and Aqua overpass time, our model performs well with a mean relative bias (MRB) of -0.2%. It underestimates in clear and partly cloudy sky with a MRB of -5.86% and -4.79% and has a mean absolute relative bias (MARB) of 8.11% and 21.59% respectively. It overestimates under overcast sky with a MRB of 1.68% and has a MARB of 31.71%. Our model performs better when compared with existing instantaneous solar radiation products. For daily solar radiation, our model shows good performance with a MRB of 1.43% and MARB of 17.02%. Our model shows significant spatial variation of solar radiation within the study area with the influences from terrain and cloud. Our research provides a novel and improved approach to assimilating remote sensing data into GIS-based solar radiation modeling in mountainous terrain where observations are sparse and difficult to obtain.

TI  - A high-resolution inventory of air pollutant emissions from crop residue burning in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residue burning is an important source of air pollutants and strongly affects the regional air quality and global climate change. This study presents a detailed emission inventory of major air pollutants from crop residue burning for the year of 2014 in China by the bottom-up method. Activity data were investigated for 296 prefecture-level cities. Emission factors were determined for indoor and in-field burning separately. Regional differences were considered for the proportion of residue burned (PCRB), the ratio between indoor and in-field burning, and the ratio of straw to grain production. The emissions were estimated at prefecture-city level as the first step; then they were redistributed within a city based on 1-km resolution land-use, MODIS fire counts, and rural population. Temporal variation was determined according to farming practices in different regions and MODIS fire counts. Uncertainties were estimated using the Monte Carlo method. The total emissions from crop residue burning in China were estimated to be 0.13 ( - 47-92%) for BC, 0.71 ( - 48-92%) for OC, 1.77 ( - 48-91%) for PM2.5, 2.04 (- 50-100%) for PM10, 0.16 (- 59-133%) for SO2, 0.53 ( - 55-105%) for NOx, 0.12 ( - 47-93%) for NH3, 1.07 ( - 55-102%) for CH4, 1.85 ( - 43-74%) for NMVOC, 18.33 ( - 46-85%) for CO and 305.20 ( - 45-80%) for CO2, in unit of Tg yr(-1). Our results are remarkably lower than those reported in previous studies, mainly because of the PCRB has decreased significantly in recent years. For most of the pollutants, indoor burning accounted for about 50-70% of the emissions. Rice, wheat and corn contributed more than 85% of the emissions, but their relative contributions varied a lot with region and season. High emissions were mostly located in the eastern China, central China and northeastern China, and temporally peaked in April, June and October, with different intensities in the north and the south. This study provides a useful basis for air quality modeling and the policy making of pollution control strategies.

TI  - Satellite-based simulation of soil freezing/thawing processes in the northeast Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of the distribution and characteristics of frozen soil is critical for evaluating the impacts of climate change on the ecological and hydrological systems in high-latitude and-altitude regions, such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, field observations have been limited by the harsh climate and complex terrain on the plateau, which greatly restricts our ability to predict the existence of and variations in frozen soils, especially at the regional scale. Here, we present a study relying solely on satellite data to drive process-based simulation of soil freeze-thaw processes. Modifications are made to an existing process-based model (Geomorphology-Based Eco-Hydrological Model, GBEHM) such that the model is fully adaptable to remote sensing inputs. The developed model fed with a combination of MODIS, TRMM and AIRX3STD satellite products is applied in the upper Yellow River Basin (coverage of similar to 2.54 x 10(5) km(2)) in the northeast TP and validated against field observations of freezing and thawing front depths (D-ft) and soil temperature (T-soil) at 54 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations, as well as frozen-ground types at 22 boreholes. Results indicate that the developed model performs reasonably well in simulating D-ft (R-2 = 0.69; mean bias = -0.03 m) and T-soil (station averaged R-2 and mean bias range between 0.90-0.96 and -0.51 similar to -0.14 degrees C at eight observational depths, respectively), and outperforms the original GBEHM forced with ground-measured meteorological variables. The frozen-ground types are also (in general) accurately identified by the satellite-based approach, except for a few permafrost boreholes located near the permafrost boundary regions. Additionally, we also demonstrate the importance of considering dynamic soil water content in frozen soil simulation: We find that a static-soil-moisture assumption (as used in previous studies) would lead to biased soil temperature estimates by > 0.5 degrees C. Our study demonstrates the value of using satellite data in frozen-soil simulation over complex landscapes, potentially leading to a greater understanding of soil freeze-thaw processes at the regional scale.

TI  - A new thermal infrared channel configuration for accurate land surface temperature retrieval from satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in many research fields. Many algorithms have been developed to retrieve LST from satellite thermal infrared (TIR) measurements; of these, the most widely used are the split window (SW) and temperature emissivity separation (TES) methods. However, the performance of the SW and TES methods can be limited by the difficulty in obtaining sufficiently accurate prior knowledge-specifically, input land surface emissivity (LSE) for the SW method and atmospheric parameters for the TES method. In this study, a procedure was proposed for selecting specific channel pairs in the TIR spectral region to accurately retrieve ground brightness temperatures without prior atmospheric knowledge, using a method similar to the SW method. Subsequently, the TES method is applied to the retrieved ground brightness temperatures to separate the LST and LSE. In numerical simulations, the three ground brightness temperatures corresponding to 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, and 10.4 mu m are acquired with an accuracy of about 0.65 K by using five channels centered at 8.6 mu m, 9.0 mu m, 10.4 mu m, 11.3 mu m, and 12.5 mu m, each with a width of 0.1 mu m. When inputting the three retrieved ground brightness temperatures into TES method, LST could be recovered with an accuracy of 0.87 K. Sensitivity analysis shows that LST retrieval accuracy is less affected by channel width and atmospheric downwelling radiance than by the channel center locations and channel noise. Finally, the proposed method is preliminarily applied to actual satellite data from the Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder (AIRS) and the retrieved results are compared with the pixel-aggregated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product. For the study area of Australia, discrepancies between our result and the MODIS LST product appear to be about 1.6 K during the day and 1.0 K at night, indicating that the new channel configuration can be used to retrieve accurate LST from satellite measurements.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Algorithm Over Land Based on the Polarized Characteristics Difference Between Cloudless and Cloud Targets
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate identification of cloud over land is one of the key issues of the satellite data processing and the product retrievals. This paper describes a new cloud detection algorithm based on Level 1 data of Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance. The simulation of multiangular normalized polarized reflectance is done for cloudless targets over land before the cloud identification processing. First, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index over land and reflectance of 670 nm are used as two initial criterions for the cloud mask. Then, the difference between the simulation and Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance observation of polarized reflectance is used as the third criterion to distinguish cloudless pixels from cloud ones. And this algorithm is proved to be more convenient and effective. This algorithm is also applied to cloud mask processing of the Multi-Angular Polarization Imager (onboard the Tiangong-2) observation. The results show that this algorithm can effectively detect cloud targets over land, and its consistency with Polarization and Directionality of Earth's Reflectance official cloud mask products is about 90%. This algorithm can provide reliable cloud mask products for the retrieval of optical and physical properties of land aerosol using Multi-Angular Polarization Imager data.

TI  - Distribution modelling of vegetation types based on area frame survey data
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Many countries lack informative, high-resolution, wall-to-wall vegetation or land cover maps. Such maps are useful for land use and nature management, and for input to regional climate and hydrological models. Land cover maps based on remote sensing data typically lack the required ecological information, whereas traditional field-based mapping is too expensive to be carried out over large areas. In this study, we therefore explore the extent to which distribution modelling (DM) methods are useful for predicting the current distribution of vegetation types (VT) on a national scale. Location Mainland Norway, covering ca. 324,000 km(2). Methods We used presence/absence data for 31 different VTs, mapped wall-to-wall in an area frame survey with 1081 rectangular plots of 0.9 km(2). Distribution models for each VT were obtained by logistic generalised linear modelling, using stepwise forward selection with an F-ratio test. A total of 116 explanatory variables, recorded in 100 m x 100 m grid cells, were used. The 31 models were evaluated by applying the AUC criterion to an independent evaluation dataset. Results Twenty-one of the 31 models had AUC values higher than 0.8. The highest AUC value (0.989) was obtained for Poor/rich broadleaf deciduous forest, whereas the lowest AUC (0.671) was obtained for Lichen and heather spruce forest. Overall, we found that rare VTs are predicted better than common ones, and coastal VTs are predicted better than inland ones. Conclusions Our study establishes DM as a viable tool for spatial prediction of aggregated species-based entities such as VTs on a regional scale and at a fine (100 m) spatial resolution, provided relevant predictor variables are available. We discuss the potential uses of distribution models in utilizing large-scale international vegetation surveys. We also argue that predictions from such models may improve parameterisation of vegetation distribution in earth system models.

TI  - Foraging ecology drives social information reliance in an avian eavesdropping community
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertebrates obtain social information about predation risk by eavesdropping on the alarm calls of sympatric species. In the Holarctic, birds in the family Paridae function as sentinel species; however, factors shaping eavesdroppers' reliance on their alarm calls are unknown. We compared three hypothesized drivers of eavesdropper reliance: (a) foraging ecology, (b) degree of sociality, and (c) call relevance (caller-to-eavesdropper body-size difference). In a rigorous causal-comparative design, we presented Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) alarm calls to 242 individuals of 31 ecologically diverse bird species in Florida forests and recorded presence/absence and type (diving for cover or freezing in place) of response. Playback response was near universal, as individuals responded to 87% of presentations (N = 211). As an exception to this trend, the sit-and-wait flycatcher Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe) represented 48% of the nonresponses. We tested 12 predictor variables representing measures relevant to the three hypothesized drivers, distance to playback speaker, and vulnerability at time of playback (eavesdropper's microhabitat when alarm call is detected). Using model-averaged generalized linear models, we determined that foraging ecology best predicted playback response, with aerial foragers responding less often. Foraging ecology (distance from trunk) and microhabitat occupied during playback (distance to escape cover) best predicted escape behavior type. We encountered a sparsity of sit-and-wait flycatchers (3 spp.), yet their contrasting responses relative to other foraging behaviors clearly identified foraging ecology as a driver of species-specific antipredator escape behavior. Our findings align well with known links between the exceptional visual acuity and other phenotypic traits of flycatchers that allow them to rely more heavily on personal rather than social information while foraging. Our results suggest that foraging ecology drives species-specific antipredator behavior based on the availability and type of escape cover.

TI  - The influence of dynamic environmental interactions on detection efficiency of acoustic transmitters in a large, deep, freshwater lake
T2  - ANIMAL BIOTELEMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAcoustic telemetry is an increasingly common method used to address ecological questions about the movement, behaviour, and survival of freshwater and marine organisms. The variable performance of acoustic telemetry equipment and ability of receivers to detect signals from transmitters have been well studied in marine and coral reef environments to inform study design and improve data interpretation. Despite the growing use of acoustic telemetry in large, deep, freshwater systems, detection efficiency and range, particularly in relation to environmental variation, are poorly understood. We used an array of 90 69-kHz acoustic receivers and 8 sentinel range transmitters of varying power output deployed at different depths and locations approximately 100-9500 m apart for 215 days to evaluate how the detection efficiency of acoustic receivers varied spatially and temporally in relation to environmental conditions.ResultsThe maximum distance that tags were detected ranged from 5.9 to 9.3 km. Shallow tags consistently had lower detection efficiency than deep tags of the same power output and detection efficiency declined through the winter months (December-February) of the study. In addition to the distance between tag and receiver, thermocline strength, surface water velocity, ice thickness, water temperature, depth range between tag and receiver, and number of fish detections contributed to explaining variation in detection efficiency throughout the study period. Furthermore, the most significant models incorporated interactions between several environmental variables and tag-receiver distance, demonstrating the complex temporal and spatial relationships that exist in heterogeneous environments.ConclusionsRelying on individual environmental variables in isolation to interpret receiver performance, and thus animal behaviour, may be erroneous when detection efficiency varies across distances, depths, or tag types. As acoustic telemetry becomes more widely used to study ecology and inform management, it is crucial to understand its limitations in heterogeneous environments, such as freshwater lakes, to improve the quality and interpretation of data. We recommend that in situ range testing and retrospective analysis of detection efficiency be incorporated into study design for telemetry projects. Furthermore, we caution against oversimplifying the dynamic relationship between detection efficiency and environmental conditions for the sake of producing a correction that can be applied directly to detection data of tagged animals when the intended correction may not be justified.

TI  - Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in previously undiagnosed patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims In patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks are sometimes ineffective and may even trigger fatal electrical storms. We assessed the efficacy and complications of ICDs placed in patients with CPVT who presented with a sentinel event of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) while undiagnosed and therefore untreated.Methods and results We analysed 136 patients who presented with SCA and in whom CPVT was diagnosed subsequently, leading to the initiation of guideline-directed therapy, including beta-blockers, flecainide, and/or left cardiac sympathetic denervation. An ICD was implanted in 79 patients (58.1%). The primary outcome of the study was sudden cardiac death (SCD). The secondary outcomes were composite outcomes of SCD, SCA, appropriate ICD shocks, and syncope. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, SCD had occurred in three patients (3.8%) with an ICD and none of the patients without an ICD (P = 0.1). SCD, SCA, or appropriate ICD shocks occurred in 37 patients (46.8%) with an ICD and 9 patients (15.8%) without an ICD (P < 0.0001). Inappropriate ICD shocks occurred in 19 patients (24.7%) and other device-related complications in 22 patients (28.9%).Conclusion In previously undiagnosed patients with CPVT who presented with SCA, an ICD was not associated with improved survival. Instead, the ICD was associated with both a high rate of appropriate ICD shocks and inappropriate ICD shocks along with other device-related complications. Strict adherence to guideline-directed therapy without an ICD may provide adequate protection in these patients without all the potential disadvantages of an ICD.

TI  - Satellite inference of water vapour and above-cloud aerosol combined effect on radiative budget and cloud-top processes in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols have a direct effect on the Earth's radiative budget and can also affect cloud development and lifetime, and the aerosols above clouds (AAC) are particularly associated with high uncertainties in global climate models. Therefore, it is a prerequisite to improve the description and understanding of these situations. During the austral winter, large loadings of biomass burning aerosols originating from fires in the southern African subcontinent are lifted and transported westwards, across the southeastern Atlantic Ocean. The negligible wet scavenging of these absorbing aerosols leads to a near-persistent smoke layer above one of the largest stratocumulus cloud decks on the planet. Therefore, the southeastern Atlantic region is a very important area for studying the impact of above-cloud absorbing aerosols, their radiative forcing and their possible effects on clouds.In this study we aim to analyse and quantify the effect of smoke loadings on cloud properties using a synergy of different remote sensing techniques from A-Train retrievals (methods based on the passive instruments POLDER and MODIS and the operational method of the spaceborne lidar CALIOP), collocated with ERA-Interim re-analysis meteorological profiles. To analyse the possible mechanisms of AAC effects on cloud properties, we developed a high and low aerosol loading approach, which consists in evaluating the change in radiative quantities (i.e. cloud-top cooling, heating rate vertical profiles) and cloud properties with the smoke loading. During this analysis, we account for the variation in the meteorological conditions over our sample area by selecting the months associated with one meteorological regime (June-August).The results show that the region we focus on is primarily under the energetic influence of absorbing aerosols, leading to a significant positive shortwave direct effect at the top of the atmosphere. For larger loads of AACs, clouds are optically thicker, with an increase in liquid water path of 20 g M-2 and lower cloud-top altitudes by 100 m. These results do not contradict the semi-direct effect of above-cloud aerosols, explored in previous studies. Furthermore, we observe a strong covariance between the aerosol and the water vapour loadings, which has to be accounted for. A detailed analysis of the heating rate profiles shows that within the smoke layer, the absorbing aerosols are 90 % responsible for warming the ambient air by approximately 5.7 K d(-1) . The accompanying water vapour, however, has a longwave effect at distance on the cloud top, reducing its cooling by approximately 4.7 K d(-1) (equivalent to 7 %). We infer that this decreased cloud-top cooling in particular, in addition with the higher humidity above the clouds, might modify the cloud-top entrainment rate and its effect, leading to thicker clouds. Therefore, smoke (the combination of aerosol and water vapour) events would have the potential to modify and probably reinforce the underlaying cloud cover.

TI  - The Era of Thromboinflammation: Platelets Are Dynamic Sensors and Effector Cells During Infectious Diseases
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Platelets are anucleate cells produced by megakaryocytes. In recent years, a robust body of literature supports the evolving role of platelets as key sentinel and effector cells in infectious diseases, especially critical in bridging hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune continuums. Upon intravascular pathogen invasion, platelets can directly sense viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections through pattern recognition receptors and integrin receptors or pathogen: immunoglobulin complexes through Fc and complement receptors-although our understanding of these interactions remains incomplete. Constantly scanning for areas of injury or inflammation as they circulate in the vasculature, platelets also indirectly respond to pathogen invasion through interactions with leukocytes and the endothelium. Following antigen recognition, platelets often become activated. Through a diverse repertoire of mechanisms, activated platelets can directly sequester or kill pathogens, or facilitate pathogen clearance by activating macrophages and neutrophils, promoting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, forming platelet aggregates and microthrombi. At times, however, platelet activation may also be injurious to the host, exacerbating inflammation and promoting endothelial damage and thrombosis. There are many gaps in our understandings of the role of platelets in infectious diseases. However, with the emergence of advanced technologies, our knowledge is increasing. In the current review, we mainly discuss these evolving roles of platelets under four different infectious pathogen infections, of which are dengue, malaria, Esterichia coli (E. coli) and staphylococcus aureus S. aureus, highlighting the complex interplay of these processes with hemostatic and thrombotic pathways.

TI  - Development of Surface Drifting Buoys for Fiducial Reference Measurements of Sea-Surface Temperature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the conception and the metrological characterization of a new surface drifting buoy, designed to comply with the requirements of satellite sea-surface temperature (SST) measurement validation and to link, per comparison, these measurements to the SI. The reliability of this comparison is ensured by a High Resolution Sea-Surface Temperature (HRSST) sensor associated with a pressure sensor in a module called MoSens. This module can be calibrated in a laboratory to ensure traceability to the SI with an expanded uncertainty inferior to 0.01 degrees C. This paper estimates the response time of the HRSST sensor based on theoretical considerations and compares the results with measurements carried out in a calibration bath. Once integrated in a number of buoys, the resulting network will contribute to create a fiducial reference measurement (FRM) network. The pressure sensor can be used as an indicator of the sea-state, which is important to consider in order to understand the comparison with satellite data. Two buoy prototypes have been tested at sea during several weeks and compared in situ to reference thermometers, demonstrating their reliability and the trueness of temperature measurements.

TI  - Mapping the functional dimension of vegetation series in the Mediterranean region using multitemporal MODIS data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the structural and functional dimensions of natural vegetation is a critical issue to ensure effective management of biodiversity. While coarse-resolution satellite image time-series have been used extensively to monitor vegetation physiognomies, their potential to describe plant species composition remains understudied. The objective of this study is to assess the potential of annual time-series of MODIS images to discriminate combinations of plant communities, called "vegetation series," and characterize their structural and functional dimensions at the landscape scale. Twelve vegetation series were mapped in a 16 574 ha study area in a Mediterranean context located in Corsica (France). First, the structural dimension of vegetation series was examined using a random forest (RF) model calibrated with a reference field map to (i) measure the importance of each MODIS image in discriminating vegetation series; (ii) quantify the influence of the number of dates on model accuracy; and (iii) map the vegetation series with the optimal subset of MODIS images. Second, the functional dimension of vegetation series was analyzed by ordinating three functional indices through principal component analysis. These indices were the annual sum of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the annual amplitude of NDVI, and the date of maximum NDVI, considered as a proxy for annual primary production, seasonality of carbon fluxes, and vegetation phenology, respectively. Results showed that (i) vegetation series were mapped accurately (median Kappa index 0.70, median overall accuracy 0.76), preferably using images acquired from February to August; (ii) at least 10 MODIS images were required to achieve sufficient accuracy; and (iii) a functional gradient was detected, ranging from high annual net primary production with low seasonality of carbon fluxes and early phenology in Mediterranean vegetation series to low annual net primary production with high seasonality of carbon fluxes and late phenology in alpine vegetation series.

TI  - Low Dose Colonization of Broiler Chickens With ESBL-/AmpC-Producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> in a Seeder-Bird Model Independent of Antimicrobial Selection Pressure
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL-) and AmpC beta-lactamase- (AmpC-) producing Enterobacteriaceae pose a risk for both human and animal health. For livestock, highest prevalences have been reported in broiler chickens, which are therefore considered as a reservoir of multidrug-resistant bacteria. The possibility of transfer to humans either by a close contact to colonized broiler flocks or through contaminated retail meat results in the necessity to develop intervention measures for the entire broiler production chain. In this regard, a basic understanding of the colonization process is mandatory including the determination of the minimal bacterial load leading to a persistent colonization of broiler chickens. Therefore, we conducted a bivalent broiler colonization study close to real farming conditions without applying any antimicrobial selection pressure. ESBL- and AmpC-negative broiler chickens (Ross 308) were co-colonized on their third day of life with two strains: one CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli-ST410 and one CMY-2/mcr-1-positive E. coli-ST10. Colonization was assessed by cloacal swabs over the period of the trial, starting 24 h post inoculation. During the final necropsy, the contents of crop, jejunum, cecum, and colon were quantified for the occurrence of both bacterial strains. To define the minimal oral colonization dosage 10(4) to 10(1) colony forming units (cfu) were orally inoculated to four separately housed broiler groups (each n = 19, all animals inoculated) and a dosage of already 10(1) cfu E. coli led to a persistent colonization of all animals of the group after 3 days. To assure stable colonization, however, a dosage of 10(2) cfu E. coli was chosen for the subsequent seeder-bird trial. In the seeder-bird trial one fifth of the animals (seeder, n = 4) were orally inoculated and kept together with the non-inoculated animals (sentinel, n = 16) to mimic the route of natural infection. After 35 days of trial, all animals were colonized with both E. coli strains. Given the low colonization dosage and the low seeder/sentinel ratio, the rapid spread of ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae in conventional broiler farms currently seems inevitably resulting in an urgent need for the development of intervention strategies to reduce colonization of broilers during production.

TI  - Estimation of coarse dead wood stocks in intact and degraded forests in the Brazilian Amazon using airborne lidar
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coarse dead wood is an important component of forest carbon stocks, but it is rarely measured in Amazon forests and is typically excluded from regional forest carbon budgets. Our study is based on line intercept sampling for fallen coarse dead wood conducted along 103 transects with a total length of 48 km matched with forest inventory plots where standing coarse dead wood was measured in the footprints of larger areas of airborne lidar acquisitions. We developed models to relate lidar metrics and Landsat time series variables to coarse dead wood stocks for intact, logged, burned, or logged and burned forests. Canopy characteristics such as gap area produced significant individual relations for logged forests. For total fallen plus standing coarse dead wood (hereafter defined as total coarse dead wood), the relative root mean square error for models with only lidar metrics ranged from 33% in logged forest to up to 36% in burned forests. The addition of historical information improved model performance slightly for intact forests (31% against 35% relative root mean square error), not justifying the use of a number of disturbance events from historical satellite images (Landsat) with airborne lidar data. Lidar-derived estimates of total coarse dead wood compared favorably with independent ground-based sampling for areas up to several hundred hectares. The relations found between total coarse dead wood and variables quantifying forest structure derived from airborne lidar highlight the opportunity to quantify this important but rarely measured component of forest carbon over large areas in tropical forests.

TI  - Simple and Applicable Method for Estimating Evapotranspiration and Its Components in Arid Regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land evapotranspiration (ET), which involves the exchange of energy and water between the atmosphere and land, is dynamic and affects the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources, a key limiting factor in arid regions. The accurate quantification of ET and its two components, that is, soil evaporation (Es) and vegetation transpiration (Ev), is crucial for managing water resources to ensure sustainable development. However, estimating ET and its components is challenging due to limitations associated with the structure and parameterization of models. The three-temperature (3T) model, which includes limited inputs that are key to the ET process (e.g., net radiation and temperature), is hypothesized to be robust. In conjunction with the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project, this study was performed in a heterogeneous oasis in northwestern China using relatively high-density eddy covariance observations. The mean absolute percent error values of the ET and its components estimated with the 3T model from the field scale (flux observations as model inputs) to large scales (Fluke, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer [ASTER] and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer [MODIS] data as model inputs) range from 9 to 25% over different landscapes. The ET estimates from the simple 3T model contained less bias than those from the Penman-Monteith equation, which requires more model inputs and parameterization. When the components were separated in the 3T model based on high-resolution images, such as Fluke and ASTER, the Ev/ET values were comparable to the isotope-based observations, and the mean absolute percent error values were <10%. With its limited inputs, the 3T model is able to simply and easily estimate ET and its components.

TI  - Epidemiological Survey of Peste des Petits Ruminants in Ethiopia: Cattle as Potential Sentinel for Surveillance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious viral disease of small ruminants; it emerged in countries previously free of the disease following the eradication of rinderpest. PPR is classified by international organizations as the next priority animal disease for global eradication campaign. Assessment of the local situations is the first step in the eradication efforts. The objective of this study was to investigate and compare the seroprevalence of PPR in cattle, sheep, and goats under two livestock production systems in Ethiopia: North Shewa zone of Amhara region represents a highland sedentary life style characterized by mixed livestock-crop production system; Zone Three of Afar region represents a lowland nomadic life style characterized by pastoral livestock production system. N-competitive EUSA PPR test was performed on sera from 2,993 animals >6 months old sampled at watering and grazing points. Multivariable logistic regression models comparing the seropositivity between the two production systems were built by classifying doubtful results as positive, negative, or excluding them from the data. The odds ratio (OR) comparing overall PPR seroprevalence in the sedentary North Shewa Zone compared to the nomadic Zone Three ranged from 19 to 27 (P < 0.001), depending on how doubtful results were classified, which contrasts with what has been reported in the literature. This is not likely to be related solely to vaccination, since seroprevalences in cattle and small ruminants were similarly high or low in the respective zones (0-4% for Zone Three and 20-40% for North Shewa Zone), and cattle were not likely to be vaccinated. The OR of seropositivity for goats compared to cattle ranged from 1.9 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3-2.7; P < 0.001] to 2.2 (95% CI: 1.5-3.1; P < 0.001) when doubtful results were excluded or classified as negative, respectively. When doubtful results were classified as positive, association between seropositivity and animal species was not significant (P > 0.05). Our results suggest to further investigate cattle as sentinel animals for PPR surveillance.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in planning adjuvant therapy for elderly women with low-risk breast cancer
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) guides adjuvant therapy in breast cancer. There is controversy regarding its use in elderly women with low-risk breast cancer. This study aimed to determine whether a positive SLNB in this group affected the decision to offer adjuvant therapy compared with younger patients. This retrospective review included 492 patients, 89 of whom had a positive SLNB. Elderly, node-positive women were significantly less likely to receive chemotherapy than their younger counterparts (P < .0001), suggesting the use of SLNB in the elderly could be rationalized.

TI  - Immunohistochemistry for diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer: a review
T2  - BIOTECHNIC & HISTOCHEMISTRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant tumor and main oncologic cause of mortality in women. Although most diagnosis of breast pathology is accomplished using hematoxylin and eosin stained sections, some cases require immunohistochemistry for proper evaluation. We investigated the latter cases including distinctions between ductal and lobular carcinoma, in situ and invasive carcinoma, typical ductal hyperplasia and atypical ductal hyperplasia/ductal carcinoma in situ, papillary and spindle cell lesion assessment, metastasis evaluation, and assessment of prognostic and therapy markers. E-cadherin is used to differentiate ductal and lobular carcinoma; 34 beta E12, CK8, p120 catenin and beta-catenin also produce consistent results. Myoepithelial cell (MEC) stains are used to evaluate in situ and invasive carcinoma; calponin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain and p63 are sensitive/specific markers. 34 beta E12 and CK5/6 are positive in ductal hyperplasia, which enables its differentiation from atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ. CK 5/6, ER and MEC markers are consistent options for evaluating papillary lesions. Spindle cell lesions can be assessed using beta-catenin, SMA, CD34, p63, CKs and hormone receptors. It is important to differentiate primary carcinomas from metastases; the most commonly used markers to identify breast origin include mammaglobin, GCDFP-15, GATA3 and ER, although none of these is completely sensitive or specific. Immunohistochemistry can be used to evaluate central prognostic and predictive factors including molecular subtypes, HER2, hormone receptors, proliferation markers (Ki-67) and lymph-vascular invasion markers including ERG, CD31, CD34, factor VIII and podoplanin. Owing to the complexity of mammary lesions, diagnosis also depends on each particular situation, evaluation of cytological characteristics revealed by immunochemistry and correlation with histological findings.

TI  - Spectral Signature of the Biosphere: NISTAR Finds It in Our Solar System From the Lagrangian L-1 Point
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - NISTAR, aboard the DSCOVR spacecraft, is one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's energy budget instruments designed to measure the seasonal changes in Earth's total outgoing radiation from a unique vantage point at the Lagrangian L-1 point a million miles from Earth. Global radiation energy balance measurements are important constraints for climate models, but are difficult measurements to quantify. CERES data offer the best current observational constraints, but need extensive modeling to get global energy. NISTAR observes the entire dayside hemisphere of the Earth as a single pixel, splitting the shortwave radiation into broadband visible and near-infrared components (analogous to the narrowband spectral ratios used to define vegetation indices). This spectral partitioning at the 0.7-mu m vegetation red edge offers unique constraints on climate model spectral treatment of cloud and surface albedos. Moreover, NISTAR's unique viewing geometry amounts to observing the Earth as an exoplanet, which opens a new perspective on exoplanet observations.

TI  - Combining pretreatment plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA level and cervical node necrosis improves prognostic stratification in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A cohort study
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of combining pretreatment Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA level and cervical node necrosis (CNN) for patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) receiving intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). A total of 607 incident nonmetastatic NPC patients treated with IMRT +/- chemotherapy were reviewed. Patients were divided into four groups based on EBV DNA level and CNN status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test were applied to compare survival outcomes and the Cox proportional model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Pretreatment EBV DNA level and CNN status were independent prognostic factors. Patients in the low-level EBV DNA group or non-CNN group had significantly better 5-year PFS. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that CNN was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.927, 95% CI: 1.129-3.290, P = .016), PFS (HR = 1.492, 95% CI: 1.005-2.214, P = .047), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR = 1.661, 95% CI: 1.044-2.644, P = .032), but not locoregional relapse-free survival. EBV DNA levels correlated significantly with CNN with a correlation coefficient of .324 (P < .001). Compared with low-level EBV DNA and non-CNN grouping, high-level EBV DNA and CNN grouping had poor PFS. The combined classification was an independent prognostic factor for OS (P < .001), PFS (P = .001), and DMFS (P = .018). Pretreatment plasma EBV DNA level and CNN status both closely correlated with prognosis of NPC patients in the IMRT era. Combined EBV DNA level and CNN status improves risk stratification and prognostic value.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Deformation and Thermal Anomalies at Mount Pagan, Mariana Islands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic islands in remote settings are challenging to study with ground-based instrumentation; nevertheless it is important to define "normal" background activity at these volcanoes because they pose threats to air and sea traffic. A combination of remote sensing methods is critical to adequately characterize volcanic activity, and in this study we present space-based observations of both thermal anomalies and surface deformation at Pagan Island in the Mariana Island Arc. Mt. Pagan produced a large eruption (>0.1 km(3)) in 1981, and recent smaller eruptions (>0.001 km(3)) in 2011 and 2012 that triggered volcanic ash advisories. In this study we examine available Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) from Envisat and ALOS between October 2004 and June 2010 for precursory deformation leading up to the most recent eruptions. Although we do not observe evidence for shallow magma reservoir inflation, we do observe a zone of subsidence of up to -3 cm/yr located on the northern flank likely caused by continuing scoria compaction of 1981 eruptive deposits. CosmoSkyMed InSAR measurements spanning the October 2012 eruption also shows deposit subsidence, but no detectable co-eruptive deflation. We also present remotely-sensed thermal time series from the MODIS and ASTER instruments spanning over a decade. There are two distinct locations of anomalous surface temperatures on the island, which correlate with previously documented, fumarolically active vents at South Pagan and Mt. Pagan. Ultimately, we did not find thermal or deformation precursors for recent eruptive activity, plausibly because the volcano had an open conduit and persistent degassing during this time period. We compare and contrast the efficacy of various sensor types currently available to characterize transient dynamics at small and remote volcanic islands such as Pagan.

AB  - Precise knowledge of the health status of experimental fish is crucial to obtain high scientific and ethical standards in biomedical research. In addition to the use of sentinel fish, the examination of diseased fish is a fundamental part of all health monitoring concepts. PCR assays offer excellent sensitivity and the ability to test a broad variety of pathogenic agents in different sample types. Recently, it was shown that analysis of environmental samples such as water, sludge or detritus from static tanks can complement PCR analysis of fish and is actually more reliable for certain pathogens. In our study, we investigated whether the analysis of filtered water mixed with detritus of tanks including fish showing clinical signs of illness is suitable to complement health monitoring programs in recirculating systems. The obtained data indicate that pathogens such as Pseudoloma neurophilia or Myxidium streisingeri were exclusively or mainly found in fish, while mycobacteria were predominantly present in environmental samples. A combination of both sample types seems to be required for the detection of a broad range of infectious agents in zebrafish colonies using real-time PCR technology.

TI  - Smoke emissions from agricultural fires in Mexico and Central America
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural burning in Mexico and Central America is a common practice to remove crop residues. Characterization of the spatial and temporal distribution of burning emissions is essential to evaluate their environmental impacts. For this reason, smoke emissions from agricultural fires were calculated using two methods: direct and indirect. The direct method calculates the rate of smoke emission by multiplying the smoke emission coefficient by the fire radiative energy (FRE) release rate. The smoke emission coefficient was calculated from satellite measurements of aerosol optical depth and FRE made by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. The indirect method calculates the rate of smoke emissions by using FRE observations from MODIS to parameterize a diurnal fire cycle based on a Gaussian equation for each ecoregion. Fire emission estimates from each of these methods were compared with each other and with the Global Fire Emissions Database, version 4.1. A total of 482,506 and 233,660 fire pixels were detected by MODIS from 2003 to 2014 in Mexico and Central America, respectively. Active fires concentrate in the tropical forests with maximum frequencies from March to May. Agricultural fires account for 40% of total detected burns from 2003 to 2014. Considerable interannual variability is observed, with 2003, 2005, and 2011 the most active years and 2008 and 2014 the least active years. Our calculations show that agricultural smoke emissions estimated by the indirect method are lower than those estimated by the direct method by a factor of 1.4 to 4, depending on the ecoregion, although the total smoke emissions are similar between both methods. Finally, average annual smoke emissions in Mexico are the greatest in tropical humid forests and least in tropical dry forests, whereas in Central America, average annual smoke emissions are very similar for both humid and dry tropical forests.

TI  - Good Workers and Crooked Bosses: The Effect of Voice Suppression by Supervisors on Employees' Populist Attitudes and Voting
T2  - POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is the first to explore the effect of political socialization in the workplace on populist attitudes. We investigate the effect of workplace voice suppression on employees' populist attitudes and voting. We expect employees who were suppressed by supervisors to hold more populist attitudes and to be more likely to vote for a populist party than employees who were not. We argue that some employees experience voice suppression by supervisors as stressful, so splitting is likely to be employed as a defense mechanism. Splitting is achieved through cognitive distinction and antagonism between "the good workers" and "the crooked bosses." Such a split mental framework can generalize into a worldview that contrasts "the pure people" and "the corrupt elite," a core characteristic of populism. We predict that the extent to which suppression triggers splitting and consequentially incites populist attitudes and voting depends on employees' acceptance of power distance. We test our hypotheses using SEM on survey data from 2990 members of the Dutch labor force. Our results show that experiences of voice suppression are positively related to populist attitudes and populist voting. As expected, this effect is stronger for employees who are less accepting of power distance.

TI  - DUACS DT2018: 25 years of reprocessed sea level altimetry products
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - For more than 20 years, the multi-satellite Data Unification and Altimeter Combination System (DUACS) has been providing near-real-time (NRT) and delayed-time (DT) altimetry products. DUACS datasets range from along-track measurements to multi-mission sea level anomaly (SLA) and absolute dynamic topography (ADT) maps. The DUACS DT2018 ensemble of products is the most recent and major release. For this, 25 years of altimeter data have been reprocessed and are available through the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).Several changes were implemented in DT2018 processing in order to improve the product quality. New altimetry standards and geophysical corrections were used, data selection was refined and optimal interpolation (OI) parameters were reviewed for global and regional map generation.This paper describes the extensive assessment of DT2018 reprocessing. The error budget associated with DT2018 products at global and regional scales was defined and improvements on the previous version were quantified (DT2014; Pujol et al., 2016). DT2018 mesoscale errors were estimated using independent and in situ measurements. They have been reduced by nearly 3 % to 4 % for global and regional products compared to DT2014. This reduction is even greater in coastal areas (up to 10 %) where it is directly linked to the geophysical corrections applied to DT2018 processing. The conclusions are very similar concerning geostrophic currents, for which error was globally reduced by around 5 % and as much as 10 % in coastal areas.

TI  - Retrieval of forest canopy height jointly using airborne LiDAR and ALOS PALSAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest canopy height is a very important forest structural attribute. LiDAR and SAR are able to penetrate the forest canopy to obtain information on the understory and canopy vertical structure. But the single data of LiDAR or SAR has its own shortcomings in forest height extraction. We jointly use LiDAR and ALOS PALSAR data to retrieve forest canopy height. First, the extinction degree of the canopy is extracted using airborne LiDAR. The canopy is assumed to be uniform, and the extinction degree is divided by the canopy height to obtain the average extinction coefficient. Then, the extinction coefficient is substituted into random volume over ground (RVoG), and the forest canopy height is obtained. Experimental results showed that the collaborative inversion algorithm based on RVoG model proposed in this paper improves the accuracy of forest canopy height retrieval.

TI  - Estimation of secondary forest parameters by integrating image and point cloud-based metrics acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To better assess spatial variabilities in subtropical secondary forest biomass, the goal of the present study was to employ small-footprint, discrete-return light detection and ranging and unmanned aerial vehicles, integrated with structure from motion (UAV-SFM) data, to accurately estimate the stand characteristic parameters of subtropical forests. The Lorey's height, density, basal area, volume, and aboveground biomass (AGB) of 30 plots (circle divide 10 m) were modeled using an array of SFM point cloud metrics and image color metrics (forestry vegetation coverage and color index set). Further, the individual models developed using stepwise multiregression analysis and a branch-and-bound algorithm were employed to examine the best models. Overall, the results indicated that the coefficient of determination (R-2) for Lorey's height (R-2 = 0.58 to 0.95), volume (R-2 = 0.29 to 0.71), and AGB (R-2 = 0.27 to 0.64) were significantly enhanced compared with the density (R-2 = 0.18 to 0.48), and basal area (R-2 = 0.24 to 0.52) Utilizing independent stand-level data from ground inventory, our results revealed that, overall, the model fit was significant for most stand characteristic parameters, with relationships close to a 1:1 line, thereby indicating no significant bias [relative root mean square error (rRMSE) = 5.32% to 27.04%]. Our image metrics had a statistically significant association with Lorey's height (rRMSE decreased by 0.08%), volume (rRMSE decreased by 0.58%), and AGB (rRMSE decreased by 3.11%), which provided additional explanatory power in the regression analysis. This research demonstrated the potential of UAV-SFM as a technology to accurately assess subtropical forest carbon while providing an improved elucidation of the positive effects of image color metrics.

TI  - All-sky assimilation of infrared radiances sensitive to mid- and upper-tropospheric moisture and cloud
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - All-sky assimilation of infrared (IR) radiances has not yet become operational at any weather forecasting centre, but it promises to bring new observations in sensitive areas and avoid the need for cloud detection. A new all-sky IR configuration gives results comparable to (and in some areas better than) clear-sky assimilation of the same data, meaning that operational implementation is now feasible. The impact of seven upper-tropospheric water vapour (WV) sounding channels from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) is evaluated in both all-sky and clear-sky approaches. All-sky radiative transfer simulations (and the forecast model's cloud fields) are now sufficiently accurate that systematic errors are comparable to those of clear-sky assimilation outside of a few difficult areas such as deep convection. All-sky assimilation brings 65% more data than clear-sky assimilation globally, with the biggest increases in midlatitude storm tracks and tropical convective areas. However, all-sky gives slightly less weight to any one observation than in the clear-sky approach. In the midlatitudes, all-sky and clear-sky assimilation have similarly beneficial impact on mid-and upper-tropospheric dynamical forecast fields. Here the addition of data in cloudy areas is offset by the slightly lower weight given to the observations. But in the tropics, all-sky assimilation is significantly more beneficial than clear-sky assimilation, with improved dynamical short-range forecasts throughout the troposphere and stratosphere.

TI  - Factors that affect the false negative rate of sentinel lymph node mapping with methylene blue dye alone in breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological factors of the false negative rate (FNR) and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) mapping with 1% methylene blue dye (MBD) alone, and to examine how to reduce the FNR in patients with breast cancer. Methods A total of 365 patients with invasive breast carcinoma who received axillary lymph node dissection after SLNB were retrospectively analyzed. SLNB was performed with 2 to 5 mL of 1% MBD. We studied the clinicopathological factors that could affect the FNR of SLNB. Results The identification rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) was 98.3% (359/365) and the FNR of SLNB was 10.4% (16/154). Multivariate analysis showed that the number of dissected SLNs and metastatic lymph nodes were independent predictive factors for the FNR of SLNB. The FNR in patients with 1, 2, 3, and >= 4 SLNs was 23.53%, 15.79%, 3.85%, and 1.79%, respectively. Conclusions SLNB mapping with MBD alone in patients with breast cancer can produce favorable identification rates. The FNR of SLNB decreases as the number of SLNs rises. Because of side effects of searching for additional SLNs and the FNR, removal of three or four SLNs may be appropriate.

TI  - Changing epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in <i>Vibrio cholerae</i>: AMR surveillance findings (2006-2016) from Nepal
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In Nepal, cases of Cholera occur annually either as sporadic or as outbreaks claiming the lives of many in rural areas. The present study is a laboratory based surveillance which aims to analyze the changing epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility trend of V. cholerae strains isolated or referred to National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) over a period of 11 years (2006-2016). Methods Specimens of fresh stool /rectal swab either received at sentinel sites or NPHL were processed following standard microbiological techniques. Suspected colonies on selective medium were identified using routine biochemical tests and confirmed by serotyping. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed following Kirby Baeur disc diffusion method. Results Of the 836 confirmed isolates, 87% (728/836) were V.cholerae O1 Ogawa,12% (103/836) were V.cholerae O1 Inaba and only 6 isolates were V.cholerae O1 Hikojima. In 2006 all the Vibrio isolates were of Inaba serotype, followed by all 3 serotypes during 2007.During 2008-2014 only Ogawa serotype was isolated while few cases of Inaba again surfaced in 2015. Resistance to ampicillin decreased from 93% in 2006 to 18% by 2010 and again raised to 100% by 2016.Cotrimoxazole resistance remained at constant range (77-100%).Nalidixic acid resistance was 100% since 2006.Ciprofloxacin and tetracycline resistance emerged in 2007, reached a peak during 2010-2012 and declined to 0 by 2016.Susceptibility to Furazolidone has re-emerged.63.6% of the isolates were Multi drug resistant. Conclusion With changing epidemiology and antibiogram of V.cholerae in Nepal, the present study reflects the importance of continuous monitoring, which could be used by policy makers and health professionals for better management of outbreaks. Decline in tetracycline and ciprofloxacin resistance along with emerging sensitivity to furazolidone shows that these drugs could make an effective comeback in future.

TI  - GIS-based earthquake-triggered-landslide susceptibility mapping with an integrated weighted index model in Jiuzhaigou region of Sichuan Province, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A M-w = 6.5 earthquake struck the Jiuzhaigou region of Sichuan Province, China, at 21:19 LT on Tuesday, 8 August 2017, and triggered a large number of landslides. For mitigating the damages of earthquake-triggered landslides to individuals and infrastructures of the earthquake-affected region, a comprehensive landslide susceptibility mapping was attempted with an integrated weighted index model by combining the frequency ratio and the analytical hierarchy process approaches under a GIS-based environment in the heavily earthquake-affected Zhangzha town of the Jiuzhaigou region. For this purpose, a total number of 842 earthquake-triggered landslides were visually interpreted and located from Sentinel-2A images acquired before and after the earthquake at first, and then the recognized landslides were randomly split into two groups to establish the earthquake-triggered landslide inventory, among which 80 % of the landslides were used for training the integrated model and the remaining 20 % for validation. Nine landslide controlling factors were considered including slope, aspect, elevation, lithology, distance from faults, distance from rivers, land use-land cover, normalized difference vegetation index and peak ground acceleration. The frequency ratio was utilized to evaluate the contribution of each landslide controlling factor to landslide occurrence, and the analytical hierarchy process was used to analyse the mutual relationship between landslide controlling factors. Finally, the landslide susceptibility map was produced by using weighted overlay analysis. Furthermore, an area under the curve approach was adopted to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the integrated weighted index model, including the degree of model fit and model predictive capability. The results demonstrated the reliability and feasibility of the integrated weighted index model in earthquake-triggered landslide susceptibility mapping at a regional scale. The generated map can help engineers and decision makers assess and mitigate hazards of the earthquake-triggered landslides to individuals and infrastructures of the earthquake-affected region.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To understand the HIV infection status and related factors in men who have sex with men (MSM) in Tianjin during 2016-2018. Methods: According to the sentinel surveillance protocol, continuous cross-sectional studies were conducted to collect the information about the awareness of AIDS, related behaviors, HIV infection, syphilis prevalence and HCV infection in the MSM in Tianjin with the annual sample seize of 400 between April and June during 2016-2018. Results: From 2016 to 2018, a total of 1 200 MSM were surveyed. The condom use rate in anal sex was 45.4% (544/1 198) in the past 6 months. The HIV test rate in MSM recruited through network declined with year (trend chi(2)=42.742, P<0.001). The overall HIV infection rate was 3.3% (40/1 200). The HIV-1 infection rate was 2.6% (95%CI: 1.7%-3.5%). The overall prevalence rate of syphilis was 6.7% (80/1 200). The overall HCV infection rate was 0.8% (9/1 200). Results from multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk factors associated with HIV infection in the MSM included divorced or widowed (compared with unmarried, aOR=7.137, 95%CI: 1.621-31.419) and syphilis positive group (compared with syphilis negative group, aOR=3.684, 95%CI: 1.520-8.932). The protective factors for HIV infection in the MSM included consistent use of condom in the past 6 months (compared with occasional use of condom, aOR=0.343, 95%CI: 0.126-0.932) and HIV test (compared with receiving no HIV test, aOR=0.314, 95%CI: 0.123-0.801). Conclusions: The HIV infection rate in the MSM in Tianjin was high from 2016 to 2018. Syphilis prevalence status in MSM should not be neglected. The rate of consistent condom use in anal sex was low in the MSM. It is necessary to take effective measures to promote condom use and strengthen HIV test in MSM.
AB  - 目的： 了解2016－2018年天津市MSM人群HIV感染状况及其相关因素。 方法： 按照全国艾滋病哨点监测方案要求，采用横断面调查方法，于2016－2018年4－6月，连续监测并收集天津市MSM人群的艾滋病知识知晓率、相关性行为、以及HIV、梅毒、HCV感染等信息，各年样本量400人。 结果： 2016－2018年天津市监测MSM共1 200人，最近6个月同性肛交坚持使用安全套的比例为45.4%（544/1 198），网络招募的MSM既往接受过HIV检测的比例呈现下降的趋势（趋势chi(2)=42.742，P<0.001）。HIV感染率为3.3%（40/1 200），HIV-1新发感染率为2.6%（95%CI：1.7%~3.5%），梅毒感染率为6.7%（80/1 200），HCV感染率为0.8%（9/1 200）。多因素logistic回归分析结果显示，离异或丧偶（与未婚者相比，aOR=7.137，95%CI：1.621~31.419）、梅毒抗体阳性（与梅毒抗体阴性者相比，aOR=3.684，95%CI：1.520~8.932）是MSM人群感染HIV的危险因素；最近6个月同性肛交坚持使用安全套（与不坚持使用安全套者相比，aOR=0.343，95%CI：0.126~0.932）、既往检测过HIV抗体（与既往未检测HIV抗体者相比，aOR=0.314，95%CI：0.123~0.801）是MSM人群感染HIV的保护因素。 结论： 2016－2018年天津市MSM人群的HIV感染率较高，梅毒感染风险不容忽视，同性肛交坚持使用安全套的比例较低，应该采取有效措施促进MSM坚持使用安全套和定期检测HIV抗体。.

TI  - Mary Shelley's 'Romantic Spinozism'
T2  - HISTORY OF EUROPEAN IDEAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mary Shelley (1797-1851) developed a 'Romantic Spinozism' from 1817 to 1848. This was a deterministic worldview that adopted an ethical attitude of love toward the world as it is, must be, and will be. Resisting the psychological despair and political inertia of fatalism, her 'Romantic Spinozism' affirmed the forward-looking responsibility of people to love their neighbors and sustain the world, including future generations, even in the face of seeming apocalypse. This history of Shelley's reception of Spinoza begins with the fragment of the otherwise lost translation of the Theologico-Political Treatise (1670) on which she collaborated. It extends through her journals, letters, poetry, and her second great work of speculative fiction after Frankenstein (1818): a post-apocalyptic novel set in the year 2100, The Last Man (1826). Through a creative synthesis of Spinoza with Plato, Cicero, Wollstonecraft, and Glasite Christianity, Shelley developed an anti-apocalyptic conception of love as apocatastasis: a cyclical restoration of an ethical attitude of stewardship toward the whole world and its necessity. Through this recovery of a vital chapter in the history of European ideas, Shelley emerges as a central figure in Spinozan philosophy, especially the ethics and political philosophy of love.

TI  - Net Community Production and Carbon Exchange From Winter to Summer in the Atlantic Water Inflow to the Arctic Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Fram Strait and area north of Svalbard, are influenced by the inflow of warm Atlantic water, which is high in nutrients and CO2, influencing the carbon flux into the Arctic Ocean. However, these estimates are mainly based on summer data and there is still doubt on the size of the net ocean Arctic CO2 sink. We use data on carbonate chemistry and nutrients from three cruises in 2014 in the CarbonBridge project (January, May, and August) and one in Fram Strait (August). We describe the seasonal variability and the major drivers explaining the inorganic carbon change (C-DIC) in the upper 50 m, such as photosynthesis (C-BIO), and air-sea CO2 exchange (C-EXCH). Remotely sensed data describes the evolution of the bloom and net community production. The focus area encompasses the meltwater-influenced domain (MWD) along the ice edge, the Atlantic water inflow (AWD), and the West Spitsbergen shelf (SD). The C-BIO total was 2.2 mol C m(-2) in the MWD derived from the nitrate consumption between January and May. Between January and August, the C-BIO was 3.0 mol C m(-2) in the AWD, thus C-BIO between May and August was 0.8 mol C m(-2). The ocean in our study area mainly acted as a CO2 sink throughout the period. The mean CO2 sink varied between 0.1 and 2.1 mol C m(-2) in the AWD in August. By the end of August, the AWD acted as a CO2 source of 0.7 mol C m(-2), attributed to vertical mixing of CO2-rich waters and contribution from respiratory CO2 as net community production declined. The oceanic CO2 uptake (C-EXCH) from the atmosphere had an impact on C-DIC between 5 and 36%, which is of similar magnitude as the impact of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3, C-CALC) dissolution of 6-18%. C-CALC was attributed to be caused by a combination of the sea-ice ikaite dissolution and dissolution of advected CaCO3 shells from the south. Indications of denitrification were observed, associated with sea-ice meltwater and bottom shelf processes. C-BIO played a major role (48-89%) for the impact on C-DIC.

TI  - Integrated positioning algorithm based on GPS/WLAN
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In complex urban environment, GPS signals are susceptible to occlusion and interference; the positioning accuracy will be reduced or even impossible to locate. Today, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) localization technology can effectively supplement the blind spot of GPS signals. However, due to the instability of received signal strength (RSS), the positioning accuracy of WLAN is seriously affected. To solve the aforementioned problems, a GPS/WLAN integrated location algorithm based on particle filter is proposed. In our method, the federated Kalman filter is used to fuse the location information of GPS and WLAN, and then the important sampling function of the particle filter is generated by the fusion result. The updating of the particle weights is accomplished by the results of federated Kalman filter and map information. With the complementary characteristics of GPS and WLAN positioning technology, the experimental results show that our algorithm can effectively improves the coverage rate of GPS and the positioning accuracy of pedestrians in complex urban environment. Compared with GPS and WLAN single system and traditional fusion algorithm, the positioning accuracy of the proposed algorithm is significantly improved.

TI  - Landslides mapped using satellite data in the Western Ghats of India after excess rainfall during August 2018
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Excess rainfall during August 2018 triggered numerous landslides in the Western Ghats region of India covering the states of Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. These landslides caused widespread damage to property, loss of life and adversely affected various land resources. In this article, we present an inventory of landslide prepared from the analysis of multi-temporal high-resolution images acquired before and after the rainfall event from Resourcesat-2, WorldView-2, GF-2, SPOT-6 and 7, Pleiades-1, Kompsat-3 and Sentinel-2 Earth observation satellites. A total of 6970 landslides with a cumulative area of 22.6 sq. km were mapped for this rainfall event. Majority of landslides have occurred in Kerala (5191), followed by Karnataka (993) and Tamil Nadu (606). Landslides are mostly debris slide and debris flow type with entrainment along the channels. Results show that landslides (83.2%) are triggered by very high rainfall. Also, very high rainfall has resulted in 14.9% of landslides even though slopes are moderate, mainly in the Kodagu district of Karnataka.

TI  - Impact of land use and land cover transitions and climate on evapotranspiration in the Lake Naivasha Basin, Kenya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lake Naivasha Basin in Kenya has experienced significant land use cover changes (LUCC) that has been hypothesized to have altered the hydrological regime in recent decades. While it is generally recognized that LUCC will impact evapotranspiration (ET), the precise nature of such impact is not very well understood. This paper describes how land use conversions among grassland and croplands have influenced ET in the Lake Naivasha Basin for the period 2003 to 2012. MODIS data products were used in combination with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data sets to model ET using the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS). The results indicate that conversions from grassland to cropland accounted for increases in ET of up to 12% while conversion from cropland back to grasslands (abandonment) reduced ET by similar to 4%.This suggests that recently cultivated agricultural lands could increase local water demands, while abandonment of the farms could decrease the water loss and eventually increase the water availability. Also, recovery of ET following reconversion from cropland to grassland might be impeded due to delayed recovery of soil properties since parts of the catchment are continuously being transformed with no ample time given for soil recovery. The annual ET over the 10 years shows an estimated decline from 724 mm to 650 mm (10%). This decline is largely explained by a reduction in net radiation, an increase in actual vapour pressure whose net effect also led to decrease in the surface-air temperature difference. These findings suggest that in order to better understand LUCC effects on water resources of Lake Naivasha, it is important to take into account the effect of LUCC and climate because large scale changes of vegetation type from grassland to cropland substantially will increase evapotranspiration with implications on the water balance.

TI  - Occurrence of legacy and emerging organic pollutants in whitemouth croakers from Southeastern Brazil
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The whitemouth croaker (Micropogonias furnieri) is one of the most commercially important species along the Atlantic coast of South America. Moreover, some of its biological traits (long life span, inshore feeding, high trophic position) make this species a suitable sentinel of coastal pollution. Here, we investigated contamination by multiple legacy and emerging organic pollutants, such as brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in whitemouth croakers from two estuaries (Guanabara and Sepetiba Bays) located in industrialized and urbanized areas in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we assessed how biological and ecological features could explain the observed contamination patterns. Regarding brominated flame retardants, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) varied from 7.6 to 879.7 pg g(-1) wet weight (w.w.), with high contribution of tetra-, penta-, hexa- and deca-BDEs. The sum of chlorinated flame retardants (dechlorane-related compounds, Sigma DRC) ranged from <LOD to 41.1 pg g(-1) w.w., mostly represented by Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane Plus (DP). Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs varied from <LOD to 1.7 pg g(-1) w.w., while the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 pg g(-1) w.w. Positive correlations between delta 15N and concentrations of tri-, tetra- and penta-BDEs, as well as Sigma DRC, DP and anti-DP isomers suggested that ecological factors (namely biomagnification along the food web) influence contamination of whitemouth croakers in the estuaries studied. Moreover, the sum of PBDEs (Sigma PBDE), tri- and tetra-BDEs concentrations were negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting that depuration by fishes and/or habitat shift throughout the whitemouth croaker's life cycle might also influence concentrations. Overall, our study emphasized the need for further investigations to help understand the complex patterns of bioaccumulation and biomagnification that seem to exist in Southeastern Brazil.

TI  - Oceanographic habitat and the coral microbiomes of urban-impacted reefs
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are in decline worldwide. In response to this habitat loss, there are efforts to grow, outplant, and restore corals in many regions. The physical oceanographic habitat of corals-such as sea temperature, waves, ocean currents, and available light-is spatially heterogeneous. We therefore hypothesize that outplant location may affect microbiomes, and ultimately, coral health and restoration success. We evaluated the influence of the physical oceanographic habitat on microbes in wild Porites astreoides and Siderastrea siderea. Tissue samples were collected at four Florida reefs in March, June, and September of 2015. We estimated oceanographic conditions from moored instruments, diver observations, remote sensing data, and numerical models. We analyzed microbiomes using amplicon 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing data. We found microbial alpha-diversity negatively correlated with in situ sea temperature (which represented both the annual cycle and upwelling), as well as modeled alongshore currents, in situ sea-level, and modeled tide. Microbial beta-diversity correlated positively with significant wave height and alongshore currents from models, remotely-sensed relative turbidity, and in situ temperature. We found that archaea from the order Marine Group II decrease with increases in significant wave height, suggesting that this taxon may be influenced by waves. Also, during times of high wave activity, the relative abundance of bacteria from the order Flavobacteriales increases, which may be due to resuspension and cross-shelf transport of sediments. We also found that bacteria from the order SAR86 increase in relative abundance with increased temperature, which suggests that this taxon may play a role in the coral microbiome during periods of higher temperature. Overall, we find that physical oceanographic variability correlates with the structure of these coral microbiomes in ways that could be significant to coral health.

TI  - Response Degradation Analysis of Fengyun-3A Medium-Resolution Spectral Imager Based on Intelligent Detection of Invariant Pixels
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - We develop an intelligent method to monitor the long-term instrumental response degradation of the Fengyun-3A (FY-3A) satellite medium-resolution spectral imager (MERSI). This method assesses the instrumental response degradation during the interval between the capturing of two images using an iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD) algorithm to statistically select invariant pixels from the different-temporal satellite images, which arc obtained from the same geographic region. First, the IR-MAD algorithm is used to analyze the invariant pixels from the image scene; subsequently, the orthogonal regression of invariant pixels from two images is conducted to obtain the relative degradation of the sensor during this interval. Next, all the long-term sequence images arc processed in a similar manner and the polynomial fitting is used to obtain the relative degradation curve of the sensor over the entire period of time. Herein, we conduct this procedure using the data of FY-3A/MERSI obtained from north Africa and northwestern China, and compare the obtained results with the instrumental degradation results obtained from other relevant researches. The verification results denote that the proposed method is in good agreement with other methods (the difference is less than 2%). The results obtained in north Africa arc consistent with those obtained in northwestern China (the differences arc less than 1% in majority of the bands), indicating the universality and reproducibility of the proposed method.

TI  - Oceanic Aerosol Loading Derived From MISR's 4.4 km (V23) Aerosol Product
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new version (V23) of the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level 2 (swath-based) aerosol product was publicly released in mid-2018. V23 has seen many updates to the retrieval process, most notably over dark water (DW), which applies over the global oceans and other deep bodies of water. Here the quality of the new MISR DW retrievals is assessed using surface-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN) and island/coastal sites within the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). About 406 MISR/MAN and 11,015 MISR/AERONET collocated observations were identified. Comparison against MAN reveals the unparalleled accuracy of the V23 AOD retrievals: the correlation coefficient is 0.98, the root-mean-square error is 0.041, and the mean bias is -0.002. Aerosol spatial heterogeneity negatively affects comparison statistics against AERONET observations-applying stricter collocation criteria drastically improves agreement between MISR and AERONET. The reported AOD uncertainties realistically represent retrieval errors as they exhibit behavior similar to that of the standard deviation of a Gaussian distribution. Over the 18 years of MISR data analyzed, the global area-weighted average AOD over oceans is 0.103; it becomes 0.151 when the averaging is restricted to locations where MAN observations are available. The AOD uncertainties are generally higher than average in offshore areas dominated by anthropogenic and biomass burning aerosols and lower than average in regions with mineral dust outflows. These results suggest future directions for improving the predefined aerosol mixtures used in the MISR aerosol retrieval look-up tables.

TI  - Modified Radical Mastectomy for Male Breast Cancer
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Unusual setting of medical careBackground: Cancer of the male breast is a rare malignancy comprising less than 1% of all male cancers. The traditional surgical management for male breast cancer is modified radical mastectomy. Other surgical methods such as breast conserving surgery with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy have been used with variable results.Case Report: A 35-year old male presented with a 2x2 cm right breast adenocarcinoma. Modified radical mastectomy for male breast cancer as the traditional surgical operation for this rare malignancy is illustrated with special emphasis on oncologic sound resection.Conclusions: Modified radical mastectomy is the corner stone surgical treatment for male breast cancer even though the breast tissue rudimentary. The recurrence of male breast cancer is less with mastectomy than breast conserving surgery.

TI  - Next-generation ARIA care pathways for rhinitis and asthma: a model for multimorbid chronic diseases
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background In all societies, the burden and cost of allergic and chronic respiratory diseases are increasing rapidly. Most economies are struggling to deliver modern health care effectively. There is a need to support the transformation of the health care system into integrated care with organizational health literacy. Main body As an example for chronic disease care, MASK (Mobile Airways Sentinel NetworK), a new project of the ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) initiative, and POLLAR (Impact of Air POLLution on Asthma and Rhinitis, EIT Health), in collaboration with professional and patient organizations in the field of allergy and airway diseases, are proposing real-life ICPs centred around the patient with rhinitis, and using mHealth to monitor environmental exposure. Three aspects of care pathways are being developed: (i) Patient participation, health literacy and self-care through technology-assisted "patient activation", (ii) Implementation of care pathways by pharmacists and (iii) Next-generation guidelines assessing the recommendations of GRADE guidelines in rhinitis and asthma using real-world evidence (RWE) obtained through mobile technology. The EU and global political agendas are of great importance in supporting the digital transformation of health and care, and MASK has been recognized by DG Sante as a Good Practice in the field of digitally-enabled, integrated, person-centred care. Conclusion In 20 years, ARIA has considerably evolved from the first multimorbidity guideline in respiratory diseases to the digital transformation of health and care with a strong political involvement.

TI  - Factors Regulating the Relationship Between Total and Size-Fractionated Chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in Coastal Waters of the Red Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton biomass and size structure are recognized as key ecological indicators. With the aim to quantify the relationship between these two ecological indicators in tropical waters and understand controlling factors, we analyzed the total chlorophyll-a concentration, a measure of phytoplankton biomass, and its partitioning into three size classes of phytoplankton, using a series of observations collected at coastal sites in the central Red Sea. Over a period of 4 years, measurements of flow cytometry, size-fractionated chlorophyll-a concentration, and physical-chemical variables were collected near Thuwal in Saudi Arabia. We fitted a three-component model to the size-fractionated chlorophyll-a data to quantify the relationship between total chlorophyll and that in three size classes of phytoplankton [pico-(<2 mu m), nano- (2-20 mu m) and micro-phytoplankton (>20 mu m)]. The model has an advantage over other more empirical methods in that its parameters are interpretable, expressed as the maximum chlorophyll-a concentration of small phytoplankton (pico- and combined pico-nanophytoplankton, C-p(m) and C-p,n(m), respectively) and the fractional contribution of these two size classes to total chlorophyll-a as it tends to zero (D-p and D-p,D-n). Residuals between the model and the data (model minus data) were compared with a range of other environmental variables available in the dataset. Residuals in pico- and combined pico-nanophytoplankton fractions of total chlorophyll-a were significantly correlated with water temperature (positively) and picoeukaryote cell number (negatively). We conducted a running fit of the model with increasing temperature and found a negative relationship between temperature and parameters C-p(m) and C-p,n(m) and a positive relationship between temperature and parameters D-p and D-p,D-n. By harnessing the relative red fluorescence of the flow cytometric data, we show that picoeukaryotes, which are higher in cell number in winter (cold) than summer (warm), contain higher chlorophyll per cell than other picophytoplankton and are slightly larger in size, possibly explaining the temperature shift in model parameters, though further evidence is needed to substantiate this finding. Our results emphasize the importance of knowing the water temperature and taxonomic composition of phytoplankton within each size class when understanding their relative contribution to total chlorophyll. Furthermore, our results have implications for the development of algorithms for inferring size-fractionated chlorophyll from satellite data, and for how the partitioning of total chlorophyll into the three size classes may change in a future ocean.

TI  - Homogenous HIV-1 subtype B from the Brazilian Amazon with infrequent diverse BF1 recombinants, subtypes F1 and C among blood donors
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic with increased incidence and AIDS-related mortality has been reported in Northern Brazil from which molecular data are scarce. Also, apparently healthy, adult blood donors, recently diagnosed with HIV-1 represent important sentinel populations for molecular studies. This cross-sectional study describes HIV-1 sub-types in blood donors from three reference public blood centers located in three States in Northern Brazil. HIV-1 pol sequencing (protease/PR, reverse transcriptase/RT) was performed on plasma samples of HIV-1 positive donors from HEMOAM, Manaus, Amazonas (n = 198), HEMERON, Porto Velho, Rondonia (n = 20) and HEMORAIMA, Boa Vista, Roraima (n = 9) collected from 2011-2017. HIV-1 subtypes were identified by REGA, phylogenetic inference; recombinant viruses were characterized by SIMPLOT. Young, single, males predominated, around half was first-time donors. Syphilis co-infection was detected in 17% (39 out of 227), 8% (18 out of 227) was anti-HBc positive. Subtype B represented >= 90% in Amazonas, Rondonia and Roraima, subtype C (3.1%) was found in Amazonas and Rondonia; subtype F1 (0.9%) and BF1 recombinants (5.3%) were only detected in Amazonas. Subtype B sequences from Amazonas (n = 179), Rondonia (n = 18) and Roraima (n = 9) were combined with viral strains representative of the B-PANDEMIC (n = 300) and B-CARIBBEAN/B-CAR (n = 200) lineages. The B-PANDEMIC lineage predominated (78%) although B-CAR lineages were frequent in Roraima (56%) and Amazonas (22%). Subtype C and subtype F1 sequences identified here clustered within Brazilian C-BR and F1(BR) lineages, respectively. Twelve BF1 mosaics showed 11 different recombination profiles: six were singleton unique-recombinant-forms/URFs, one displays a CRF28/29_BF-like recombinant pattern and the remaining four BF1 isolates branched with other Brazilian BF1 viruses previously described and may represent putative new CRF_BF1 from Northern Brazil. Our study shows a highly homogeneous molecular pattern with prevalent subtype B, followed by BF1, and sporadic subtype C and F1 in blood donors from the Northern region. Surveillance studies are important to monitor HIV-1 diversity which can reveal patterns of viral dissemination, especially in a highly endemic, remote and geographically isolated region as Northern Brazil.

TI  - Comparing Discharge Estimates Made via the BAM Algorithm in High-Order Arctic Rivers Derived Solely From Optical CubeSat, Landsat, and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional satellite platforms are limited in their ability to monitor rivers at fine spatial and temporal scales: suffering from unavoidable trade-offs between spatial and temporal resolutions. CubeSat constellations, however, can provide global data at high spatial and temporal resolutions, albeit with reduced spectral information. This study provides a first assessment of using CubeSat data for river discharge estimation in both gauged and ungauged settings. Discharge was estimated for 11 Arctic rivers with sizes ranging from 16 to >1,000 m wide using the Bayesian at-many-stations hydraulic geometry-Manning algorithm (BAM). BAM-at-many-stations hydraulic geometry solves for hydraulic geometry parameters to estimate flow and requires only river widths as input. Widths were retrieved from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data sets and a CubeSat (the Planet company) data set, as well as their fusions. Results show satellite data fusion improves discharge estimation for both large (>100 m wide) and medium (40-100 m wide) rivers by increasing the number of days with a discharge estimation by a factor of 2-6 without reducing accuracy. Narrow rivers (<40 m wide) are too small for Landsat and Sentinel-2 data sets, and their discharge is also not well estimated using CubeSat data alone, likely because the four-band sensor cannot resolve water surfaces accurately enough. BAM technique outperforms space-based rating curves when gauge data are available, and its accuracy is acceptable when no gauge data are present (instead relying on global reanalysis for discharge priors). Ultimately, we conclude that the data fusion presented here is a viable approach toward improving discharge estimates in the Arctic, even in ungauged basins.

TI  - Monitoring forest disturbance using time-series MODIS NDVI in Michoacan, Mexico
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - MODIS-based NDVI time series (2000-2016) was applied to monitor sub-annual forest disturbance in the Mexican state of Michoacan, with an algorithm that decomposes the time-series data into a harmonic function and a trend. To detect change, a moving sum of residuals between the observed and predicted NDVI values was compared with that from the reference period. Magnitude of change was computed by subtracting the predicted NDVI from the observed one. By comparing the detected changes with reference data through visual interpretation, a threshold of |0.05| was established as the magnitude of change for forest disturbance detection. The method detected more forest gain than loss for 2013-2016, a result which is supported by recent findings from the national forest inventory. Forest loss decreases yearly for 2013-2016, and forest gain peaks at 2014 and 2015. We verified the findings with data from the global forest cover change project.

TI  - The distribution of pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> observed with OLCI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present monthly maps and derived statistics to describe the large-area distribution of Sargassum in the equatorial Atlantic, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico, using image data from the OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) on the Sentinel 3a satellite. OLCI has provided image data since October 2016 which can be compared with images produced by MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) in the period 2002 to 2012. Results show a significant and continuing increase of the area covered by pelagic Sargassum, starting from a first expansion into the Caribbean and equatorial Atlantic in 2011. We use results from a global detection scheme based on the MCI (Maximum Chlorophyll Index) derived from MERIS and OLCI and implemented by ESA's Grid Processing on Demand (GPOD) project. The scheme uses the OLCI image data set at the reduced resolution of 1200m to give monthly global composite images at 5km spatial resolution, designed to record location, extent and intensity of intense plankton blooms and floating vegetation. In the present study area, images are dominated by a growing and spreading distribution of pelagic Sargassum, whose origin and annual cycle remain unexplained. The composite images give no indication of similar populations in other parts of the global ocean. Results derived from MERIS and OLCI are consistent with those derived from MODIS and VIIRS.

TI  - A Rare Occurrence of Three Primary Malignancies of the Rectum, Breast, and Kidney in the Same Patient: A Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - An increasing number of patients with multiple primary cancers are encountered due to improved cancer detection, widespread cancer screening, and better cancer treatment. Here, we report such a patient without a family history of malignancies or a known genetic predisposition developing three primary malignancies of the rectum, breast, and kidney. A 63-year-old female who underwent an anterior resection for rectal cancer was detected to have an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level during a routine follow-up, 8 years after the initial surgery. Clinical examination revealed a left breast lump which was confirmed as invasive ductal carcinoma (pT3 pN0 cM0). Imaging and colonoscopy excluded a local recurrence. However, a right renal lesion suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma was detected (pT1a). She underwent left mastectomy with a sentinel lymph node biopsy and a right partial nephrectomy with a curative intent. Postoperatively, CEA levels declined to normal limits. Management of multiple primary malignancies poses a major challenge. A multidisciplinary approach and tailored decision-making for the individual patient help with the optimum outcome.

TI  - Getting more out of interviews. Understanding interviewees' accounts in relation to their frames of orientation
T2  - QUALITATIVE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper contributes to an ongoing debate about the validity of interview data and the ways in which they are interpreted in the 'interview society'. We understand the need for an extensive reliance on interviews and, at the same time, recognise the serious limitations that exist regarding access to the interviewee's worldview, their motivations and orientations. A crucial problem in this regard and the main concern of our paper is how to interpret subjective accounts, such as arguments or everyday theories, interviewees hold about themselves. While ethnomethodologists suggest that the complete authorship for meaning depends on the interview setting, we argue that the interviewee's practices of generating interview content are quite stable across various sequences that allows for a reconstruction of their agency dispositions based on interview transcripts. Taking Mannheim's and Bourdieu's idea of a formative or generative principle as a point of departure, we introduce the most recent variant of the documentary method of interpretation (DMI) that aims at the reconstruction of this principle's manifestation (as an individual's frame of orientation) and helps us then to understand everyday theories, subjective explanations and justifications presented by interviewees.

TI  - Support for women's rights and feminist self-identification as antecedents of attitude toward femvertising
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Existing research demonstrates that consumers prefer advertising that aligns with their values and beliefs but can also be distrustful of claims of corporate social responsibility. The purpose of this paper is to explore consumers' perceptions of femvertising in relation to their worldview. Femvertising is defined as "advertising that employs pro-female talent, messages, and imagery to empower women and girls" (Skey, 2015). Design/methodology/approach A survey of US adults (n = 419) was used to investigate attitudes toward femvertising as they relate to gender, age, support for women's rights, feminist self-identification, political affiliation and trust in advertising. Findings Structural equation modeling revealed several antecedents and consequences of attitude toward femvertising. The findings suggest that women's rights supporters and self-identifying feminists seem highly receptive of femvertising. Originality/value Taken together, the findings clarify how femvertising can be an effective strategy for marketers and how it fits within the current advertising literature.

TI  - Controversies in locoregional management of breast cancer with low volume pN0(i+) and pN1mi nodal disease
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTICANCER THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: The pathologic status of the axillary lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in patients with breast cancer. With the transition from axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with clinically node negative breast cancer, there has been an increase in detection of pN0(i+) breast cancer with isolated tumor cells and pN1mi disease with micrometastatic nodal involvement. The prognostic impact of small volume nodal involvement and the role of locoregional radiotherapy, especially in the era of modern systemic therapy, are unclear. Areas covered: This review examines contemporary data evaluating the prognostic impact of pN0(i+) and pN1mi breast cancer on locoregional recurrence and survival outcomes, then discusses controversies related to the use of adjuvant locoregional radiation therapy in the presence of low volume nodal disease. Relevant papers were identified by searching multiple engines for articles published since 2000. Expert opinion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy without completion ALND is a standard surgical option for patients with pN0(i+) and pN1mi disease. The available evidence does not support routine use of adjuvant locoregional radiation therapy in patients with pN0i+ or pN1mi disease, but locoregional radiotherapy should be considered in the presence of concomitant high-risk features and patient factors.

AB  - Postoperative chyle leak is an exceedingly rare complication following breast and axillary surgery. We present the first described case of chyle leak following breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Management should begin with appropriated conservative measures aimed at reduction of lymph production and flow. Intervention is warranted when conservative strategies fail and include sclerotherapy, lymphangiography, embolization, and surgery. Breast surgeons should be mindful of this potential complication when operating in the axilla and be familiar with its stepwise management.

TI  - Modeling L- and X-band backscattering of wheat and tests over fields of Pampas
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A discrete scattering model and a detailed set of ground measurements are used to simulate the backscattering coefficients of wheat fields during the whole growth cycle. Simulations are carried out at L- and X-band, and at HH, VV, and HV polarizations. Wheat fields are located in Pampas (Argentina), and are characterized by low values of plant density. Simulations show that the backscattering coefficient is driven by variations of soil moisture at L-band, particularly for HH polarization, with low vegetation effects. Conversely, the attenuation of vegetation is dominant in producing variations of backscattering coefficients at X-band, particularly for VV polarization. Simulations are compared against experimental data collected over the same Pampas region, using airborne SARAT SAR at L-band and COSMO-SKYMED at X-band. Assuming a surface height standard deviation in a 0.4-0.7 cm range, the simulations generally agree with experimental data, with an RMSE lower than about 2 dB at L-band and X-band, except a limited number of cases. Discrepancies observed in specific conditions are discussed. Overall, the results indicate that a joint use of L- and X-band has a good potential to monitor both soil moisture and vegetation growth.

TI  - Surface Rupture and Distributed Deformation Revealed by Optical Satellite Imagery: The Intraplate 2016 M<sub>w</sub> 6.0 Petermann Ranges Earthquake, Australia
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution optical satellite imagery is used to quantify vertical surface deformation associated with the intraplate 20 May 2016 M-w 6.0 Petermann Ranges earthquake, Northern Territory, Australia. The 21 +/- 1-km-long NW trending rupture resulted from reverse motion on a northeast dipping fault. Vertical surface offsets of up to 0.7 +/- 0.1m distributed across a 0.5-to-1-km-wide deformation zone are measured using the Iterative Closest Point algorithm to compare preearthquake and postearthquake digital elevation models derived from WorldView imagery. The results are validated by comparison with field-based observations and interferometric synthetic aperture radar. The pattern of surface uplift is consistent with distributed shear above the propagating tip of a reverse fault, leading to both an emergent fault and folding proximal to the rupture. This study demonstrates the potential for quantifying modest (<1 m) vertical deformation on a reverse fault using optical satellite imagery.

TI  - Reduced rate of land subsidence since 2016 in Beijing, China: evidence from Tomo-PSInSAR using RadarSAT-2 and Sentinel-1 datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence associated with groundwater extraction in the city of Beijing, China, has been a problem for decades. Remote sensing has been used extensively in prior studies to monitor subsidence in Beijing. However, given recent changes in precipitation and groundwater management, there is an urgent need to update the subsidence record and to evaluate whether the long-term spatiotemporal patterns of subsidence have changed. This study therefore investigates the recent spatiotemporal patterns of land subsidence in Beijing by tomography-based persistent scatterer interferometry SAR (Tomo-PSInSAR) technology, using 39 RadarSAT-2 images from 2012 to 2015 and 33 Sentinel-1 images from 2016 to May-2018, and drawing upon Geographic Information System (GIS) spatial analysis methods. Vertical ground deformation rates in Beijing were found to range from -176.2 to +12.3 mm year(-1) from 2012 to 2015, but subsequently decreased to -119 to +8 mm year(-1) from 2016 to May 2018. Three spatial scale of subsidences are evident: At the metropolitan regional-scale, the total area of subsidence area is about 1235.2 km(2), and comprises four main subsiding regions, located in the northern and eastern parts of the city. More than 85% of the subsiding area is located between the Fifth and Sixth Ring Roads. At a more local scale, eight main subsidence bowls are characterized by different patterns of subsidence. Some of the subsidence bowls are separated by active faults. Time-series data of the displacement show that the decreasing subsidence rate after 2016 could be due to the 1 m rise in mean groundwater level from the end of 2014 to mid-2018. This change in groundwater level is likely due to an increase in precipitation since 2016, and water transfers, which reached 2.3 x 10(9) m(3) by 2017 from the South-North Water Transfer Project. At the scale of individual infrastructure projects, the Beijing subway, main roads and the Capital Airport all show severe uneven subsidence, which is a cause for concern. To our knowledge, this research is the first study using satellite SAR remote sensing methods to document the change in the land subsidence rate of Beijing. Starting in 2016, the rate notably declined, suggesting that subsidence mitigation strategies are beginning to have an effect.

AB  - This study analyzed the land deformation associated with Mw 6.3 earthquake along Pasni coast, Pakistan. Post-earthquake widespread surface displacements were found using Sentinel-1 data. Pre, Co and Post-seismic images were used to investigate the deformation trends. Before the earthquake, 89.65% of Pasni land mass showed uplifting from 0.0 to 3.0 cm at 1.00 mm/day while 3.0 cm subsidence was noted in 86.36% of the land mass after the earthquake at 2.5 mm/day. However, two weeks after the earthquake, 72.9% Pasni land mass showed uplifting at an unprecedented rate of 3.3 mm/day. The maximum deformation along the Line Of Sight (LOS) direction in co-seismic time was about -4.0 cm. Azimuthal interferogram showed more complex displacement pattern with both negative and positive displacements between +/- 5.0 cm. Pasni is already facing many problems due to increased sea water intrusion under prevailing climatic changes and land deformation due to strong earthquakes.

TI  - Near-Surface Biases in ERA5 Over the Canadian Prairies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We quantify the biases in the diurnal cycle of air temperature in ERA5, using hourly climate station data for four stations in Saskatchewan, Canada. Compared with ERA-Interim, the biases in ERA5 have been greatly reduced, and show no differences with snow cover. We compute fits to the ERA5 mean air temperature biases based on ERA5 effective cloud albedo. They can be used to improve the ERA5 diurnal cycle of air temperature for modeling agricultural processes. Diurnally, ERA5 has a negative wind speed bias, which increases quasi-linearly with wind speed, and is greater in the daytime than at night. We evaluate ERA5 precipitation against the original climate station precipitation data, and a second generation adjusted precipitation dataset by Mekis and Vincent (2011). For the warm season, ERA5 has a high bias of 8 +/- 9% above the Mekis dataset. ERA5 is -22 +/- 7% below the Mekis estimate in winter, suggesting that their correction with snow may be too large. It is likely that the ERA5 precipitation bias is small, which is encouraging for agricultural modeling. Data from a BSRN site near Regina shows that the biases in the downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation estimates in ERA5 are small, and have changed little from ERA-Interim. We show that the annual cycle of the Saskatchewan surface energy and water budgets in ERA5 are realistic. In particular the damping of extremes in summer precipitation by the extraction of soil water is comparable in ERA5 to our earlier observational estimate based on gravity satellite data.

TI  - Aphid cards - Useful model for assessing predation rates or bias prone nonsense?
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Predation on pest organisms is an essential ecosystem function supporting yields in modern agriculture. However, assessing predation rates is intricate, and they can rarely be linked directly to predator densities or functions. We tested whether sentinel prey aphid cards are useful tools to assess predation rates in the field. Therefore, we looked at aphid cards of different sizes on the ground level as well as within the vegetation. Additionally, by trapping ground-dwelling predators, we examined whether obtained predation rates could be linked to predator densities and traits. Predation rates recorded with aphid cards were independent of aphid card size. However, predation rates on the ground level were three times higher than within the vegetation. We found both predatory carabid activity densities as well as community weighted mean body size to be good predictors for predation rates. Predation rates obtained from aphid cards are stable over card type and related to predator assemblages. Aphid cards, therefore, are a useful, efficient method for rapidly assessing the ecosystem function predation. Their use might especially be recommended for assessments on the ground level and when time and resource limitations rule out more elaborate sentinel prey methods using exclosures with living prey animals.

TI  - Method for predicting soil salinity concentrations in croplands based on machine learning and remote sensing techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the potential of machine learning methods for predicting and mapping soil salinity in highly vegetated and slightly salt-affected croplands, a random forest (RF) regression model was constructed based on the measured soil salinity and spectral indices of remote sensing data, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The model was evaluated under different soil salinity conditions and with different resolutions of imagery data (Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS) to compare it with the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. The results indicated that a higher accuracy estimation can be achieved from the RF model under conditions of poor correlations between the soil salinity and the spectral indices in the highly vegetated croplands, with a cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) = 0.86, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.83, and ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) = 2.7; these were better than the MARS model (R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 4.8, and RPD = 1.96). The performance of the MARS model shows sensitivity to the variety of salinity levels. Estimated total salinity maps of Jiashi County were produced using the RF model based on OLI and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for September 2015 and April 2016, respectively. Acceptable mapping accuracy was achieved from the cross validation of the salinity mapping results for September 2015 (R-2 = 0.84 and 0.81 for OLI and MODIS data, respectively) and April 2016 (R-2 = 0.85 and 0.82 for OLI and MODIS data, respectively). The results indicated that the method developed is reliable and accurate for digital soil salinity mapping of slightly and moderately salt-affected croplands.

TI  - Improving Medium-Range Forecasts of Rain-on-Snow Events in Prealpine Areas
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain-on-snow (RoS) events have caused severe floods in mountainous catchments in the recent past. Challenges in forecasting such events are uncertainties in meteorological input variables, the accurate estimation of snow cover and deficits in process understanding during runoff formation. Here, we evaluate the potential of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS) to forecast RoS disposition (i.e., minimum rainfall amounts, initial snow cover, and meltwater contribution) several days ahead. We thereby evaluate forecasts of rain and snowfall with disdrometer observations and show that ensemble-based forecasts have larger potential than the high-resolution forecast of ECMWF IFS. Then, we use ECMWF IFS weather forecasts as input to a conceptual hydrological model, which is calibrated using estimates of snow-covered area (SCA), snow water equivalent (SWE), and discharge observations. We show that the forecast skill of this model chain is reasonably high with respect to SCA and SWE, even several days ahead. However, a number of RoS events are missed in the forecast, mainly due to an underestimation of rainfall amounts. These misses can be reduced by lowering the rainfall amount threshold for the forecast as compared to the analysis, being accompanied by only a moderate increase in false alarm rates. In contrast, the forecast of RoS disposition is found to be less sensitive to thresholds of initial snow cover and meltwater contribution. We conclude that valuable disposition warnings for RoS events can be issued several days ahead, and we illustrate this idea with a case study.

TI  - Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized due to influenza A and B in the south of Europe, 2010-2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza produces annual epidemics that affect 5-15% of the world population. Complications and hospitalizations are more frequent in childhood. This study describes and analyses the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children hospitalized due to confirmed influenza in influenza surveillance sentinel hospitals in Catalonia. Retrospective descriptive study conducted in six influenza seasons (2010-2011 to 2015-2016) in persons aged 0-17 years diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza requiring hospitalization. 291 cases were notified to the health authorities: 79.4% were due to the influenza A virus and 20.6% to the B virus. The most common subtype was H1N1 with 57.6% of cases: 52.6% were male, 56.7% were aged < 2 years, and 24.4% were aged < 1 year. 62.2% of cases had pneumonia, 26.8% acute respiratory distress syndrome and 11.7% bacterial pneumonia. 5.8% of cases were vaccinated and 21.3% required intensive care unit admission, of whom 54.8% were aged < 2 years. There were 3 deaths, all with influenza A infection. Influenza A cases were younger than influenza B cases (OR 3.22; 95% CI: 1.73-6.00). Conclusion: Children aged < 2 years are especially vulnerable to the A H1N1 virus, including those without pre-existing chronic disease. These results are relevant for the planning of vaccination programs to improve maternal and child health.

TI  - A statistical model for predicting PM<sub>2.5</sub> for the western United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A new statistical model for predicting daily ground level fine scale particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at monitoring sites in the western United States was developed and tested operationally during the 2016 and 2017 wildfire seasons. The model is site-specific, using a multiple linear regression schema that relies on the previous day's PM2.5 value, along with fire and smoke related variables from satellite observations. Fire variables include fire radiative power (FRP) and the National Fire Danger Rating System Energy Release Component index. Smoke variables, in addition to ground monitored PM2.5, include aerosol optical depth (AOD) and smoke plume perimeters from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hazard Mapping System. The overall statistical model was inspired by a similar system developed for British Columbia (BC) by the BC Center for Disease Control, but it has been heavily modified and adapted to work in the United States. On average, our statistical model was able to explain 78% of the variance in daily ground level PM2.5. A novel method for implementation of this model as an operational forecast system was also developed and was tested and used during the 2016 and 2017 wildfire seasons. This method focused on producing a continuously-updating prediction that incorporated the latest information available throughout the day, including both updated remote sensing data and real-time PM2.5 observations. The diurnal pattern of performance of this model shows that even a few hours of data early in the morning can substantially improve model performance. Implications: Wildfire smoke events produce significant air quality impacts across the western United States each year impacting millions. We present and evaluate a statistical model for making updating predictions of fine particulate (PM2.5) levels during smoke events. These predictions run hourly and are being used by smoke incident specialists assigned to wildfire operations, and may be of interest to public health officials, air quality regulators, and the public. Predictions based on this model will be available on the web for the 2019 western U.S. wildfire season this summer.

TI  - Waterproof, low-cost, long-battery-life sound trap for surveillance of male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> for rear-and-release mosquito control programmes
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSterile male rear-and-release programmes are of growing interest for controlling Aedes aegypti, including use an incompatible insect technique (IIT) to suppress transmission of dengue, Zika, and other viruses. Under IIT, males infected with Wolbachia are released into the suppression area to induce cytoplasmic incompatibility in uninfected populations. These and similar mosquito-release programmes require cost-effective field surveys of both sexes to optimize the locations, timing, and quantity of releases. Unfortunately, traps that sample male Ae. aegypti effectively are expensive and usually require mains power. Recently, an electronic lure was developed that attracts males using a 484 Hz sinusoidal tone mimicking the female wingbeat frequencies, broadcast in a 120 s on/off cycle. When deployed in commercially available gravid Aedes traps (GATs), the new combination, sound-GAT (SGAT), captures both males and females effectively. Given its success, there is interest in optimizing SGAT to reduce cost and power usage while maximizing catch rates.MethodsOptions considered in this study included use of a smaller, lower-power microcontroller (Tiny) with either the original or a lower-cost speaker (lcS). A 30s on/off cycle was tested in addition to the original 120s cycle to minimize the potential that the longer cycle induced habituation. The original SGAT was compared against other traps incorporating the Tiny-based lures for mosquito capture in a large semi-field cage. The catch rates in waterproofed versions of this trap were then compared with catch rates in standard [BG-Sentinel 2 (BGS 2); Biogents AG, Regensburg, Germany] traps during an IIT field study in the Innisfail region of Queensland, Australia in 2017.ResultsThe system with a low-power microcontroller and low-cost speaker playing a 30s tone (Tiny-lcS-30s) caught the highest proportion of males. The mean proportions of males caught in a semi-field cage were not significantly different among the original design and the four low-power, low-cost versions of the SGAT. During the IIT field study, the waterproofed version of the highest-rated, Tiny-lcS-30s SGAT captured male Ae. aegypti at similar rates as co-located BGS-2 traps.ConclusionsPower- and cost-optimized, waterproofed versions of male Ae. aegypti acoustic lures in GATs are now available for field use in areas with sterile male mosquito rear-and-release programmes.

TI  - Tracking fishing ground parameters in cloudy region using ocean colour and satellite-derived surface flow estimates: A study in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new conceptual framework, based on ocean bio-physical observations from different satellites, has been proposed to track fishing ground parameters to identify Potential Fishing Zones (PFZ) in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). The proposed technique also attempts to provide a short-term forecast based on feature propagation, even under cloudy conditions. The current study has been carried out to understand the link between possible fish catch availability and satellite-derived parameters such as chlorophyll concentration, sea surface temperature, sea-level anomaly, ocean surface currents and wind vectors. Net Ekman transport obtained from the upfront and downfront components of the wind relative to the frontal direction provides valuable information on the forecast of PFZ regions and its possible shift. Comparison of the identified PFZs with limited in situ fish catch data proves that the suggested approach holds the promise in improved monitoring of possible fish catch locations. The study provides a novel approach for the monitoring and short-term forecasting of PFZ even for cloud-contaminated regions by using all possible ocean information from space-based platforms.

TI  - Estimating fractional green vegetation cover of Mongolian grasslands using digital camera images and MODIS satellite vegetation indices
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional green vegetation cover (FVC) is a useful indicator for monitoring grassland status. Satellite imagery with coarse spatial but high temporal resolutions has been preferred to monitor seasonal and inter-annual FVC dynamics in wide geographic area such as Mongolian steppe. However, the coarse spatial resolution can cause a certain uncertainty in the satellite-based FVC estimation, which calls attention to develop a robust statistical test for the relationship between field FVC and satellite-derived vegetation indices. In the arid and semi-arid Mongolian steppe, nadir pointing digital camera images (DCI) were collected and used to produce a FVC dataset to support the evaluation of satellite-based FVC retrievals. An optimal DCI processing method was determined with respect to three color spaces (RGB, HIS, L*a*b*) and six green pixel classification algorithms, from which a country-wide dataset of DCI-FVC was produced and used for evaluating the accuracy of satellite-based FVC estimates from MODIS vegetation indices. We applied three empirical and three semi-empirical MODIS-FVC retrieval models. DCI data were collected from 96 sites across the Mongolian steppe from 2012 to 2014. The histogram algorithm using the hue (H) value of the HIS color space was the optimal DCI method (r(2) = 0.94, percent root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 7.1%). For MODIS-FVC retrievals, semi-empirical Baret model was the best-performing model with the highest r(2) (0.69) and the lowest RMSE (49.7%), while the lowest MB (+1.1%) was found for the regression model with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The high RMSE (>50% or so) is an issue requiring further enhancement of satellite-based FVC retrievals accounting for key plant and soil parameters relevant to the Mongolian steppe and for scale mismatch between sampling and MODIS data.

TI  - A Cell-Penetrating Scorpion Toxin Enables Mode-Specific Modulation of TRPA1 and Pain
T2  - CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - TRPA1 is a chemosensory ion channel that functions as a sentinel for structurally diverse electrophilic irritants. Channel activation occurs through an unusual mechanism involving covalent modification of cysteine residues clustered within an amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Here, we describe a peptidergic scorpion toxin (WaTx) that activates TRPA1 by penetrating the plasma membrane to access the same intracellular site modified by reactive electrophiles. WaTx stabilizes TRPA1 in a biophysically distinct active state characterized by prolonged channel openings and low Ca2+ permeability. Consequently, WaTx elicits acute pain and pain hypersensitivity but fails to trigger efferent release of neuropeptides and neurogenic inflammation typically produced by noxious electrophiles. These findings provide a striking example of convergent evolution whereby chemically disparate animal- and plant-derived irritants target the same key allosteric regulatory site to differentially modulate channel activity. WaTx is a unique pharmacological probe for dissecting TRPA1 function and its contribution to acute and persistent pain.

TI  - Impact of shortened length of stay for delivery on the required bed capacity in maternity services: results from forecast analysis on administrative data
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We examine the implications of reducing the average length of stay (ALOS) for a delivery on the required capacity in terms of service volume and maternity beds in Belgium, using administrative data covering all inpatient stays in Belgian general hospitals over the period 2003-2014. Methods A projection model generates forecasts of all inpatient and day-care services with a time horizon of 2025. It adjusts the observed hospital use in 2014 to the combined effect of three evolutions: the change in population size and composition, the time trend evolution of ALOS, and the time trend evolution of the admission rates. In addition, we develop an alternative scenario to evaluate the impact of an accelerated reduction of ALOS. Results Between 2014 and 2025, we expect the number of deliveries to increase by 4.41%, and the number of stays in maternity services by 3.38%. At the same time, a reduction in ALOS is projected for all types of deliveries. The required capacity for maternity beds will decrease by 17%. In case of an accelerated reduction of the ALOS to reach international standards, this required capacity for maternity beds will decrease by more than 30%. Conclusions Despite an expected increase in the number of deliveries, future hospital capacity in terms of maternity beds can be considerably reduced in Belgium, due to the continuing reduction of ALOS.

TI  - Strict experimental test of macroscopic realism in a light-matter-interfaced system
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW A
M3  - Article
AB  - Macroscopic realism is a classical worldview that a macroscopic system is always determinately in one of the two or more macroscopically distinguishable states available to it and so is never in a superposition of these states. The question of whether there is a fundamental limitation on the possibility to observe quantum phenomena at the macroscopic scale remains unclear. Here we implement a strict and simple protocol to test macroscopic realism in a light-matter-interfaced system. We create a micro-macro entanglement with two macroscopically distinguishable solid-state components and rule out those theories which would deny coherent superpositions of up to 76 atomic excitations shared by 10(10) ions in two separated solids. These results provide a general method to enhance the size of superposition states of atoms by utilizing quantum memory techniques and to push the envelope of macroscopicity at higher levels.

M3  - Article
AB  - The project 'The Norse Perception of the World' is building a digital infrastructure to facilitate interdisciplinary research on medieval worldviews as recorded in East Norse texts. It does so by collecting spatial material, i.e. attestations of place names and other location-based data from medieval vernacular manuscripts, early prints, and runic inscriptions from fictional, non-biblical, and scientific texts dated to before 1530, and providing free access to these spatial references through a tailored back-end MySQL database and an interactive end-user interface with mapping via Leaflet and Leaflet.markercluster. This paper discusses how geocoding can be problematic when applied to pre-modern materials, as the concept of space is a temporal and social variable, especially when dealing with ideas about places abroad. The geospatial visualization employed by the project has no ambition to represent a historically correct worldview as understood by medieval Scandinavians. Rather, it is an anachronistic tool for managing and obtaining an overview of the spatial references in East Norse texts.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation in surface velocity in Chandra basin glacier between 1999 and 2017 using Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier surface velocity is one of the main parameters of the glaciers used to interpret the glacier dynamics. In the present research paper, surface velocity of four glaciers, namely Bara Shigri, Chhota Shigri, Gepang Gath and Hamtah in Chandra basin between 1999 and 2017 during two time spans of 1999-2002 and 2013-2017, is estimated to analyze spatiotemporal characteristics of surface velocity of these glaciers using a cross-correlation algorithm applied on panchromatic images of Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors. A decrease of similar to 34% and similar to 33% in average annual surface velocity is observed during 2013-2017 in comparison with the average annual surface velocity during 1999-2002 for Bara Shigri and Hamtah glaciers mainly due to lowering of glacier surface. However, Gepang Gath has shown a very low reduction of similar to 3% during the same period due to the presence of proglacial lake in its terminus. The analysis of transverse velocity profile of all the four glaciers is also carried out to determine the dominant factor responsible for glacier movement.

TI  - Investigation of slope instabilities in NW Bhutan as derived from systematic DInSAR analyses
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we present a methodology based on remote sensing data to map and classify unstable slopes in high alpine areas and apply this methodology to the Himalaya of northwestern Bhutan. We leverage on radar images acquired by the ESA Envisat and the JAXA ALOS-1 satellites between 2007 and 2011. Synthetic aperture radar differential interferometry (DInSAR) is used to identify and quantify recent ground surface displacements associated with potentially unstable slopes. Optical satellite images and a high-resolution digital surface model is used for the geomorphological classification of individual landforms and deposits associated with displacements. The analysis of the geomorphological characteristics reveals that displacements are associated with: rock slides, mountain slope deformation and rock slope deformation (77.5%), soil creep (4%), soil slides (1.9%) and rock glaciers (12.3%); 4.3% of the detected displacements remain of unknown origin. The method applied here for the assessment of activity likelihood uses a very large number of interferograms obtained with images acquired by different satellites. The method, which is new and replicable, takes advantage of the combination of different acquisition geometries and then combines indices of vegetation cover, layover, velocity estimate and temporal sampling associated with each detected active area to assign a weight. The analysis shows that a cluster of unstable slopes exists in the northwest, potentially related to the presence of an important regional lineament and the distribution of permafrost. Comparatively little ongoing activity is detected in the south, but field validation documents substantial landslide activity in the recent geological past. The dataset here generated, containing 700 potentially unstable areas with an associated activity likelihood, is a novel dataset that makes an essential basis of future analysis to investigate rock slope instability distribution and predisposing factors. Moreover, this dataset represents a new important step towards future landslide hazard assessment in the Himalaya of Bhutan.

TI  - The State of Remote Sensing Capabilities of Cascading Hazards Over High Mountain Asia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cascading hazard processes refer to a primary trigger such as heavy rainfall, seismic activity, or snow melt, followed by a chain or web of consequences that can cause subsequent hazards influenced by a complex array of preconditions and vulnerabilities. These interact in multiple ways and can have tremendous impacts on populations proximate to or downstream of these initial triggers. High Mountain Asia (HMA) is extremely vulnerable to cascading hazard processes given the tectonic, geomorphologic, and climatic setting of the region, particularly as it relates to glacial lakes. Given the limitations of in situ surveys in steep and often inaccessible terrain, remote sensing data are a valuable resource for better understanding and quantifying these processes. The present work provides a survey of cascading hazard processes impacting HMA and how these can be characterized using remote sensing sources. We discuss how remote sensing products can be used to address these process chains, citing several examples of cascading hazard scenarios across HMA. This work also provides a perspective on the current gaps and challenges, community needs, and view forward toward improved characterization of evolving hazards and risk across HMA.

TI  - Chemical and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols in Nanjing, eastern China: regionally transported biomass burning contribution
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning can significantly impact the chemical and optical properties of carbonaceous aerosols. Here, the biomass burning impacts were studied during wintertime in a megacity of Nanjing, eastern China. The high abundance of biomass burning tracers such as levoglucosan (lev), mannosan (man), galactosan (gal) and non-sea-salt potassium (nss-K+) was found during the studied period with the concentration ranges of 22.4-1476 ng m(-3), 2.1-56.2 ng m(-3), 1.4-32.2 ng m(-3) and 0.2-3.8 mu g m(-3), respectively. The significant contribution of biomass burning to water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC; 22.3 +/- 9.9 %) and organic carbon (OC; 20.9 +/- 9.3 %) was observed in this study. Backward air mass origin analysis, potential emission sensitivity of elemental carbon (EC) and MODIS fire spot information indicated that the elevations of the carbonaceous aerosols were due to the transported biomass-burning aerosols from southeastern China. The characteristic mass ratio maps of lev/man and lev/nss-K+ suggested that the biomass fuels were mainly crop residuals. Furthermore, the strong correlation (p < 0.01) between biomass burning tracers (such as lev) and light absorption coefficient (babs) for water-soluble brown carbon (BrC) revealed that biomass burning emissions played a significant role in the light-absorption properties of carbonaceous aerosols. The solar energy absorption due to water-soluble brown carbon and EC was estimated by a calculation based on measured light-absorbing parameters and a simulation based on a radiative transfer model (RRTMG_SW). The solar energy absorption of water-soluble BrC in short wavelengths (300-400 nm) was 0.8 +/- 0.4 (0.2-2.3) W m(-2) (figures in parentheses represent the variation range of each parameter) from the calculation and 1.2 +/- 0.5 (0.3-1.9) W m(-2) from the RRTMG_SW model. The absorption capacity of water-soluble BrC accounted for about 20 %-30 % of the total absorption of EC aerosols. The solar energy absorption of water-soluble BrC due to biomass burning was estimated as 0.2 +/- 0.1 (0.0-0.9) W m(-2), considering the biomass burning contribution to carbonaceous aerosols. Potential source contribution function model simulations showed that the solar energy absorption induced by water-soluble BrC and EC aerosols was mostly due to the regionally transported carbonaceous aerosols from source regions such as southeastern China. Our results illustrate the importance of the absorbing water-soluble brown carbon aerosols in trapping additional solar energy in the low-level atmosphere, heating the surface and inhibiting the energy from escaping the atmosphere.

TI  - Surface displacements of the Heifangtai terrace in Northwest China measured by X and C-band InSAR observations
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heifangtai terrace located in Yongjing County of Gansu Province in northwest China is characterized by a large number of landslides with frequent failure events related to agricultural irrigation activities. Thus, it is a task of great importance to identify and monitor the active loess slopes and sort out the impact factors. In this study, we employed the time series InSAR method to map the active slopes in the Heifangtai terrace with two TerraSAR-X data stacks covering the year of 2016 and two Sentinel-1 data stacks from 2016 to 2018. The detected active spots are mainly distributed along the edges of the terrace. Time series displacements derived from TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1 observations were validated by comparisons against GPS and crack gauge measurements. Good agreement between InSAR and GPS was achieved at slow moving locations, while unwrapping errors induced by sudden accelerations make InSAR underestimate the pre-failure displacements with respect to GPS measurements. The trends of InSAR-measured displacement and crack gauge measurements also match well with correlation higher than 0.75. InSAR-measured displacements at the Jiaojia landslide group were highly correlated with the bury of groundwater record, which suggested that the rising of groundwater level may seriously decrease the stability of loess slopes.

TI  - GIS-based logistic regression for rainfall-induced landslide susceptibility mapping under different grid sizes in Yueqing, Southeastern China
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The logistic regression (LR) method was applied to assess landslide susceptibility in the northern Yueqing of Zhejiang Province, China. An inventory map of 323 landslides, digital elevation models (DEMs), remote sensing images, geological map, roads and rivers were collected and utilized in the analysis.' LR models using partially continuous (LR-CON) and all categorized variables (LR-CAT) were carried out under different grid sizes of 5 m, 15 m and 30 m to investigate the influence of variable type and grid size on landslide susceptibility assessment. Ten different subsets of positive (landslide) and negative (non-landslide) cases were prepared for each kind of LR models. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curves were employed to evaluate the performance of the LR models while cross-validation was used to validate the effectiveness of susceptibility maps. The models with and without the rainfall factor were also compared. Among the three grid sizes, the result of 15 m shows the best performance with mean AUC (the area under a ROC curve) of 82.6%. The AUC values of LR-CON models with different grid sizes all demonstrated acceptable fit (0.7 < mean AUC < 0.8) while those of LR-CAT models showed an excellent fit (mean AUC > 0.8), indicating that LR method has a better performance when using all categorical variables than using partially continuous variables. Random sampling is an adoptable method to generate training group and there is no significant difference of AUC values among different data subsets. The results also showed that the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility models is higher when rainfall is included in the analyses.

TI  - Predicting Fine-Scale Daily NO<sub>2</sub> for 2005-2016 Incorporating OMI Satellite Data Across Switzerland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) remains an important traffic-related pollutant associated with both short- and long-term health effects. We aim to model daily average NO2 concentrations in Switzerland in a multistage framework with mixed-effect and random forest models to respectively downscale satellite measurements and incorporate local sources. Spatial and temporal predictor variables include data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, land use, and meteorological variables. We derived robust models explaining similar to 58% (R-2 range, 0.56-0.64) of the variation in measured NO2 concentrations using mixed-effect models at a 1 X 1 km resolution. The random forest models explained similar to 73% (R-2 range, 0.70-0.75) of the overall variation in the residuals at a 100 x 100 m resolution. This is one of the first studies showing the potential of using earth observation data to develop robust models with fine-scale spatial (100 x 100 m) and temporal (daily) variation of NO2 across Switzerland from 2005 to 2016. The novelty of this study is in demonstrating that methods originally developed for particulate matter can also successfully be applied to NO2. The predicted NO2 concentrations will be made available to facilitate health research in Switzerland.

TI  - Mapping the suitability of groundwater-dependent vegetation in a semi-arid Mediterranean area
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the suitability of groundwater-dependent vegetation in semi-arid Mediterranean areas is fundamental for the sustainable management of groundwater resources and groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) under the risks of climate change scenarios. For the present study the distribution of deep-rooted woody species in southern Portugal was modeled using climatic, hydrological and topographic environmental variables. To do so, Quercus suber, Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea were used as proxy species to represent the groundwater-dependent vegetation (GDV). Model fitting was performed between the proxy species Kernel density and the selected environmental predictors using (1) a simple linear model and (2) a geographically weighted regression (GWR) to account for autocorrelation of the spatial data and residuals. When comparing the results of both models, the GWR modeling results showed improved goodness of fit as opposed to the simple linear model. Climatic indices were the main drivers of GDV density, followed by a much lower influence by groundwater depth, drainage density and slope. Groundwater depth did not appear to be as pertinent in the model as initially expected, accounting only for about 7% of the total variation compared to 88% for climate drivers.The relative proportion of model predictor coefficients was used as weighting factors for multicriteria analysis to create a suitability map for the GDV in southern Portugal showing where the vegetation most likely relies on groundwater to cope with aridity. A validation of the resulting map was performed using independent data of the normalized difference water index (NDWI), a satellite-derived vegetation in-dex. June, July and August of 2005 NDWI anomalies, for the years 1999-2009, were calculated to assess the response of active woody species in the region after an extreme drought. The results from the NDWI anomalies provided an overall good agreement with the suitability to host GDV. The model was considered to be reliable for predicting the distribution of the studied vegetation.The methodology developed to map GDVs will allow for the prediction of the evolution of the distribution of GDV according to climate change and aid stakeholder decision-making concerning priority areas of water resource management.

TI  - The Value of Near Real-Time Earth Observations for Improved Flood Disaster Response
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Information is a critical resource in disaster response scenarios. Data regarding the geographic extent, severity, and socioeconomic impacts of a disaster event can help guide emergency responders and relief operations, particularly when delivered within hours of data acquisition. Information from remote observations provides a valuable tool for assessing conditions "on the ground" more quickly and efficiently. Here, we evaluate the social value of a near real-time flood impact system using a disaster response case study, and quantify the Value of Information (VOI) of satellite-based observations for rapid response using a hypothetical flooding disaster in Bangkok, Thailand. MODIS imagery from NASA's Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) system is used to produce operational estimates of inundation depths and economic damages. These rapid Earth observations are coupled with a decision-analytical model to inform decisions on emergency vehicle routing. Emergency response times from vehicles routed using flood damage data are compared with baseline routes without the benefit of advance information on road conditions. Our results illustrate how the application of near real-time Earth observations can improve the response time and reduce potential encounters with flood hazards when compared with baseline routing strategies. Results indicate a potential significant economic benefit (i.e., millions of dollars) from applying near real-time Earth observations for improved flood disaster response and management.

TI  - Applying the principles of adaptive governance to bushfire management: a case study from the South West of Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Bushfires are a global climate change challenge and a critical disaster issue for Australia. Adaptive governance has emerged as a model to address socio-ecological issues such as disasters. This paper discusses four principles of adaptive governance: polycentric institutions, collaboration, social learning, and reflexivity and examines how these are reflected in the policy and practice of bushfire management in the South West of Australia. Findings demonstrate that current disaster policy discourse, which influences bushfire management, increasingly advocates for principles associated with adaptive governance. However, a case study on the Shire of Augusta-Margaret River found that the extent to which these principles translate into bushfire management practice is largely influenced by interpretive worldview policy frames. The paper suggests that governance for bushfire management could become more adaptive in its approach by incorporating more collaborative management activities, deliberative policy processes and reflexive practice.

TI  - Mapping Rice Paddies in Complex Landscapes with Convolutional Neural Networks and Phenological Metrics
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice mapping with remote sensing imagery provides an alternative means for estimating crop-yield and performing land management due to the large geographical coverage and low cost of remotely sensed data. Rice mapping in Southern China, however, is very difficult as rice paddies are patchy and fragmented, reflecting the undulating and varied topography. In addition, abandoned lands widely exist in Southern China due to rapid urbanization. Abandoned lands are easily confused with paddy fields, thereby degrading the classification accuracy of rice paddies in such complex landscape regions. To address this problem, the present study proposes an innovative method for rice mapping through combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) model and a decision tree (DT) method with phenological metrics. First, a pre-trained LeNet-5 Model using the UC Merced Dataset was developed to classify the cropland class from other land cover types, i.e. built-up, rivers, forests. Then, paddy rice field was separated from abandoned land in the cropland class using a DT model with phenological metrics derived from the time-series data of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The accuracy of the proposed classification methods was compared with three other classification techniques, namely, back propagation neural network (BPNN), original CNN, pre-trained CNN applied to HJ-1 A/B charge-coupled device (CCD) images of Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Results suggest that the proposed method achieved an overall accuracy of 93.56%, much higher than those of other methods. This indicates that the proposed method can efficiently accommodate the challenges of rice mapping in regions with complex landscapes.

TI  - Climate-Triggered Insect Defoliators and Forest Fires Using Multitemporal Landsat and TerraClimate Data in NE Iran: An Application of GEOBIA TreeNet and Panel Data Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing the number of studies for mapping remote sensing insect-induced forest infestations, applying novel approaches for mapping and identifying its triggers are still developing. This study was accomplished to test the performance of Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) TreeNet for discerning insect-infested forests induced by defoliators from healthy forests using Landsat 8 OLI and ancillary data in the broadleaved mixed Hyrcanian forests. Moreover, it has studied mutual associations between the intensity of forest defoliation and the severity of forest fires under TerraClimate-derived climate hazards by analyzing panel data models within the TreeNet-derived insect-infested forest objects. The TreeNet optimal performance was obtained after building 333 trees with a sensitivity of 93.7% for detecting insect-infested objects with the contribution of the top 22 influential variables from 95 input object features. Accordingly, top image-derived features were the mean of the second principal component (PC2), the mean of the red channel derived from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), and the mean values of the normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the global environment monitoring index (GEMI). However, tree species type has been considered as the second rank for discriminating forest-infested objects from non-forest-infested objects. The panel data models using random effects indicated that the intensity of maximum temperatures of the current and previous years, the drought and soil-moisture deficiency of the current year, and the severity of forest fires of the previous year could significantly trigger the insect outbreaks. However, maximum temperatures were the only significant triggers of forest fires. This research proposes testing the combination of object features of Landsat 8 OLI with other data for monitoring near-real-time defoliation and pathogens in forests.

TI  - Increasing the profitability of propolis production in honey bee colonies by utilizing remote sensing techniques to spot locations of trees as potential sources of resin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Propolis is produced by honey bees utilizing resins from different plants especially trees. Propolis is incorporated in many industries and has many medicinal uses, and is also considered among valuable products from honey bee colonies. Beekeepers can produce propolis from their colonies after the end of honey seasons. Locations containing high numbers of trees are very suitable for propolis production by honey bee colonies. Searching for suitable locations to obtain high amounts of propolis from bee colonies is very crucial especially when no forests are available as in Egypt. In this study, geographical information system (GIS) and Landsat satellite images were utilized to identify potential locations for propolis production in the study area (Kafr Al-Shiekh Governorate, Egypt). The analysis depended on unsupervised and supervised image classification followed by using spatial analyst tools. Real images were used to verify the correctness of the classified locations. It is possible to predict the potential locations for propolis production using remote sensing to increase the profitability from honey bee colonies.

TI  - Rationale, historical developments and advances in remote sensing of gas flares
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Gas flaring is one of the key processes used in major oil-producing countries to dispose of associated gas at oil production sites, processing plants, or refineries. It is a controversial process, which has raised global concerns, thus, generating research interests globally. Difficulties encountered in accessing official information on gas flaring prompted the development of alternative techniques for deriving vital flaring information from space. This review paper discussed the underlying principles of remote sensing of gas flares. In addition, historical developments in satellite flaring studies with various satellite imageries (AVHRR, DMSP-OLS, ATSR, Landsat, MODIS, Soumi-VIIRS and Sentinel-3 SLSTR) and recent advances were discussed. Advantages and limitations of the various techniques, as well as future directions and applications, were discussed to stimulate further research into this relatively nascent area of study.

TI  - Delineation and mapping of coal mine fire using remote sensing data - a review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Various countries around the globe face numerous hazards due to the burning of coal on the surface as well as below ground. Countries like China, India, United States of America (USA), Australia, Indonesia, and many other countries have reported the burning of coal fires, and thus it is the urgent need to control the coal fire propagation to prevent the loss of energy resources. Coal is a fossil fuel that has a tendency to catch fire for many reasons; spontaneous combustion being the most frequent reasons for its burning. Other factors leading to coal fire include forest fires close to coal seams, natural hazards, old mining techniques, and external heat sources. The review work demonstrates the application of various satellite data in fire detection and mapping. The literature reveals that remote sensing plays an important role in facilitating quick and complete delineation of coal mine fires. Many algorithms have been developed around the world for fire detection from different satellite data. A comprehensive demonstration of different algorithms along with their merits and demerits are outlined. Comparative performances of the different algorithms with their case studies are also explained. It can be inferred from the various literature that it is very difficult to select a particular sensor algorithm for generating global fire products. Suggestions are given to further explore the possibility of improvement of fire detection algorithms.

TI  - Slow? plus ?Fashion ? Women?s Wisdom
T2  - FASHION PRACTICE-THE JOURNAL OF DESIGN CREATIVE PROCESS & THE FASHION INDUSTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Building on ideas I first published in 2008 as, ?Slow + Fashion - An Oxymoron or a Promise for the Future???, this paper brings new insights to the value of a slow approach to fashion. The cases explored for that research indicated the significant role of women practitioners. As a consequence, further investigation and thinking leads me to propose here a development of the slow + fashion discourse that respects and is informed by feminine strategies and values, or what I am choosing to call women's wisdom. In this paper, the work of women thinkers, scholars and design professionals is discussed to explore the potential of developing further the ?+? of slow + fashion and to draw from and value the long-established existence of beliefs and methods common to women that can also pre-date and transcend capitalism, modernity, and Eurocentricity, and which are not formed on the basis of patriarchy. Attention is drawn to everyday values, history, sensory studies, micro-phenomenology, and fashion design practices that indicate the potential for a system change in fashion. Implicit is a shift in worldview to challenge the fashion status quo, and to introduce different economic logic, business models, values and processes than those that currently dominate the fashion system. The paper demonstrates that models already exist in theories and practices which have been devised and applied by women. It concludes that women's wisdom added to a slow + fashion can contribute to establishing much needed sets of principles to move us forward and change perspectives.

TI  - Ultra-Orthodox women pursuing higher education: motivations and challenges
T2  - STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Highly religious students from fundamentalist or sectarian religious communities face unique challenges in pursuing higher education, directly bearing on their educational opportunities. This study reports findings on ultra-Orthodox Jewish female students in Israel, a group which only recently began pursuing higher education. Using a mixed-methods design, we surveyed 469 students and conducted in-depth interviews with 61 additional students in order to explore their motivations, concerns and challenges in pursuing higher education. The interviews elicited narratives of a 'Heroine's Journey' format, indicating that for many of these women, entering college is perceived as a transformative series of trials. Challenges and management techniques were identified, primarily concerning value and worldview conflicts. A k-means cluster analysis of the survey revealed five distinct profiles of students (practical, driven, anxious, self-realizers and conventional) with differential demographic characteristics. We analyze these results as reflecting 'multiple traditionalities' and discuss their implications for supporting highly religious students in higher education.

TI  - Advances in active fire detection using a multi-temporal method for next-generation geostationary satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A vital component of fire detection from remote sensors is the accurate estimation of the background temperature of an area in fire's absence, assisting in identification and attribution of fire activity. New geostationary sensors increase the data available to describe background temperature in the temporal domain. Broad area methods to extract the expected diurnal cycle of a pixel using this temporally rich data have shown potential for use in fire detection. This paper describes an application of a method for priming diurnal temperature fitting of imagery from the Advanced Himawari Imager. The BAT method is used to provide training data for temperature fitting of target pixels, to which thresholds are applied to detect thermal anomalies in 4 mu m imagery over part of Australia. Results show the method detects positive thermal anomalies with respect to the diurnal model in up to 99% of cases where fires are also detected by Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellite active fire products. In absence of LEO active fire detection, but where a burned area product recorded fire-induced change, this method also detected anomalous activity in up to 75% of cases. Potential improvements in detection time of up to 6 h over LEO products are also demonstrated.

TI  - Crop Water Content of Winter Wheat Revealed with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to efficiently estimate the crop water content of winter wheat using high spatial and temporal resolution satellite-based imagery. Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data collected by the Sentinel-1 satellite and optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite was used to create inversion models for winter wheat crop water content, respectively. In the Sentinel-1 approach, several enhanced radar indices were constructed by Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient of imagery, and selected the one that was most sensitive to soil water content as the input parameter of a water cloud model. Finally, a water content inversion model for winter wheat crop was established. In the Sentinel-2 approach, the gray relational analysis was used for several optical vegetation indices constructed by Sentinel-2 spectral feature of imagery, and three vegetation indices were selected for multiple linear regression modeling to retrieve the wheat crop water content. 58 ground samples were utilized in modeling and verification. The water content inversion model based on Sentinel-2 optical images exhibited higher verification accuracy (R = 0.632, RMSE = 0.021 and nRMSE = 19.65%) than the inversion model based on Sentinel-1 SAR (R = 0.433, RMSE = 0.026 and nRMSE = 21.24%). This study provides a reference for estimating the water content of wheat crops using data from the Sentinel series of satellites.

TI  - Investigating the Current and Future Co-Occurrence of <i>Ambrosia artemisiifolia</i> and <i>Ophraella communa</i> in Europe through Ecological Modelling and Remote Sensing Data Analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The common ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia has spread throughout Europe since the 1800s, infesting croplands and causing severe allergic reactions. Recently, the ragweed leaf beetle Ophraella communa was found in Italy and Switzerland; considering that it feeds primarily on A. artemisiifolia in its invaded ranges, some projects started biological control of this invasive plant through the adventive beetle. In this context of a 'double' invasion, we assessed the influence of climate change on the spread of these alien species through ecological niche modelling. Considering that A. artemisiifolia mainly lives in agricultural and urbanized areas, we refined the models using satellite remote-sensing data; we also assessed the co-occurrence of the two species in these patches. A. artemisiifolia is predicted to expand more than O. communa in the future, with the medium and high classes of suitability of the former increasing more than the latter, resulting in lower efficacy for O. communa to potentially control A. artemisiifolia in agricultural and urbanized patches. Although a future assessment was performed through the 2018 land-cover data, the predictions we propose are intended to be a starting point for future assessments, considering that the possibility of a shrinkage of target patches is unlikely to occur.

AB  - The paper reviews the status of glacier mapping with special reference to the Indian Himalaya. The review provides information on various satellite remote sensing data interpretation methods used with special emphasis laid on recent semi-automated algorithms used for glacier and debris-cover mapping, along with their limitations and challenges. Further, the pragmatic solutions on offer are discussed, and the emerging areas of glacier mapping research are highlighted. The review also touches - contribution of Survey of India (SOI) and Geological Survey of India (GSI) in the glacier mapping. Finally, it discusses the wider range of spatial and spectral domains in which remote sensing data helps to inventories glaciers. The review also identifies gaps in using the latest techniques like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and machine learning algorithms to improvise on the ongoing efforts. At last, the review provides an exhaustive list of references on glacier mapping from the Indian Himalaya as benefit to readers.

TI  - Upper Runde sub-catchment stabilisation for Gweru city water security: considering the Vetiver (<i>Chrysopogon Zizanioides)</i> System an option
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - The study mapped soil loss hotspots and slope angles in the Upper Runde sub-catchment (URSC) with particular concentration on Gweru water sources. The catchment assessment to estimate the severity of soil loss risk was necessary for basin monitoring and possible protection for water security for the city of Gweru. The soil loss estimation model for southern Africa (SLEMSA) was used to compute soil loss hotspots and produce maps in a GIS environment. Landsat imagery, soil database, rainfall data and field observation were used for the study. The SLEMSA model output obtained showed that there is moderate to high soil loss risk around Gwenhoro and Amapongogwe because of grass cover and gentle slopes that alter the runoff rate. Land cover was predominantly grassland with patches of thickets to dense vegetation. The slope angles around the water sources were below 20 degrees (0-5). The findings showed that the application of the Vetiver System for erosion control and slope stabilisation would be a feasible and proactive action towards city water security. This is particularly in light of small-scale farming and mining activities that are arbitrarily appearing in the catchment. It is therefore recommended that catchment management authorities implement the use of vetiver technology, especially on relatively steep slopes and bare soils to control erosion and minimise possible sediment deposition into water sources.

TI  - Leaf equivalent water thickness assessment by means of spectral analysis and a new vegetation index
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf equivalent water thickness (LEWT) is an important parameter in ecological and environmental monitoring. Our study proposes two new indices, the normalized differential projection index (NDPI) and the distance projection ratio index (DPRI), by considering the angle of beta SWIR1 and the length, projection, and relationships among the random forest feature bands at 721, 1466, and 2061 nm, corresponding to NIR, SWIR1, and SWIR2 wavebands, respectively. Single-factor analysis of NDPI and DPRI and multifactor analysis of other vegetation indices are used to build a LEWT linear model whose effectiveness is evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. Despite their simple structure, the NDPI and DPRI can explain the majority of the variation in LEWT. After single-factor analysis, results from DPRI are superior to those from previous vegetation indices or equations with a higher coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.79) and lower relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE = 9.79%). Multifactor analysis shows that the model (R-2 = 0.81, rRMSE = 9.45%) built using DPRI and the water index is the most accurate. The proposed use of NDPI and DPRI as parameter bands to build such models provides a method for further study of the vegetation water content inversion.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The surge in the number of earth observation satellites being launched worldwide is placing significant pressure on the satellite-direct ground receiving stations that are responsible for systematic data acquisition, processing, archiving, and dissemination of earth observation data. Growth in the number of satellite sensors has a bearing on the ground segment payload data processing systems due to the complexity, volume, and variety of the data emanating from the different sensors. In this paper, we have aimed to present a generic, multi-mission, modularized payload data processing system that we are implementing to optimize satellite data processing from historical and current sensors, directly received at the South African National Space Agency's (SANSA) ground receiving station. We have presented the architectural framework for the multi-mission processing system, which is comprised of five processing modules, i.e., the data ingestion module, a radiometric and geometric processing module, atmospheric correction and Analysis Ready Data (ARD) module, Value Added Products (VAPS) module, and lastly, a packaging and delivery module. Our results indicate that the open architecture, multi-mission processing system, when implemented, eliminated the bottlenecks linked with proprietary mono-mission systems. The customizable architecture enabled us to optimize our processing in line with our hardware capacities, and that resulted in significant gains in large-scale image processing efficiencies. The modularized, multi-mission data processing enabled seamless end-to-end image processing, as demonstrated by the capability of the multi-mission system to execute geometric and radiometric corrections to the extent of making it analysis-ready. The processing workflows were highly scalable and enabled us to generate higher-level thematic information products from the ingestion of raw data.

TI  - Waterhole distribution and the piosphere effect in heterogeneous landscapes: evidence from north-western Zimbabwe
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - Forage, water and soil remain critical environmental variables in the distribution of most wildlife species in nearly all protected landscapes. In landscapes where water and forage are scarce and not supplemented, most species succumb to starvation. To avoid animal species succumbing to water induced deaths, waterholes can be put in place to provide water during the dry season. This study intends to find out whether the distribution of waterholes in three study sites in north-western Zimbabwe created a utilisation gradient around them. This was tested through the use of curve estimation methods using remote sensing data. The results illustrate that evenly distributed waterholes in any landscape do not allow the piosphere effect to alter the vegetation around the waterholes as compared to areas with waterholes that are not evenly distributed. As such, to avert land degradation in protected areas there needs to be proper planning in the distribution of waterholes that are sunk to support wildlife during the dry season.

TI  - Ice cover exists: A quick method to delineate groundwater inputs in running waters for cold and temperate regions
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater can be important in regulating stream thermal regimes in cold, temperate regions, and as such, it can be a significant factor for aquatic biota habits and habitats. Groundwater typically remains at a constant temperature through time; that is, it is warmer than surface water in winter and cooler in summer. Further, small tributaries are often dominated by groundwater during low flows of winter and summer. We exploit these thermal patterns to identify and delineate tributary/groundwater inputs along a frozen river (ice-on) using publically available satellite data, and we tested the findings against airborne, thermal infrared (TIR) data. We utilize a supervised maximum likelihood classification (sMLC) to identify possible groundwater inputs while the river is in a frozen state (kappa coefficient of 96.77 when compared with visually delineated possible groundwater inputs). We then compare sMLC-identified possible groundwater inputs with TIR-classified groundwater inputs, which confirmed that there was no statistical difference (chi(2) = .78), that is, confirming that groundwater inputs can be delineated in north temperate river systems using available satellite imagery of the system's frozen state. Our results also established the spatial extent and influence of possible groundwater inputs in two seasons. The thermal plumes were longer and narrower in winter; this is likely related to seasonal differences in dispersion regimes. We hypothesize that differences between summer and winter is related to either (a) tributaries that are modulated by shading in summer or (b) aquifer disconnection from the river in winter owing to frozen ground conditions and lack of aquifer recharge. This method of establishing tributary/groundwater inputs and contributions to surface water thermal regimes is relatively simple and can be useful for science and management as long as "ice cover exists"; that is, the system can achieve a frozen state.

AB  - Reliable and accurate crop classification maps are an important data source for agricultural monitoring and food security assessment studies. For many years, crop type classification and monitoring were focused on single-source optical satellite data classification. With advancements in sensor technologies and processing capabilities, the potential of multi-source satellite imagery has gained increasing attention. The combination of optical and radar data is particularly promising in the context of crop type classification as it allows explaining the advantages of both sensor types with respect to e.g. vegetation structure and biochemical properties. This review article gives a comprehensive overview of studies on crop type classification using optical and radar data fusion approaches. A structured review of fusion approaches, classification strategies and potential for mapping specific crop types is provided. Finally, the partially untapped potential of radar-optical fusion approaches, research gaps and challenges for upcoming future studies are highlighted and discussed.

TI  - Can remote sensing detect, monitor and track baboon-damaged <i>Pinus</i> plantations located in South Africa?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The sustainability of the South African forestry industry is under threat due to the increasing number of biotic stressors in a changing environment. Bark-stripping baboons are impacting the economic potential of the forestry sector, with immediate systems required to quantify plantation damage for real-time adaptive management. This study aims to develop a remotely sensed surveillance system, using the Landsat 8 sensor, to detect and monitor baboon damage over two years. Results show a successful first baboon-damage map regionally, with an overall accuracy of 82.45%. Overall, this research developed an operational framework that supports forest protection using a space-borne satellite platform.

TI  - Land use/land cover dynamics and soil erosion in the Umzintlava catchment (T32E), Eastern Cape, South Africa
T2  - Transactions of the Royal Society of South Africa
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change is often recognised as one of the most sensitive indicators of the interaction between humans and the natural environment contributing to soil erosion. Assessing the impact of LULC dynamics on soil erosion is imperative for soil conservation planning. Against this background, the primary aim of this paper is to assess the impact of LULC change on soil erosion in the Umzintlava catchment during the period 1989-2017. To achieve this, multi-temporal Landsat data, together with the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) were used. Six LULC classes - water bodies, badlands, bare soil and built-up area, agriculture, grassland, and forest - were derived for the years 1989, 2001, and 2017, based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) classification. A post-classification change detection analysis showed that water bodies, agriculture, and grassland decreased by 0.038%, 1.796%, and 13.417%, respectively, whereas the areas covered by forest, badlands, and bare soil and built-up area increased by 9.741%, 3.7338%, and 1.778%, respectively. Results further showed that all other LULC classes, except badlands, experienced increased rates of soil loss. The proportion of the catchment area experiencing moderate (12-25t ha(-1)year(-1)) to extremely high (>150t ha(-1)year(-1)) erosion risk consistently increased. This study provides relevant information on the relationship between LULC dynamics and soil erosion risk, highlighting the necessity and importance of integrating remote sensing and empirical erosion models in spatio-temporal soil erosion assessment at the catchment level.

TI  - Change detection in urban areas from remote sensing data: a multidimensional classification scheme
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) from remote sensing data is a very challenging research problem, especially when we analyse an urban scene. Urban scenes are composed of many different types of objects, both natural and man-made. The building class is one of the important and most complex classes to analyse, important because it is useful for so many applications and complex because it exhibits many changes due to human activity and natural catastrophes. For these reasons, we focus our study on building change detection (BCD). In this paper we propose a classification scheme for BCD research according to several important dimensions including objective, input data, temporal resolution, analysis unit, target output unit, building features, processing technique, change categories, and assessment of results. This classification scheme can guide practitioners in choosing appropriate change detection methods to achieve their goals as well as informing new research efforts. Based on this multidimensional characterisation of BCD, we offer a number of suggestions for further work to be done in this field.

TI  - Altered lymphatic drainage patterns in re-operative sentinel lymph node biopsy for ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study aimed to evaluate the impact of previous local treatment on lymphatic drainage patterns in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) based on our data on re-operative sentinel lymph node biopsy (re-SLNB) for IBTR. Methods Between April 2005 and December 2016, re-SLNB using lymphoscintigraphy with Tc-99 m phytate was performed in 136 patients with cN0 IBTR. Patients were categorized into two groups: the AX group included 55 patients with previous axillary lymph node dissection; the non-AX group included 69 patients with previous SLNB and 12 patients with no axillary surgery. The whole breast irradiation (RT) after initial surgery had performed in 17 patients in the AX group and 27 patients in the non-AX group. Results Lymphatic drainage was visualized in 80% of the AX group and 95% of the non-AX group (P < 0.01). The visualization rate of lymphatic drainage was associated with the number of removed lymph nodes in prior surgery. In the non-AX group, lymphatic drainage was visualized in 96% of patients without RT and 93% with RT. Lymphatic drainage was observed at the ipsilateral axilla in 98% of patients without RT and in 64% with RT (P < 0.0001). Aberrant drainage was significantly more common in patients with RT than without RT (60% vs. 19%, P < 0.001); it was observed mostly to the contralateral axilla (52% vs. 2%, P < 0.0001). In the AX group, patients with previous RT showed decreased lymphatic drainage to the ipsilateral axilla compared to those without RT (29% vs. 63%, P < 0.05) and increased aberrant drainage to the contralateral axilla (64% vs. 5%, P < 0.0001). Conclusion Lymphatic drainage patterns altered in re-SLNB in patients with IBTR and previous ALND and RT were associated with alterations in lymphatic drainage patterns.

TI  - Toward High-Resolution Soil Moisture Monitoring by Combining Active-Passive Microwave and Optical Vegetation Remote Sensing Products with Land Surface Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of radiometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a promising recent technique to downscale soil moisture products, yet it requires land surface parameters and meteorological forcing data at a high spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a new downscaling approach, named integrated passive and active downscaling (I-PAD), to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture datasets over regions without detailed soil data. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data are combined through a dual-pass land data assimilation system to obtain soil moisture at 1 km resolution. In the first step, fine resolution model parameters are optimized based on fine resolution PALSAR soil moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index data, and coarse resolution AMSR-E brightness temperature data. Then, the 25 km AMSR-E observations are assimilated into a land surface model at 1 km resolution with a simple but computationally low-cost algorithm that considers the spatial resolution difference. Precipitation data are used as the only inputs from ground measurements. The evaluations at the two lightly vegetated sites in Mongolia and the Little Washita basin show that the time series of soil moisture are improved at most of the observation by the assimilation scheme. The analyses reveal that I-PAD can capture overall spatial trends of soil moisture within the coarse resolution radiometer footprints, demonstrating the potential of the algorithm to be applied over data-sparse regions. The capability and limitation are discussed based on the simple optimization and assimilation schemes used in the algorithm.

TI  - Evaluating synthetic odours and trap designs for monitoring <i>Anopheles farauti</i> in Queensland, Australia
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMonitoring of malaria vectors is important for designing and maintaining effective control interventions as changes in vector-feeding habits can threaten the efficacy of interventions. At present, human landing catches remain the most common method for monitoring malaria vectors of the Anopheles punctulatus complex, including the Anopheles farauti group. The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of different lures and fan-powered traps, including an odour blend that has been demonstrated to be attractive to African anophelines, in Queensland, Australia.MethodsTo evaluate the performance of different lures in trapping An. farauti in the field, four Suna traps were baited with either: CO2-alone, a synthetic lure (MB5 or BG-Lure) plus CO2, or a human odour plus CO2 and set in the field in Cairns, eastern Australia. A second study evaluated the performance of four traps: a Passive Box trap, BG-Suna trap, BG-Sentinel 2 trap, and BG-Bowl trap, for their ability to trap An. farauti using the best lure from the first experiment. In both experiments, treatments were rotated according to a Latin square design over 16 nights. Trapped mosquitoes were identified on the basis of their morphological features.ResultsBG-Suna traps baited with CO2 alone, a BG-Lure plus CO2 or a natural human odour plus CO2 captured comparable numbers of An. farauti. However, the number of An. farauti sensu lato captured when the MB5 lure was used with CO2 was three times lower than when the other odour lures were used. The BG-Sentinel 2 trap, BG-Suna trap and BG-Bowl trap all captured high numbers of An. farauti, when baited with CO2 and a BG-Lure. The morphological condition of captured mosquitoes was affected by mechanical damage caused by all fan-powered traps but it was still possible to identify the specimens.ConclusionsThe BG-Sentinel 2 trap, BG-Suna trap and the BG-Bowl trap captured high numbers of An. farauti in the field, when equipped with CO2 and an odour lure (either the BG-Lure or a natural odour). The most important attractant was CO2. This study shows that fan-powered traps, baited with CO2 plus an appropriate odour lure, can be a promising addition to current vector monitoring methods in the Southwest Pacific.

TI  - Combining Landsat and landscape metrics to analyse large-scale urban land cover change: a case study in the Jakarta Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPATIAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - This study tests the capacity of Landsat imagery and landscape metrics to explore spatial and temporal dynamics of urban expansion in Jakarta Metropolitan Area (JMA), Indonesia, over 23-year period (1994-2017). Results show that JMA's urban area has doubled in size with average expansion of nearly 40 km(2) per annum, and urban area has grown into sparsely vegetated areas on the outskirts of Jakarta and along the east-west and southern corridors of JMA. Landscape metrics show that urban land cover has evolved into single-connected urban landscape in JMA's core while more fragmented urban pattern in the inner and outer municipalities.

TI  - Three-dimensional interventional photoacoustic imaging for biopsy needle guidance with a linear array transducer
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Needle placement is important for many clinical interventions, such as tissue biopsy, regional anesthesia and drug delivery. It is essential to visualize the spatial position of the needle and the target tissue during the interventions using appropriate imaging techniques. Based on the contrast of optical absorption, photoacoustic imaging is well suited for the guidance of interventional procedures. However, conventional photoacoustic imaging typically provides two-dimensional (2D) slices of the region of interest and could only visualize the needle and the target when they are within the imaging plane of the probe at the same time. This requires great alignment skill and effort. To ease this problem, we developed a 3D interventional photoacoustic imaging technique by fast scanning a linear array ultrasound probe and stitching acquired image slices. in vivo sentinel lymph node biopsy experiment shows that the technique could precisely locate a needle and a sentinel lymph node in a tissue volume while a perfusion experiment demonstrates that the technique could visualize the 3D distribution of injected methylene blue dye underneath the skin at high temporal and spatial resolution. The proposed technique provides a practical way for photoacoustic image-guided interventions.

TI  - Empirical Formulas for Estimating Backscattering and Absorption Coefficients in Complex Waters from Remote-Sensing Reflectance Spectra and Examples of Their Application
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many standard methods used for the remote sensing of ocean colour have been developed, though mainly for clean, open ocean waters. This means that they may not always be effective in complex waters potentially containing high concentrations of optically significant constituents. This paper presents new empirical formulas for estimating selected inherent optical properties of water from remote-sensing reflectance spectra R-rs(lambda), derived, among other things, for waters with high concentrations of dissolved and suspended substances. These formulas include one for estimating the backscattering coefficient b(b)(620) directly from the magnitude of R-rs in the red part of the spectrum, and another for estimating the absorption coefficient a(440) from the hue angle alpha. The latter quantity represents the water's colour as it might be perceived by the human eye (trichromatic colour vision); it is easily calculated from the shape of the R-rs spectrum. These new formulas are based on a combined dataset. Most of the data were obtained in the specific, optically complex environment of the Baltic Sea. Additional data, taken from the NASA bio-Optical Marine Algorithm Dataset (NOMAD) and representing various regions of the global oceans, were used to widen the potential applicability of the new formulas. We indicate the reasons why these simple empirical relationships can be derived and compare them with the results of straightforward modelling; possible applications are also described. We present, among other things, an example of a simple semi-analytical algorithm using both new empirical formulas. This algorithm is a modified version of the well-known quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA), and it can improve the results obtained in optically complex waters. This algorithm allows one to estimate the full spectra of the backscattering and absorption coefficients, without the need for any additional a priori assumptions regarding the spectral shape of absorption by dissolved and suspended seawater constituents.

TI  - Space-based full chain multi-spectral imaging features accurate prediction and analysis for aircraft plume under sea/cloud background
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Building a wide-area, high-efficiency, and accurate detection technology for air targets has become a new challenge for the construction of space situational awareness. Firstly, based on the space-based optical detection requirements for aircraft plume, the method of integrated modeling for sea/cloud background radiation characteristics based on coupling of remote sensing data and physical model is proposed, which can effectively deduce the background radiation field distribution under any environmental conditions. Specifically, combined with meteorological satellite sensor data, such as cloud top temperature, cloud type and cloud top height, three-dimensional atmospheric transmittance and atmospheric path thermal radiation texture are generated for different cloud heights and cloud phase conditions. Then, a coupled sea/cloud bidirectional reflectance model matched to the sampling of space-based detectors is established. Further, the accurate prediction model for multi-spectral imaging features of aircraft plume is built by considering the space-based full imaging chains including the complex coupling of aircraft plume, sea/cloud background, environmental atmosphere, optical system, and imaging detector. Finally, combined with the diffraction effect of the optical system, the multi-spectral imaging features of the aircraft plume are simulated under various spectral bands, flying heights, sea/cloud backgrounds, and detection angles, and the detection performances are analyzed and discussed by using the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). Research results show that the detection capability in the narrow band of 2.65-2.90 mu m and 4.25-4.50 mu m is better than the wide band of 3-5 mu m. When the aircraft flying height is greater than 5km, the aircraft plume can be detected in both narrow bands. It is more reliable to use the multispectral joint-band to detect aircraft plume in different backgrounds.

TI  - Flood Risk Assessment of the Wadi Nu'man Basin, Mecca, Saudi Arabia (During the Period, 1988-2019) Based on the Integration of Geomatics and Hydraulic Modeling: A Case Study
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the impact of flash floods in the Wadi Nu'man basin on urban areas, east of Mecca, which are subjected to frequent floods, during the period from 1988-2019. By producing and analyzing the maps of the regions, an integrated approach to geomatics and hydraulic modelling is employed. The following maps are used: Flood-prone urbanity from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of Wadi Nu'man based on a risk matrix map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use in the Wadi Nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive satellite images, taken by the US satellite, Landsat, in 1988, 1998, 2013, and 2019. Using a supervised classification, with the maximum likelihood method of ERDAS IMAGINE 2016, GIS was used in the production and analysis of soil maps, and geological and hydrological groups of drainage basins, as well as the hydrological model (HEC-HMS), were applied in calculating the hydrograph curve of the Wadi Nu'man basin. The flood water volumes and flow rates were estimated based on the SCS unit hydrograph, and the rain depth was analyzed and estimated for different periods. The hydraulic modeling program (HEC-RAS) was employed, when developing a two-dimensional model to calculate the speed, depth, and spread of the flood, in order to apply the risk matrix method. The recommendations based on this study give priority to the implementation of a flood prevention plan and the protection of infrastructure by maintaining the existing flood drainage facilities and establishing new drainage facilities to protect lives, property, and infrastructure.

TI  - Deforestation is driven by agricultural expansion in Ghana's forest reserves
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Ghana's protected forest reserves have suffered average annual deforestation rates of 0.7%, 0.5%, 0.4%, and 0.6% for the periods 1990-2000, 2000-2005, 2005-2010 and 2010-2015, respectively. The Ashanti region has recorded the second highest deforestation rates. Despite the government's efforts to maintain and protect Ghana's forest reserves, deforestation continues. We observed deforestation patterns in the Ashanti region of Ghana from 1986 to 2015 using Landsat imagery to identify the main causes of deforestation. We obtained and processed two adjacent Landsat images from the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) National Centre for Earth Resources Observation and Science at 30 m spatial resolution for 1986, 2002, and 2015. We then supported the results with findings from 291 farm household surveys in communities fringing the forest reserves. By 2015, dense forest covered 53.3% of the land area of the forest reserves, and the remaining area had been disturbed. Expansion of annual crop farms and tree crops caused 78% of the forest loss within the 29-year period. Afforestation projects are ongoing some of which employ the participation of farmers, yet agricultural expansion exerts more pressure on the remaining dense forest. Agricultural intensification on existing farmlands may reduce farm expansion into the remaining forest areas. Strengthening and enforcing forest protection laws could minimise the extent of agricultural encroachment into forests. Mixed tree-crop systems could reduce the effects of arable farming on deforestation, limit the clearance of trees from farmlands, enhance the provision of ecosystem services, and improve the soil's fertility and moisture content. A forest transition may be underway leading to more trees in agricultural systems and better protection of residual natural forests. (C) 2019 The Author(s).

TI  - Development of Neural Network Based Adaptive Change Detection Technique for Land Terrain Monitoring with Satellite and Drone Images
T2  - DEFENCE SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Role of satellite images is increasing in day-to-day life for both civil as well as defence applications. One of the major defence application while troop's movement is to know about the behaviour of the terrain in advance by which smooth transportation of the troops can be made possible. Therefore, it is important to identify the terrain in advance which is quite possible with the use of satellite images. However, to achieve accurate results, it is essential that the data used should be precise and quite reliable. To achieve this with a satellite image alone is a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper an attempt has been made to fuse the images obtained from drone and satellite, to achieve precise terrain information like bare land, dense vegetation and sparse vegetation. For this purpose, a test area nearby Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India has been selected, and drone and Sentinel-2 data have been taken for the same dates. A neural network based technique has been proposed to obtain precise terrain information from the Sentinel-2 image. A quantitative analysis was carried out to know the terrain information by using change detection. It is observed that the proposed technique has a good potential to identify precisely bare land, dense vegetation, and sparse vegetation which may be quite useful for defence as well as civilian application.

TI  - Antimicrobials Used for the Therapy of Necrotic Enteritis and Coccidiosis in Broiler Chickens and Turkeys in Canada, Farm Surveillance Results (2013-2017)
T2  - AVIAN DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2013, the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) has collected antimicrobial use (AMU) and antimicrobial resistance data from sentinel broiler chicken flocks (Br, five provinces) and sentinel turkey flocks (Tk, one province 2013-2015, three provinces 2016-2017). The objectives of this paper were to describe various preventive strategies aimed at controlling necrotic enteritis (NE) and coccidiosis in the broiler chicken and turkey flocks participating in CIPARS and FoodNet Canada Farm Surveillance Program between 2013 and 2017, to quantify and identify trends in antimicrobials used in feed, and to describe temporal changes in the diagnoses of bacterial and protozoal diseases in relation to antimicrobial use in feed. Comprehensive data were collected (by questionnaire) enabling AMU assessment by various count-based metrics (i.e., frequency and number of medicated rations), weight-based metrics (i.e., inclusion rate in feed and kilograms consumed), and technical indicators (i.e., milligrams per population correction unit [mg/PCU]). Qualitative information such as reasons for use and frequency of diagnosed diseases provided context to the trends in AMU. Between 2013 and 2017, 646 broiler flocks (14.9 million kg biomass) and 234 turkey flocks (12.4 million kg biomass) were surveyed. Overall, antimicrobials used for the prevention of Clostridium perfringens infections (NE) contributed to 85% (109/128 mg/PCUBr) and 95% (59/62 mg/PCUTk) of the quantity of antimicrobials administered via feed in broiler chickens and turkeys, respectively. Three NE programs were used: either 1, 2, or >= 3 antimicrobials administered throughout the production cycle. The treatment protocol in which a single antimicrobial was used throughout the cycle was the most frequent NE preventive program for broiler chickens (58%) and turkeys (76%). Bacitracin and virginiamycin were the top two most frequently used antimicrobials in both species for NE. For coccidiosis control, ionophores and chemical coccidiostats contributed to 66% (3091 kg) and 68% (1561 kg) of the total feed antimicrobial exposures in broiler chickens and turkeys, respectively. Documented coccidiosis programs included continuous or straight (1 drug/cycle), shuttle or dual control (>= 2 drugs/cycle), and vaccination. Variations in coccidiosis programs between species were noted: broiler chickens frequently used a shuttle or dual-control program (68%), whereas turkey flocks used primarily a continuous or straight program (74%). Flocks raised without antibiotics and organic farms (10.3% of broiler chickens and 9.8% turkey flocks) used vaccines to prevent coccidiosis. A small number of broiler flocks (n = 6) used a combination of a vaccination and a coccidiostat during the cycle. During the surveillance timeframe used for this paper, the total feed AMU decreased over time in broiler chickens from 136 to 120 mg/PCUBr and in turkeys from 85 to 62 mg/PCUTk, with no remarkable changes in the frequency of flocks diagnosed with bacterial and protozoal diseases. Surveillance findings such as these will be used as valid reference points in light of the upcoming changes in Canadian federal AMU regulations and industry-led initiatives aimed at reducing AMU.

TI  - <i>Bordetella</i> Adenylate Cyclase Toxin Inhibits Monocyte-to-Macrophage Transition and Dedifferentiates Human Alveolar Macrophages into Monocyte-like Cells
T2  - MBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Monocytes arriving at the site of infection differentiate into functional effector macrophages to replenish the resident sentinel cells. Bordetella pertussis, the pertussis agent, secretes an adenylate cyclase toxin-hemolysin (CyaA) that binds myeloid phagocytes through complement receptor 3 (CD11b/CD18) and swiftly delivers its adenylyl cyclase enzyme domain into phagocytes. This ablates the bactericidal capacities of phagocytes through massive and unregulated conversion of cytosolic ATP into the key signaling molecule cAMP. We show that exposure of primary human monocytes to as low a concentration as 22.5 pM CyaA, or a low (2:1) multiplicity of infection by CyaA-producing B. pertussis bacteria, blocks macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-driven differentiation of monocytes. CyaA-induced cAMP signaling mediated through the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) efficiently blocked expression of macrophage markers, and the monocytes exposed to 22.5 pM CyaA failed to acquire the characteristic intracellular complexity of mature macrophage cells. Neither M-CSF-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) expansion nor accumulation of Golgi bodies, mitochondria, or lysosomes was observed in toxin-exposed monocytes, which remained small and poorly phagocytic and lacked pseudopodia. Exposure to 22.5 pM CyaA toxin provoked loss of macrophage marker expression on in vitro differentiated macrophages, as well as on primary human alveolar macrophages, which appeared to dedifferentiate into monocyte-like cells with upregulated CD14 levels. This is the first report that terminally differentiated tissue-resident macrophage cells can be dedifferentiated in vitro. The results suggest that blocking of monocyte-to-macrophage transition and/or dedifferentiation of the sentinel cells of innate immunity through cAMP-elevating toxin action may represent a novel immune evasion strategy of bacterial pathogens.IMPORTANCE Macrophages are key sentinel cells of the immune system, and, as such, they are targeted by the toxins produced by the pertussis agent Bordetella pertussis. The adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) mediates immune evasion of B. pertussis by suspending the bactericidal activities of myeloid phagocytes. We reveal a novel mechanism of potential subversion of host immunity, where CyaA at very low (22 pM) concentrations could inhibit maturation of human monocyte precursors into the more phagocytic macrophage cells. Furthermore, exposure to low CyaA amounts has been shown to trigger dedifferentiation of mature primary human alveolar macrophages back into monocyte-like cells. This unprecedented capacity is likely to promote survival of the pathogen in the airways, both by preventing maturation of monocytes attracted to the site of infection into phagocytic macrophages and by dedifferentiation of the already airway-resident sentinel cells.

TI  - The role of sediment supply in the adjustment of channel sinuosity across the Amazon Basin
T2  - GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment supplies are a fundamental component of alluvial river systems, but the importance of sustained supplies of externally derived sediments for the evolution of meandering planforms remains unclear. Here we demonstrate the importance of sediment supply in enhancing the growth of point bars that influence the rate of sinuosity increase through flow deflections in meander bends. We use an archive of Landsat images of 16 meandering reaches from across the Amazon Basin to show that rivers transporting larger sediment loads increase their sinuosity more rapidly than those carrying smaller loads. Sediment-rich rivers are dominated by downstream-rotating meanders that increase their sinuosity more rapidly than both extensional and upstream-rotating meanders. Downstream-rotating meanders appear to establish larger point bars that expand throughout the meander, in contrast to extensional meanders, which have smaller bars, and upstream rotating meanders, which are characterized by deposition over the bar head. These observations demonstrate that the size and position of point bars within meander bends influences flow routing and thus controls the dominant direction of meander growth. Rivers with low sediment supplies build smaller point bars, which reduces their capacity to increase meander curvature and the resulting sinuosity.

TI  - Introducing a New Remote Sensing-Based Model for Forecasting Forest Fire Danger Conditions at a Four-Day Scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires are natural disasters that create a significant risk to the communities living in the vicinity of forested landscape. To minimize the risk of forest fires for the resilience of such urban communities and forested ecosystems, we proposed a new remote sensing-based medium-term (i.e., four-day) forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS) based on an existing framework, and applied the system over the forested regions in the northern Alberta, Canada. Hence, we first employed moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived daily land surface temperature (Ts) and surface reflectance products along with the annual land cover to generate three four-day composite for Ts, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and normalized difference water index (NDWI) at 500 m spatial resolution for the next four days over the forest-dominant regions. Upon generating these four-day composites, we calculated the variable-specific mean values to determine variable-specific fire danger maps with two danger classes (i.e., high and low). Then, by assuming the cloud-contaminated pixels as the low fire danger areas, we combined these three danger maps to generate a four-day fire danger map with four danger classes (i.e., low, moderate, high, and very high) over our study area of interest, which was further enhanced by incorporation of a human-caused static fire danger map. Finally, the four-day scale fire danger maps were evaluated using observed/ground-based forest fire occurrences during the 2015-2017 fire seasons. The results revealed that our proposed system was able to detect about 75% of the fire events in the top two danger classes (i.e., high and very high). The system was also able to predict the 2016 Horse River wildfire, the worst fire event in Albertian and Canadian history, with about 67% agreement. The higher accuracy outputs from our proposed model indicated that it could be implemented in the operational management, which would be very useful for lessening the adverse impact of such fire events.

TI  - Unravelling the Frontiers of Urban Growth: Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Land-Use Change and Urban Expansion in Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Ghana
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed and assessed spatio-temporal dynamics of land-use change (LUC) and urban expansion (UE) within the Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA) of Ghana. This region serves as a case to illustrate how a major economic hub and political core area is experiencing massive spatial transformations, resulting in uneven geographies of urban land expansion. Quickbird/Worldview-2 images for the years 2008 and 2017 were segmented and classified to produce LUC maps. LUC and UE were analyzed by post-classification change detection and spatial metrics, respectively. The results revealed an intensive decrease in open-space by 83.46 km(2), brushland/farmland (194.29 km(2)) and waterbody/wetland (3.32 km(2)). Conversely, forestland and urban built-up area increased by 3.45 km(2) and 277.62 km(2). Urban extent expanded from 411.45 km(2) (27%) in 2008 to 689.07 km(2) (46%) in 2017 at a rate of 5.9% and an intensity of 2.06% with an expansion coefficient of 1.5%, indicating low-density urban sprawl. The spatial pattern turned out to be an uneven and spatially differentiated outward expansion, which materialized mainly in districts located within the urban peripheries but intensely towards eastern and western directions, being the frontier and the hotspots of urbanization. Overall, the findings bear important implications for regional spatial planning and development.

TI  - Monitoring Dust Storms in Iraq Using Satellite Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms can suspend large quantities of sand and cause haze in the boundary layer over local and regional scales. Iraq is one of the countries that is often impacted to a large degree by the occurrences of dust storms. The time between June 29 to July 8, 2009 is considered one of the worst dust storm periods of all times and many Iraq is suffered medical problems as a result. We used data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). MODIS Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 1 km and 500 m data were utilized to calculate the Normalized Difference Dust Index (NDDI). The MYD09GA V006 product was used to monitor, map, and assess the development and spread of dust storms over the arid and semi-arid territories of Iraq. We set thresholds for NDDI to distinguish between water and/or ice cloud and ground features and dust storms. In addition; brightness temperature data (TB) from the Aqua /MODIS thermal band 31 were analyzed to distinguish sand on the land surface from atmospheric dust. We used the MODIS level 2 MYD04 deep blue 550 nm Aerosol Option Depth (AOD) data that maintains accuracy even over bright desert surfaces. We found NDDI values lower than 0.05 represent clouds and water bodies, while NDDI greater than 0.18 correspond to dust storm regions. The threshold of TB of 310.5 K was used to distinguish aerosols from the sand on the ground. Approximately 75% of the territory was covered by a dust storm in 5 July 2009 due to strong and dry northwesterly winds.

TI  - Volcano Monitoring from Space Using High-Cadence Planet CubeSat Images Applied to Fuego Volcano, Guatemala
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuego volcano (Guatemala) is one of the most active and hazardous volcanoes in the world. Its persistent activity generates lava flows, pyroclastic density currents (PDCs), and lahars that threaten the surrounding areas and produce frequent morphological change. Fuego's eruption deposits are often rapidly eroded or remobilized by heavy rains and its constant activity and inaccessible terrain makes ground-based assessment of recent eruptive deposits very challenging. Earth-orbiting satellites can provide unique observations of volcanoes during eruptive activity, when ground-based techniques may be too hazardous, and also during inter-eruptive phases, but have typically been hindered by relatively low spatial and temporal resolution. Here, we use a new source of Earth observation data for volcano monitoring: high resolution (-3 m pixel size) images acquired from a constellation of over 150 CubeSats ('Doves') operated by Planet Labs Inc. The Planet Labs constellation provides high spatial resolution at high cadence (<1-72 h), permitting space-based tracking of volcanic activity with unprecedented detail. We show how PlanetScope images collected before, during, and after an eruption can be applied for mapping ash clouds, PDCs, lava flows, or the analysis of morphological change. We assess the utility of the PlanetScope data as a tool for volcano monitoring and rapid deposit mapping that could assist volcanic hazard mitigation efforts in Guatemala and other active volcanic regions.

TI  - Using the USLE: Chances, challenges and limitations of soil erosion modelling
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - To give soils and soil degradation, which are among the most crucial threats to ecosystem stability, social and political visibility, small and large scale modelling and mapping of soil erosion is inevitable. The most widely used approaches during an 80year history of erosion modelling are Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-type based algorithms which have been applied in 109 countries. Addressing soil erosion by water (excluding gully erosion and land sliding), we start this review with a statistical evaluation of nearly 2,000 publications). We discuss model developments which use USLE-type equations as basis or side modules, but we also address recent development of the single USLE parameters (R, K, LS, C, P). Importance, aim and limitations of model validation as well as a comparison of USLE-type models with other erosion assessment tools are discussed. Model comparisons demonstrate that the application of process-based physical models (e.g., WEPP or PESERA) does not necessarily result in lower uncertainties compared to more simple structured empirical models such as USLE-type algorithms. We identified four key areas for future research: (i) overcoming the principally different nature of modelled (gross) versus measured (net) erosion rates, in coupling on-site erosion risk to runoff patterns, and depositional regime, (ii) using the recent increase in spatial resolution of remote sensing data to develop process based models for large scale applications, (iii) strengthen and extend measurement and monitoring programs to build up validation data sets, and (iv) rigorous uncertainty assessment and the application evaluation criteria to soil erosion modelling.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Level-1 Radiometry Assessment Using Vicarious Methods From DIMITRI Toolbox and Field Measurements From RadCalNet Database
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B constellation is an Earth observation optical mission developed and operated by the European Space Agency in the frame of the Copernicus program of the European Commission. The novel observation capacity offered by the multispectral instruments (MSI) on-board Sentinel-2 mission provides a massive resource for the Earth observation community. The accurate radiometric calibration is a critical element of the success of the mission; therefore, in-orbit calibration and validation activities are conducted within the Sentinel-2 Mission Performance Centre. The database of the imaging multispectral instrument and tool for radiometric intercomparison and the ground measurements of the radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet) are used to perform the vicarious validation of the radiometry of the Level-1 products delivered to the users. The aims of this validation are to assess the quality of the data product, to monitor the evolution of the radiometry of both instruments, and to ensure that the products meet the mission requirement accuracy. This article outlines the vicarious methods-Rayleigh scattering, desert pseudoinvariant calibration sites, sensor-to-sensor intercalibration, and the ground reflectance-based approach-that are used for the Sentinel-2 radiometry validation. The validation results indicate good performance and stability of both sensors MSI-A and MSI-B and consistency up to similar to 1% (similar to 2% for red-edge bands) between them. The results of the intercomparison with the in situ measurements from RadCalNet illustrate the relevance of such dataset for the vicarious validation activity.

TI  - Spatial susceptibility analysis of vector-borne diseases in KMC using geospatial technique and MCDM approach
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prevalence of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) like malaria and dengue claims many parts of the capital city Kolkata. Although the frequency of affects has been declining, still several cases are still reported from different parts of Kolkata Municipal Corporation. The present study aimed to apply multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach along with geospatial technique to map susceptible areas of vector-borne diseases. For growing vectors and transmitting diseases, there are always many factors responsible instead of a single factor. Hence, the present work was carried out in multiple stages. Initially different susceptible factors to vector-borne diseases like environment, demography, epidemic and related to suitable breeding sites were selected. Analytic hierarchy process as a technique of MCDM was considered and pair-wise comparison matrix (PCM) was established for each selected factor. Synergistically, weight-based single layer of susceptible zonation was developed and finally, GIS integration was performed for susceptible map of VBDs. The decision-making process was judged by consistency measurement and result shows that the consistency ratio of each selected factor ranged between 0.02 and 0.07, i.e. <0.1 which is acceptable. Geospatial technique offers space to apply statistical method and analytical technique to acquire information. With the help of remote sensing data and spatial information, GIS tool was utilised to analyse spatial susceptibility of vector-borne diseases. The study revealed that spatial location of water bodies is the most responsible factor with highest weight among all selected factors and concomitantly, moisture content, surface temperature, proximity to waste storage bins, and reported dengue and malaria cases also share influential contributions in prevalence of vector-borne diseases. The present result shows the high applicability of geospatial technique in epidemic diseases' zonation which may considered helpful for applying in different fields of research.

AB  - This study compares the precision of the satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Deep Blue (DB) Collection-51 (C-51) and Collection-06 (C-06) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD, at 550 nm) products with surface-based aerosol robotic network (AERONET) observations for the period 2002-2013 at the Solar Village, Saudi Arabia. In general, MODIS captures the patterns of AERONET AOD although C 51 tends to underestimate them while C-06 overestimates them. We found a slightly higher correlation for C-06 (0.79) than for C-51 (0.74) over the Solar Village. The C-06 retrievals are typically of better quality than those of C-51 with a smaller root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) and more AODs fall within the expected error range and relative mean bias. Overall, both the C-51 and C-06 MODIS DB algorithms show significant uncertainties and errors. The errors in AOD measurements arise due to imperfect aerosol model schemes and underestimation of surface reflectance over the Solar Village. This study suggests that further quantitative research is required to provide better estimates of satellite-based AOD over Saudi Arabia.

TI  - <i>Black Boy</i> Revisited: Richard Wright's Harbingers of Transracial Worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Black Boy has established Wright as one of the most insightful social critics of his time. Richard Wright's Black Boy challenges the mainstream African American literature during 1930s and 1940s. It sets for a non-essentialist and transracial worldview in literature, a new trend to canonical American literature. He challenges prevailing dogmatic ideologies to explore and experience freedom, equality, and justice. As he describes in his autobiographical work Black Boy, he has been radicalized as being black. However, Wright stresses that he could not remain confined to the essentialist American view of nationality that associates race and participation in social networks to provide a national identification during that time. He resists to write and to observe the world from an essentialist African American perspective.

TI  - Pre-colonial African Gender Cosmology and the Gender Equality Nexus: "The Road Not Taken" in Igboland, Nigeria
T2  - ASIAN WOMEN
M3  - Article
AB  - African gender cosmology is often deemed to be wrapped up in patriarchal domination. However, such perceptions consider neither what was obtained during the pre-colonial period in Africa nor the distorting external influences on African societies. Sometimes, the alien cultures are, ironically, praised for the liberation of women from the shackles of a barbaric and cruel patriarchal culture, without considering how the anti-equality Western gender worldview of the Victorian era helped to derail the indigenous one which would have been more amenable to the trending notion of gender equality. Using the pre-colonial Igbo society of southeastern Nigeria as an example, this paper attempts to prove, from a historical perspective, that the indigenous African socio-political and cultural structures and practices hinged largely on the complementarity of the sexes, as opposed to total male domination. The paper is based mainly on primary data sourced from direct oral interviews and focus group discussions. In a historical descriptive and analytical manner, the information was subjected to critical analysis in order to ascertain the actual structure of Igbo traditional gender relations during the stated period. Significantly, the realization and espousal of this more sympathetic foundation of African indigenous gender culture, especially in this era of cultural reawakening in the continent, will surely lend strong support to the attainment of gender equity in Africa and beyond.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article considers the avant-garde universe of French-speaking Cameroonian slampoetry as a practice of transfrontality. Intermedial methods (and particularly those developed by Robert Fotsing Mangoua and Francois Guiyoba) guide the analysis. This approach allows for a study of media-linguistic interactions that take place within this art form, its dissemination methods, and its reception. These are constitutive elements of the worldview of Cameroonian slammers.

TI  - Taking Confucian Religiousness on Its Own Terms
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF CHRISTIAN CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Because Confucianism was introduced into the Western academy by missionaries, the key terminology of this tradition was translated in a way that would syncretize it with an Abrahamic worldview. Tian became (and still is) "Heaven," became (and still is) "ritual," and dao became (and still is) "the Way." It is for this reason that Confucian philosophy is shelved in the religion section of our libraries and taught in religion and Asian studies departments in our universities. Yet if we allow this tradition to speak on its own terms, it provides an alternative model of religiousness that takes family and human beings rather than a transcendent God as its core idea. In this essay, I want to use the canonical texts of the Confucian tradition itself to try to reconstruct a religious vocabulary that expresses a distinctively Confucian form of religiousness.

TI  - Do clinical trials truly mirror their target population? An external validity analysis of national register versus trial data from the Swedish prospective SENOMIC trial on sentinel node micrometastases in breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIncreasing evidence suggests that completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) may be omitted in breast cancer patients with limited axillary nodal metastases. However, the representativeness of trial participants for the original clinical practice population, and thus, the generalizability of published trials have been questioned. We propose the use of background data from national registers as a means to assess whether trial participants mirror their target population and to strengthen the generalizability and implementation of trial outcomes.MethodsThe Swedish prospective SENOMIC trial, omitting a completion ALND in breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node micrometastases, reached full target accrual in 2017. To assess the generalizability of trial results for the target population, a comparative analysis of trial participants versus cases reported to the Swedish National Breast Cancer Register (NKBC) was performed.ResultsComparing 548 trial participants and 1070 NKBC cases, there were no significant differences in age, tumor characteristics, breast surgery, or adjuvant treatment. Only the mean number of sentinel lymph nodes with micrometastasis per individual was lower in trial participants than in register cases (1.06 vs. 1.09, p=0.037).ConclusionsPatients included in the SENOMIC trial are acceptably representative of the Swedish breast cancer target population. There were some minor divergences between trial participants and the NKBC population, but taking these into consideration, upcoming trial outcomes should be generalizable to breast cancer patients with micrometastases in their sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Rapid Assessment of Flood Inundation and Damaged Rice Area in Red River Delta from Sentinel 1A Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Red River Delta (RRD), including 11 provinces, is one of the four largest rice-growing areas in Vietnam. Tropical storms often occur and cause serious flooding from May to October annually in the RRD, which strongly affects the productivity of the summer-autumn rice, one of two main rice crops. Therefore, the rapid assessment of damaged rice area by flooding inundation is critical for farmers and the government. In this study, we proposed a methodology for quick estimation of rice areas damaged by flooding using Sentinel 1A (S1A) imagery. Firstly, the latest rice map was produced. Then, a Near Real-Time (NRT) flood map, which is estimated from S1A images at the closest time to a flooding event, was generated by excluding the yearly permanent map from the temporal water map. Our experiment was conducted for the assessment of damaged rice area by flooding from the tropical storm named Son-Tinh, which happened on 19-21 July 2018. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was applied on time-series of S1A VV with VH data (VVVH) to obtain a rice map for the winter-spring season of 2018 with 90.5% Overall Accuracy (OA) and 2.37% difference (12,544 ha) from the General Statistics Office (GSO) of Vietnam's reports for the whole region. Then, the Otsu thresholding method was applied for permanent water surface extraction and NRT flood mapping. The estimated damaged area was compared to available provincial and communal statistics for validation and further analysis. Right after the Son-Tinh storm, the estimation of inundated rice was approximately 50% of the total rice area in the RRD (271,092 ha). As a result, rice damage level strongly corresponds to the inundation period. In addition, the rice-flooding frequency map over the RRD was estimated to show rice fields suffering a high risk of flooding during the rainy season in the RRD. Our experiment's results highlight the potential of using Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery for fast monitoring and assessment of paddy rice areas affected by flooding at a large scale in the RRD region.

T2  - Journal of oral and maxillofacial pathology : JOMFP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The link between oncology and immunology has a long history, and its development is forced by the necessity to develop innovative and highly efficient modalities for the immunological destruction of malignant cells. The success of cancer immunotherapy depends on two major factors: adequate tumor-specific antigens and a vehicle capable of inducing a tumor-specific immune response by effective delivery of these antigens. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most powerful antigen-presenting cells, because of their unique characteristics, and these cells are actively used in cancer immunotherapy. DCs form a critical interface between innate and adaptive immunity. They integrate signals derived from tissue infection or damage and present processed antigen from these sites to naive T-cells in secondary lymphoid organs while also providing multiple soluble and surface-bound signals that help to guide T-cell differentiation. They are sentinel of immune system, as they are deployed through the body and monitor their surroundings for antigens and danger signals derived from pathogens or tissue damage. These cells (DCs) with their potent antigen-presenting ability are considered as critical factor in antitumor immunity. In recent years, the existence of immunosuppressive regulatory DCs in tumor microenvironment is well described. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells can contribute to the pool of tumor-associated DCs by differentiating to inflammatory DCs, which appear to have specific phenotype and are critical components of antitumor response. There is currently much interest in modulating DC function to improve cancer immunotherapy. Many strategies have been developed to target DCs in cancer, such as the administration of antigens with immunomodulators that mobilize and activate endogenous DCs and the generation of DC-based vaccines. Here, we highlight the role of DCs along with other DC subsets in the regulation of immune responses in cancer treatment.

TI  - A-DInSAR Performance for Updating Landslide Inventory in Mountain Areas: An Example from Lombardy Region (Italy)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the capabilities and limitations of the Advanced Satellite SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) Interferometry (A-DInSAR) in wooded and mountainous regions, with the aim to get insights on the performances for studying slow-moving landslides. The considered critical issues are related to the SAR acquisition geometries (angle of incidence of the satellite line of sight, ascending and descending geometries) and to the physical and morphological features of the slopes (land use, aspect and slope angles), which influence the measuring points coverage. 26 areas in Lombardy Region (Italy), affected by known slope instability phenomena, have been analyzed through A-DInSAR technique, using COSMO-SkyMed images. The results allowed to outline general considerations about the effectiveness of A-DInSAR analysis of a single dataset (descending or ascending dataset), selected accordingly to the aspect of the slopes. Moreover, we aimed to quantitatively describe the capability to update the state of activity of several previously mapped landslides using satellite SAR Interferometry results. Although in a wooded and mountainous region, where the chances of retrieving radar targets for satellite SAR analysis are generally low, the A-DInSAR results have allowed to detect landslides' reactivations or new landslides and to update the inventory for about 70% of the investigated areas.

TI  - On-Demand Processing of Data Cubes from Satellite Image Collections with the gdalcubes Library
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data cubes are increasingly used as a data structure to make large collections of satellite images easily accessible to scientists. They hide complexities in the data such that data users can concentrate on the analysis rather than on data management. However, the construction of data cubes is not trivial and involves decisions that must be taken with regard to any particular analyses. This paper proposes on-demand data cubes, which are constructed on the fly when data users process the data. We introduce the open-source C++ library and R package gdalcubes for the construction and processing of on-demand data cubes from satellite image collections, and show how it supports interactive method development workflows where data users can initially try methods on small subsamples before running analyses on high resolution and/or large areas. Two study cases, one on processing Sentinel-2 time series and the other on combining vegetation, land surface temperature, and precipitation data, demonstrate and evaluate this implementation. While results suggest that on-demand data cubes implemented in gdalcubes support interactivity and allow for combining multiple data products, the speed-up effect also strongly depends on how original data products are organized. The potential for cloud deployment is discussed.

TI  - Integration of terrain and AVHRR-derived multi-temporal snow cover data for statistical assessment of avalanches: case study of a part of NW Himalaya
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the data of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) 1 km resolution of daily time series is used to extract the distribution of seasonal snow in the Chowkibal-Tangdhar (CT) area. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) at 90-m resolution has been used to delineate the terrain characteristics such as aspect, slope, and altitude. The study is focused on two major objectives, first is to assess the snow cover variation with a time series analysis and second one is the snow cover changes with respect to the changes in terrain parameters mainly at avalanche prone regions. Study area has 60 registered avalanche sites; most of these avalanches trigger during the winter months when snow deposition takes place in the steep slopes due to successive snowfall spells. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) method is used to monitor the snow cover of the study area from the satellite image. The multi-temporal analysis of the snow cover derived from the AVHRR data shows that the binary snow cover in the study area increases with time from November to March due to successive snowfalls. After that, the snow cover starts to deplete from the mid-March onwards due to rise in temperature. Maximum snow cover area (SCA) has been found 85.67% and minimum is at 14.33% respectively. An attempt has been made to understand the influence of terrain parameters by extracting the major terrain and snow parameters for each of the avalanche site and correlating it with occurrences of the avalanches. The study suggests that the sites having terrain characteristics of slope 25-45 degrees, aspect 26.45%, and altitude 2500-3500 m has more occurrences of avalanches.

TI  - Assessing the changes of mangrove ecosystem services value in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ) is the largest global special economic zone in the field of oil, gas, and petrochemical industry. The Nayband national marine park is located in the PSEEZ and mangrove forests are spread throughout the estuaries (Bidkhun or Asaloyeh, Basatin and Haleh) of the park. Despite important goods and ecosystem services of mangroves and their high economic value, mangroves within the PSEEZ are threatened by activities of the oil industry. Thus, it is necessary to monitor and assess the mangroves and their ecosystem services. In this context, remote sensing technologies provide effective tools for spatio-temporal analysis of mangrove distribution. In this study, Landsat-5, 7, 8 images were used from 1986 to 2018. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Sen's slope was employed for monitoring mangrove cover changes and estimating Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) trends. In assessing the economic value of the ecosystem services of the Mangrove forests, the mangrove distribution changes and global values of mangrove ecosystem services were integrated. The results revealed that the coverage of mangroves had increased to about nearly 204.93 ha in area from 1986 to 2003, followed by a drop to 169.29 ha in 2018. The economic value of mangrove forests of the PSEEZ in 1986, 1998, 2003, 2015 and 2018 was estimated to be about 3.3, 3.8, 6.7, 6.5 and 5.5 million US dollars per year, respectively. Based on Sen's slope, the NDVI trend in Basatin estuary decreased at a rate of - 0.001, but showed significant increases of about 0.008 and 0.006 for the Bidkhun and the Haleh estuaries, respectively. Despite the suitable distribution and an economic value of $1.9 million in 1986, conditions of the Basatin estuary seem to have diminished from 1986 to 2018 (economic value of $0.71 million in 2018). The Bidkhun estuary, which showed a positive trend in distribution changes, has also been downgrading since 2015 to about 30.43 ha in size, and an economic value of $1 million. Since 1998, the mangroves of Haleh estuary have been improving distribution-wise, with further elevations in economic value ($ 0.26 million in 2018).

TI  - Paving the Way towards an Armenian Data Cube
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental issues become an increasing global concern because of the continuous pressure on natural resources. Earth observations (EO), which include both satellite/UAV and in-situ data, can provide robust monitoring for various environmental concerns. The realization of the full information potential of EO data requires innovative tools to minimize the time and scientific knowledge needed to access, prepare and analyze a large volume of data. EO Data Cube (DC) is a new paradigm aiming to realize it. The article presents the Swiss-Armenian joint initiative on the deployment of an Armenian DC, which is anchored on the best practices of the Swiss model. The Armenian DC is a complete and up-to-date archive of EO data (e.g., Landsat 5, 7, 8, Sentinel-2) by benefiting from Switzerland's expertise in implementing the Swiss DC. The use-case of confirm delineation of Lake Sevan using McFeeters band ratio algorithm is discussed. The validation shows that the results are sufficiently reliable. The transfer of the necessary knowledge from Switzerland to Armenia for developing and implementing the first version of an Armenian DC should be considered as a first step of a permanent collaboration for paving the way towards continuous remote environmental monitoring in Armenia.

TI  - Unrest at Domuyo Volcano, Argentina, Detected by Geophysical and Geodetic Data and Morphometric Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New volcanic unrest has been detected in the Domuyo Volcanic Center (DVC), to the east of the Andes Southern Volcanic Zone in Argentina. To better understand this activity, we investigated new seismic monitoring data, gravimetric and magnetic campaign data, and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) deformation maps, and we derived an image of the magma plumbing system and the likely source of the unrest episode. Seismic events recorded during 2017-2018 nucleate beneath the southwestern flank of the DVC. Ground deformation maps derived from InSAR processing of Sentinel-1 data exhibit an inflation area exceeding 300 km(2), from 2014 to at least March 2018, which can be explained by an inflating sill model located 7 km deep. The Bouguer anomaly reveals a negative density contrast of similar to 35 km wavelength, which is spatially coincident with the InSAR pattern. Our 3D density modeling suggests a body approximately 4-6 km deep with a density contrast of -550 kg/m(3). Therefore, the geophysical and geodetic data allow identification of the plumbing system that is subject to inflation at these shallow crustal depths. We compared the presence and dimensions of the inferred doming area to the drainage patterns of the area, which support long-established incremental uplift according to morphometric analysis. Future studies will allow us to investigate further whether the new unrest is hydrothermal or magmatic in origin.

TI  - The Performance of Satellite-Based Actual Evapotranspiration Products and the Assessment of Irrigation Efficiency in Egypt
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of crop water consumption, also known as actual evapotranspiration (ETa), is crucial for the prudent use of limited freshwater resources. Remote-sensing-based algorithms have become a popular approach for providing spatio-temporal information on ETa. Satellite-based ETa products are widely available. However, identifying an adequate product remains a challenge due to validation data scarcity. This study developed an assessment process to identify superior ETa products in agricultural areas in Egypt. The land cover product (MCD12Q1) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was evaluated and used to detect agricultural areas. The performances of three ETa products, namely: Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux), USGS-FEWS NET SSEBop ETa monthly product, and MODIS ETa monthly product (MOD16A2), were evaluated. The ETa values of these products were compared to previous ETa observations and evaluated using the integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (iNDVI) on a seasonal and annual basis. Finally, the irrigation efficiency throughout Egypt was calculated based on the annual Relative Water Supply (RWS) index. Results reveal that the SSEBop monthly product has the best performance in Egypt, followed by the MOD16A2. The EEFlux overestimated ETa values by 36%. RWS had a range of 0.96-1.47, indicating high irrigation efficiency. The findings reported herein can assist in improving irrigation water management in Egypt and the Nile Basin.

TI  - Field and spaceborne imagery data for evaluation of the paleo-stress regime during formation of the Jurassic dike swarms in the Kalateh Alaeddin Mountain area, Shahrood, north Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Dike swarms are commonly linked with extensional structures in diverse geodynamic environments. Mafic dyke swarms are typically used to reconstruct the paleo-stress fields of a given region. These dikes are considered paleo-stress indicators and excellent time marker (if related geochronological data are available) of the local and regional stress fields. In the Middle-Late Jurassic, swarms of mafic dikes emplaced into the Neoproterozoic schists and amphibolites in the Kalateh Alaeddin Mountain area in south Shahrood, north Iran. These dikes with different thicknesses show a general east-west strike direction, with mostly a steep dip angle. In this paper, we present structural data of these dike swarms for the sake of assessing the paleo-stress state and the magma pressure ratio at the time of their emplacement. Field and structural data are integrated with ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) and Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)/SPOT imagery data, to extract important parameters of the investigated dikes and controlling fault/joint sets. Orientation of the principal paleo-stress axes, quantification of the stress ratio, and the associated magma pressure ratio (driving stress ratio) were calculated using the stereographic projection and Mohr's circle reconstruction techniques. The results reveal that the maximum paleo-stress component (sigma 1) was sub-vertical and the intermediate (sigma 2) and minimum (sigma 3) paleo-stresses components were sub-horizontal in N264 degrees E and N173 degrees E trends, respectively. Due to the low value of the driving stress ratio (R = 0.05), these dikes developed perpendicular to the minimum principal stress (in E-W direction). The stress ratio value (o = 0.66) indicates a moderately oblate stress ellipsoid. The orientation of the principal paleo-stress axes and the oblate ellipsoid are indicative of the dike emplacement during a N-S-directed tectonic extension, in agreement with the Jurassic subsidence phase and N-S stretching described for the Kalateh Alaeddin Mountain area.

TI  - Simulating slum growth in Lagos: An integration of rule based and empirical based model
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Demographic forecasts put Lagos as one of the cities with the highest population growth. Past trends show correlations between urban growth and slum growth, thereby creating a major challenge for sustainable city planning. This study explores the drivers of slum development in Lagos, and simulates scenarios for slum growth through coupling logistic regression with the cellular automata-based SLEUTH model. RapidEye (2009 and 2015) and Sentinel-2 (2015) imagery were used to create slum extents maps for each time point, and then used for the calibration and prediction, respectively, of the model. The driving forces of slum development in Lagos were analyzed, and the correlated spatial drivers compiled to create a probability map of slum development using the logistic regression model. The probability map was incorporated with the exclusion layer of the modified SLEUTH to simulate scenarios of slum growth in Lagos by 2035. Three scenarios were designed based on the modification of the exclusion layer and the transition rules. The Scenario 1 'business as usual', depicts slum development following the present trend; the scenario 2 'excessive growth', considers the demographic projection for the city; while the scenario 3 'limited government influence', asserts limited interference by the government in slum management/control. Factors including distance to markets, distance to shoreline, distance to local government administrative buildings, land prices, etc. were predictors of slum development in Lagos. The prediction model, based on the logistic regression, reached an overall accuracy of 79.17% and a relative operation characteristics value of 0.85. The three scenarios show further densification of the existing slums, and increase in their area by 1.18 km(2) (scenario 1), 4.02 km(2) (scenario 2), and 1.28 km(2) (scenario 3). New slums are predicted at the fringe of the south-eastern part of the city. The foreseen limited spatial growth of the slums is due to the high density of the city, thus new slums may likely develop in the neighboring zones to Lagos when land in the city is no longer available.

TI  - Intercomparison of AVHRR GIMMS3g, Terra MODIS, and SPOT-VGT NDVI Products over the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technology has promoted the generation of different vegetation index products, resulting in substantive accomplishment in comprehensive economic development and monitoring of natural environmental changes. The results of scientific experiments based on various vegetation index products are also different with the variation of time and space. In this work, the consistency characteristics among three global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products, namely, GIMMS3g NDVI, MOD13A3 NDVI, and SPOT-VGT NDVI, are intercompared and validated based on Landsat 8 NDVI at biome and regional scale over the Mongolian Plateau (MP) from 2000 to 2014 by decomposing time series datasets. The agreement coefficient (AC) and statistical scores such as Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE), and standard deviation (STD) are used to evaluate the consistency between three NDVI datasets. Intercomparison results reveal that GIMMS3g NDVI has the highest values basically over the MP, while SPOT-VGT NDVI has the lowest values. The spatial distribution of AC values between various NDVI products indicates that the three NDVI datasets are highly consistent with each other in the northern regions of the MP, and MOD13A3 NDVI and SPOT-VGT NDVI have better consistency in expressing vegetation cover and change trends due to the highest proportions of pixels with AC values greater than 0.6. However, the trend components of decomposed NDVI sequences show that SPOT-VGT NDVI values are about 0.02 lower than the other two datasets in the whole variation periods. The zonal characteristics show that GIMMS3g NDVI in January 2013 is significantly higher than those of the other two datasets. However, in July 2013, the three datasets are remarkably consistent because of the greater vegetation coverage. Consistency validation results show that values of SPOT-VGT NDVI agree more with Landsat 8 NDVI than GIMMS3g NDVI and MOD13A3 NDVI, and the consistencies in the northeast of the MP are higher than northwest regions.

TI  - Detection of Liquefaction Phenomena from the 2017 Pohang (Korea) Earthquake Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 15 November 2017, liquefaction phenomena were observed around the epicenter after a 5.4 magnitude earthquake occurred in Pohang in southeast Korea. In this study, we attempted to detect areas of sudden water content increase by using SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and optical satellite images. We analyzed coherence changes using Sentinel-1 SAR coseismic image pairs and analyzed NDWI (normalized difference water index) changes using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical satellite images from before and after the earthquake. Coherence analysis showed no liquefaction-induced surface changes. The NDWI time series analysis models using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 optical images confirmed liquefaction phenomena close to the epicenter but could not detect liquefaction phenomena far from the epicenter. We proposed and evaluated the TDLI (temporal difference liquefaction index), which uses only one SWIR (short-wave infrared) band at 2200 nm, which is sensitive to soil moisture content. The Sentinel-2 TDLI was most consistent with field observations where sand blow from liquefaction was confirmed. We found that Sentinel-2, with its relatively shorter revisit period compared to that of Landsat 8 (5 days vs. 16 days), was more effective for detecting traces of short-lived liquefaction phenomena on the surface. The Sentinel-2 TDLI could help facilitate rapid investigations and responses to liquefaction damage.

TI  - An Examination of Snow Albedo Estimates From MODIS and Their Impact on Snow Water Equivalent Reconstruction
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow albedo is a dominant control on snowmelt in many parts of the world. An empirical albedo decay equation, developed over 60 years ago, is still used in snowmelt models. Several empirical snow albedo models developed since show wide spread in results. Remotely sensed snow albedos have been used in a few studies, but validations are scarce because of the difficulty in making accurate in situ measurements. Reconstruction of snow water equivalent (SWE), where the snowpack is built in reverse, is especially sensitive to albedo. We present two new contributions: (1) an updated albedo model where grain size and light absorbing particle content are solved for simultaneously and (2) multiyear comparisons of remotely sensed and in situ albedo measurements from three high-altitude sites in the western United States. Our remotely sensed albedos show 4 to 6% RMSE and negligible bias. In comparison, empirical albedo decay models, which require extensive in situ measurements, show RMSE values of 7 to 17% with biases of -6 to -14%. We examine the sensitivity of SWE reconstructions to albedo error at two sites. With no simulated error in albedo, reconstructed SWE had MAE values of 7 to 13% and 5-6% bias. The accuracy actually improved with some simulated added error, likely because of a fundamental bias in the reconstruction approach. Conversely, the best age-based decay model showed an 18-20% MAE and bias in reconstructed SWE. We conclude that remotely sensed albedos where available are superior to age-based approaches in all aspects except simplicity.

TI  - Assessing groundwater potential zones using remote sensing, GIS and MIF techniques: Renigunta area, Andhra Pradesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater potential zones of Renigunta area have been evaluated using an integration of remote sensing, GIS and MIF techniques. Survey of India (SOI) toposheets, IRS-R2 LISS-IV satellite imagery and supplementary datasets from various organizations were used to generate different thematic maps such as geology, geomorphology, drainage density, lineament density, soils, slope and land use/land cover. Then, each thematic map and their subclasses were assigned a weight and rating by using multi influencing factor (MIF) technique and integrated using the weighted overlay process in GIS. The study results into four categories viz., poor 46.46 km(2) (21.75%), moderate 109.99 km(2) (51.49%), good 51.62 km(2)(24.17%) and very good 5.53 km(2)(2.59%) groundwater potential zones. The final groundwater potential zones map may be useful for policymakers in planning and management scenario of groundwater resources of the study area.

TI  - Estimating Root Zone Soil Moisture Across the Eastern United States with Passive Microwave Satellite Data and a Simple Hydrologic Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) affects many natural processes and is an important component of environmental modeling, but it is expensive and challenging to monitor for relatively small spatial extents. Satellite datasets offer ample spatial coverage of near-surface soil moisture content at up to a daily time-step, but satellite-derived data products are currently too coarse in spatial resolution to use directly for many environmental applications, such as those for small catchments. This study investigated the use of passive microwave satellite soil moisture data products in a simple hydrologic model to provide root zone soil moisture estimates across a small catchment over a two year time period and the Eastern U.S. (EUS) at a 1 km resolution over a decadal time-scale. The physically based soil moisture analytical relationship (SMAR) was calibrated and tested with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSRE), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data products. The SMAR spatial model relies on maps of soil physical properties and was first tested at the Shale Hills experimental catchment in central Pennsylvania. The model met a root mean square error (RMSE) benchmark of 0.06 cm(3) cm(-3) at 66% of the locations throughout the catchment. Then, the SMAR spatial model was calibrated at up to 68 sites (SCAN and AMERIFLUX network sites) that monitor soil moisture across the EUS region, and maps of SMAR parameters were generated for each satellite data product. The average RMSE for RZSM estimates from each satellite data product is <0.06 cm(3) cm(-3). Lastly, the 1 km EUS regional RZSM maps were tested with data from the Shale Hills, which was set aside for validating the regional SMAR, and the RMSE between the RZSM predictions and the catchment average is 0.042 cm(3) cm(-3). This study offers a promising approach for generating long time-series of regional RZSM maps with the same spatial resolution of soil property maps.

TI  - Touching with Light, or, How Texture Recasts the Sensing of Underground Water
T2  - SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY & HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an ethnographic examination of the early social life of a project to map Costa Rica's aquifers using LandSat imagery and a specialized algorithm. The project aims to make subterranean formations accessible for public agencies mediating recent environmental conflicts over underground water, which have been diagnosed as the country's first "water war." I analyze the presentation to the public of this project and the technology it uses to show how vision and touch are conceptual resources that people use to describe the technicalities of satellite imagery. Attending to the semiotic and technical power of vision and touch requires a nonessentialist understanding of the senses. It requires moving away from a narrow understanding of sensing as embodied, phenomenological practice. Focusing on the role of texture as that which operates in the interstices of vision and touch, I propose going beyond panoptic imaginaries in order to grasp the diverse social lives that technologies such as satellite imaging have.

TI  - Suitability of MODIS-based NDVI index for forest monitoring and its seasonal applications in Central Europe
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper demonstrates the multipurpose application of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from MODIS products for forest monitoring across the Central-European macro-region Slovakia and Hungary (i.e., the Western Carpathians and Pannonian basin). Relationships between forest dynamics and NDVI were analysed and used for determining the onset of phenophases in spring and autumn and for the assessment of forest growth and health condition. To identify the phenophases, the NDVI profile during the year was established by fitting a double logistic sigmoid function to data and phenological metrics were developed based on the calculated extreme values of the sigmoid function and its derivatives. According to our analyses, leaf unfolding and leaf fall were significantly delayed or advanced in 2018 with the increase of altitude and latitude (p <0.01). The longitudinal aspect was significant only in the autumn phenophase with earlier onset of leaf fall towards to the east. The duration of the growing season varied extensively within the region, mainly according to altitudinal and latitudinal occurrence of beech forests. Positive associations between annual tree-ring width and standardized summer NDVI were found for conifers at local scale. The highest correlation period was between July 12 and August 12 as the most critical periods for forest growth. Slight positive correlation can be observed during March -April that could be associated with the varying start of the growing seasons. In the forest health study, whereas NDVI values could well identify the location and extent of a recent forest damage due to a combination of snow break and wind break, an urgent demand for more detailed field data was obvious.

TI  - 'Bioethical Realism': A Framework for Implementing Universal Research Ethics
T2  - DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementation of existing ethical guidelines for international collaborative medical and health research is still largely controversial in sub-Saharan Africa for two major reasons: One, they are seen as foreign and allegedly inconsistent with what has been described as an 'African worldview', hence, demand for their strict implementations reeks of 'bioethical imperialism'. Two, they have other discernible inadequacies - lack of sufficient detail, apparent as well as real ambiguities, vagueness and contradictions. Similar charges exist(ed) in other non-Western societies. Consequently, these guidelines have been correctly judged as an inadequate response to the complex and ever shifting dilemmas met by researchers and research regulators in the field. This paper proposes a framework for effective implementation of existing guidelines without much worry about bioethical imperialism and other inadequacies. This framework is proposed using an analogy of Legal Realism, specifically its key assertions on how, in reality, judicial systems operate using general legal rules to settle specific cases. Legal realists assert that in judicial decision-making, general legal rules do not totally dictate court decisions in specific cases. This analogy is used to coin a new term, 'Bioethical Realism.' The framework suggests that local Research Ethics Committees ought to be construed as analogues of judicial courts with the resulting implications. Consequently, just like legal rules are general rules that do not always dictate court decisions, similarly international bioethical guidelines are general ethical rules that should not always dictate local RECs' decisions and such decisions (ought to) enjoy considerable immunity from outsiders.

Hence, a sequential three-decade profiling of erosion and accretion activities within the Kaziranga National Park-a protected area in the flood plain of the Brahmaputra, was undertaken. Thirty consecutive Landsat images from 1987 to 2016 were analyzed in GIS environment, to evaluate long-term sequential data and derive a baseline reference. Overlay analysis was carried out to estimate the magnitudes and intensities of erosion and accretion in spatiotemporal scale. The resultant mean rates of erosion and accretion have been estimated to be 184.2 ha/year and 93.9 ha/year, respectively. Consequently, the resultant net reduction in the park land area was 2617.7 ha, which projected a mean net rate of 90.3 ha/year. Erosion was therefore annually recurrent and dominant over accretion. The resultant area dynamics, from the assessment of the spatiotemporal scale, provided a reliable, continuous data resource that overcomes the information lacunae from available fragmented studies. In addition, assessment with sequential data displayed a more accurate reflection of actual topography as compared to intermittent data results, which in turn can validate and enrich data resources, on the area dynamics of the Brahmaputra floodplain. Finally, defining a reference perspective derived from long-term sequential data that endorses the twin episodes of erosion and accretion will be vital for floodplain management.

TI  - Temporal Evolution of Corn Mass Production Based on Agro-Meteorological Modelling Controlled by Satellite Optical and SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to provide daily estimates of the evolution of popcorn dry masses at the field scale using an agro-meteorological model, named the simple algorithm for yield model combined with a water balance model (SAFY-WB), controlled by the Green Area Index (GAI), derived from satellite images acquired in the microwave and optical domains. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite information (sigma degrees (VH/VV)) was provided by the Sentinel-1A (S1-A) mission through two orbits (30 and 132), with a repetitiveness of six days. The optical data were obtained from the Landsat-8 mission. SAR and optical data were acquired over one complete agricultural season, in 2016, over a test site located in the southwest of France. The results show that the total dry masses of corn can be estimated accurately (R-2 = 0.92) at daily time steps due to a combination of satellite and model data. The SAR data are more suitable for characterizing the first period of crop development (until the end of flowering), whereas the optical data can be used throughout the crop cycle. Moreover, the model offers good performances in plant (R-2 = 0.90) and ear (R-2 = 0.93) mass retrieval, irrespective of the phenological stage. The results also reveal that four phenological stages (four to five leaves, flowering, ripening, and harvest) can be accurately predicted by the proposed approach (R-2 = 0.98; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = seven days). Nevertheless, some important points must be taken into account before assimilation, namely the SAR signal must be corrected with respect to thermal noise before being assimilated, and the relationship estimated between the GAI and SAR signal must be performed over fields cultivated without intercrops. These results are unique in the literature and provide a new way to better monitor corn production over time.

TI  - A Comparison of Two Soil Moisture Products S<SUP>2</SUP>MP and Copernicus-SSM Over Southern France
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a comparison between the Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2-derived soil moisture product at plot scale ((SMP)-M-2) and the new Copernicus surface soil moisture (C-SSM) product at 1-km scale over a wide region in southern France. In this study, both products were first evaluated using in situ measurements obtained by the calibrated time delay reflectometer in field campaigns. The accuracy against the in situ measurements was defined by the correlation coefficient R, the root mean square difference (RMSD), and the bias and the unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD). Then, the soil moisture estimations from both SSM products were intercompared over one year (October 2016-October 2017). Both products show generally good agreement with in situ measurements. The results show that using in situ measurements collected over agricultural areas and grasslands, the accuracy of the C-SSM is good (RMSD = 6.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 6.0 vol%, and R = 0.48) but less accurate than the (SMP)-M-2 (RMSD = 4.0 vol%, ubRMSD = 3.9 vol%, and R = 0.77). The intercomparison between the two SSM products over one year shows that both products are highly correlated over agricultural areas that are mainly used for cereals (R value between 0.5 and 0.9 and RMSE between 4 and 6 vol%). Over areas containing forests and vineyards, the C-SSM values tend to overestimate the (SMP)-M-2 values (bias > 5 vol%). In the case of well-developed vegetation cover, the (SMP)-M-2 does not provide SSM estimations while C-SSM sometimes provides underestimated SSM values.

TI  - How Well can Spaceborne Digital Elevation Models Represent a Man-Made Structure: A Runway Case Study
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this case study, an active runway of a civilian airport in Zonguldak, Turkey was used to assess the suitability of spaceborne digital elevation models (DEMs) to model an anthropogenic structure. The tested DEMs include the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D 30 m (AW3D30), the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)-1", the SRTM-3", the SRTM-X, the TanDEM-3", and the WorldDEM. A photogrammetric high accuracy DEM was also available for the tests. As a reference dataset, a line-leveling survey of the runway using a Leica Sprinter 150/150M instrument was performed. The selection of a runway as a testbed for this type of investigation is justified by its unique characteristics, including its flat surface, homogenous surface material, and availability for a ground survey. These characteristics are significant because DEMs over similar structures are free from environment-and target-induced error sources. For our test area, the most accurate DEM was the WorldDEM followed by the SRTM-3" and TanDEM-3", with vertical errors (LE90) equal to 1.291 m, 1.542 m, and 1.56 m, respectively. This investigation uses a method, known as the runway method, for identifying the vertical errors in DEMs.

TI  - Quality of Chronic Kidney Disease Management in Canadian Primary Care
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Although patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are routinely managed in primary care settings, no nationally representative study has assessed the quality of care received by these patients in Canada.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices to identify care gaps to guide development and implementation of national quality improvement initiatives.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study leveraged Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, to develop a cohort of 46 162 patients with CKD managed in primary care practices. Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2018, to July 31, 2019.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The study examined the proportion of patients with CKD who met a set of 12 quality indicators in 6 domains: (1) detection and recognition of CKD, (2) testing and monitoring of kidney function, (3) use of recommended medications, (4) monitoring after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), (5) management of blood pressure, and (6) monitoring for glycemic control in those with diabetes and CKD. The study also analyzed associations of divergence from these quality indicators.RESULTS The cohort comprised 46 162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Only 4 of 12 quality indicators were met by 75% or more of the study cohort. These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A1c test for monitoring diabetes during follow-up. Indicators in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD, testing and monitoring of kidney function (specifically, urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing), use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs were not met. Only 6529 patients (18.4%) with CKD received a urine albumin test within 6 months of CKD diagnosis, and 3954 (39.4%) had a second measurement within 6 months of an abnormal baseline urine albumin level. Older age (>= 85 years) and CKD stage 5 were significantly associated with not satisfying the criteria for the quality indicators across all domains. Across age categories, younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (>= 75 years) were less likely to be tested for albuminuria (314 of 1689 patients aged 18-49 years [18.5%], 1983 of 11 919 patients aged 75-84 years [61.6%], and 614 of 5237 patients aged >= 85 years [11.7%] received the urine albumin to creatinine ratio test within 6 months of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min per 1.73m(2); P<.001). Patients aged 18 to 49 years were less commonly prescribed recommended medications (222 of 2881 [7.7%]), whereas patients aged 75 to 84 years were prescribed ACEIs or ARBs most frequently (2328 of 5262 [ 44.2%];P<.001).CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings suggest that management of CKD across primary care practices in Canada varies according to quality indicator. This study revealed potential priority areas for quality improvement initiatives in Canadian primary care practices.

TI  - Impacts of Radiometric Uncertainty and Weather-Related Surface Conditions on Soil Moisture Retrievals with Sentinel-1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric uncertainty of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations and weather-related surface conditions caused by frozen conditions, snow and intercepted rain affect the backscatter (<mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics>) observations and limit the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals. This study estimates Sentinel-1's radiometric uncertainty, identifies the effects of weather-related surface conditions on <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> and investigates their impact on soil moisture retrievals for various conditions regarding soil moisture, surface roughness and incidence angle. Masking rules for the surface conditions that disturb <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> were developed based on meteorological measurements and timeseries of Sentinel-1 observations collected over five forests, five meadows and five cultivated fields in the eastern part of the Netherlands. The Sentinel-1 <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> observations appear to be affected by frozen conditions below an air temperature of 1<mml:semantics>degrees C</mml:semantics>, snow during Sentinel-1's morning overpasses on meadows and cultivated fields and interception after more than <mml:semantics>1.8</mml:semantics> <mml:semantics>m</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>m</mml:semantics> of rain in the 12 h preceding a Sentinel-1 overpass, whereas dew was not found to be of influence. After the application of these masking rules, the radiometric uncertainty was estimated by the standard deviation of the seasonal anomalies timeseries of the Sentinel-1 forest <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> observations. By spatially averaging the <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> observations, the Sentinel-1 radiometric uncertainty improves from <mml:semantics>0.85</mml:semantics> dB for a surface area of <mml:semantics>0.25</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>ha</mml:semantics> to <mml:semantics>0.30</mml:semantics> dB for 10 <mml:semantics>ha</mml:semantics> for the VV polarization and from <mml:semantics>0.89</mml:semantics> dB to <mml:semantics>0.36</mml:semantics> dB for the VH polarization, following approximately an inverse square root dependency on the surface area over which the <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> observations are averaged. Deviations in <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> were combined with the <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> sensitivity to soil moisture as simulated with the Integral Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model, which demonstrated that both the disturbing effects by the weather-related surface conditions (if not masked) and radiometric uncertainty have a significant impact on the soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1. The soil moisture retrieval uncertainty due to radiometric uncertainty ranges from <mml:semantics>0.01</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>m3</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>m-3</mml:semantics> up to <mml:semantics>0.17</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>m3</mml:semantics><mml:semantics>m-3</mml:semantics> for wet soils and small surface areas. The impacts on soil moisture retrievals are found to be weakly dependent on the surface roughness and the incidence angle, and strongly dependent on the surface area (or the <mml:semantics>sigma 0</mml:semantics> disturbance caused by a weather-related surface condition for a specific land cover type) and the soil moisture itself.

TI  - Exploring land use/land cover changes, drivers and their implications in contrasting agro-ecological environments of Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examined the trends, driving factors, and implications of land use/land cover (LULC) dynamics over the past 35 years (1982-2017) in three watersheds of the drought-prone areas that represent different agro-ecologies of Upper Blue Nile basin, Ethiopia: Guder (highland), Aba Gerima (midland), and Debatie (lowland). The changes in LULC were analyzed by integrating field observations, remote-sensing data (aerial photographs [1: 50,000 scale] and very high resolution [0.5-3.2 m] satellite images), and geographic information systems. The drivers of LULC were explored using key informant interviews and relevant literature reviews. The implications of LULC change on soil erosion and surface runoff responses were also evaluated. A minimum of four and maximum of six LULC classes were identified in each watershed over the study period. The study revealed that forest land was the dominant LULC class accounting for 40.9% and 32.0% in Guder and Aba Gerima, respectively in 1982. While in the same period, bush land (36.6%) was the dominant LULC class in Debatie watershed. From 1982 to 2016/2017, forest land, bush land, and grazing land respectively decreased by about 70%, 50%, and 27% in Guder; 65%, 49%, and 63% in Aba Gerima; and 63%, 59%, and 38% in Debatie. During the same period, cultivated land increased by approximately 40%, 129%, and 704% in Guder, Aba Gerima and Debatie, respectively. In contrast, between 2012 and 2017, plantation cover increased by about 400% in the Guder, mainly at the expense of cultivated land, which decreased by 40% for the same period. Population growth and associated changes in the farming practices were the major driving forces for the observed LULC changes in the study watersheds. The traditionally deleterious impacts of human activities on the environment have been recently reversed at an unprecedented rate, particularly at Guder and to a lesser extent at Aba Gerima, following the shift from the traditional annual cropping to more economically attractive tree-based farming practices such as Acacia decurrens plantation in Guder and khat (Cathy edulis) cultivation in Aba Gerima. The continued expansion of cultivated land combined with population growth positively linked to the increase of gully erosion and surface runoff potential in the study watersheds particularly, in Aba Gerima and Debatie watersheds. The Upper Blue Nile basin is currently experiencing both positive and negative socio-economic and environmental consequences of LULC dynamics. Hence, the present study can help form a basis for the appropriate development of land management policies and strategies in this and other basins experiencing similar problems.

TI  - Canopy Height and Above-Ground Biomass Retrieval in Tropical Forests Using Multi-Pass X- and C-Band Pol-InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia's landscape is strongly characterized by degradation and deforestation, which results in carbon release. This makes Indonesia one of the largest carbon sources worldwide. The study at hand, investigates monitoring of canopy height and above-ground biomass (AGB) from space in Indonesian tropical forests. Using data from 2015, the canopy height and AGB were modelled in Kalimantan based on quad-pol Pol-InSAR data from RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) and dual-pol Pol-InSAR data from TerraSAR-X (TS-X). Novel algorithms utilizing the Random Volume over Ground (RVoG) interferometric model and the Random Motion over Ground (RMoG) interferometric model were tested to obtain a more accurate and robust forest parameter estimation during dry weather conditions. As a reference for modelling canopy height and AGB, extensive field inventory as well as LiDAR and drone data collected in Kalimantan were used. The RMoG model-based height inversion algorithm led to more accurate results for canopy height than the RVoG model. Using RS-2 imagery, the independent validation displayed a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.63 and a slight overestimation for the modelled canopy height. The modelled canopy height from TS-X data achieved an R-2 of up to 0.66 and resulted in underestimated modelled canopy height. The resulting AGB estimation based on the modelled canopy height resulted in an R-2 of 0.83 for RS-2 data and 0.84 for TS-X data. The results of the different tested images varied since the acquisition parameters and the weather conditions changed during acquisitions. It can be concluded, that not all RS-2 and TS-X data is suitable for modelling canopy height from coherence. The parameters that most affect the canopy height model were identified as the baselines (temporal and perpendicular), HoA (height of ambiguity), incident angle and moist weather conditions, as well as the wavelength. Ascending and descending flight directions did not display influence. Globally available high-resolution information about canopy height and AGB is important for carbon accounting. The present study showed that Pol-InSAR data from TS-X and RS-2 could be used together with field inventories and high-resolution data such as drone or LiDAR data to support the carbon accounting in the context of REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) projects.

TI  - Volumetric Analysis of Reservoirs in Drought-Prone Areas Using Remote Sensing Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, the number of dams increased dramatically during the 20th century. As a result, monitoring water levels and storage volume of dam-reservoirs has become essential in order to understand water resource availability amid changing climate and drought patterns. Recent advancements in remote sensing data show great potential for studies pertaining to long-term monitoring of reservoir water volume variations. In this study, we used freely available remote sensing products to assess volume variations for Lake Mead, Lake Powell and reservoirs in California between 1984 and 2015. Additionally, we provided insights on reservoir water volume fluctuations and hydrological drought patterns in the region. We based our volumetric estimations on the area-elevation hypsometry relationship, by combining water areas from the Global Surface Water (GSW) monthly water history (MWH) product with corresponding water surface median elevation values from three different digital elevation models (DEM) into a regression analysis. Using Lake Mead and Lake Powell as our validation reservoirs, we calculated a volumetric time series for the GSW(MWH)-DEMmedian elevation combinations that showed a strong linear area (W-A) - elevation (W-H)' (R-2 > 0.75) hypsometry. Based on W-A-W-H' linearity and correlation analysis between the estimated and in situ volumetric time series, the methodology was expanded to reservoirs in California. Our volumetric results detected four distinct periods of water volume declines: 1987-1992, 2000-2004, 2007-2009 and 2012-2015 for Lake Mead, Lake Powell and in 40 reservoirs in California. We also used multiscalar Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) for San Joaquin drainage in California to assess regional links between the drought indicators and reservoir volume fluctuations. We found highest correlations between reservoir volume variations and the SPEI at medium time scales (12-18-24-36 months). Our work demonstrates the potential of processed, open source remote sensing products for reservoir water volume variations and provides insights on usability of these variations in hydrological drought monitoring. Furthermore, the spatial coverage and long-term temporal availability of our data presents an opportunity to transfer these methods for volumetric analyses on a global scale.

TI  - Ground Subsidence Susceptibility (GSS) Mapping in Grosseto Plain (Tuscany, Italy) Based on Satellite InSAR Data Using Frequency Ratio and Fuzzy Logic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed at evaluating and mapping Ground Subsidence Susceptibility (GSS) in the Grosseto plain (Tuscany Region, Italy) by exploiting multi-temporal satellite InSAR data and by applying two parallel approaches; a bivariate statistical analysis (Frequency Ratio) and a mathematical probabilistic model (Fuzzy Logic operator). The Grosseto plain experienced subsidence and sinkholes due to natural causes in the past and it is still suffering slow-moving ground lowering. Five conditioning subsidence-related factors were selected and managed in a GIS environment through an overlay pixel-by-pixel analysis. Firstly, multi-temporal ground subsidence inventory maps were prepared in the study area by starting from two inventories referred to distinct temporal intervals (2003-2009 and 2014-2019) derived from Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) data of ENVISAT and SENTINEL-1 satellites. Then, the susceptibility modelling was performed through the Frequency Ratio (FR) and Fuzzy Logic (FL) approaches. These analyses led to slightly different scenarios which were compared and discussed. Results show that flat areas on alluvial and colluvial deposits with thick sedimentary cover (higher than 20 m) on the bedrock in the central and eastern sectors of the plain are the most susceptible to land subsidence. The obtained FR- and FL-based GSS maps were finally validated with a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis, in order to estimate the overall performance of the models. The AUC (Area Under Curve) values of ROC analysis of the FR model were higher than the ones of FL model, suggesting that the former is a better and more appropriate predictor for subsidence susceptibility analysis in the study area. In conclusion, GSS maps provided a qualitative overview of the subsidence scenarios and may be helpful to predict and preliminarily identify high-risk areas for environmental local authorities and decision makers in charge of land use planning in the study area. Finally, the presented methodologies to derive GSS maps are easily reproducible and could also be applied and tested in other test sites worldwide, in order to check the modeling performance in different environmental settings.

TI  - An Atmospheric Phase Screen Estimation Strategy Based on Multichromatic Analysis for Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In synthetic aperture radar (SAR), the separation of the height between the ground subsidence phase components and the atmospheric phase delay mixed in the global SAR interferometry (InSAR) phase information is an issue of primary concern in the remote sensing community. This paper describes a complete procedure to address the challenge to estimate the atmospheric phase screen and to separate the three-phase components by exploiting only one InSAR image couple. This solution has the capability to process persistent scatterers subsidence maps potentially using only two multitemporal InSAR couples observed in any atmospheric condition. The solution is obtained by emulating the atmosphere compensation technique that is largely used by the global positioning system where two frequencies are used in order to estimate and compensate the positioning errors due to atmosphere parameters' variations. A sub-chirping and sub-Doppler algorithm for atmospheric compensation is proposed, which allows the successful separation of the height from the subsidence and the atmosphere parameters from the interferometric phase observed on one InSAR couple. The results are given processing images of two InSAR couples observed by the COSMO-SkyMed satellite system.

TI  - Developing a New Machine-Learning Algorithm for Estimating Chlorophyll-a Concentration in Optically Complex Waters: A Case Study for High Northern Latitude Waters by Using Sentinel 3 OLCI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in high northern latitude waters has been receiving increased focus due to the rapid environmental changes in the sub-Arctic, Arctic. Spaceborne optical instruments allow the continuous monitoring of the occurrence, distribution, and amount of Chl-a. In recent years, the Ocean and Land Color Instruments (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel 3 (S3) A and B satellites were launched, which provide data about various aquatic environments on advantageous spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions with high SNR. Although S3 OLCI could be favorable to monitor high northern latitude waters, there have been several challenges related to Chl-a concentration retrieval in these waters due to their unique optical properties coupled with challenging environments including high sun zenith angle, presence of sea ice, and frequent cloud covers. In this work, we aim to overcome these difficulties by developing a machine-learning (ML) approach designed to estimate Chl-a concentration from S3 OLCI data in high northern latitude optically complex waters. The ML model is optimized and requires only three S3 OLCI bands, reflecting the physical characteristic of Chl-a as input in the regression process to estimate Chl-a concentration with improved accuracy in terms of the bias (five times improvements.) The ML model was optimized on data from Arctic, coastal, and open waters, and showed promising performance. Finally, we present the performance of the optimized ML approach by computing Chl-a maps and corresponding certainty maps in highly complex sub-Arctic and Arctic waters. We show how these certainty maps can be used as a support to understand possible radiometric calibration issues in the retrieval of Level 2 reflectance over these waters. This can be a useful tool in identifying erroneous Level 2 Remote sensing reflectance due to possible failure of the atmospheric correction algorithm.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in clinical stage I testicular cancer enables early detection of occult metastatic disease
T2  - BJU INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To report the long-term results of the sentinel node (SN) approach in patients with clinical stage I testicular tumours in our facility. Patients and Methods We conducted an analysis of 27 consecutive patients suspected of clinical stage I testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) and treated with an SN procedure at our tertiary referral centre. SNs were identified using lymphoscintigraphy with or without single-photo-emission computed tomography with CT (SPECT/CT). Patients underwent laparoscopic retroperitoneal SN excision with inguinal orchiectomy. Patients with a tumour-positive SN underwent adjuvant treatment. Follow-up was conducted according to then-current guidelines. Results In two patients, no SNs were visualized on scintigraphy. In the remaining 25 patients, a median (range) of 3 (1-4) SNs per patient were removed. Two patients showed no malignancy on histopathological examination of the testis. Of the 23 patients diagnosed with TGCT (16 seminomas, seven non-seminomas), three (13.0%) had occult metastatic disease. All 23 patients were without evidence of disease at a median (range) follow-up of 63.9 (29.0-143.4) months. Conclusion The SN procedure allows early identification of patients with occult metastatic disease in clinical stage I TGCT, enabling early treatment.

TI  - Untargeted analysis of nanoLC-HRMS data by ANOVA-PCA to highlight metabolites in <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> after in vivo exposure to pharmaceuticals
T2  - TALANTA
M3  - Article
AB  - In Western Europe, river water quality can be assessed using sentinel species such as the amphipod Gammarus fossarum. In this work of environmental metabolomics, the objective was to develop suitable chemometrics methods, using a limited number of individuals, to assess the modification of the metabolism of G. fossarum exposed to two human pharmaceuticals. Males and females gammarids were exposed to a mixture of the anxiolytic oxazepam and the antiepileptic carbamazepine (1000 ng L-1 ) for 14 days under laboratory conditions according to a full factorial design 2(2) (repeated 5 times). They were analyzed at the single individual scale using a method including a uQuEChERS type extraction followed by a nanoliquid chromatography analysis coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. The molecular fingerprints obtained were investigated using XCMS. Several corrections of experimental drifts (by using lock mass and Quality Control samples) were tested prior to using APCA + method for the exploitation of the unbalanced designed data. Signal reproducibility was greatly improved by the lock mass normalisation. From the experimental design, a significant effect of both experimental factors "exposure to the mixture" and "gammarid gender" on the signals measured were highlighted by APCA+ . Finally, the results obtained made it possible to identify variables responsible for each of the factor effects.

TI  - Winds of Change for Future Operational AMV at EUMETSAT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - EUMETSAT, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites, is one of the key contributors to global atmospheric motion vector (AMV) production around the world. Its current contribution includes geostationary satellites at 0.0 and 41.5 degrees east, and several products extracted from the Metop low-orbit satellites. These last ones mainly cover high-latitude regions completing the observations from the geostationary ring. In the upcoming years, EUMETSAT will launch a new generation of geostationary and low-orbit satellites. The imager instruments Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and METImage will take over the nominal AMV production at EUMETSAT around 2022 and 2024. The enhanced characteristics of these new-generation instruments are expected to increase AMV production and to improve the quality of the products. This paper presents an overview of the current EUMETSAT AMV operational production, together with a roadmap of the preparation activities for the new generation of satellites. The characteristics of the upcoming AMV products are described and compared to the current operational AMV products. This paper also presents a recent investigation into AMV extraction using the Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument, as well as the retrieval of wind profiles from infrared sounders.

TI  - India's e-reverse auctions (2017-2018) for allocating renewable energy capacity: An evaluation
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the renewable energy sector of India, the system of Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) is being rapidly replaced by the mechanism of e-reverse auctions to discover the lowest tariff. 23.375 GW of solar, wind and hybrid capacity has been auctioned by central and state agencies during the period 2017-2018. The auctions resulted in historical low bids, due to the expectation of low price of capital goods like solar modules. The highest winning bids in solar auctions were, on an average, 36.49% less than the ongoing solar FIT in the states that held the e-reverse auctions. Consequently, the FIT has been revised downward. While the auctions proved to be cost effective, commissioning of projects remains a suspect. Only 58.6% of solar capacity allocated through the auctions held in 2017 got commissioned by the end of 2018. Project developers face the winner's curse due to increased import price of solar modules. The bids were revised upward in 2018, due to expected cost escalation because of safeguard duty imposed on import of solar panels. 8 GW solar bids got cancelled in FY 2018-19. Deployment of projects got affected as the distribution companies attempted to force winners of auctions to match tariff with lowest bids in subsequent auctions. This article evaluates the e-reverse auctions on account of their impact on price, deployment and financing of projects.

TI  - Identification, characterisation and analysis of the Oltrepo Pavese calanchi in the Northern Apennines (Italy)
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Badlands are characteristic erosional forms distributed along the entire Apennines. In the Italian context badland areas are called "calanchi", the plural of the word "calanco". In this paper we present the first calanchi inventory map of the Oltrepo Pavese area, Northern Apennines (Italy). In total 263 calanchi were mapped using remote sensing techniques like Orthophotos, Google Earth images, as well as field recognition. Moreover, calanchi were characterised from a geomorphologic, geologic and a morphometric point of view. The calanchi of the Oltrepo Pavese have been categorised in two geomorphological classes based on process related morphologies. In the study area calanchi mainly occur in soft sedimentary bedrock materials such as melanges, marls, claystones, and interstratified rocks. The results show that calanchi formations are often related to faults and tectonic lineaments present in the study area. Moreover, we analyse a 5 m cell size Digital Terrain Model to detect correlations between calanchi and morphometric indices. The calanchi, defined and categorised for the first time in the study area, show typical morphometric characteristics of Apennine calanchi forms and features. In particular, they occur on concave south-facing slopes on soft bedrock formations. Finally, a multitemporal air photo interpretation over a 40 years period indicated a general decrease in calanchi areas. The area reduction is mainly correlated to intensive land use changes combined with variations of precipitation pattern. The revegetation trend was also confirmed by NDVI analysis based on Landsat satellites images. The calanchi were digitized and stored in a GIS database providing the information for future quantitative modelling assessments. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - A top-down approach for semantic segmentation of big remote sensing images
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing amount of remote sensing data has opened the door to new challenging research topics. Nowadays, significant efforts are devoted to pixel and object based classification in case of massive data. This paper addresses the problem of semantic segmentation of big remote sensing images. To do this, we proposed a top-down approach based on two main steps. The first step aims to compute features at the object-level. These features constitute the input of a multi-layer feed-forward network to generate a structure for classifying remote sensing objects. The goal of the second step is to use this structure to label every pixel in new images. Several experiments are conducted based on real datasets and results show good classification accuracy of the proposed approach. In addition, the comparison with existing classification techniques proves the effectiveness of the proposed approach especially for big remote sensing data.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics of Invasive Para Grass on a Monsoonal Floodplain, Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - African para grass (Urochloa mutica) is an invasive weed that has become prevalent across many important freshwater wetlands of the world. In northern Australia, including the World Heritage landscape of Kakadu National Park (KNP), its dense cover can displace ecologically, genetically and culturally significant species, such as the Australian native rice (Oryza spp.). In regions under management for biodiversity conservation para grass is often beyond eradication. However, its targeted control is also necessary to manage and preserve site-specific wetland values. This requires an understanding of para grass spread-patterns and its potential impacts on valuable native vegetation. We apply a multi-scale approach to examine the spatial dynamics and impact of para grass cover across a 181 km(2) floodplain of KNP. First, we measure the overall displacement of different native vegetation communities across the floodplain from 1986 to 2006. Using high spatial resolution satellite imagery in conjunction with historical aerial-photo mapping, we then measure finer-scale, inter-annual, changes between successive dry seasons from 1990 to 2010 (for a 48 km(2) focus area); Para grass presence-absence maps from satellite imagery (2002 to 2010) were produced with an object-based machine-learning approach (stochastic gradient boosting). Changes, over time, in mapped para grass areas were then related to maps of depth-habitat and inter-annual fire histories. Para grass invasion and establishment patterns varied greatly in time and space. Wild rice communities were the most frequently invaded, but the establishment and persistence of para grass fluctuated greatly between years, even within previously invaded communities. However, these different patterns were also shown to vary with different depth-habitat and recent fire history. These dynamics have not been previously documented and this understanding presents opportunities for intensive para grass management in areas of high conservation value, such as those occupied by wild rice.

AB  - Objectives To determine the proportion of 50-75-year-old patients who visit a primary care physician's (PCP) office and were tested for colorectal cancer (CRC) by either colonoscopy within 10 years or fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) within 2 years. To describe the variation in care between PCPs and factors associated with these proportions. Methods Cross-sectional data collected between April and December 2017. Participants: PCPs reporting for the Swiss Sentinel Surveillance Network. Each PCP collected demographic data and CRC testing status from 40 consecutive patients. Measurements: proportions of patients up to date with CRC screening and method used (colonoscopy/FOBT/Other); variation in the outcome measures between PCPs; association of physician-level factors with main outcomes. Results 91/129 PCPs collected data from 3451 patients; 45% had been tested for CRC within recommended intervals (41% colonoscopy, 4% FOBT). The proportions of patients tested and testing with colonoscopy versus FOBT varied widely between PCPs. Language region was associated with PCPs' rate of FOBT prescription. Conclusions Less than half of patients who visited PCPs in Switzerland were tested for CRC within recommended intervals. PCPs varied widely in their testing practices.

TI  - Refugee Camp Monitoring and Environmental Change Assessment of Kutupalong, Bangladesh, Based on Radar Imagery of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately one million refugees of the Rohingya minority population in Myanmar crossed the border to Bangladesh on 25 August 2017, seeking shelter from systematic oppression and persecution. This led to a dramatic expansion of the Kutupalong refugee camp within a couple of months and a decrease of vegetation in the surrounding forests. As many humanitarian organizations demand frameworks for camp monitoring and environmental impact analysis, this study suggests a workflow based on spaceborne radar imagery to measure the expansion of settlements and the decrease of forests. Eleven image pairs of Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2, as well as a digital elevation model, were used for a supervised land cover classification. These were trained on automatically-derived reference areas retrieved from multispectral images to reduce required user input and increase transferability. Results show an overall decrease of vegetation of 1500 hectares, of which 20% were used to expand the camp and 80% were deforested, which matches findings from other studies of this case. The time-series analysis reduced the impact of seasonal variations on the results, and accuracies between 88% and 95% were achieved. The most important input variables for the classification were vegetation indices based on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter intensity, but topographic parameters also played a role.

TI  - Creating New Stories: The Role of Evaluation in Truth and Reconciliation
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PROGRAM EVALUATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the origins of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, with the focus on how evaluators and their professional associations can contribute to truth and reconciliation. At the professional association level, the actions that the Canadian Evaluation Society has taken in committing itself to incorporating truth and reconciliation into its values, principles, and practices are highlighted. At the individual level, evaluators are challenged to reflect on their practice. As storytellers, evaluators have been complicit in telling stories that, while highlighting the damaging legacy of residential schools, have had little influence on changing the status quo for Indigenous peoples and communities. The need to reconsider who should be telling the stories and what stories should be told are critical issues upon which evaluators must reflect. The way forward also needs to include a move toward a more holistic view, incorporating the interaction between human and natural systems, thus better reflecting an Indigenous, rather than a Western, worldview. The imperative for evaluators, both in Canada and globally, to see Indigenous peoples "as creators of their own destinies and experts in their own realities" is essential if evaluation is to become "a source of enrichment ... and not a source of depletion or denigration."

TI  - Recruitment of native parasitic wasps to populations of the invasive winter moth in the northeastern United States
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological communities may be resistant to invasive species through a combination of top-down and bottom-up mechanisms, including predation, competition, parasitism, and disease. In particular, natural enemies that cross over from native species to use newly introduced non-native species as hosts can influence invasive species population dynamics and may slow down invasions. However, research on parasitism in biological invasions is lagging behind research on biological invasions in general. We used the model species winter moth (Operophtera brumata) to study the effect of recruitment of native parasitoids on an invasive population of winter moth in the northeastern United States. We deployed sentinel pupae over 4 years across this population's range, identified recovered parasitoids, and measured the rate of parasitism by native sources across years, seasons, invasion history, and host densities. Native Pimpla wasps inflicted 98% of the parasitism detected, resulting in an annual average of 15-40% mortality on pupae not depredated. Pimpla were present across all years, seasons, and sites. Where winter moth has invaded, parasitism was greatest when winter moth pupal density was high (i.e., positive density-dependent mortality) suggesting that Pimpla is helping to regulate the population. The wasps were morphologically identified as Pimpla aequalis Provancher; however, using a multilocus genetic comparison approach, they were determined to comprise two cryptic species. Overall, this study shows that recruitment of these native wasps to the invasive winter moth population is likely playing a significant role in regulating population outbreaks and is aiding in biological control of winter moth.

TI  - Prophetic Endurance and Eschatological Restoration: Exhortation and Conclusion in the Epistle of James
T2  - EXPOSITORY TIMES
M3  - Article
AB  - The epistle of James provides a window into a messianic movement that is beginning to develop into a community of faithful amidst a larger Hellenistic socio-cultural environment. It presents a series of exhortations crossing the spectrum of life situations audiences encounter as they settle into community together. Throughout the instruction, a foundational moral code is presupposed through which the author constructs the requisite worldview. Further, James speaks to this community through the full authority of 'the name of the Lord' and understands himself as both servant and teacher in this new life in light of the coming of that Lord (1:1; 3:1; 5:7-9). The last fourteen verses of the epistle offer a final essay on the need to stand fast through perseverance and prayer, as well as a summary statement of the goal of the entire effort. The formation of the community engenders a new action arising from the 'implanted word' that will produce a 'kind of first fruits' of God's creatures who lead the way of salvation (1:18, 21; 5:19-20). The concluding injunction indicates that this way is tantamount to eschatological restoration.

TI  - Could nature help children rise out of poverty? Green space and future earnings from a cohort in ten US cities
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Growing up in poverty is associated with poor health, and the American Dream of upward mobility is becoming an illusion for many low-income children. But nearby green space can support academic achievement, creativity, and emotional regulation, and these traits might help children rise out of poverty.Objectives: To examine the relationship between recent incomes of children born into poverty in the ten largest U.S. cities and densities of residential green space during childhood.Methods: We calculate park proximity, park acreage, new park development, and NDVI greenness for 1980-1990 from Landsat and Trust for Public Land data. We obtain the 2014 income for children born between 1978 and 1982 into families in poverty from The Opportunity Atlas cohort, aggregated at the tract level (n = 5849).Results: Conditional autoregressive (CAR) models of tracts show statistically significant associations between income rank and above-average levels of greenness but not between income rank and park measures, adjusting for individual and neighborhood confounders and spatial autocorrelation. We estimate that, over a 30-year career, children growing up in tracts with the most vegetative cover will earn cumulatively $28,000 more than children growing up in tracts with the least cover, on average. Tracts with lower than average levels of precipitation, higher disadvantage, higher population density, or higher annual temperatures do not show beneficial effects of green space.Conclusions: Greenness may be weakly associated with children rising out of poverty in wetter, cooler, less dense, more advantaged census tracts.

TI  - A GeoNode-Based Platform for an Effective Exploitation of Advanced DInSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents the development of an efficient tool for managing, visualizing, analysing, and integrating with other data sources, the deformation time-series obtained by applying the advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) techniques. To implement such a tool we extend the functionalities of GeoNode, which is a web-based platform providing an open source framework based on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, that allows development of Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). In particular, our efforts have been dedicated to enable the GeoNode platform to effectively analyze and visualize the spatio/temporal characteristics of the DInSAR deformation time-series and their related products. Moreover, the implemented multi-thread based new functionalities allow us to efficiently upload and update large data volumes of the available DInSAR results into a dedicated geodatabase. The examples we present, based on Sentinel-1 DInSAR results relevant to Italy, demonstrate the effectiveness of the extended version of the GeoNode platform.

TI  - The Pathogenesis and Clinical Management of Cutaneous Melanoma: An Evidence-Based Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous malignant melanoma (CM) is the leading cause of skin cancer-related mortality and accounts for approximately 1,250 deaths in Canada each year. It is also one of few cancers continuing to display rates of increasing incidence throughout the world. The past decade has brought significant growth in our understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical management of CM. This evidence-based review synthesizes that knowledge, beginning with a review of the epidemiology and etiology of the disease followed by a broad review of the roles of diagnostic imaging in its management. Special attention is given to the role of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) in supporting assessment at primary presentation of disease, follow-up to surgical and nonsurgical treatment, and for the surveillance of high-risk asymptomatic patients. After a brief review of current treatment options, this article concludes with a demonstration of how and when uncertainty exists at the point of care systematic review processes may be used to resolve clinical questions.Learning Objectives:By the end of this Continuing Medical Education article, participants will be able to1. Describe the epidemiology and etiology of cutaneous melanoma,2. Describe broadly the role of diagnostic imaging in the clinical management of cutaneous melanoma,3. Describe the specific roles and limitations of F-18-FDG PET/CT in the clinical management of cutaneous melanoma,4. Describe broadly the best practice in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma,5. Define the value of systematic review for synthesizing knowledge pertaining to a specific clinical question, and6. Discuss the utility of F-18 FDG PET/CT in the management of early-stage (AJCC 0-IIc) cutaneous melanoma.This is a CME article and provides the equivalent of 2 hours of continuing education that may be applied to your professional development credit system. A 12-question multiple choice quiz follows this reading. Please note that no formalized credit (Category A) is available from CAMRT.

TI  - Evaluation of Radiation Exposure During Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Study
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSentinel node biopsy (SNB) is the standard of care for nodal staging in breast cancer. Currently, radioisotope-guided SNB is the standard technique. We have undertaken this study to analyse radiation exposure during SNB for breast cancer over a significant period of time.MethodsThe study was conducted over a period of 41months and included 183 patients. The radioisotope was usually administered the day preceding the surgery at a dose of 40MBq (10%), and a lower dose of 20MBq (10%) was given if injected on the day of surgery. The radiation exposure was measured by dosimeters worn by the surgeon and surgical assistant.Results The surgical procedures performed were mastectomy and SNB (56 patients), wide local excision and SNB (109 patients), and SNB alone (18 patients). The median time interval between the injection and surgery was 19.3h, and median duration of surgery 93min. The annual exposure for the surgeon was 0.125mSv (range 0.01-0.03mSv) and for the assistant was 0.265 (range 0.01-0.13mSv).Conclusion Contrary to other studies, we found the radiation exposure in the assistant was higher than that in the surgeon and we think this is because the assistant is positioned closer to the injection site during the procedure. However, the cumulative levels of radiation with SNB were very low and significantly below the permissible limits. The timing of injection, type of breast surgery and duration of procedure did not affect the levels of radiation exposure.

TI  - Detecting problematic beach widths for the recreational function along the Gulf of Valencia (Spain) from Landsat 8 subpixel shorelines
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work shows a continuous and regional monitoring of the beach width and how to link it with the recreational function of these spaces. Shorelines automatically derived from Landsat 8 satellite were employed for this purpose, covering up to 83 dates (2013-2016) and 150 km of beaches. The study included the microtidal beaches of the Gulf of Valencia, a strongly developed coast with intensive use in the Western Mediterranean. Beach widths were defined in alongshore coastal segments of 80-m length. Annual mean width and annual percentiles appeared as representative statistics of the beach state and the most unfavorable widths occurred throughout the year. Considering these statistical descriptors, beach segments were classified according to their adequacy to sustain a recreational function. The integration of descriptors of the beach width and use of the beach data on a regional scale offers a holistic approach to identify potentially problematic segments, crucial information for coastal managers.

TI  - Modeling 3D Free-geometry Volumetric Sources Associated to Geological and Anthropogenic Hazards from Space and Terrestrial Geodetic Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Recent decades have shown an explosion in the quantity and quality of geodetic data, mainly space-based geodetic data, that are being applied to geological and anthropogenic hazards. This has produced the need for new approaches for analyzing, modeling and interpreting these geodetic data. Typically, modeling of deformation and gravity changes follows an inverse approach using analytical or numerical solutions, where normally regular geometries (point sources, disks, prolate or oblate spheroids, etc.) are assumed at the initial stages and the inversion is carried out in a linear context. Here we review an original methodology for the simultaneous, nonlinear inversion of gravity changes and/or surface deformation (measured with different techniques) to determine 3D (three-dimensional) bodies, without any a priori assumption about their geometries, embedded into an elastic or poroelastic medium. Such a fully nonlinear inversion has led to interesting results in volcanic environments and in the study of water tables variation due to its exploitation. This methodology can be used to invert geodetic remote sensing data or terrestrial data alone, or in combination.

TI  - Nature and the Sacred. The "Migrant Imagery" between Animism, Religion and Ecospirituality: an Exploratory Study among Asylum-seekers
T2  - RELIGIONI E SOCIETA-RIVISTA DI SCIENZE SOCIALI DELLA RELIGIONE
M3  - Article
AB  - In in this paper we will analyze the phenomenon of ecospirituality, highlighting its most relevant aspects. in the first part of the article we will briefly analyze some features of this unprecedented phenomenon. in the main part, through a qualitative explorative analysis, we will show the characteristics of what we have defined as the "migrant imagery". We will focus on the theme of "sacralization of nature" (Cardano 1995 e 1997) thanks to the information obtained from the interviewed subjects (asylum-seekers and beneficiaries of humanitarian and international protection from Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Togo and Ivory Coast). In this way it will be possible to detect any similarities and discrepancies between two different cosmologies, one shaped by Western modernization, the other largely not involved in this process. We have found out elements of similarity in ways that we will explain between the Western worldview and that of the asylum-seekers communities, concerning the experience of the sacred. We have also noted a sort of "reversed overlapping": while Western postmodernity seems to witness a return of the sacred, the "forced migrants", to the extent of the examined sample, are the social indicators of an ongoing process of secularization or rationalization of the "religion of spirits", through a gradual Christianization and Islamization.The hypothesis is that religious belief with its typical syncretic meanings could work as a symbolic resource, in relation with other important factors of social integration.

TI  - A Copernicus Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Classification Framework for the 2020+ European Common Agricultural Policy: A Case Study in Valencia (Spain)
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a methodology for deriving an agreement map between the Spanish Land Parcel Information System (LPIS), also known as SIGPAC, and a classification map obtained from multitemporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The study area comprises the province of Valencia (Spain). The approach exploits predictions and class probabilities obtained from an ensemble method of decision trees (boosting trees). The overall accuracy reaches 91.18% when using only Sentinel-2 data and increases up to 93.96% when Sentinel-1 data are added in the training process. Blending both Setninel-1 and Sentinel-2 data causes a remarkable classification improvement ranging from 3.6 to 8.7 percentage points over shrubs, forest, and pasture with trees, which are the most confusing classes in the optical domain as demonstrated by a spectral separability analysis. The derived agreement map is built upon combining per pixel classifications, their probabilities, and the Spanish LPIS. This map can be exploited into the decision-making chain for subsidies payment to cope with the 2020+ European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

TI  - Automated Cloud and Cloud-Shadow Masking for Landsat 8 Using Multitemporal Images in a Variety of Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8 images have been widely used for many applications, but cloud and cloud-shadow cover issues remain. In this study, multitemporal cloud masking (MCM), designed to detect cloud and cloud-shadow for Landsat 8 in tropical environments, was improved for application in sub-tropical environments, with the greatest improvement in cloud masking. We added a haze optimized transformation (HOT) test and thermal band in the previous MCM algorithm to improve the algorithm in the detection of haze, thin-cirrus cloud, and thick cloud. We also improved the previous MCM in the detection of cloud-shadow by adding a blue band. In the visual assessment, the algorithm can detect a thick cloud, haze, thin-cirrus cloud, and cloud-shadow accurately. In the statistical assessment, the average user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of cloud masking results across the different land cover in the selected area was 98.03% and 98.98%, respectively. On the other hand, the average user's accuracy and producer's accuracy of cloud-shadow masking results was 97.97% and 96.66%, respectively. Compared to the Landsat 8 cloud cover assessment (L8 CCA) algorithm, MCM has better accuracies, especially in cloud-shadow masking. Our preliminary tests showed that the new MCM algorithm can detect cloud and cloud-shadow for Landsat 8 in a variety of environments.

AB  - We conducted comprehensive Raman and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic studies on the whole rock and lithic clasts of Northwest Africa (NWA) 4884 to constrain its igneous mineralogy and metamorphic characteristics. NWA 4884 is composed of mostly clinopyroxene (25.8 vol.%), pigeonite (16.6 vol.%), plagioclase (26.6 vol.%), maskelynite (8.1 vol.%), olivine (20.7 vol.%), minor tridymite (1.0 vol.%), quartz (0.2 vol.%), and ilmenite (0.5 vol.%). Lithic clasts contain mafic rocks including plutonic ultramafic cumulate, olivine gabbro, mare basalt, and feldspathic rocks including noritic anorthosite and impact melt breccia. Raman and FTIR spectroscopic analyses are combined to investigate the shock history of this breccia and revealed that NWA 4884 is highly shocked (17.9-48.1 GPa recorded in plagioclase). The combination of bulk composition and remote sensing data provides possible source regions of NWA 4884: the southern Lacus Veris (20.5 degrees S, 84.5 degrees W) within Orientale basin and the western mare unit (45.3 degrees N, 151.3 degrees E) of Campbell Crater. The pairing relationship among NWA 4884, Yamato 793274, Queen Alexandra Range 94281, and NWA 7611 is supported by their petrographic, mineral, and compositional similarities. Our work demonstrates the potential of Raman and FTIR spectroscopies to shed light on igneous petrology and the bombardment history of the Moon.

TI  - Joint 3D-Wind Retrievals with Stereoscopic Views from MODIS and GOES
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs), derived by tracking patterns, represent the winds in a layer characteristic of the pattern. AMV height (or pressure), important for applications in atmospheric research and operational meteorology, is usually assigned using observed IR brightness temperatures with a modeled atmosphere and can be inaccurate. Stereoscopic tracking provides a direct geometric height measurement of the pattern that an AMV represents. We extend our previous work with multi-angle imaging spectro-radiometer (MISR) and GOES to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the GOES-R series advanced baseline imager (ABI). MISR is a unique satellite instrument for stereoscopy with nine angular views along track, but its images have a narrow (380 km) swath and no thermal IR channels. MODIS provides a much wider (2330 km) swath and eight thermal IR channels that pair well with all but two ABI channels, offering a rich set of potential applications. Given the similarities between MODIS and VIIRS, our methods should also yield similar performance with VIIRS. Our methods, as enabled by advanced sensors like MODIS and ABI, require high-accuracy geographic registration in both systems but no synchronization of observations. AMVs are retrieved jointly with their heights from the disparities between triplets of ABI scenes and the paired MODIS granule. We validate our retrievals against MISR-GOES retrievals, operational GOES wind products, and by tracking clear-sky terrain. We demonstrate that the 3D-wind algorithm can produce high-quality AMV and height measurements for applications from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the upper troposphere, including cold-air outbreaks, wildfire smoke plumes, and hurricanes.

TI  - Monitoring agricultural field trafficability using Sentinel-1
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of heavy mobile machinery in agriculture for tillage and harvesting is now indispensable since it facilitates farming over large areas. However, one of the impacts of regular and prolonged use of heavy mobile machinery is soil compaction. To help minimize this harmful effect, trafficability of agricultural fields needs to be determined. Soil moisture acts as one of the dominant controls for field trafficability. Therefore satellites such as Sentinel-1, which is one source of spatio-temporal soil moisture information, could be useful in assessing trafficable conditions. One limitation of satellite-derived soil moisture is that only the upper surface layer is mapped. In this study, we determined the feasibility of Sentinel-1 surface soil moisture to monitor trafficability over 2016-2017. We first determined coupled conditions when surface soil moisture is a good indicator for values at the subsurface. We applied a probabilistic approach to determine trafficability using extensive in situ measurements of penetration resistance and surface soil moisture over a variety of crops. Trafficability is expressed as the probability that penetration resistance will exceed a threshold, for a given soil moisture value. Furthermore, we investigated the variability encountered from these measurements to gain insights on other temporal controls. Our results show coupled conditions for soil moisture >= 0.19 cm(3) cm(-3) and there is an almost 1:1 correspondence between surface and subsurface values. For decoupled conditions, values at the subsurface can be two times more than the surface. An increase in penetration resistance variability coincided with the maturity of crops for cultivated fields. Aside from soil moisture, root growth may have a significant impact on the temporal variability of soil's penetration resistance. The status of trafficability can be monitored through the high temporal resolution of Sentinel-1. However, aggregation to coarser resolutions maybe necessary as its original 10 m resolution may be suboptimal, based on validation against in situ measurements. Days favorable for traffic were observed in early spring. This information can aid farmers in the timing of tillage activities or for water managers in deciding to adjust water levels to meet agricultural demands.

TI  - Post-emplacement dynamics of andesitic lava flows at Volcan de Colima, Mexico, revealed by radar and optical remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We used optical and radar remote sensing datasets to map, estimate the volume, and measure the surface displacements of lava flows emplaced on the flanks of Volcan de Colima, Mexico by extrusion of lava dome material from the end of 2014 to early 2016. Our main result is that the flow motion of the lava contributes significantly to the recorded displacements several months after its emplacement. First, we mapped the deposits and estimated their volumes using two Digital Elevation Models (DEM), one derived from radar data acquired before the peak of activity and one derived from optical images acquired just after this peak of activity. Coherence information derived from the radar dataset added some temporal constraints on the timing of emplacement of various deposits. We thus estimated a mean extrusion rate of 1-2 m(3)s(-1) between November 2014 and February 2015. We then used a new approach to reconstruct the 3D displacement field, taking advantage of images acquired by the same satellite, on both ascending and descending tracks, and using a physical a priori on the direction of horizontal displacements. Our results show that about 2 cm yr(-1) of horizontal motion is still recorded a few months after the emplacement on the SW lava flow, which is the only one covered by the two-acquisition geometries. In order to differentiate the potential causes of the observed displacements, we modeled the thermal contraction of the lava flow using a finite element numerical method. Removing the contribution of thermoelastic contraction from the measured displacements enable to infer both the viscoelastic loading and flow motion effects from the residuals. Results show that, thermal contraction, flow motion and viscoelastic loading contribute significantly to the displacements recorded. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Finding behavioral parameterization for a 1-D water balance model by multi-criteria evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is often estimated by numerical simulation. However, to produce accurate simulations, these models usually require on-site measurements for parameterization or calibration. We have to make sure that the model realistically reproduces both, the temporal patterns of soil moisture and evapotranspiration. In this study, we combine three sources of information: (i) measurements of sap velocities; (ii) soil moisture; and (iii) expert knowledge on local runoff generation and water balance to define constraints for a "behavioral" forest stand water balance model. Aiming for a behavioral model, we adjusted soil moisture at saturation, bulk resistance parameters and the parameters of the water retention curve (WRC). We found that the shape of the WRC influences substantially the behavior of the simulation model. Here, only one model realization could be referred to as "behavioral". All other realizations failed for a least one of our evaluation criteria: Not only transpiration and soil moisture are simulated consistently with our observations, but also total water balance and runoff generation processes. The introduction of a multi-criteria evaluation scheme for the detection of unrealistic outputs made it possible to identify a well performing parameter set. Our findings indicate that measurement of different fluxes and state variables instead of just one and expert knowledge concerning runoff generation facilitate the parameterization of a hydrological model.

TI  - Exploring the synergy between Landsat and ASAR towards improving thematic mapping accuracy of optical EO data
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) provides a unique means of obtaining information on land use/cover and of its changes, which is of key importance in many scientific and practical applications. EO data is already widely used, for example, in environmental practices or decision-making related to food availability and security. As such, it is imperative to examine the suitability of different EO datasets, including their synergies, in respect to their ability to create products and tools for such practices and to guide effectively such decisions. This work aims at exploring the added value of the synergistic use of optical and radar data (from the Landsat TM and Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) sensors respectively). Such information can help towards improving the accuracy of land cover classifications from EO datasets. As a case study, the region of Wales in the UK has been used. Two classifications-one based on optical data alone and another one developed from the synergy of optical and RADAR datasets acquired nearly, concurrently were developed for the studied region. Evaluation of the derived land/use cover maps was performed on the basis of the confusion matrix using validation points derived from a Phase 1 habitat map of Wales. The results showed 15% increase in overall accuracy (84% from 69%) and kappa coefficient (0.81 from 0.65) using the synergistic approach over the scenario where only optical data were used in the classification. In addition, McNemar's test was used to assess the statistical significance of the obtained results. Results of this test provided further confirmed that the use of optical data synergistically with the radar data provides more accurate land use/cover maps in comparison with the use of optical data alone.

TI  - Soil Organic Carbon Mapping Using LUCAS Topsoil Database and Sentinel-2 Data: An Approach to Reduce Soil Moisture and Crop Residue Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) loss is one of the main causes of soil degradation in croplands. Thus, spatial and temporal monitoring of SOC is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspective. In this regard, the high temporal, spatial, and spectral resolution of the Sentinel-2 data can be exploited for monitoring SOC contents in the topsoil of croplands. In this study, we aim to test the effect of the threshold for a spectral index linked to soil moisture and crop residues on the performance of SOC prediction models using the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) Sentinel-2 and the European Land Use/cover Area frame Statistical survey (LUCAS) topsoil database. The LUCAS spectral data resampled according to MSI/Sentinel-2 bands, which were used to build SOC prediction models combining pairs of the bands. The SOC models were applied to a Sentinel-2 image acquired in North-Eastern Germany after removing the pixels characterized by clouds and green vegetation. Then, we tested different thresholds of the Normalized Burn Ratio 2 (NBR2) index in order to mask moist soil pixels and those with dry vegetation and crop residues. The model accuracy was tested on an independent validation database and the best ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) was obtained using the average between bands B6 and B5 (Red-Edge Carbon Index: RE-CI) (RPD: 4.4) and between B4 and B5 (Red-Red-Edge Carbon Index: RRE-CI) (RPD: 2.9) for a very low NBR2 threshold (0.05). Employing a higher NBR2 tolerance (higher NBR2 values), the mapped area increases to the detriment of the validation accuracy. The proposed approach allowed us to accurately map SOC over a large area exploiting the LUCAS spectral library and, thus, avoid a new ad hoc field campaign. Moreover, the threshold for selecting the bare soil pixels can be tuned, according to the goal of the survey. The quality of the SOC map for each tolerance level can be judged based on the figures of merit of the model.

TI  - Mining Concise Datasets for Testing Satellite-Data-Based Land-Cover Classifiers Meant for Large Geographic Areas
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining an accurate estimate of a land-cover classifier's performance over a wide geographic area is a challenging problem due to the need to generate the ground truth that represents the entire area, which may be thousands of square kilometers in size. The current best approach for solving this problem constructs a test set by drawing samples randomly from the entire area-with a human supplying the true label for each such sample-with the hope that the labeled data thus collected capture statistically all of the data diversity in the area. A major shortcoming of this approach is that, in an interactive session, it is difficult for a human to ensure that the information provided by the next data sample chosen by the random sampler is nonredundant with respect to the data already collected. In order to reduce the annotation burden caused by this uncertainty, it makes sense to remove any redundancies from the entire dataset before presenting its samples to the human for annotation. This article presents a framework that uses a combination of clustering and compression to create a concise-set representation of the land-cover data for a large geographic area. Whereas clustering is achieved by applying locality-sensitive hashing to the data elements, compression is achieved by choosing a single data element to represent a cluster. This framework reduces the annotation burden on the human and makes it more likely that the human would persevere during the annotation stage. We validate our framework experimentally by comparing it with the traditional random sampling approach using WorldView2 satellite imagery.

TI  - Estimation of influenza and respiratory syncytial virus hospitalizations using sentinel surveillance data-La Paz, Bolivia. 2012-2017
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The objective was to estimate the number of hospitalizations associated with influenza and RSV using data from severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) sentinel surveillance from El Alto-La Paz. Bolivia. Methods All persons who met the case definition for SARI at one sentinel hospital had a clinical sample collected and analyzed by rRT-PCR for influenza and by indirect immunofluorescence for RSV. The SARI-influenza and SARI-RSV case counts were stratified by six age groups. The proportion of cases captured in the sentinel hospital in relation to the non-sentinel hospitals of area was multiplied by the age-specific census population, to build the denominators. The annual incidence and a 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated. Results During 2012-2017, n = 2606 SARI cases were reported (average incidence 120/100 000 inhabitants [95% CI: 116-124]); the average incidence of influenza-associated SARI hospitalization was 15.3/100 000 (95% CI: 14.1-16.7), and the average incidence of RSV-associated SARI hospitalization was 9/100 000 inhabitants (95% CI: 8.1-10.1). The highest incidence of influenza was among those less than one year of age (average 174.7/100 000 [range: 89.1-299.5]), followed by those one to four years of age (average 51.8/100 000 [range: 19.8-115.4]) and then those 65 years of age and older (average 47.7/100 000 [range: 18.8-117]). For RSV, the highest incidence was highest among those less than one year of age (231/100 000 [range: 119.9-322.9]). Conclusion Influenza and RSV represent major causes of hospitalization in La Paz, Bolivia-with the highest burden among children under one year of age. Our estimates support current prevention strategies in this age group.

T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is a serious problem worldwide, which heightens the need to understand watershed dynamics and their impact on water quantity. The study examined water demand using the WEAP (Water Evaluation and Planning) model in the Arror watershed in Kenya. The primary sources of data included remotely sensed data and socio-economic data. The secondary data included climate, river discharge and soil data. Field surveys and questionnaires were used to collect socio-economic data. From the findings, the total annual water allocated (supply) for agriculture, domestic and livestock in the watershed was 10,333,441 m(3), with the highest annual consumer being agriculture in the lower part of the catchment at 7,154,457 m(3) for the reference scenario (1986-2012). The total mean annual demand for the same period was 10,461,123 m(3) and thus a mean annual unmet demand of 127,682 m(3). The highest mean monthly unmet water demand was that of agriculture in the lower part of the catchment in January (90,200 m(3)). Management practices that would enhance the sustainable management of water resources include construction of a reservoir and enforcement of minimum environmental flows maintenance in the river and these are recommended for the Arror watershed.

T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper analyzes the derivatives formed from the stem of adjective khara "black" in the structural-semantic aspect. The relatedness of word khara "black" to color words leads to the formation of adjectives with the meaning of incompleteness and intensity of a color characteristic, diminutive adjective, compound adjectives with meanings of intensity, which are used to convey shades of colors, compound nouns, and a verb with the meaning of a color's development degree. Analytical derivatives are represented by adjectives and nouns. Compound adjectives express the intensity of a color trait and are used to denote mixed shades. Compound nouns with the first component khara name mainly specific objects: living and mythical creatures, plants, objects of nature, kinds of products, place (building). Only two words denote a holiday and a period of time. Names of plants and animals can serve as a stem for the formation of verbs with meanings "to collect the designated plant," "to hunt the designated." The symbolism of colors in the people's culture and worldview has influenced on the formation of figurative meanings of words naming colors and, as a consequence, on the formation of derivative words on the basis of such meanings. Black color was associated with the dark side, the North, night, lower (underground) world. Derivatives kharan "a spirit, dark power," khara uzut "a dead's evil soul" appeared due to this symbolism. Thus, Khakas derivatives, formed with the participation of component khara, reflect ancient ideas about the symbolism of black color.

TI  - Assessment of multi-wavelength SAR and multispectral instrument data for forest aboveground biomass mapping using random forest kriging
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an important role in carbon cycle. Assessment of AGB presents a challenge in forest management. Reported studies have explored the potential of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and multi spectral instrument (MSI) data using random forest (RF) approach in AGB mapping. However, how AGB prediction would be affected by using data from different sources based on random forest kriging (RFK), which integrates RF and estimates residuals by ordinary kriging (OK), deserves further exploration. This study reported an assessment of multisensor data from Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) L band and Sentinel-1C band SAR, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), and Sentinel-2 MSI for forest AGB mapping using RFK. The effectiveness of 97 predictor variables derived from multisensor data was evaluated for AGB prediction in a temperate continental forest site in northeastern China. The assessment was tested by field-measured data from 1167 forest plots in 2017. The results showed that the RFK model achieved the accuracy with mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error and correlation coefficient in -0.11, 19.37, 28.15 Mg ha(-1) and 0.98, respectively. The study revealed that backscatters and texture features from ALOS-2 L band SAR and vegetation indices from Sentinel-2 MSI were primary contributors for explaining the observed variability of AGB. Topographic indices from SRTM DEM were more important than C band SAR backscatters and texture. features. The accuracy improvement on forest AGB mapping by RFK over RF was more distinguished in models using a single sensor than those using multisensors.

TI  - Rapid detection to long ship wake in synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The maritime administrative department employs synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite remote sensing technology to obtain evidence of illegal discharge of ships. If the ship is discharged during navigation, it forms a long dark wake on the SAR image due to the suppression of the Bragg wave by the oil film. This study investigates key techniques for rapid detection of long ship wakes, thereby providing law enforcement agencies with candidate ships for possible discharge. This paper presents a rapid long ship wake detection method that uses satellite imaging parameters and the axial direction of the ship in images to determine the potential detection area of the wake. Then, the threshold of long ship wake detection is determined using statistical analysis, the area is binarized, and isolated points are removed using a morphological filter operator. The method was tested with ENVISAT Synthetic Aperture Radar and GF-3 SAR data, and results showed that the method was effective, and the overall accuracy of the decision reaches 71%. We present two innovations; one is a method that draws a Doppler shift curve, and uses the SAR imaging parameters to determine the detection area of the long wake to achieve rapid detection and reduce the image detection area. The other is where a classical linear fitting method is used to quickly and accurately determine whether the detected dark area is a long ship wake and realizes the twisted long ship wake detection caused by the sea surface flow field, which is otherwise difficult to detect by the traditional Radon and Hough transform methods. This method has good suppression performance for the dark spot false alarm formed by low speed wind region or upward flow. The method is developed for maritime ship monitoring system and will promote the operational application of maritime ship monitoring system.

TI  - A method for determining vegetation growth process using remote sensing data: A case study in the Three-River Headwaters Region, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of the associated vegetation phenological dynamics are crucial for understanding the relationship between climate change and terrestrial ecosystems. However, at present, most vegetation phenological calculations are based on a single algorithm or method. Because of the spatial, temporal, and ecological complexity of the vegetation growth processes, a single algorithm or method for monitoring all these processes has been indicated to be elusive. Therefore, in this study, from the perspective of plant growth characteristics, we established a method to remotely determine the start of the growth season (SOG) and the end of the growth season (EOG), in which the maximum relative change rate of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) corresponds to the SOG, and the next minimum absolute change rate of the NDVI corresponds to the EOG. Taking the Three-River Headwaters Region in 2000-2013 as an example, we ascertained the spatiotemporal and vertical characteristics of its vegetation phenological changes. Then, in contrast to the actual air temperature data, observed data and other related studies, we found that the SOG and EOG calculated by the proposed method is closer to the time corresponding to the air temperature, and the trends of the SOG and EOG calculated by the proposed method are in good agreement with other relevant studies. Meantime, the error of the SOG between the calculated and observed in this study is smaller than that in other studies.

TI  - The practice patterns in the management of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid in the Asia Pacific region
T2  - EYE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To determine the practice patterns of ophthalmic plastic surgeons regarding the management of eyelid sebaceous carcinoma (SC).Methods An electronic survey was distributed to oculoplastic surgical colleagues in the Asia Pacific region requesting clinical information and treatment approaches to SC.Results The responses from 192 respondents from the Asia Pacific region was included and analyzed in this study. For initial diagnosis, most surgeons selected incisional biopsy (55%), followed by complete excision (35%). Initial workup was mainly by palpation of lymph nodes, chest X-ray, and computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) of the orbit. Conjunctival map biopsy was done in selected cases. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was done mainly for tumors larger than 10 mm. Management was mainly by surgical excision (5 mm margin) combined with adjuvant therapy in some cases, with radiotherapy being the most common. Margin status was determined most frequently by frozen section as evaluated by the pathologist (57%) followed by Mohs micrographic surgery (18%). Surveillance was based mainly on physical examination alone.Conclusion The Asia Pacific oculoplastic surgeons prefer incisional biopsy for lesions suspicious of SC prior to definitive surgery. This is in contrast to survey results previously reported in other populations. Frozen section control (done by an oculoplastic surgeon with pathology support) is most commonly used for margin control and conjunctival map biopsies are done only in selected cases. Despite the potential benefits of SLNB, access and expertise in this area is currently lacking in the Asia Pacific region.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Key messageWe provided long-term stand and canopy structural data from permanent monitoring plots representative of some most diffuse temperate and Mediterranean forests, under different coppice management regimes. Periodic inventories were performed in the surveyed plots since the 1970s. Annual litterfall production and its partitioning (leaf, woody, reproductive parts) and optical canopy measurements using the LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer were performed every year in fully equipped plots since the 1990s. These data can be used for evaluating the influence of coppice management in the stand and canopy structure, the parametrization of radiative transfer models that require accurate ground truth data, and the calibration of high to medium resolution remotely sensed data.

TI  - Optimal dates for assessing long-term changes in tree-cover in the semi-arid biomes of South Africa using MODIS NDVI time series (2001-2018)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The varying proportions of tree and herbaceous cover in the grassland and savanna biomes of Southern Africa determine their capacity to provide ecosystem services. The asynchronous phenologies e.g. annual NDVI profiles of grasses and trees in these semi-arid landscapes provide an opportunity to estimate percentage tree-cover by determining the period of maximum contrast between grasses and trees. First, a 16-day NDVI time series was generated from MODIS NDVI data, i.e. MOD13A2 16-day NDVI composite data. Secondly, percentage tree-cover data for 100 sample polygons (4 x 4) pixels for areas that have not undergone change in tree cover between 2001 and 2018 were derived using high resolution Google Earth imagery. Next, a time series consisting of the coefficients of determination (R-2) for the NDVI/tree-cover linear regression were computed for the 100 polygons. Lastly, a threshold R-2 > 0.5 was used to determine the optimal period of the year for mapping tree-cover. It emerged that the narrow period from Julian day 161-177 (June 10-26) was the most consistent period with R-2 > 0.5 in the region. 18 tree-cover maps (2001-2018) were generated using linear regression model coefficients derived from Julian day 161 for each year. Kendall correlation coefficient (tau) was used to determine areas of significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) increasing or decreasing trend in tree-cover. Areas (polygons) that showed increasing tree-cover appeared to be more widespread in the trend map as compared to areas of decreasing tree-cover. An accuracy assessment of the map of increasing tree-cover was conducted using Google Earth high resolution images. Out of 330 and 200 mapped polygons verified using p < 0.05 and 0.01 thresholds, respectively, 180 (54% accuracy) and 132 (65% accuracy) showed evidence of tree recruitment. Farm abandonment appeared to have been the most important factor contributing to increasing tree-cover in the region.

TI  - Predicting Urban Expansion and Urban Land Use Changes in Nakhon Ratchasima City Using a CA-Markov Model under Two Different Scenarios
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the prediction of land-use changes in Nakhon Ratchasima city using a CA-Markov Model with GIS. Satellite images taken by Landsat-5 (1992), Landsat-7 (2002) and THEOS (2016) were used to predict land use in 2026. In 1992, the most proportion of land usage was built-up areas (47.76%) and followed by green areas (37.45%), bare lands (13.19%), and water bodies (1.60%), respectively. In 2002, the land use comprised built-up areas (56.04%), green areas (35.52%), bare lands (4.80%) and water bodies (3.63%). By 2016, urbanisation had changed the land use pattern, which comprised built-up areas (70.80%), green areas (20.78%), bare lands (6.37%), and water bodies (2.03%). The data were analysed using a change detection matrix and revealed an increase in built-up area at the expense of all other types, especially green areas. The results were in accordance with the prediction model created in two scenarios. Scenario 1 assumed city expansion following past trends, built-up areas (85.88%), green areas (11.67%), bare lands (2.15%), and water bodies (0.30%). Scenario 2 assumed city expansion in accordance with the national strategy, built-up areas (74.91%), green areas (15.77%), bare lands (8.48%), and water bodies (0.84%). The results indicated an expansion of built-up areas and a shrinking of green areas. In Scenario 2, urban expansion was less than in Scenario 1, and preserving the green area seemed more feasible due to governmental restrictions. The results indicated that planning the urbanisation according to the policies development plans, especially in specific areas, contributed to a more efficient urbanisation growth. The city should provide to promote the use of floor area ratio (FAR) and open space ratio (OSR) with urban planning measures as well as increasing the green areas.

TI  - Node positive breast cancer: Concordance between baseline PET/CT and sentinel node assessment after neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Sentinel node biopsy for axillary staging in node positive patients after neoadjuvant treatment is controversial, mainly due to high false negative rates. We examined the concordance between the location of the hot nodes identified on PET-CT at presentation with the location of the sentinel nodes.Materails and methods: Fifty-eight breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment between January 2013 and September 2018 who had positive regional lymph nodes on PET/CT, and a SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy completed before sentinel node biopsy were included. Patient, tumor and treatment characteristics were collected. Images of PET/CT were compared to images of SPECT/CT lymphoscintigraphy post treatment and concordance between location of the hot nodes on PET/CT with the sentinel nodes visualized on SPECT/CT was assessed. Association between patient, tumor and treatment characteristics and concordance between the sentinel node and the hot nodes was determined.Results: Sentinel nodes were identified in 53 (91%) of the cases in surgery. In 25 (43%) patients, axillary nodes were positive after treatment. In 16 (28%; 95% CI 18, 40) the sentinel node was not one of the hot nodes seen on PET/CT at presentation. Twenty-three (40%) patients had excision of additional axillary nodes. In two patients with non-concordant sentinel nodes, the sentinel node was falsely negative.Conclusions: In node positive patients who undergo neoadjuvant treatment, the sentinel node visualized on lymphatic mapping is not necessarily one of the hot nodes identified on PET/CT at presentation. These findings underline the importance of marking the pathologically proven lymph node and excising it as well as the sentinel nodes after treatment.

TI  - Comparative proteomics in the wild: Accounting for intrapopulation variability improves describing proteome response in a <i>Gammarus pulex</i> field population exposed to cadmium
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-throughput proteomics can be performed on animal sentinels for discovering key molecular biomarkers signing the physiological response and adaptation of organisms. Ecotoxicoproteomics is today amenable by means of proteogenomics to small arthropods such as Gammarids which are well known sentinels of aquatic environments. Here, we analysed two regional Gammarus pulex populations to characterize the potential proteome divergence induced in one site by natural bioavailable mono-metallic contamination (cadmium) compared to a non-contaminated site. Two RNAseq-derived protein sequence databases were established previously on male and female individuals sampled from the reference site. Here, individual proteomes were acquired on 10 male and 10 female paired organisms sampled from each site. Proteins involved in protein lipidation, carbohydrate metabolism, proteolysis, innate immunity, oxidative stress response and lipid transport were found more abundant in animals exposed to cadmium, while hemocyanins were found in lower abundance. The intrapopulation proteome variability of long-term exposed G. pulex was inflated relatively to the non-contaminated population. These results show that, while remaining a challenge for such organisms with not yet sequenced genomes, taking into account intrapopulation variability is important to better define the molecular players induced by toxic stress in a comparative field proteomics approach.

TI  - Applying sequential surveillance methods that use regression adjustment or weighting to control confounding in a multisite, rare-event, distributed setting: Part 2 in-depth example of a reanalysis of the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella combination vaccine and seizure risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In-depth example of two new group sequential methods for postmarket safety monitoring of new medical products.Study Design and Setting: Existing trial-based group sequential approaches have been extended to adjust for confounders, accommodate rare events, and address privacy-related constraints on data sharing. Most adaptations have involved design-based confounder strategies, for example, self-controlled or exposure matching, while analysis-based approaches like regression and weighting have received less attention. We describe the methodology of two new group sequential approaches that use analysis-based confounder adjustment (GS GEE) and weighting (GS IPTW). Using data from the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel network, we apply both methods in the context of a known positive association: the measles-mumps-rubella-varicella vaccine and seizure risk in infants.Results: Estimates from both new approaches were similar and comparable to prior studies using design-based methods to address confounding. The time to detection of a safety signal was considerably shorter for GS IPTW, which estimates a risk difference, compared to GS GEE, which provides relative estimates of excess risk.Conclusion: Future group sequential safety surveillance efforts should consider analysis-based confounder adjustment techniques that evaluate safety signals on the risk difference scale to achieve greater statistical power and more timely results.

TI  - Time-consistent estimation of LAI by assimilation in GreenLab plant growth model
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is concerned with the recovery of Leaf Area Index (LAI) time series in intense agriculture areas from moderate resolution remote sensing data (MODIS or SENTINEL). Although their resolution limits an analysis at a parcel level, their high temporal rate enables to monitor land use/land cover through the temporal evolution of key biophysical parameters as LAI. However in practice, frame-by-frame estimation is unsatisfactory since the quality of each single data is subjected to undesirable effects due to atmosphere disturbance, sun geometry, viewing geometry, etc. These effects lead to a lack of temporal consistency of resulting time series. The reconstruction of such time series is delicate using conventional interpolation methods since underlying physical processes are not taken into account. In this paper, we tackle this issue by exploiting the prior information of a plant growth model, namely GreenLab, using stochastic data assimilation techniques. Our experiments on challenging situations, such as few data and fragmented landscapes, demonstrate the approach is robust on various challenging situations and enables to extract additional information about observed fields..

TI  - A comparison of satellite remote sensing data fusion methods to map peat swamp forest loss in Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The loss of huge areas of peat swamp forest in Southeast Asia and the resulting negative environmental effects, both local and global, have led to an increasing interest in peat restoration in the region. Satellite remote sensing offers the potential to provide up-to-date information on peat swamp forest loss across large areas, and support spatial explicit conservation and restoration planning. Fusion of optical and radar remote sensing data may be particularly valuable in this context, as most peat swamp forests are in areas with high cloud cover, which limits the use of optical data. Radar data can 'see through' cloud, but experience so far has shown that it doesn't discriminate well between certain types of land cover. Various approaches to fusion exist, but there is little information on how they compare. To assess this untapped potential, we compare three different classification methods with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to map the remnant distribution of peat swamp forest in the area surrounding Sungai Buluh Protection Forest, Sumatra, Indonesia. Results show that data fusion increases overall accuracy in one of the three methods, compared to the use of optical data only. When data fusion was used with the pixel-based classification using the original pixel values, overall accuracy increased by a small, but statistically significant amount. Data fusion was not beneficial in the case of object-based classification or pixel-based classification using principal components. This indicates optical data are still the main source of information for land cover mapping in the region. Based on our findings, we provide methodological recommendations to help those involved in peatland restoration capitalize on the potential of big data.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations in Vegetation Cover and Responses to Climatic Variables in the Daqing River Basin, North China
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The establishment of Xiong'an New Area in Hebei Province has gained immense attention from the whole scientific community. The Daqing River Basin (DRB), where the New Area is located, has become a new focus of hydrological scientists. The vegetation cover plays a key role in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, serving as a reference to understand the ecological environment and water circulation status of the watershed. To analyse the current situation of climate and vegetation changes in the DRB, kriging interpolation, moving average, trend analysis of Theil-Sen median, and Mann-Kendall statistical test were used based on ground-based observation data and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The annual mean values of NDVI showed a significant upward trend from 2000 to 2015. The fluctuations in seasonal NDVI values followed this trend correspondingly to various extents. The variations in NDVI value positively correlated with those in temperature, both on the annual scale and during summer seasons (P <= 0.05). A large improvement in the vegetation cover of DRB was observed (54.21% of the areas), mainly distributed in the northeast of Mountainous Areas of Daqing River Basin and West Plain of Baiyangdian Lake. The findings might be helpful to understand the water and energy flux cycling in the changing environment of this region, providing guiding information on river basin management and the planning and construction of New Area.

From the viewpoint of the attention mechanism, ship targets can be salient candidates from sea clutter. A novel saliency detector for PolSAR ship detection has been proposed in this paper. The core idea is to explore the different scattering mechanisms between ships and sea clutter in low and medium sea conditions. The scattering mechanism differences are measured by the similarity test of polarimetric covariance matrices. A new saliency feature named similar pixel number (SPN) is proposed by recording the similar pixels within a moving window and a saliency detection method is developed thereafter. The proposed ship detection method mainly contains three steps. Firstly, the similarity test is applied between the central pixel and its neighborhood. Then, SPN feature is generated based on the result of similarity test by counting the number of similar pixels. Finally, with thresholding and morphological filtering procedures, ship targets can be extracted from the saliency feature map. Experimental studies with Radarsat-2 and GaoFen-3 data validate the advantages of the proposed method. Quantitative comparisons illustrate that the proposed method achieves the best detection performance with detection quality factors higher than 97% for both datasets over inshore dense and offshore sparse areas.

TI  - Seasonal Evolution of the Surface Layer Heat Balance in the Eastern Subtropical Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Indian Ocean (SIO) is a region of strong air-sea heat loss due to the unique ocean circulation pattern influenced by the Indonesian Throughflow. In this study, the seasonal variation of the surface layer heat budget in the eastern SIO is investigated using 2 years of measurements from a mooring at 25 degrees S, 100 degrees E, the only colocated upper ocean and surface meteorology time series in the subtropical Indian Ocean. The mooring data are combined with other in situ and satellite data to examine the role of air-sea fluxes and ocean heat transport on the evolution of mixed layer temperature using heat budget diagnostic models. Results show that on seasonal time scales, mixed layer heat storage in the eastern SIO is mostly balanced by a combination of surface fluxes and turbulent entrainment with a contribution from horizontal advection at times. Solar radiation dominates the seasonal cycle of net surface heat flux, which warms the mixed layer during austral summer (67 W/m(2)) and cools it during austral winter (-44 W/m(2)). Entrainment is in good agreement with the heat budget residual for most of the year. Horizontal advection is spatially variable and appears to be dominated by the presence of mesoscale eddies and possibly annual and semiannual Rossby waves propagating from the eastern boundary. Results from the 2-year mooring-based data analysis are in reasonably good agreement with a 12-year regional heat budget analysis around the mooring location using ocean reanalysis products.

TI  - The influence of ENSO and PDO on tropical Andean glaciers and their impact on the hydrology of the Amazon Basin
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent decades, particularly since the late 1970s, have witnessed a rapid retreat of glaciers in the tropical Andes. We compiled the changes in glacier surfaces along the eastern cordilleras of the tropical Andes of Peru and Bolivia since the early 1980s from the literature. Water levels from two Brazilian river basins in the Amazon basin (one (Madeira River) glacially fed by meltwater from the Andes and the other (Envira River) non-glacially fed), were analysed for a 30-year period between 1985-2014. Furthermore, precipitation data near these two basins were also analysed in order to understand the differential contributions of glacier melting and rainfall. Variations in the water levels from the glacially fed Madeira River showed that some years were associated with higher water levels even when the precipitation remained low during the corresponding season (May-October). This observation was common when El Nino events occurred during the positive phase of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Water levels in glacier-fed Madeira River were slightly higher during the periods where El Nino and warm PDO co-occurred. On the other hand, water levels in the Envira River were precipitation dependent; water levels were higher when the rainfall was high.

TI  - Satellite soil moisture observations predict burned area in Southeast Asian peatlands
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires that emit massive amounts of CO2 and particulate matter now burn with regularity in Southeast Asian tropical peatlands. Natural peatlands in Southeast Asia are waterlogged for most of the year and experience little or no fire, but networks of canals constructed for agriculture have drained vast areas of these peatlands, making the soil vulnerable to fire during periods of low rainfall. While soil moisture is the most direct measure of peat flammability, it has not been incorporated into fire studies due to an absence of regional observations. Here, we create the first remotely sensed soil moisture dataset for tropical peatlands in Sumatra, Borneo and Peninsular Malaysia by applying a new retrieval algorithm to satellite data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission with data spanning the 2015 El Nino burning event. Drier soil up to 30 days prior to fire correlates with larger burned area. The predictive information provided by soil moisture complements that of precipitation. Our remote sensing-derived results mirror those from a laboratory-based peat ignition study, suggesting that the dependence of fire on soil moisture exhibits scale independence within peatlands. Soil moisture measured from SMAP, a dataset spanning 2015-present, is a valuable resource for peat fire studies and warning systems.

TI  - Geographic Planning and Design of Marine Island Ecological Landscape Based on Genetic Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographical remote sensing imaging technology is used to image the ecological landscape of marine islands, and remote sensing image data of ecological landscape features of marine islands are extracted. In view of the multi-spectral remote sensing data of multi-spectral remote sensing data based on mathematical morphology segmentation method, the extraction of ecological landscape geographic information of marine islands is easy to produce pseudo-edges and miss detection. This paper presents a design method of marine island ecological landscape geography planning based on genetic algorithm based on remote sensing data of marine island ecological landscape. Firstly, geographical remote sensing imaging technology is used to collect remote sensing data of marine island ecological landscape, and image fusion filtering and block matching are carried out for the collected remote sensing image of marine island ecological landscape. Taking the extracted boundary features of marine island ecological landscape as the center moment, the affine invariant moment of remote sensing image of marine island ecological landscape is obtained. Combining with genetic algorithm, the extraction and optimization of marine island ecological landscape geographic information is realized. Taking NanSan Island in Guangdong as an example, the simulation of marine island ecological landscape geographic planning and design is carried out. The results show that the marine island ecological landscape geographic planning and design is reasonable and accurate information detection efficiency is high. The regional planning capacity for islands is better.

TI  - Is It Time to Shift Our Environmental Thinking? A Perspective on Barriers and Opportunities to Change
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and Sustainable Development Goals. In 2019, the release of the global assessment report of the United Nations' Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services unfortunately demonstrated that our planet may be in more trouble than expected. The main drivers have been identified for many years and relate to human activities such as over-exploitation of natural resources leading to land degradation, deforestation, ocean and atmospheric pollution, and climate change. Despite international agreements and conventions, we are gradually reaching the planet's boundaries. In this commentary, we present an analysis of the current worldview, discuss the humanist roots of this view, and the barriers to be able to move forward with the transformative changes that are needed for sustainability. We suggest that for these transformative changes to happen, there is a need to reconnect humans with nature, and we propose that some solutions could be devised in areas like education and social media. Changing our mindsets and worldviews are the most urgent courses of action we must undertake to avoid the inevitable.

TI  - New perspectives in land use mapping based on urban morphology: A case study of the Federal District, Brazil
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Federal District of Brazilis characterized by intense and uncontrolled urban expansion and growing economic inequality, that is strongly reflected in absence of appropriated land use planning. The inability to effectively manage land use has resulted in unconstrained appropriations of the territory, mainly in public areas. It is necessary to develop tools to support decision-making in managing the land use and sustainable development of urban areas. This effort must address the complex set of laws related to the environment, urban licensing, and water use granting. Urban morphology is a spatial indicator that specifies the physical characteristics of the urban structure and, more specifically, the organization of urban space. In this context, the Urban Structure Type (UST) is a concept for identifying and understanding the urban space. The UST methodology describes urban spaces and considers their homogeneity regarding the coverage types, types of land use, physical features, functionality and context. This study aims to characterize the urban area of the Federal District, Brazil, using the UST approach. The UST features were mappedusing remote sensing data, orthophotos with 1-metre resolution and vector data (blocks, census tracts, routes and ecological corridors). A classification was performed by visual analysis. We considered three hierarchical levels during the classification stage. The first two levels were classified based only on the uses of the urban structure. In the third level, we considered 25 types of urban structures. The classes that had the most extensive areas were Remaining Spaces (29%), Green Spaces (10%), Agricultural Spaces (9%), Consolidation Areas of type SH1 (7.6%), Community Equipment (6.7%) and Residential Areas of type RH1 (5.9%). The UST mapping distinguished the characteristics of the patterns of the urban occupancy. Mapping of urban structure types provided a new and more accurate vision of cities, since the scale of detail allows the cities to be analysed by different stakeholders, both from the public and private sector. After a revision of several legal definitions and allowing convergence in public sector decision-making process on the territory, the UST was incorporated in the EEZ-DF plan discussions, through a district law n degrees 1988/2018. Hence, this methodology represents a capacity-building process for the public sector, with enormous implications for land use planning and management.

TI  - Improving SWE Estimation by Fusion of Snow Models with Topographic and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new concept to derive the snow water equivalent (SWE) based on the joint use of snow model (AMUNDSEN) simulation, ground data, and auxiliary products derived from remote sensing. The main objective is to characterize the spatial-temporal distribution of the model-derived SWE deviation with respect to the real SWE values derived from ground measurements. This deviation is due to the intrinsic uncertainty of any theoretical model, related to the approximations in the analytical formulation. The method, based on the k-NN algorithm, computes the deviation for some labeled samples, i.e., samples for which ground measurements are available, in order to characterize and model the deviations associated to unlabeled samples (no ground measurements available), by assuming that the deviations of samples vary depending on the location within the feature space. Obtained results indicate an improved performance with respect to AMUNDSEN model, by decreasing the RMSE and the MAE with ground data, on average, from 154 to 75 mm and from 99 to 45 mm, respectively. Furthermore, the slope of regression line between estimated SWE and ground reference samples reaches 0.9 from 0.6 of AMUNDSEN simulations, by reducing the data spread and the number of outliers.

TI  - Prognostic value of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography and inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with anal cancer
T2  - COLORECTAL DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to assess the value of positron emission tomography (PET)/CT and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in staging inguinal lymph nodes in anal cancer patients and to determine if the results of the two methods could be of prognostic value. Method Sixty-three patients with anal cancer and clinically negative inguinal lymph nodes underwent lymphoscintigraphy and inguinal SLN biopsy and/or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT scan. All patients were treated with radiotherapy combined with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C. Results Overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 43 months (range 5-211) and 43 months (range 4-142) respectively. PET/CT examination showed high FDG uptake in the inguinal lymph nodes in 25% of patients. Thirty-five patients with inguinal uptake at lymphoscintigraphy underwent inguinal SLN biopsy and metastatic nodes were found in 31.4%. There was no statistical difference in OS (55 vs 41 months; P = 0.652) and DFS (48 vs 38 months; P = 0.992) between the group which showed inguinal uptake on PET/CT and the group which did not, while a positive inguinal SLN was associated with a worse OS (28 vs 59 months; P = 0.028) and DFS (56 vs 21 months; P = 0.046). When the two examinations were compared PET/CT showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 22%, 82%, 33% and 73% respectively. Conclusion The technique of SLN biopsy had a better diagnostic accuracy than total body FDG-PET/CT for the staging of inguinal lymph nodes in anal cancer patients; moreover it was a stronger predictor of OS and DFS than PET/CT.

TI  - Change in forest cover of the northwest region of Amazon in Mato Grosso state
T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few years, the intensification of anthropic activities that modify the soil-vegetation cover in Brazil's land has been occurring on a large scale. To monitor the forest cover changes, the techniques of Remote Sensing of vegetation are essential tools, especially in large areas and with difficult access, as is the case of the Brazilian Amazon. The aim of this work was to identify the changes in land use and land cover, over the past 20 years, in the municipalities of Aripuana and Rondolandia, Northwest of Mato Grosso State, in order to quantify the effective altered areas. Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI digital classification images techniques were used in three different dates (1995, 2005 and 2015) and, later, the detection to the land use and land cover changes. The digital classification showed excellent results, with kappa index above 0.80 for the generated maps, indicating the digital classification as a potential tool for land use and land cover. Results reflect the conversion of forest areas mainly for agricultural activities, in the order of 472 km(2), representing a loss of 1.3% of Amazon forest surface in the study region.

TI  - Tropical deforestation drivers and associated carbon emission factors derived from remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and enhancing carbon stocks (REDD+) is a crucial component of global climate change mitigation. Remote sensing can provide continuous and spatially explicit above-ground biomass (AGB) estimates, which can be valuable for the quantification of carbon stocks and emission factors (EFs). Unfortunately, there is little information on the fate of the land following tropical deforestation and of the associated carbon stock. This study quantified post-deforestation land use across the tropics for the period 1990-2000. This dataset was then combined with a pan-tropical AGB map at 30 m resolution to refine EFs from forest conversion by matching deforestation areas with their carbon stock before and after clearing and to assess spatial dynamics of EFs by follow-up land use. In Latin America, pasture was the most common follow-up land use (72%), with large-scale cropland (11%) a distant second. In Africa deforestation was often followed by small-scale cropping (61%) with a smaller role for pasture (15%). In Asia, small-scale cropland was the dominant agricultural follow-up land use (35%), closely followed by tree crops (28%). Deforestation often occurred in forests with lower than average carbon stocks. EFs showed high spatial variation within eco-zones and countries. While our EFs are only representative for the studied time period, our results show that EFs are mainly determined by the initial forest carbon stock. The estimates of the fraction of carbon lost were less dependent on initial forest biomass, which offers opportunities for REDD+ countries to use these fractions in combination with recent good quality national forest biomass maps or inventory data to quantify emissions from specific forest conversions. Our study highlights that the co-location of data on forest loss, biomass and fate of the land provides more insight into the spatial dynamics of land-use change and can help in attributing carbon emissions to human activities.

TI  - Integration of Beer-Lambert and van 't Hoff Laws for Salinity Detection using Remote Sensing Spectroscopy
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a technique based on optical detection of the salinity by integrating both Beer-Lambert and van 't Hoff laws regarding remote sensing spectroscopy. Classical detection techniques using polychromatic waveband by field computation and experimental data are, on the one hand, time-consuming and on the other hand expensive and less accurate. Therefore, best precision is reached by implementing monochromatic wavelength from multispectral bands (Landsat 8) and spectroscopy USGS database. Our method aims to identify spectral reflectance of NaCl and KCl salts through satellite images using calibration process and atmospheric correction by dark object subtraction method, thermal infra-red sensor, and operational land imager. We have performed an automated tool detection using intrinsic physical parameters such as absorbance, radiance, reflectance, and transmittance, related dynamically to osmotic pressure, thermodynamic temperature from surface emissivity, and finally molar concentration of salts. The results illustrate that osmotic pressure is influenced by temperature at infra-red shortwave and more sensitive for thermal infra-red sensor, blue, and costal bands, which is affected by aerosol scattering diffusion and water absorption attenuation. This means that pressure and low temperature act synergistically in mixture mass attenuation coefficient or quantitative concentrations of materials and molar absorption. The infra-red short-wave properties are the most diffusing according to sigmoidal model adaptation. The best correlation was demonstrated by vapor pressure (exponential model) for the blue wave band (99.43%) and the dose response model (DR-Hill) for panchromatic wave band (98.4%). The results confirm that for small particles, the Rayleigh diffusion is predominate depending on the concentration of electrolyte and the wavelength polarization. The models demonstrate that the wave bands near 260, 1400, and 2100 nm are more sensitive to humidity and salinity absorption. Spectral curves of halite and sylvite salts have more intense electronic and vibrational effects in the short-wave field according to their solubility product chromophores, such as water, due to the presence of salt.

TI  - Tree density, species richness, and composition drive vegetation patches identified from remotely-sensed data in a semi evergreen tropical forest
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A proposal for characterizing habitat of forests, obtained from an object-oriented classification of RapidEye multiespectral imagery, based on dissimilarity matrices of vegetation structure, species diversity and composition is presented. The study area is a forested landscape mosaic after slash and burn agriculture (Ac: 8-23 years ago), selective logging (Fs: 43-53 years ago), and selective logging and forest fire (Fc: 21-28 years ago). The site is located in the central part of Quintana Roo, Mexico, where three vegetation patches were delineated according to remotely sensed multiespectral imagery. Mean differences between vegetation structure properties of each vegetation patch were obtained through a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (P < 0.001). Species richness, stem density per hectare, and the axis-1 scores of the non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination of specific composition were identified as the vegetation attributes more relevant to differentiate the vegetation patches by a multinomial logistic model. Fc vegetation patch is characterized by the greatest mean values on Shannon-Wiener index, species richness, and stem density. The Fs has the greatest mean values of canopy height, basal area, and biomass at 80 percentile, and the Ac vegetation patch has the lowest values of all mentioned metrics. The species with the greatest relative importance value were: Ac: Bursera simaruba and Piscidia piscipula, Fs: Gymnanthes lucida and Manilkara zapota, Fc: G. lucida and B. simaruba. The uncertainty associated with the metrics assessed by vegetation patch was smaller than the uncertainty of the whole area, because of the efficient variability aggregation of the field data. We conclude that multiespectral information is a reliable tool for distinguishing vegetation patches with specific features, as stem density, specific composition, and species richness.

TI  - Feasibility of sentinel lymph node mapping of the ovary: a systematic review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy is routinely performed in early ovarian cancer to define the stage of the disease. However, it may be associated with increased blood loss, operative time, and length of hospitalization. The sentinel lymph node technique has been shown to be safe and feasible in vulvar, uterine, and cervical cancer. Data detailing feasibility and outcomes of sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian cancer are scarce. To summarize the studies evaluating the feasibility of sentinel lymph node detection from the ovary, examining the technique and detection rate. A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed and Embase from June 1991 to February 2019. Studies describing the sentinel lymph node technique and lymphatic drainage of the ovaries were incorporated in this review. Ten articles were selected, comprising a total of 145 patients. A variety of agents were used, but the primary markers were technetium-99m radiocolloid (Tc-99m), patent blue, or indocyanine green, and the most common injection site was the ovarian ligaments. The overall sentinel lymph node detection rate was 90.3%. We propose a standardized technique sentinel lymph node mapping in ovarian cancer, using indocyanine green, or Tc-99m and blue dye as alternative tracers, injected in both the suspensory and the infundibulopelvic ligament of the ovary.

TI  - Requirements for multispectral remote sensing data used for the detection of arable land colonization by tree and shrubbery vegetation
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We discuss requirements for the multispectral remote sensing (RS) data utilized in the author's technique for estimating plant species concentration to detect arable land colonization by tree and shrubbery vegetation. The study is carried out using available high-resolution remote sensing data of two arable land plots. The paper considers the influence of resolution, combinations of spectral channels of RS data, as well as the season RS data is acquired on the quality of identification of elementary vegetation classes that form the basis of the plant community - a fallow land. A fallow land represents a piece of arable land that has not been cultivated for a long time. The study was conducted using a technology that is based on image superpixel segmentation. We found out that for determining tree and shrub vegetation, it is preferable to use RS data acquired in autumn, namely, in late September. The combination of red and blue spectral channels turned out to be the best for the analysis of tree-shrub vegetation against the background of grassy plant communities, and the presence of a near-infrared channel is necessary to range the various grassy plant communities in different classes. RS data with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m can be used to define tree-shrub plant communities with a high closeness of crowns (90 % or more), but cannot be used to classify isolated trees. Trees and shrubs (with a height of 8 m) can be classified in images with a spatial resolution of 0.8 m. An increase in spatial resolution does not improve the quality of the classification. The highest accuracies achieved for the land areas studied are 90 % and 83 %. Therefore, the suggested technology can be used in arable land expertise.

TI  - Comparison of Methods for Modeling Fractional Cover Using Simulated Satellite Hyperspectral Imager Spectra
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed data can be used to model the fractional cover of green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and soil in natural and agricultural ecosystems. NPV and soil cover are difficult to estimate accurately since absorption by lignin, cellulose, and other organic molecules cannot be resolved by broadband multispectral data. A new generation of satellite hyperspectral imagers will provide contiguous narrowband coverage, enabling new, more accurate, and potentially global fractional cover products. We used six field spectroscopy datasets collected in prior experiments from sites with partial crop, grass, shrub, and low-stature resprouting tree cover to simulate satellite hyperspectral data, including sensor noise and atmospheric correction artifacts. The combined dataset was used to compare hyperspectral index-based and spectroscopic methods for estimating GV, NPV, and soil fractional cover. GV fractional cover was estimated most accurately. NPV and soil fractions were more difficult to estimate, with spectroscopic methods like partial least squares (PLS) regression, spectral feature analysis (SFA), and multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) typically outperforming hyperspectral indices. Using an independent validation dataset, the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) values were 0.115 for GV using either normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or SFA, 0.164 for NPV using PLS, and 0.126 for soil using PLS. PLS also had the lowest RMSE averaged across all three cover types. This work highlights the need for more extensive and diverse fine spatial scale measurements of fractional cover, to improve methodologies for estimating cover in preparation for future hyperspectral global monitoring missions.

TI  - Using Volunteered Geographic Information and Nighttime Light Remote Sensing Data to Identify Tourism Areas of Interest
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Easy, economical, and near-real-time identification of tourism areas of interest is useful for tourism planning and management. Numerous studies have been accomplished to analyze and evaluate the tourism conditions of a place using free and near-real-time data sources such as social media. This study demonstrates the potential of volunteered geographic information, mainly Twitter and OpenStreetMap, for discovering tourism areas of interest. Active tweet clusters generated using Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering algorithm and building footprint information are used to identify touristic places that ensure the availability of basic essential facilities for travelers. Furthermore, an investigation is made to examine the usefulness of nighttime light remotely sensed data to recognize such tourism areas. The study successfully discovered important tourism areas in urban and remote regions in Nepal which have relatively low social media penetration. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is examined using the F1 measure. The accuracy assessment showed F1 score of 0.72 and 0.74 in the selected regions. Hence, the outcomes of this study can provide a valuable reference for various stakeholders such as tourism planners, urban planners, and so on.

TI  - Edge detection of satellite image using fuzzy logic
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Edge detection plays an important role in the field of image processing. Various edge detection techniques are obtained like Sobel, PSO Preweitt, Laplacian and Laplacian of Gaussian. These techniques consume some restrictions such as fixed edge thickness and some parameter like threshold is problematic to implement. Although many different edge-detection methods have been proposed for gray-scale, color, and multispectral images, they still face difficulties when extracting edge features from hyperspectral images (HSIs) that contain a large number of bands with very narrow gap in the spectral domain. High performance computing (HPC) is a technique used to assemble process and analyze more quantity of remote sensing (satellite) data which needs less processing time. HPC method is used in distributed & cluster Computing, parallel computing and following satellite data analyzing & processing approaches like geo-referencing, image edge detection, image classification, image mosaicking, Morphological/neural approach and image fusion for hyperspectral satellite data. Stimulated by means of the specific clustering of theory called gravitational theory, an original edge detection process. The conservative methods include the usage of linear time invariant filters. Recognition of edge is done by these filters as a These filters recognize an edge as a sudden conversion of grey scale pixel intensity. These techniques are well recognized and computationally effective. Canny, Sobel, Robert, Kirsch, Prewitt and LOG, on idea of spatial differential filters by using local grade. Within the less time these filters process the data and are inclined to noise. But in fuzzy technique, it does not include like this restriction, by altering the rules and output parameters, it is possible to change the thickness of the edge. In this paper, a new technique is created on fuzzy logic, which is suggested for detection of edge in digital images deprived of finding the threshold value. This method starts through segmenting the images into sections by means of fluctuating 3 x 3 binary matrixes. The pixels of edge are planned to a range of standards separated from each other. The results of this proposed technique is compared with the results obtained from PSO and neural network methods. This suggested technique provides a permanent effect in the lines smoothness and straightness for the straight lines and good roundness for the curved lines. And sharpness in the curves.

TI  - An ensemble-based model of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration across the contiguous United States with high spatiotemporal resolution
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Various approaches have been proposed to model PM2.5 in the recent decade, with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth, land-use variables, chemical transport model predictions, and several meteorological variables as major predictor variables. Our study used an ensemble model that integrated multiple machine learning algorithms and predictor variables to estimate daily PM(2.5 )at a resolution of 1 km x 1 km across the contiguous United States. We used a generalized additive model that accounted for geographic difference to combine PM2.5 estimates from neural network, random forest, and gradient boosting. The three machine learning algorithms were based on multiple predictor variables, including satellite data, meteorological variables, land-use variables, elevation, chemical transport model predictions, several reanalysis datasets, and others. The model training results from 2000 to 2015 indicated good model performance with a 10-fold cross-validated R-2 of 0.86 for daily PM2.5 predictions. For annual PM2.5 estimates, the cross-validated R-2 was 0.89. Our model demonstrated good performance up to 60 mu g/m(3). Using trained PM2.5 model and predictor variables, we predicted daily PM2.5 from 2000 to 2015 at every 1 km x 1 km grid cell in the contiguous United States. We also used localized land-use variables within 1 km x 1 km grids to downscale PM2.5 predictions to 100 m x 100 m grid cells. To characterize uncertainty, we used meteorological variables, land-use variables, and elevation to model the monthly standard deviation of the difference between daily monitored and predicted PM2.5 for every 1 km x 1 km grid cell. This PM2.5 prediction dataset, including the downscaled and uncertainty predictions, allows epidemiologists to accurately estimate the adverse health effect of PM2.5. Compared with model performance of individual base learners, an ensemble model would achieve a better overall estimation. It is worth exploring other ensemble model formats to synthesize estimations from different models or from different groups to improve overall performance.

TI  - River Discharge Estimation based on Satellite Water Extent and Topography: An Application over the Amazon
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - River discharge (RD) estimates are necessary for many applications, including water management, flood risk, and water cycle studies. Satellite-derived long-term GIEMS-D3 surface water extent (SWE) maps and HydroSHEDS data, at 90-m resolution, are here used to estimate several hydrological quantities at a monthly time scale over a few selected locations within the Amazon basin. Two methods are first presented to derive the water level (WL): the "hypsometric curve" and the "histogram cutoff" approaches at an 18 km x 18 km resolution. The obtained WL values are interpolated over the whole water mask using a bilinear interpolation. The two methods give similar results and validation with altimetry is satisfactory, with a correlation ranging from 0.72 to 0.89 in the seven considered stations over three rivers (i.e., Wingu, Negro, and Solimoes Rivers). River width (RW) and water volume change (WVC) are also estimated. WVC is evaluated with GRACE total water storage change, and correlations range from 0.77 to 0.88. A neural network (NN) statistical model is then used to estimate the RD based on four predictors (SWE, WL, WVC, and RW) and on in situ RD measurements. Results compare well to in situ measurements with a correlation of about 0.97 for the raw data (and 0.84 for the anomalies). The presented methodologies show the potential of historical satellite data (the combination of SWE with topography) to help estimate RD. Our study focuses here on a large river in the Amazon basin at a monthly scale; additional analyses would be required for other rivers, including smaller ones, in different environments, and at higher temporal scale.

T2  - ARIES-JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF WESTERN ESOTERICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Aleister Crowley was considerably influenced by the doctrines of Theravada Buddhism, which he studied in his youth, both theoretically and practically. He correlated its principles to the principles of scientific agnosticism and considered that its objectives could also be achieved through the practice of ceremonial magic. His eventual acceptance of Thelema's religious philosophy led to his ultimate renunciation of Buddhism as a worldview. This essay examines Crowley's early writings on the subject of Buddhism and suggests that the presence of Buddhist theories remains quite significant in his formulation of the doctrine of Thelema.

Earth and humanity form a unique and complex reality. Humanity and nature have the same origin and a common destiny before the future. However the society of today's world advocates individualism dualism and collective selfishness and finds no new understanding of itself that con guide it. The objective of the article Is to expose the idea of the recovery of a woriclview of the feminine dimension of the human being and the virtues for a possible new world. In today's world, education and the gentle interaction between reason and intuition con lead to the transformation of society and free thought into the building of fraternal and sensitive universal consciousness. Advocates for the construction of a new paradigm of coexistence that fuses a more benign reaction to the Earth and inaugurates a new social pact between the peoples in the sense of respect and preservation of all that exists and lives.

TI  - A global record of single-layered ice cloud properties and associated radiative heating rate profiles from an A-Train perspective
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A record of global single-layered ice cloud properties has been generated using the CloudSat and CALIPSO Ice Cloud Property Product (2C-ICE) during the period 2007-2010. These ice cloud properties are used as inputs for the NASA Langley modified Fu-Liou radiative transfer model to calculate cloud radiative heating rate profiles and are compared with the NASA CERES observed top-of-atmosphere fluxes. The radiative heating rate profiles calculated in the CloudSat/CALIPSO 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR and CCCM_CC products are also examined to assess consistency and uncertainty of their properties using independent methods. Based on the methods and definitions used herein, single-layered ice clouds have a global occurrence frequency of similar to 18%, with most of them occurring in the tropics above 12 km. Zonal mean cloud radiative heating rate profiles from the three datasets are similar in their patterns of SW warming and LW cooling with small differences in magnitude; nevertheless, all three datasets show that the strongest net heating (> + 1.0 K day(-1)) occurs in the tropics (latitude < 30 degrees) near the cloud-base while cooling occurs at higher latitudes (> similar to 50 degrees). Differences in radiative heating rates are also assessed based on composites of the 2C-ICE ice water path (IWP) and total column water vapor (TCWV) mixing ratio to facilitate model evaluation and guide ice cloud parameterization improvement. Positive net cloud radiative heating rates are maximized in the upper troposphere for large IWPs and large TCWV, with an uncertainty of 10-25% in the magnitude and vertical structure of this heating.

TI  - Shiism and Communism in the Arab World: a Political Footprint
T2  - REVUE DES MONDES MUSULMANS ET DE LA MEDITERRANEE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shiism and Communism in the Arab World: a Political Footprint. Communism and Shia political Islam in the Arab world do not share the same ideological assumptions; however, they do bear family resemblances, due to their historical relationship - particularly in Iraq and Lebanon - which can be broken down to three time sequences. From the 1950s, communist parties are anchored in marginalized Shia communities: the revolutionary narrative of Marxism and class struggle echoes Shia messianism. In the aftermath of the 1979 Iranian revolution, the dynamic is reversed : the anti-imperialist and eschatological narrative coming from Teheran fascinates the Marxist lefts, and encourages conversions to political Islam. The third sequence opens in the nineties, with the end of the Cold War: since then, Arab communists have displayed a political use of Shiism, that is not religious. By supporting Teheran and the Lebanese Hezbollah, some Arab Marxist activists try to reactivate a neo-thirld-worldist political worldview. Nevertheless, as have the proponents of Shia political Islam, they have abandoned for the moment any revolutionary aspirations.

TI  - Long-term subsidence in Mexico City from 2004 to 2018 revealed by five synthetic aperture radar sensors
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic land subsidence is an example of changes to the natural environment due to human activities and is one of the key factors in causing land degradation at a range of scales. Previous studies assessing land subsidence in the Valley of Mexico either focused on regional scale or short (noncontinuous) temporal scale. In this study, long-term land subsidence (~15 years) is mapped in Mexico City (Mexico) using two interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) methods, namely, GEOS (Geoscience and Earth Observing Systems Group)-Advance Time-series Analysis and GEOS-Small Baseline Subset. An inverse distance weighted-based integration module and maximum likelihood regression-based M estimator are introduced to further enhance these two methods. The land subsidence was continuously mapped using ENVISAT (2004-2007), ALOS-1 (2007-2011), COSMO-SkyMed (2011-2014), ALOS-2 (2014-2018), and SENTINEL-1 (2015-2017) data sets. A comparison between InSAR time-series and GPS measurement shows that the subsidence rates are consistent over 2004-2018. The subsidence map over 15 years was generated finding a maximum subsidence over 4.5 m. By comparing our InSAR results with a land use map, we find that the subsidence centre in Mexico City is mostly located in the residential regions with the consumption of groundwater contributing considerably to the local subsidence rate. A total volume of 1.20 x 10(8) m(3) of the land in Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl subsided/degraded. A continuing subsidence process limits the potential land use causing serious land degradation. Our results may be used to assist disaster reduction plans.

AB  - Urban forests are vitally important for sustainable urban development and the well-being of urban residents. However, there is, as yet, no country-level urban forest spatial dataset of sufficient quality for the scientific management of, and correlative studies on, urban forests in China. At present, China attaches great importance to the construction of urban forests, and it is necessary to map a high-resolution and high-accuracy dataset of urban forests in China. The open-access Sentinel images and the Google Earth Engine platform provide a significant opportunity for the realization of this work. This study used eight bands (B2-B8, B11) and three indices of Sentinel-2 in 2016 to map the urban forests of China using the Random Forest machine learning algorithms at the pixel scale with the support of Google Earth Engine (GEE). The 7317 sample points for training and testing were collected from field visits and very high resolution images from Google Earth. The overall accuracy, producer's accuracy of urban forest, and user's accuracy of urban forest assessed by independent validation samples in this study were 92.30%, 92.27%, and 92.18%, respectively. In 2016, the percentage of urban forest cover was 19.2%. Nearly half of the cities had an urban forest cover between 10% and 20%, and the average percentage of large cities whose urban populations were over 5 million was 24.8%. Cities with less than half of the average were mainly distributed in northern and western parts of China, which should be focused on in urban greening planning.

TI  - Exploring the dynamics of urban sprawl using geo-spatial indices: a study of English Bazar Urban Agglomeration, West Bengal
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The term "urban sprawl" can be defined in a number of ways. Traditionally, urban sprawls were described in qualitative terms. At present, geo-spatial indices are mostly used to measure and quantify "urban sprawl." This study measures the extent and magnitude of "urban sprawl" by employing seven landscape metrics and Shannon entropy in remote sensing and GIS environments. The study also explores the prospective future urban growth centers based on the directionality and magnitude of sprawling. The analysis also shows a dynamic trend of urban expansion beyond its defined boundary which results in "urban sprawl." This is also supported by the result of selected landscape metrics which revealed that high growth of sprawl is taking place in the Northwest and Southwest part of English Bazar UA. The diversified methodology employed in this study effectively demonstrates the dynamic growth pattern of sprawl and also helps in timely monitoring of spatial dynamics, its variation, and changing forms of "urban sprawl" patterns using spatio-temporal remote-sensing data in a growing city like English Bazar UA of West Bengal, India.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning Methods for the Prediction of River Mouth Morphological Variation: A Comparative Analysis of the Da Dien Estuary, Vietnam
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of river mouth morphological variation plays a crucial role in the study of unique brackish river ecosystems and is important for economic development. However, it is still a challenge to assess river mouth morphological variation because it is influenced by multiple factors. With the increasing availability of observation data, machine learning techniques have been widely used in the geosciences. This study aims to examine different machine learning techniques (logistic regression, neural network, bootstrap aggregating, AdaBoost, LogitBoost, and random subspace) for the prediction of estuary morphological variation probability. The Da Dien estuary, located in Phu Yen Province, Vietnam, was selected as a case study. To construct the machine learning models, the throat width of the Da Dien estuary (the dependent variable) was determined using Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8. Six independent variables (wind energy, wind direction, swell energy, swell direction, tidal prism, and river discharge) were obtained from either local hydrological stations or worldwide data portals. Through the examination of several statistical indicators, such as receiver operating characteristic, area under receiving operating characteristic, root-mean-square error, mean absolute error, and kappa, the results indicate that among the examined techniques, the Random Subspace model outperformed all others in almost every indicator, and it provided the most accurate prediction of estuary throat width variation. There are some limitations to this approach, such as the requirement of a large amount of data and difficulties in putting human-induced factors and topographical variables into the model. However, this paper presents a promising approach for providing a rapid assessment and can aid in developing a conceptual model of the system.

T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For the purpose of informing biodiversity conservation efforts in managed landscapes, we explored whether and how understory plant communities (abundance, diversity, composition) were related to a topographic moisture index, called depth-to-water, in the boreal mixedwood forests of northwestern Alberta. Depth-to-water is an index of relative site moisture derived from the Wet Areas Mapping tool using a fine-scale digital elevation model based upon remotely-sensed lidar (light detection and ranging) data. Sample plots were placed along the depth-to-water moisture gradient in three forest types: conifer-dominated, mixedwood, and broadleaf -(deciduous) dominated. Understory vascular plant diversity, abundance, and composition were measured for each plot. We found understory attributes were related to the depth-to-water index with the relationships varying among forest types. In coniferous stands, diversity and abundance (cover) were higher on drier sites. In broadleaf and mixedwood stands, understory abundance was higher on drier sites, but diversity was not related to the depth-to-water index. Lastly, composition was significantly, but weakly, related to the depth-to-water index in all three forest types. Our study shows that this moisture index, based on remotely-sensed data, can be used to characterize patterns in understory vascular plant communities; hence it can be useful for identifying areas of particular interest for conservation or management.

AB  - The discovery of natural resources remains the main mission of Earth observation satellites, especially in geographical areas that have a very difficult accessibility as those of the Bou Azzer-El Graara inlier (Central Anti-Atlas, Morocco). This work investigates the use of different satellite data, such as Sentinel-2A's multispectral imagery, in order to direct the prospection program in an efficient manner, saving both time and cost. The image processing methods of Landsat 7, 8, and "Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)" (30 m/15 m) were used to create methods for Sentinel-2A images (10 m). The red, green, blue (RGB) image 12.8.2, 11/12.11/2.11/8, principal component (PC) 1,2,3(11.12.2), and other new images were the result of principal component analysis (PCA), and classification by the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) and K-Means allowed realization of a lithological cartography as well as maps of lineaments through directional filters and the ratio of 11/12 for hydrothermal alteration zone mapping. The assembly of lithological, structural, and hydrothermal alteration data gave an idea of the mineralogy of the study area. Validity of the results was tested by comparison with the field data and the geological maps of the studied site (62% for the hydrothermal alteration zone, 81% for the lithological map, and 74% for the structural map).

TI  - Satellite-Based Bathymetric Modeling Using a Wavelet Network Model
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric modeling is required for safe maritime navigation in shallow waters as well as for other marine operations. Traditionally, bathymetric modeling is commonly carried out using linear models, such as the Stumpf method. Linear methods are developed to derive bathymetry using the strong linear correlation between the grey values of satellite imagery visible bands and the water depth where the energy of these visible bands, received at the satellite sensor, is inversely proportional to the depth of water. However, without satisfying homogeneity of the seafloor topography, this linear method fails. The current state-of-the-art is represented by artificial neural network (ANN) models, which were developed using a non-linear, static modeling function. However, more accurate modeling can be achieved using a highly non-linear, dynamic modeling function. This paper investigates a highly non-linear wavelet network model for accurate satellite-based bathymetric modeling with dynamic non-linear wavelet activation function that has been proven to be a valuable modeling method for many applications. Freely available Level-1C satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2A satellite was employed to develop and justify the proposed wavelet network model. The top-of-atmosphere spectral reflectance values for the multispectral bands were employed to establish the wavelet network model. It is shown that the root-mean-squared (RMS) error of the developed wavelet network model was about 1.82 m, and the correlation between the wavelet network model depth estimate and "truth" nautical chart depths was about 95%, on average. To further justify the proposed model, a comparison was made among the developed, highly non-linear wavelet network method, the Stumpf log-ratio method, and the ANN method. It is concluded that the developed, highly non-linear wavelet network model is superior to the Stumpf log-ratio method by about 37% and outperforms the ANN model by about 21%, on average, on the basis of the RMS errors. Also, the accuracy of the bathymetry-derived wavelet network model was evaluated on the basis of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)'s standards for all survey orders. It is shown that the accuracy of the bathymetry derived from the wavelet network model does not meet the IHO's standards for all survey orders; however, the wavelet network model can still be employed as an accurate and powerful tool for survey planning when conducting hydrographic surveys for new, shallow water areas.

TI  - Urban Health Related Air Quality Indicators over the Middle East and North Africa Countries Using Multiple Satellites and AERONET Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is reported as one of the most severe environmental problems in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Remotely sensed data from newly available TROPOMI - TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument on board Sentinel-5 Precursor, shows an annual mean of high-resolution maps of selected air quality indicators (NO2, CO, O3, and UVAI) of the MENA countries for the first time. The correlation analysis among the aforementioned indicators show the coherency of the air pollutants in urban areas. Multi-year data from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations from nine MENA countries are utilized here to study the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE) with other available observations. Additionally, a total of 65 different machine learning models of four categories, namely: linear regression, ensemble, decision tree, and deep neural network (DNN), were built from multiple data sources (MODIS, MISR, OMI, and MERRA-2) to predict the best usable AOD product as compared to AERONET data. DNN validates well against AERONET data and proves to be the best model to generate optimized aerosol products when the ground observations are insufficient. This approach can improve the knowledge of air pollutant variability and intensity in the MENA region for decision makers to operate proper mitigation strategies.

TI  - Combining Deep Learning and Prior Knowledge for Crop Mapping in Tropical Regions from Multitemporal SAR Image Sequences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop type identification and crop area estimation from remote sensing data in tropical regions are still considered challenging tasks. The more favorable weather conditions, in comparison to the characteristic conditions of temperate regions, permit higher flexibility in land use, planning, and management, which implies complex crop dynamics. Moreover, the frequent cloud cover prevents the use of optical data during large periods of the year, making SAR data an attractive alternative for crop mapping in tropical regions. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of Deep Learning (DL) techniques for crop recognition from multi-date SAR images from tropical regions. Three DL strategies are investigated: autoencoders, convolutional neural networks, and fully-convolutional networks. The paper further proposes a post-classification technique to enforce prior knowledge about crop dynamics in the target area. Experiments conducted on a Sentinel-1 multitemporal sequence of a tropical region in Brazil reveal the pros and cons of the tested methods. In our experiments, the proposed crop dynamics model was able to correct up to 16.5% of classification errors and managed to improve the performance up to 3.2% and 8.7% in terms of overall accuracy and average F1-score, respectively.

TI  - Estimating Canopy Fuel Attributes from Low-Density LiDAR
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulations of wildland fire risk are dependent on the accuracy and relevance of spatial data inputs describing drivers of wildland fire, including canopy fuels. Spatial data are freely available at national and regional levels. However, the spatial resolution and accuracy of these types of products often are insufficient for modeling local conditions. Fortunately, active remote sensing techniques can produce accurate, high-resolution estimates of forest structure. Here, low-density LiDAR and field-based data were combined using randomForest k-nearest neighbor imputation (RF-kNN) to estimate canopy bulk density, canopy base height, and stand age across the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota, USA. RF-kNN models produced strong relationships between estimated canopy fuel attributes and field-based data for stand age (Adj. R-2 = 0.81, RMSE = 10.12 years), crown fuel base height (Adj. R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 1.10 m), live crown base height (Adj. R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 1.60 m), and canopy bulk density (Adj. R-2 = 0.48, RMSE = 0.09kg/m(3)). These results suggest that low-density LiDAR can help estimate canopy fuel attributes in mixed forests, with robust model accuracies and high spatial resolutions compared to currently utilized fire behavior model inputs. Model map outputs provide a cost-efficient alternative for data required to simulate fire behavior and support local management.

AB  - The paper studies the possibility of using air temperature and humidity profiles for the determination of pressure in tropical cyclones (TC). The accuracy of air temperature and humidity profile retrieval from AMSU radiometer data is verified using direct radiosonde measurements together with weather station data for the Northwest Pacific. In total, 10 tropical cyclones are analyzed for the period of 2011-2012. The comparison of pressure values inside TC calculated from satellite profiles with weather station data demonstrated good agreement: the linear regression with a slope of 1.014 +/- 0.073, a free term of -19 +/- 73, and a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.73. TC central pressure values calculated from satellite data were compared with the estimates of the Japan Meteorological Agency exhibiting a satisfactory correspondence with a slope of 1.2. The comparison with the estimates of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (USA) demonstrates worse agreement.

T2  - MEMO-MAGAZINE OF EUROPEAN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This short review summarizes the most important facts presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium 2018 concerning local therapy of breast cancer, including breast and lymph node surgery as well as radiotherapy. Despite the increasing use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCHT) and consequently higher response and pathologic complete response (pCR) rates in the past years, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has not increased. This is not only due to positive genetic testing, but it is mostly based on patients' preference. On the other hand, quality of life seems to be better in young patients undergoing BCS regarding satisfaction with breasts and sexual and psychosocial well-being. Thus, surgical decision-making is crucial in young women with breast cancer and long-term quality of life aspects have to be taken into account. The safe performance of sentinel lymph node biopsy in N+ patients with or without neoadjuvant therapy is the current focus of several large randomized controlled trials. In San Antonio, new data about the impact ofmicro-metastases or extracapsular extension were presented. The 10-year follow-up data from the AMAROS study demonstrated similar axillary recurrence rates in patients with positive sentinel nodes undergoing complete axillary dissection or radiotherapy only. The RAPID study showed that in patients with unifocal small DCIS (Ductal carcinoma in situ) or invasive cancer <3cm, accelerated partial breast irradiation with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy was not inferior compared to whole breast irradiation regarding ipsilateral recurrence rate, but the regimen has to be adapted to achieve similar cosmetic results.

AB  - Yamula Dam that has been constructed in Kayseri is one of the most important projects regarding the irrigation of agricultural lands. The total area of the collected water body was reached in 2005 as planned before, and electricity production started. Together with the realization of the project, it is planned to use agricultural lands in basin more efficiently and productively. In this study, it was aimed to determine the hydrological structure of Yamula Basin and potentially irrigable lands by using geographic information systems and remote sensing technologies. The hydrological structure was determined using digital elevation model. The land use map was prepared by using Landsat satellite image for the year 2016. The analysis and queries were carried out by overlapping the land use, land use capacity, topographic maps and sub-basin layers. The potential agricultural lands were determined in accordance with the results obtained from the spatial analysis.

TI  - Variations in Persistence and Regenerative Zones in Coastal Forests Triggered by Sea Level Rise and Storms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retreat of coastal forests in relation to sea level rise has been widely documented. Recent work indicates that coastal forests on the Delmarva Peninsula, United States, can be differentiated into persistence and regenerative zones as a function of sea-level rise and storm events. In the lower persistence zone trees cannot regenerate because of frequent flooding and high soil salinity. This study aims to verify the existence of these zones using spectral remote sensing data, and determine whether the effect of large storm events that cause damage to these forests can be detected from satellite images. Spectral analysis confirms a significant difference in average Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) values in the proposed persistence and regenerative zones. Both NDVI and NDWI indexes decrease after storms triggering a surge above 1.3 m with respect to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). NDWI values decrease more, suggesting that this index is better suited to detect the effect of hurricanes on coastal forests. In the regenerative zone, both NDVI and NDWI values recover three years after a storm, while in the persistence zone the NDVI and NDWI values keep decreasing, possibly due to sea level rise causing vegetation stress. As a result, the forest resilience to storms in the persistence zone is lower than in the regenerative zone. Our findings corroborate the ecological ratchet model of coastal forest disturbance.

TI  - Remotely Sensed Boro Rice Production Forecasting Using MODIS-NDVI: A Bangladesh Perspective
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research work dealt with the development of an operational methodology with appropriate technical components for monitoring and forecasting of rice crop (Boro) production in Bangladesh. Designed system explores integrated application of remote sensing (RS) sciences and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. Terra MODIS 16-day Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maximum value composite (MVC) image product MOD13A1 of 500 m spatial resolution covering Bangladesh have been utilized for a period 2011-2017. Hence the district-wise sum of NDVI on pixel-by-pixel has been calculated from Jan-April during 2011-2017. Regression analysis between district-based pixel-wise summation of MODIS-NDVI and district-wise BBS (Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics) estimated Boro production revealed strong correlation (R-2 = 0.57-0.85) where in March most of the regression coefficient shows significant correlation due to maximize photosynthetic activities. Therefore, the highest regression coefficient value from derived set of coefficient value (BCP-Boro Crop Production Model 2) has been utilized to obtain year-wise rice productions for all the years (2011-2017). Global Positioning System (GPS)-based field verification, accuracy assessment and validation operation have been carried out at randomly selected geographical positions over the country using various statistical tools. The results demonstrate good agreement between estimated and predicted yearly Boro rice production during 2011-2017 time period with Mean Bias Error (MBE) = -29,881 to 19,431 M.Ton; Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 5238 to 11,852 M.Ton; Model Efficiency (ME) = (0.86-0.94); Correlation Coefficients = 0.65 to 0.87. Therefore MODIS-NDVI based regression model seems to be effective for Boro production forecasting. The system generally appears to be relatively fast, simple, reasonably accurate and suitable for nation-wide crop statistics generation and food security issues.

TI  - Ship Detection Using a Fully Convolutional Network with Compact Polarimetric SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (CP SAR), as a new technique or observation system, has attracted much attention in recent years. Compared with quad-polarization SAR (QP SAR), CP SAR provides an observation with a wider swath, while, compared with linear dual-polarization SAR, retains more polarization information in observations. These characteristics make CP SAR a useful tool in marine environmental applications. Previous studies showed the potential of CP SAR images for ship detection. However, false alarms, caused by ocean clutter and the lack of detailed information about ships, largely hinder traditional methods from feature selection for ship discrimination. In this paper, a segmentation method designed specifically for ship detection from CP SAR images is proposed. The pixel-wise detection is based on a fully convolutional network (i.e., U-Net). In particular, three classes (ship, land, and sea) were considered in the classification scheme. To extract features, a series of down-samplings with several convolutions were employed. Then, to generate classifications, deep semantic and shallow high-resolution features were used in up-sampling. Experiments on several CP SAR images simulated from Gaofen-3 QP SAR images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with Faster RCNN (region-based convolutional neural network), which is considered a popular and effective deep learning network for object detection, the newly proposed method, with precision and recall greater than 90% and a F-1 score of 0.912, performs better at ship detection. Additionally, findings verify the advantages of the CP configuration compared with single polarization and linear dual-polarization.

TI  - Intercomparison of Multiple Satellite Aerosol Products against AERONET over the North China Plain
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, using Aerosol Robotic Network aerosol optical depth (AOD) products at three stations in the North China Plain (NCP)-a heavily polluted region in China-the AOD products from six satellite-borne radiometers: the Moderate Resolution Imagining Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), Ozone Mapping Imaging (OMI), the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor (SeaWiFS), and Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), were thoroughly validated, shedding new light on their advantages and disadvantages. The MODIS Deep Blue (DB) products provide more accurate retrievals than the MODIS Dark Target (DT) and other satellite products at the Beijing site (BJ, a megacity), with higher correlations with AERONET (R > 0.93), lower mean absolute bias (MB < 0.012), and higher percentages (>68%) falling within the expected error (EE). All MODIS DT and DB products perform better than the other satellite products at the Xianghe site (XH, a suburb). The MODIS/Aqua DT products at both 3-km and 10-km resolutions performed better than the other space-borne AOD products at the Xinglong site (XL, a rural area at the top of a mountain). MISR, VIIRS, and SeaWiFS tend to underestimate high AOD values and overestimate AOD values under very low AOD conditions in the NCP. Both OMI and POLDER significantly underestimate the AOD. In terms of data volume, MISR with the limited swath width of 380 km has less data volume than the other satellite sensors. MODIS products have the highest sampling rate, especially the MODIS DT and DB merged products, and can be used for various climate study and air-quality monitoring.

TI  - Spatiotemporal characteristics of the expansion of an urban agglomeration and its effect on the eco-environment: Case study on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban agglomerations, which are highly integrated urban groups, form during the advanced stages of industrialization and urban development. The urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains is one of the 19 urban agglomerations promoted by China's 13th Five-Year Plan and a key area of urbanization in Xinjiang. Based on remote sensing data, we analyzed the expansion of construction land in the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains and its effect on ecological value in 1980-2015. The results show that the expansion of construction land significantly affected ecological value in the study area over the past 35 years. Among land use types, grassland was the dominant contributor to changes in ecological value; its contribution rate reached 66.27% with an interannual variation of only 5%. The contribution rate of urban and rural residential land along with industrial and mining lands was very low (0.82%), while the interannual variation was large (86%). The area of construction land in the urban agglomeration expanded from 1,067 to 2,586 km(2), and the conversions of different land use types had different effects on ecological value. Among land use types, the conversions of low-coverage grassland and dry land made the largest contributions to changes in ecological value. During the study period, a total of 1,685 km(2) of ecological land, 69.91% of which belonged to cultivated land and grassland, was converted into construction land. A total area of 1,082 km(2) of dry land and low-coverage grassland was converted into construction land, accounting for 64.21% of the total ecological land that was converted into construction land. In 2000-2015, the area of urban construction land increased significantly along with the proportion of unused land, including gobi (172 km(2)), bare land (65 km(2)), and salt-affected land (65 km(2)), being converted into construction land. In contrast, the area of construction land that was converted into ecological land was less than 166 km(2). The areas with the largest expansions of construction land were concentrated in Urumqi, Karamay, and Changji, where the areas of construction land increased by 399, 186, and 126 km(2), respectively. The areas with the most rapid expansions in construction land were concentrated in Kuytun, Toksun, and Usu. The environmental effects of construction land expansion and land use change were more positive in the late stage of urban agglomeration (2000-2015) compared to in the early stage (1980-2000). Kuytun City, Shihezi City, and Wujiaqu City showed large changes in ecological value caused by the expansion of construction land, whereas the changes in ecological value in the 14 other cities were relatively small, and the expansion of construction land slowed in 2000-2015 compared to in 1980-2000. In the future, further development of the urban agglomeration on the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains should fully consider the sensitivity and carrying capacity of the vulnerable ecological environment in this area. Population growth and industrial development in the urban agglomeration should be controlled based on the available water resources and ecological capacity to reduce the pressure on the environment and ensure sustainable development.

TI  - An Overview of Global Leaf Area Index (LAI): Methods, Products, Validation, and Applications
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical vegetation structural variable and is essential in the feedback of vegetation to the climate system. The advancement of the global Earth Observation has enabled the development of global LAI products and boosted global Earth system modeling studies. This overview provides a comprehensive analysis of LAI field measurements and remote sensing estimation methods, the product validation methods and product uncertainties, and the application of LAI in global studies. First, the paper clarifies some definitions related to LAI and introduces methods to determine LAI from field measurements and remote sensing observations. After introducing some major global LAI products, progresses made in temporal compositing and prospects for future LAI estimation are analyzed. Subsequently, the overview discusses various LAI product validation schemes, uncertainties in global moderate resolution LAI products, and high resolution reference data. Finally, applications of LAI in global vegetation change, land surface modeling, and agricultural studies are presented. It is recommended that (1) continued efforts are taken to advance LAI estimation algorithms and provide high temporal and spatial resolution products from current and forthcoming missions; (2) further validation studies be conducted to address the inadequacy of current validation studies, especially for underrepresented regions and seasons; and (3) new research frontiers, such as machine learning algorithms, light detection and ranging technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles be pursued to broaden the production and application of LAI.

TI  - Recognizing Global Reservoirs From Landsat 8 Images: A Deep Learning Approach
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Man-made reservoirs are key components of terrestrial hydrological systems. Identifying the location and number of reservoirs is the premise for studying the impact of human activities on water resources and environmental changes. While complete bottom-up censuses can provide a comprehensive view of the reservoir landscape, they are time-consuming and laborious and are thus infeasible on a global scale. Moreover, it is challenging to distinguish man-made reservoirs from natural lakes in remote sensing images. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework to recognize global reservoirs from Landsat 8 imageries. On the basis of the HydroLAKES dataset, a Landsat 8 cloud-free mosaic of 2017 was clipped for each feature (reservoir or lake) and was resized into 224 x 224 patches, which were collected as training and testing samples. Compared to other deep learning methods (Alexnet and VGG) and state-of-the-art traditional machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and bag-of-visual-words), we found that fine-tuning the pretrainedCNNmodel, ResNet-50, could reach the highest accuracy (91.45%). Application cases in Kansas (USA, North America), Mpumalanga (South Africa, Africa), and Kostanay (Kazakhstan, Asia) resulted in classification accuracies of better than 99%, which showed the applicability of the proposed ResNet-50model to the extraction of reservoirs froma vast amount of moderate resolution images. The framework that was developed in this paper is the first attempt to combine remote sensing big data and the deep learning technique to the recognition of reservoirs at a global scale.

AB  - Economic mineralization and hydrothermally altered zones are areas of great economic interests. This study focusses on hydrothermal altered zones of high mineralization potentials in Wadi Al-Bana, in southern Yemen. An azimuthal very low frequency-electromagnetic (AVLF-EM) data acquisition was conducted in search for mineralization in the study area. The study integrated observations from geophysical field data with others extracted from object-oriented principal component analysis (PCA) to better map and understand mineralization in the investigated area. This technique was applied to two data sets, ASTER and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery. The results of PCA revealed high accuracy in detecting alteration minerals and for mapping zones of high concentration of these minerals. The PCA-based distribution of selected alteration zones correlated spatially with high conductivity anomalies in the subsurface that were detected by VLF measurements. Finally, a GIS model was built and successfully utilized to categorize the resulted altered zones, into three levels.

TI  - Coastal Tidal Effects on Industrial Thermal Plumes in Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal tidal effects on thermal plumes are investigated, exploiting remote sensing of two major coastal industrial installations. The installations use sea water as a coolant, which is then released back into coastal environments at a higher-than-ambient temperature, allowing the plume to be delineated from the ambient waters. Satellite-based thermal sensors observing the Earth at spatial resolutions of 90 and 100 m are used. It is possible to identify coastal features and thermal spatial distributions. This paper presents coastal tidal effects on detected plumes for two case studies: an intertidal embayment and open water exposure, both on the coast of the UK. We correlated the behaviours of thermal plumes using remotely sensed high resolution thermal imagery with tidal phases derived from tide gauges. The results show very distinct behaviours for the flood and ebb tides. The detected surface plume location was dependent on flow switching direction for the different types of tide. The detected surface area was dependent on the strength of the currents, with the largest area observed during the strongest currents. Understanding the dispersion of the plume is essential to influence understanding of any potential ecological impacts.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the random forests method and the support vector machine in machine learning are explored and compared to the traditional statistical-based maximum likelihood method with 126 features from Sentinel-2A images. The spectral reflectance of 12 bands, 96 texture parameters, 7 vegetation indices, and 11 phenological parameters are successfully extracted from Sentinel-2A images in 2017. The classification result shows that the optimal combination of 13 features yields overall accuracies of traditional classification and machine learning classification of 88.96% and 98% respectively. Short-wave infrared information shows a significant effect on distinguishing rice, corn, and soybean. The water vapor band plays a significant role in distinguishing between corn and rice. In the multiclassification problem, the machine learning methods have robustness with the identification accuracy of greater than 95% for each crop type, whereas the traditional classification result shows imbalanced accuracies for different crops.

TI  - GRAMAT: a comprehensive Matlab toolbox for estimating global mass variations from GRACE satellite data
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we robustly analyze the noise reduction methods for processing spherical harmonic (SH) coefficient data products collected by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite mission and devise a comprehensive GRACE Matlab Toolbox (GRAMAT) to estimate spatio-temporal mass variations over land and oceans. Functions in GRAMAT contain: (1) destriping of SH coefficients to remove "north-to-south" stripes, or geographically correlated high-frequency errors, and Gaussian smoothing, (2) spherical harmonic analysis and synthesis, (3) assessment and reduction of the leakage effect in GRACE-derived mass variations, and (4) harmonic analysis of regional time series of the mass variations and assessment of the uncertainty of the GRACE estimates. As a case study, we analyze the terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations in the Amazon River basin using the functions in GRAMAT. In addition to obvious seasonal TWS variations in the Amazon River basin, significant interannual TWS variations are detected by GRACE using the GRAMAT, which are consistent with precipitation anomalies in the region. We conclude that using GRAMAT and processing the GRACE level-2 data products, the global spatio-temporal mass variations can be efficiently and robustly estimated, which indicates the potential wide range of GRAMAT's applications in hydrology, oceanography, cryosphere, solid Earth and geophysical disciplines to interpret large-scale mass redistribution and transport in the Earth system. We postulate that GRAMAT will also be an effective tool for the analysis of data from the upcoming GRACE-Follow-On mission.

TI  - A Tree Species Mapping Method from UAV Images over Urban Area Using Similarity in Tree-Crown Object Histograms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information about spatial distribution of tree species in urban areas provides crucial data for sustainable urban development, management and planning. Very high spatial resolution data collected by sensors onboard Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) systems provide rich data sources for mapping tree species. This paper proposes a method of tree species mapping from UAV images over urban areas using similarity in tree-crown object histograms and a simple thresholding method. Tree-crown objects are first extracted and used as processing units in subsequent steps. Tree-crown object histograms of multiple features, i.e., spectral and height related features, are generated to quantify within-object variability. A specific tree species is extracted by comparing similarity in histogram between a target tree-crown object and reference objects. The proposed method is evaluated in mapping four different tree species using UAV multispectral ortho-images and derived Digital Surface Model (DSM) data collected in Shanghai urban area, by comparing with an existing method. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative method for all four tree species, with improvements of 0.61-5.81% in overall accuracy. The proposed method provides a simple and effective way of mapping tree species over urban area.

TI  - Burn severity analysis in Mediterranean forests using maximum entropy model trained with EO-1 Hyperion and LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - All ecosystems and in particular ecosystems in Mediterranean climates are affected by fires. Knowledge of the drivers that most influence burn severity patterns as well an accurate map of post-fire effects are key tools for forest managers in order to plan an adequate post-fire response. Remote sensing data are becoming an indispensable instrument to reach both objectives. This work explores the relative influence of pre-fire vegetation structure and topography on burn severity compared to the impact of post-fire damage level, and evaluates the utility of the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier trained with post-fire EO-1 Hyperion data and pre-fire LiDAR to model three levels of burn severity at high accuracy. We analyzed a large fire in central-eastern Spain, which occurred on 16-19 June 2016 in a maquis shrubland and Pinus halepensis forested area. Post-fire hyperspectral Hyperion data were unmixed using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and five fraction images were generated: char, green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation, soil (NPVS) and shade. Metrics associated with vegetation structure were calculated from pre-fire LiDAR. Post-fire MESMA char fraction image, pre-fire structural metrics and topographic variables acted as inputs to MaxEnt, which built a model and generated as output a suitability surface for each burn severity level. The percentage of contribution of the different biophysical variables to the MaxEnt model depended on the burn severity level (LiDAR-derived metrics had a greater contribution at the low burn severity level), but MaxEnt identified the char fraction image as the highest contributor to the model for all three burn severity levels. The present study demonstrates the validity of MaxEnt as one-class classifier to model burn severity accurately in Mediterranean countries, when trained with post-fire hyperspectral Hyperion data and pre-fire LiDAR.

TI  - Unravelling the molecular mechanisms of nickel in woodlice
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last few years, there has been an alarming increase in the amount of nickel (Ni) being released into the environment, primarily due to its use in the production of stainless steel but also from other sources such as batteries manufacturing and consequent disposal. The established biotic ligand models provide precise estimates for Ni bioavailability, in contrast, studies describing the mechanisms underpinning toxicological effect of Ni are scarce. This study exploits RNA-seq to determine the transcriptomic responses of isopods using Porcellionides pruinosus as an example of a terrestrial metal-resistant woodlouse. Furthermore, the recently proposed model for Ni adverse outcome pathways (Ni-AOP) presents an unprecedented opportunity to fit isopod responses to Ni toxicity and define Porcellionides pruinosus as a metalomic model.Prior to this study, P. pruinosus represented an important environmental sentinel, though lacking genetic/omic data. The reference transcriptome generated here thus represents a major advance and a novel resource. A detailed annotation of the transcripts obtained is presented together with the homology to genes/gene products from Metazoan and Arthropoda phylum, Gene Ontology (GO) classification, clusters of orthologous groups (COG) and assignment to KEGG metabolic pathways.The differential gene expression comparison was determined in response to nickel (Ni) exposure and used to derive the enriched pathways and processes. It revealed a significant impact on ion trafficking and storage, oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reproduction impairment, genetics and epigenetics. Many of the processes observed support the current Ni-AOP although the data highlights that the current model can be improved by including epigenetic endpoints, which represents key chronic risks under a scenario of Ni toxicity.

TI  - SENSITIVITY OF EVAPOTRANSPIRATION ESTIMATED BY ORBITAL IMAGES UNDER INFLUENCE OF SURFACE TEMPERATURE
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature (Ts) is a determining factor to obtain energy balance parameters, being relevant to understand the influence of this variable on the estimation of evapotranspiration. Thus, the objective of this study was to simulate errors in Ts estimation to verify the consequences of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimated by the SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) model. For this, an image of the Landsat-8 satellite was used to induce errors from 0.2K to 10K in the variable Ts, allowing verifying the consequences in the ETa data. After the estimations of Ts and ETa, the quantitative consequences and dynamics of Ts impact on the ETa data were verified along the different land uses in the study area. The results showed that the precise estimation of Ts is essential to obtain ETa accurately. The image of ETa errors presented the highest relative errors on the surface with exposed soils and with high Ts values. However, the highest residuals of ETa images occurred on the surfaces with milder Ts and higher evapotranspiration rates (irrigated surfaces).

M3  - Article
AB  - There is an increasing demand to better understand the dynamics of the vegetation conditions over time as a result of the improvement of remote sensing techniques. Yhis study aimed to analyse the spatio-temporal behavior of vegetation, stratified by land use in area located in Botucatu-SP. We sused21 Landsat-5 TM images in 25 years (1985 - 2010) of analysis. We applied conversion of the digital numbers to physical values, atmospheric and topographic corrections, which allowed to analyze the vegetation changes by using the VCI (Vegetation Condition Index) calculation. The VCI showed a good performance in analyzing the spatiotemporal vegetation condition at a local level, it is sensitive to local variations of rainfall, it enhances the variability of the intra-class land use for the vigor of vegetation. By applying the VCI we were able to observe the vegetation pattern of the semideciduous forest (land use class = Forest) present in the area, fact that makes this methodology recommended in future researches related to the analysis of the vegetation condition.

T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper deals with landslide hazards in the Ebantu district of the Oromia regional state of western Ethiopia. Ninety-two landslides were recorded during field investigations and Google Earth interpretation. The data sets were prepared as a layer in the spatial GIS database that was later utilized for generating the landslide susceptibility zonation map. Slope, elevation, and distance from drainage were extracted from the digital elevation model, the geology is modified from the geological map of Nekemte, and the land use map was prepared from Landsat +ETM satellite (2015) using digital image processing techniques. The statistical index method was applied to identify landslide hazard areas, and statistical analysis was carried out based on the relationship between past landslides and the causative factors. The causative factor map is further classified into a number of classes based on their relative influence on mass movement and rating values are assigned to each class depending on their influence on slope instability. Based on their assigned weight values, the map overlay process is performed using Arc GIS 10.3, and finally, the landslide hazard map showing various zones is produced by the overlay technique.

TI  - A PCA-OLS Model for Assessing the Impact of Surface Biophysical Parameters on Land Surface Temperature Variations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of land surface temperature (LST) spatiotemporal variations and characterization of the factors affecting these variations are of great importance in various environmental studies and applications. The aim of this study is to propose an integrated model for characterizing LST spatiotemporal variations and for assessing the impact of surface biophysical parameters on the LST variations. For this purpose, a case study was conducted in Babol City, Iran, during the period of 1985 to 2018. We used 122 images of Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and products of water vapor (MOD07) and daily LST (MOD11A1) from the MODIS sensor of the Terra satellite, as well as soil and air temperature and relative humidity data measured at the local meteorological station over 112 dates for the study. First, a single-channel algorithm was applied to estimate LST, while various spectral indices were computed to represent surface biophysical parameters, which included the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), normalized difference water index (NDWI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), albedo, brightness, greenness, and wetness from tasseled cap transformation. Next, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to determine the degree of LST variation and the surface biophysical parameters in the temporal dimension at the pixel scale based on Landsat imagery. Finally, the relationship between the first component of the PCA of LST and each surface biophysical parameter was investigated by using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with both regional and local optimizations. The results indicated that among the surface biophysical parameters, variations of NDBI, wetness, and greenness had the highest impact on the LST variations with a correlation coefficient of 0.75, -0.70, and -0.44, and RMSE of 0.71, 1.03, and 1.06, respectively. The impact of NDBI, wetness, and greenness varied geographically, but their variations accounted for 43%, 38%, and 19% of the LST variation, respectively. Furthermore, the correlation coefficient and RMSE between the observed LST variation and modeled LST variation, based on the most influential biophysical factors (NDBI, wetness, and greenness) yielded 0.85 and 1.06 for the regional approach and 0.93 and 0.26 for the local approach, respectively. The results of this study indicated the use of an integrated PCA-OLS model was effective for modeling of various environmental parameters and their relationship with LST. In addition, the PCA-OLS with the local optimization was found to be more efficient than the one with the regional optimization.

TI  - Automated Built-Up Extraction Index: A New Technique for Mapping Surface Built-Up Areas Using LANDSAT 8 OLI Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate built-up area extraction is one of the most critical issues in land-cover classification. In previous studies, various techniques have been developed for built-up area extraction using Landsat images. However, the efficiency of these techniques under different technical and geographical conditions, especially for bare and sandy areas, is not optimal. One of the main challenges of built-up area extraction techniques is to determine an optimum and stable threshold with the highest possible accuracy. In many of these techniques, the optimum threshold value fluctuates substantially in different parts of the image scene. The purpose of this study is to provide a new index to improve built-up area extraction with a stable optimum threshold for different environments. In this study, the developed Automated Built-up Extraction Index (ABEI) is presented to improve the classification accuracy in areas containing bare and sandy surfaces. To develop and evaluate the accuracy of the new method for built-up area extraction with Landsat 8 OLI reflective bands, five test sites located in the Iranian cities (Babol, Naqadeh, Kashmar, Bam and Masjed Soleyman), eleven European cities (Athens, Brussels, Bucharest, Budapest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Riga, Rome and Porto) and high resolution layer imperviousness (HRLI) data were used. Each site has varying environmental and complex surface coverage conditions. To determine the optimal weights for each of the Landsat 8 OLI reflective bands, the pure pixel sets for different classes and the improved gravitational search algorithm (IGSA) optimization were used. The Kappa coefficient and overall error were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of the built-up extraction map. Additionally, the ABEI performance was compared with the urban index (UI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) performances. In each of the five test sites and eleven cities, the extraction accuracy of the built-up areas using the ABEI was higher than that using the UI, and NDBI (P-value of 0.01). The relative standard deviations of the optimal threshold values for the ABEI and UI were 27 and 155% (at five test sites) and were 16 and 37% (at eleven European cities), respectively, which indicates the stability of the ABEI threshold value when the location and environmental conditions change. The results of this study demonstrated that the ABEI can be used to extract built-up areas from other land covers. This index is effective even in bare soil and sandy areas, where other indices experience major challenges.

TI  - Is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Required for a Core Biopsy Diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ with Microinvasion?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Among patients with a core biopsy diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), approximately 10% have microinvasion (DCISM), which, like DCIS, is subject to upstaging by surgical excision, but for which the rates of T and N upstaging are unknown, as is the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), since current studies of SLNB for DCISM are based on the final pathologic report, not the core needle biopsy. In this study, we identified the rates of T and N upstaging following surgical excision in patients with a suspected versus definite core needle biopsy diagnosis of DCISM. Methods Overall, 369 consecutive patients (2007-2017) with a core biopsy diagnosis of suspected versus definite DCISM and surgical excision were stratified by extent of DCISM on core biopsy: suspicious focus, single focus, multiple foci/single biopsy, and multiple foci/multiple biopsies. Within strata, we identified clinicopathologic features associated with T and N upstaging. Results Across core biopsy strata, there were no clear differences in imaging characteristics or median invasive tumor size (0.2 cm). Among 105 patients with a core biopsy suspicious for DCISM versus 264 with definite DCISM, 28% and 37%, respectively, were upstaged to at least pT1a, but only 1% and 6%, respectively, to pN1. Conclusions Although 28% of patients with suspected DCISM on core biopsy were surgically upstaged to invasive cancer, the frequency of pN1 SLN metastasis (1%) was comparable with that of DCIS, and was insufficient to recommend SLNB at initial surgery. SLNB remains reasonable for patients with definite DCISM on core biopsy.

T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim.: To study the feasibility and validity of ultrasound-guided pre-chemotherapy marking of metastatic axillary lymph nodes followed by targeted axillary dissection (TAD), in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT).Material and method: Prospective diagnostic test study conducted between January 2016 and March 2018. Patients with breast cancer and indication for NACT, cN1 or cN2 axillary staging, were included. A clip was placed in the affected lymph node prior to NACT. A sentinel lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) and a clipped lymphnode biopsy (BCLIP) were conducted, followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Location rate (LR) and negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated, taking SLNB, BCLIP and their combination (TAD) as evaluated tests and metastatic involvement in the ALND specimen as the gold standard.Results: Twenty-three patients were included in the study. Sentinel lymph node could only be detected in 19 cases (LR = 80.61%), whereas BCLIP was successful in 22 (LR = 95.65%). The sentinel lymph node coincided with the marked lymph node in 14 patients (60.9%). We found a NPV for the SLNB of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.61-1.0), whereas for TAD it was 1.00 (95%CI: 0.74-1.0).Conclusion: TAD is a feasible test for axillary restaging after NACT, with a higher success rate than SLNB.

TI  - Estimates of landscape composition from terrestrial oblique photographs suggest homogenization of Rocky Mountain landscapes over the last century
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - While orthogonal (i.e., aerial or satellite) imagery has become the more conventional source of land cover data because it can yield spatially accurate land cover maps, terrestrial oblique photographs present a valuable, relatively untapped source of raw optical data for studies of land cover change. We present a case study contrasting how these two types of imagery sample landscape composition and using repeat oblique photographs to evaluate long-term land cover change in a remote region of the Canadian Rocky Mountains. We classified 46 historical oblique photographs and their corresponding modern repeats using the same discrete land cover classes employed in a Landsat-based map of the same area. We compared landscape-level composition estimates from both sources and regressed the land cover proportions from Landsat against the modern oblique images, hypothesizing a linear relationship for most classes. We found that the two sources sampled the landscape in broadly similar ways, with near-concordance for dominant land cover classes, yet that oblique photographs more frequently detected narrow landscape features and estimated higher proportions of rock compared to satellite imagery, possibly due to the higher spatial resolution of the oblique photographs, and to their angle of incidence against steep slopes. We then evaluated land cover change from corresponding historical and repeat photographs and found that the landscape has homogenized over the past century via increased coniferous forest cover. Our work shows that terrestrial oblique photographs can be used to estimate landscape composition, particularly in mountain environments. This is helpful for analyzing past landscape conditions in historical photographs, monitoring decadal-span landscape change and assessing habitat to model biodiversity through time.

TI  - SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIATION OF NO<sub>2</sub> AND SUB-REGIONAL TRANSPORT DURING WINTER POLLUTION EVENTS IN HAIKOU, CHINA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble of satellite measurements, statistic data from government and meteorological diagnosis in regional background site (Haikou, China) has revealed the spatial and temporal characteristics of NO2 and associated synoptic transport patterns over southern China from January 2013 to February 2014. The result are as follows. (1) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite products have a good correlation with observation NO2 in Ilaikou. The correlation coefficients between Observation NO2 and tropospheric column NO2 and ratio of Tro NO2/ Tot NO2 (tropospheric column NO2/ total column NO2) have all passed the confidence level of 99.9% test. (2) Tro NO2 over southern China has an obvious seasonal variation, which is closely coupled with regional meteorology in each season. (3) NO2 concentration in Haikou revealed three pollution periods during December 2013 and January 2014. The variation of NO2 concentration in Haikou is related to the meteorological elements closely. (4) Compared to the monthly mean meteorological fields of the pollution periods, the results indicate that NO2 pollution event in Haikou is directly related to the exogenous transportation from PRD region. An ensemble analysis of meteorological dynamic factors, wind vectors and backward trajectories during the pollution periods further verifies this conclusion.

TI  - A physical model-based method for retrieving urban land surface temperatures under cloudy conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST), due to its synoptic coverage, has been widely used for understanding surface energy and carbon fluxes at local, regional, and global scales. Despite great achievements in developing practical algorithms to estimate LSTs from thermal infrared (TIR) data, the retrieval of LSTs for overcast conditions has received much less attention. Existing techniques, such as passive microwave (PMW) approaches, surface energy balance (SEB) models, and reconstruction algorithms relying on spatial/temporal information, for estimating LSTs under cloudy skies cannot fulfill the need for a spatially and temporally consistent LST dataset. Inspired by recent advancements in physically-based urban canopy models (UCMs), this study synergistically used the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF)/UCM system and the random forest (RF) regression technique (hereafter named as WRFF) to effectively estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Taking the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan region as a test site, the WRF/UCM simulations (LSTs) were performed from April 28 to May 20, 2011. The MODIS LST images of the same period were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the method introduced in this study. LSTs under cloudy conditions for a partially cloudy image were retrieved using the RF model calibrated by clear-sky pixels from the same image. For a fully cloud-contaminated image, clear-sky pixels from its temporally adjacent images were used to calibrate the RF model to estimate LSTs under cloudy conditions. Results showed that the modeling system could well capture diurnal air temperature variations but tended to underestimate temperature values. The correlation coefficient between MODIS LSTs and simulated LSTs exhibited a wide range from 0.5 to 0.9 with the RMSE (root mean square error) value varying from 1.0 to 9.0 K across different land covers. The utilization of the RF regression technique for estimating LSTs under cloudy conditions from a partially cloud-contaminated LST image greatly reduced the RMSE to similar to 1.8 K with an improved correlation coefficient. For fully cloud-contaminated LST images, LSTs were estimated with the correlation coefficient and RMSE values of similar to 0.75 and similar to 2.0 K, respectively. Overall, the WRFF method has potential to generate a consistent and reliable LST dataset for various applications such as quantification of urban heat island intensity and vulnerability analysis of humans to vector-borne diseases. Further research should be made to examine the impact of the temporal distance between the target image and its temporally adjacent images on the performance of the proposed method.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying spatially explicit or pixel-level aboveground forest biomass (AFB) across large regions is critical for measuring forest carbon sequestration capacity, assessing forest carbon balance, and revealing changes in the structure and function of forest ecosystems. When AFB is measured at the species level using widely available remote sensing data, regional changes in forest composition can readily be monitored. In this study, wall-to-wall maps of species-level AFB were generated for forests in Northeast China by integrating forest inventory data with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images and environmental variables through applying the optimal k-nearest neighbor (kNN) imputation model. By comparing the prediction accuracy of 630 kNN models, we found that the models with random forest (RF) as the distance metric showed the highest accuracy. Compared to the use of single-month MODIS data for September, there was no appreciable improvement for the estimation accuracy of species-level AFB by using multi-month MODIS data. When k > 7, the accuracy improvement of the RF-based kNN models using the single MODIS predictors for September was essentially negligible. Therefore, the kNN model using the RF distance metric, single-month (September) MODIS predictors and k = 7 was the optimal model to impute the species-level AFB for entire Northeast China. Our imputation results showed that average AFB of all species over Northeast China was 101.98 Mg/ha around 2000. Among 17 widespread species, larch was most dominant, with the largest AFB (20.88 Mg/ha), followed by white birch (13.84 Mg/ha). Amur corktree and willow had low AFB (0.91 and 0.96 Mg/ha, respectively). Environmental variables (e.g., climate and topography) had strong relationships with species-level AFB. By integrating forest inventory data and remote sensing data with complete spatial coverage using the optimal kNN model, we successfully mapped the AFB distribution of the 17 tree species over Northeast China. We also evaluated the accuracy of AFB at different spatial scales. The AFB estimation accuracy significantly improved from stand level up to the ecotype level, indicating that the AFB maps generated from this study are more suitable to apply to forest ecosystem models (e.g., LINKAGES) which require species-level attributes at the ecotype scale.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Data Fusion for Satellite Images Using Hopfield Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal data fusion refers to the technique of combining high temporal resolution from coarse satellite images and high spatial resolution from fine satellite images. However, data availability remains a major limitation in algorithm development. Existing spatio-temporal data fusion algorithms require at least one known image pair between the fine and coarse resolution image. However, data which come from two different satellite platforms do not necessarily have an overlap in their overpass times, hence restricting the application of spatio-temporal data fusion. In this paper, a new algorithm named Hopfield Neural Network SPatio-tempOral daTa fusion model (HNN-SPOT) is developed by utilizing the optimization concept in the Hopfield neural network (HNN) for spatio-temporal image fusion. The algorithm derives a synthesized fine resolution image from a coarse spatial resolution satellite image (similar to downscaling), with the use of one fine resolution image taken on an arbitrary date and one coarse image taken on a predicted date. The HNN-SPOT particularly addresses the problem when the fine resolution and coarse resolution images are acquired from different satellite overpass times over the same geographic extent. Both simulated datasets and real datasets over Hong Kong and Australia have been used in the evaluation of HNN-SPOT. Results showed that HNN-SPOT was comparable with an existing fusion algorithm, the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM). HNN-SPOT assumes consistent spatial structure for the target area between the date of data acquisition and the prediction date. Therefore, it is more applicable to geographical areas with little or no land cover change. It is shown that HNN-SPOT can produce accurate fusion results with >90% of correlation coefficient over consistent land covers. For areas that have undergone land cover changes, HNN-SPOT can still produce a prediction about the outlines and the tone of the features, if they are large enough to be recorded in the coarse resolution image at the prediction date. HNN-SPOT provides a relatively new approach in spatio-temporal data fusion, and further improvements can be made by modifying or adding new goals and constraints in its HNN architecture. Owing to its lower demand for data prerequisites, HNN-SPOT is expected to increase the applicability of fine-scale applications in remote sensing, such as environmental modeling and monitoring.

TI  - Reduced Rainfall Increases Metabolic Rates in Upper Mixed Layers of Tropical Lakes
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem-level metabolism is a good sentinel for human and natural disturbances in freshwater systems, responding from local changes (for example, land use) to regional and global changes (for example, climate). Despite the increasing understanding of metabolic processes in tropical lakes, our knowledge on how morphometric and catchment characteristics affect metabolic responses to those changes in tropical lakes is still very scarce. We investigated how metabolic rates in the upper mixed layer of twelve Brazilian tropical lakes responded to reduced rainfall, considering their lake area and drainage area ratio and the percentage of native forest cover in their drainage area. An 80% reduction in the 2013 rainy season rainfall, compared with 2012, resulted in a reduction of approximated 1 m in the water column depth, a 1-2 m deepening of the upper mixed layer, a 50% reduction in mean light availability, and a doubling in total phosphorus concentrations. These changes were associated with 38% increases in gross primary production (GPP), stimulated by higher nutrient concentrations and reduced photoinhibition. These effects of reduced rainfall were strongest in lakes with a small volume in relation to their catchment areas. Our results show that climatic-related reductions in precipitation in this tropical region will reduce lake volumes, affect temperature, water mixing, and nutrient supply with pronounced effects on lake metabolic processes and carbon cycling in this region.

T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Satellite-derived data, including an estimation of the eruption rate, proximal volcanic deposits and lava flow morphometric parameters (area, maximum length, thickness, and volume) are provided for the eruption that occurred at Mt Etna on 6-8 December 2015. This eruption took place at the New Southeast Crater (NSEC), the youngest of the summit craters of Etna, shortly after a sequence of four violent paroxysmal events took place in 65 h (3-5 December) at "Voragine", the oldest summit crater. Multispectral SEVIRI images at 15 min sampling time have been used to compute time-averaged eruption rate curves, while tri-stereo Pleiades images, at 50 cm spatial resolution, provided the pre-eruptive topography and topographic changes due to volcanic deposits. In addition to the two types of satellite data, other parameters have been inferred, such as probable vesicularity and pyroclastic deposits. Dataset: 10.5281/zenodo.3362925 Dataset License: CC-BY-NC

TI  - Urban expansion using remote-sensing data and a monocentric urban model
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of urban land use is an indispensable tool of urban policy, particularly in developing countries which are facing rapid urbanization. However, most sophisticated spatial-analysis methods used in developed countries are not applicable to developing countries due to the limited availability of spatially-resolved statistical data. This study examines the applicability of a simple, classic monocentric urban model for capturing urban activities in three Chinese cities in 2003 and 2013. The model estimates traffic cost, goods consumption, area of available residential floor space, and rents for residential floor space by aggregating urban statistics and estimating urban areas using remote sensing data. We find that some predictions of our model are inaccurate due to its simple, static nature; however, the model predicts meaningful temporal trends in key variables and meaningful differences among the population and economic growth trajectories of the three cities. Our results imply that the classic monocentric model is useful for approximating urban activities and for strategic planning of urban traffic policies, as it allows tracing of the causal mechanisms of urban activity and furnishes estimates for several critical statistical measures needed for policy evaluation. Although a monocentric model may not allow detailed representation of urban activity, we show that our simple model nonetheless offers advantages for studying urban planning practices in developing nations in which the availability of statistical data is limited.

TI  - NWCSAF High Resolution Winds (NWC/GEO-HRW) Stand-Alone Software for Calculation of Atmospheric Motion Vectors and Trajectories
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The High Resolution Winds (NWC/GEO-HRW) software is developed by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility on Support to Nowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting (NWCSAF). It is part of a stand-alone software package for the calculation of meteorological products with geostationary satellite data (NWC/GEO). NWCSAF High Resolution Winds provides a detailed calculation of Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) and Trajectories, locally and in near real time, using as input geostationary satellite image data, NWP model data, and OSTIA sea surface temperature data. The whole NWC/GEO software package can be obtained after registration at the NWCSAF Helpdesk, www.nwcsaf.org, where users also find support and help for its use. NWC/GEO v2018.1 software version, available since autumn 2019, is able to process MSG, Himawari-8/9, GOES-N, and GOES-R satellite series images, so that AMVs and trajectories can be calculated all throughout the planet Earth with the same algorithm and quality. Considering other equivalent meteorological products, in the 2014 and 2018 AMV Intercomparison Studies' NWCSAF High Resolution Winds compared very positively with six other AMV algorithms for both MSG and Himawari-8/9 satellites. Finally, the Coordination Group for Meteorological Satellites (CGMS) recognized in its 2012 Meeting Report': (1) NWCSAF High Resolution Winds fulfills the requirements to be a portable stand-alone AMV calculation software due to its easy installation and usability. (2) It has been successfully adopted by some CGMS members and serves as an important tool for development. It is modular, well documented, and well suited as stand-alone AMV software. (3) Although alternatives exist as portable stand-alone AMV calculation software, they are not as advanced in terms of documentation and do not have an existing Helpdesk.

T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper provides geometric accuracy improvements for very high resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) Ortho Ready Standard Level-2A (ORS2A) satellite images in the panchromatic (PAN) band. The entire process can be divided into two steps: (1) sensor orientation, which was conducted on 40 ground control points (GCPs) to determine which sensor model was best depending on various numbers of GCPs; and (2) orthorectification, whose main objective was to compare the accuracy of the process when using different freely available global digital elevation models (DEMs). The research showed that a sensor model based on rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) with a shift or zero-order bias correction attained the best geopositioning accuracy during the orientation step with the use of seven GCPs. The highest accuracy was achieved for images orthorectified with the ALOS World 3D-30 m DEM (AW3D30).

T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The natural and semi-natural areas within cities provide important refuges for biodiversity, as well as many benefits to people. To study urban ecology and quantify the benefits of urban ecosystems, we need to understand the spatial extent and configuration of different types of vegetated cover within a city. It is challenging to map urban ecosystems because they are typically small and highly fragmented; thus requiring high resolution satellite images. This article describes a new high-resolution map of land cover for the tropical city-state of Singapore. We used images from WorldView and QuickBird satellites, and classified these images using random forest machine learning and supplementary datasets into 12 terrestrial land classes. Close to 50 % of Singapore's land cover is vegetated while freshwater fills about 6 %, and the rest is bare or built up. The overall accuracy of the map was 79 % and the class-specific errors are described in detail. Tropical regions such as Singapore have a lot of cloud cover year-round, complicating the process of mapping using satellite imagery. The land cover map provided here will have applications for urban biodiversity studies, ecosystem service quantification, and natural capital assessment.

TI  - Assessing risk of collapse of Lake Burullus Ramsar site in Egypt using IUCN Red List of Ecosystems
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) assessment is a new powerful scheme that identifies ecosystems that are at risk of collapse due to global environmental changes, which can help any mitigation actions aimed at conserving and rescuing these natural ecosystems. The current study applied RLE assessment protocol on Lake Burullus ecosystem, a highly productive wetland ecosystem, Ramsar site and International Bird Area (IBA) of Egypt. A conceptual model of the key ecosystem processes for Burullus wetland was constructed. The application of RLE followed the standard protocol for the first four criteria; (A) declines in distribution, (B) restricted distribution, (C) degradation of the abiotic components, and (D) regarding the assessment of the disruption of biotic processes and interactions. However, data were insufficient for assessing Criterion (E) that entails conducting quantitative estimates of the risk of collapse. Multi-date satellite images were obtained and processed to estimate the changes in the spatial distribution under criteria (A) and (B) of the study area. For evaluating Criteria (C) and (D), long-term data were collected from literature and previous works to cover the time frame of the assessment as much as possible. The results from the RLE assessment revealed that the status of the ecosystem is Critically Endangered (CR), which was attributed to various types of threats that caused degradation of the natural quality and integrity of the ecosystem. Although the RLE assessment provides a coherent approach for identifying ecosystems vulnerable to human-induced changes; data insufficiency can be an impediment for the efficient application of the RLE assessment. Remotely-sensed data can help in derivation of suitable spectral indicators of the status of the ecosystems structure and functioning that might overcome some of the challenges of data adequacy and relevance to the RLE assessment especially for the understudied and data-deficient ecosystems.

TI  - Spatial Prediction of Wildfire Susceptibility Using Field Survey GPS Data and Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, global climate change discussions have become more prominent, and forests are considered as the ecosystems most at risk by the consequences of climate change. Wildfires are among one of the main drivers leading to losses in forested areas. The increasing availability of free remotely sensed data has enabled the precise locations of wildfires to be reliably monitored. A wildfire data inventory was created by integrating global positioning system (GPS) polygons with data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for Amol County, northern Iran. The GPS polygon dataset from the state wildlife organization was gathered through extensive field surveys. The integrated inventory dataset, along with sixteen conditioning factors (topographic, meteorological, vegetation, anthropological, and hydrological factors), was used to evaluate the potential of different machine learning (ML) approaches for the spatial prediction of wildfire susceptibility. The applied ML approaches included an artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF). All ML approaches were trained using 75% of the wildfire inventory dataset and tested using the remaining 25% of the dataset in the four-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure. The CV method is used for dealing with the randomness effects of the training and testing dataset selection on the performance of applied ML approaches. To validate the resulting wildfire susceptibility maps based on three different ML approaches and four different folds of inventory datasets, the true positive and false positive rates were calculated. In the following, the accuracy of each of the twelve resulting maps was assessed through the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The resulting CV accuracies were 74%, 79% and 88% for the ANN, SVM and RF, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a serious complication of endovascular angioplasty and stent placement for long-standing intracranial stenosis, resulting in neurologic dysfunction, seizure, or reperfusion hemorrhage. Rigorous control of blood pressure is commonly used in the perioperative period to prevent cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome, but the optimal blood pressure is often arbitrary. We describe the angiographic features that reflect impaired cerebral autoregulation and microvascular transit abnormality, which may be used to gauge the optimal blood pressure parameters in the immediate postintervention period for prevention of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome.

TI  - Immune response profile of primary tumour, sentinel and non-sentinel axillary lymph nodes related to metastasis in breast cancer: an immunohistochemical point of view
T2  - HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CELL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Approximately 1.67 million new cases of breast cancer (BC) are diagnosed annually, and patient survival significantly decreases when the disease metastasizes. The axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) are the main doorway for BC tumoral cell escape, through which cells can disseminate to distant organs. The immune response, which principally develops in the lymph nodes, is linked to cancer progression, and its efficacy at controlling tumoral growth is compromised during the disease. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is one of the most widely used research techniques for studying the immune response. It allows the measurement of the expression of particular markers related to the immune populations. This review focuses on the role of the immune populations in the primary tumour in the locoregional metastasis of the ALN, and the relationship of the immune response in these regions to distant metastasis. We considered only studies of immune cells using IHC techniques. In particular, lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells all play important roles in BC and have been extensively studied. Although further research is needed, there is much evidence of their role in the invasion of the ALN and distant organs. Their association with tumoral growth or protection has not yet been demonstrated decisively and is very likely to be determined by a combination of factors. Moreover, even though IHC is a widely used technique in cancer diagnosis and research, there is still room for improvement, since its quantification needs to be properly standardized.

AB  - Increasing global urbanisation is leading to a rise in the number of people living in informal settlements, challenging our ability to achieve sustainable development goals. As a consequence of high building density, inadequate building methods and flammable building materials, informal settlements are highly vulnerable to the devastating impacts of fire. Databases on historic fire occurrence, location and extent are scarce, especially in the Global South. This paper explores the potential for remote sensing technologies to fill this gap. Two case studies in Cape Town representing fire of different extent and build back characteristics, are used to demonstrate that Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can be used to detect known historic informal settlement fire. A pixel based approach applied to Sentinel-2 band 2 reflectance and Sentinel 1 backscatter and interferometry are highlighted. The concept of spatial autocorrelation is explored with both Sentinel-2 and 1 data showing that a 3 x 3 pixel standard deviation kernel and hotspot analysis can complement the pixel approach. Further research is required to test these methods within a time series change detection algorithm to identify unknown historic informal settlement fires.

TI  - Utility of Multistep Protocols in the Analysis of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Cutaneous Melanoma An Assessment of 194 Cases
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PATHOLOGY & LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 107th Annual Meeting of the United-States-and-Canadian-Academy-of-Pathology (USCAP)
CL  - Vancouver, CANADA
AB  - Context.-Currently, no universal protocol exists for the assessment of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in cutaneous melanoma. Many institutions use a multistep approach with multiple hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical stains. However, this can be a costly and time- and resource-consuming task.Objective.-To assess the utility for multistep protocols in the analysis of melanoma SLNs by specifically evaluating the Calgary Laboratory Services (CLS) protocol (which consists of 3 H&E slides and 1 S100 protein, 1 HMB-45, and 1 Melan-A slide per melanoma SLN block) and to develop a more streamlined protocol.Design.-Histologic slides from SLN resections from 194 patients with diagnosed cutaneous melanoma were submitted to the CLS dermatopathology group. Tissue blocks were processed according to the CLS SLN protocol. The slides were re-reviewed to determine whether or not metastatic melanoma was identified microscopically at each step of the protocol. Using SPSS software, a decision tree was then created to determine which step most accurately reflected the true diagnosis.Results.-We found with Melan-A immunostain that 337 of 337 negative SLNs (100%) were correctly diagnosed as negative and 55 of 56 positive nodes (98.2%) were correctly diagnosed as positive. With the addition of an H&E level, 393 of 393 SLNs (100%) were accurately diagnosed.Conclusions.-We recommend routine melanoma SLN evaluation protocols be limited to 2 slides: 1 H&E stain and 1 Melan-A stain. This protocol is both time-and cost-efficient and yields high diagnostic accuracy.

TI  - Paving the Way to Increased Interoperability of Earth Observations Data Cubes
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observations data cubes (EODCs) are a paradigm transforming the way users interact with large spatio-temporal Earth observation (EO) data. It enhances connections between data, applications and users facilitating management, access and use of analysis ready data (ARD). The ambition is allowing users to harness big EO data at a minimum cost and effort. This significant interest is illustrated by various implementations that exist. The novelty of the approach results in different innovative solutions and the lack of commonly agreed definition of EODC. Consequently, their interoperability has been recognized as a major challenge for the global change and Earth system science domains. The objective of this paper is preventing EODC from becoming silos of information; to present how interoperability can be enabled using widely-adopted geospatial standards; and to contribute to the debate of enhanced interoperability of EODC. We demonstrate how standards can be used, profiled and enriched to pave the way to increased interoperability of EODC and can help delivering and leveraging the power of EO data building, efficient discovery, access and processing services.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of organochlorine pesticides in an apex predator: Influence of government regulations and farming practices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intensification of agricultural practices has caused several negative effects to the environment. The use of fertilizers and pesticides may alter geochemical cycles or cause direct wildlife intoxication. Detrimental effects of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have forced the authorities to ban or restrict its use. This study evaluates the variation in levels of OCPs in a sentinel species in relation to changes in government regulations and the spatial configuration of agricultural practices around the nests.Methods: Between 2003 and 2007, we analysed OCP levels in 256 blood samples of Eurasian Eagle-owl (Bubo bubo) chicks nesting in area of intensive commercial agriculture with historical frequent use of pesticides, in South-eastern Spain. We studied year-to-year variations in OCP concentrations and their relation with land use configuration around raptor nests by Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM).Results: OCPs were detected in 100% samples surveyed in 2003 and 2004, while dropped to 27% in 2005, 6.8% in 2006 and 6.3% in 2007, coinciding with the ban of OCPs. The presence of the main OCPs was related to agricultural practices. In particular, endosulfan and lindane were related to irrigated crops and urban areas, while DDT-related compounds and dieldrin were associated with dry land farming.Conclusions: OCP concentrations in blood samples of Eurasian Eagle-owls may respond quickly to the implementations of new regulations about the use of agricultural products. This raptor was confirmed as a good sentinel species allowing rapid detection of changes in pesticides use.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Geodetic Observations and Modeling of the 2017 Mw 6.3 Jinghe Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mw 6.3 Jinghe earthquake struck Xingjiang Province, China, on 8 August 2017 (05:15:04 UTC); the epicenter was near the Kusongmuxieke Piedmont Fault (KPF) of the northern Tian Shan Mountains. We used multi-source and multi-track satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques to reconstruct the coseismic displacement field from different line-of-sight geometries. To reduce the phase artifacts, we employed multi-temporal scenes acquired by Sentinel-1, and reconstructed the coseismic deformation through a temporal averaging strategy. Together with a single interferometric pair obtained using the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR2) sensor aboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS2), we obtained five displacement maps with slightly different viewing geometries; all of which were used to constrain a geodetic inversion to retrieve the fault geometry parameters and slip distribution. Based on the focal mechanism and regional geology, we constructed multiple fault models that differ in dip direction (south and north dipping), and various striking angles. Both models fit the InSAR displacement maps, but have slip distributions of different depths. The slip depth of the south dipping model, with a dip of similar to 42 degrees, is the most consistent with the relocated earthquake sequence and regional geological structure. Through the geodetic inversion, the maximum slip (0.25 m) occurred at 14.05 km and the associated rake was 89.56 degrees. The result implies that the seismogenic fault is a blind thrust fault north of KPF (towards the foreland). Considering the relative locations of the suggested blind fault, the KPF, and the continuing north to south (N-S) shortening of the Tian Shan Mountains, this fault could be formed by the northward propagation of the regional fold-thrust belt.

TI  - Does Earlier and Increased Spring Plant Growth Lead to Reduced Summer Soil Moisture and Plant Growth on Landscapes Typical of Tundra-Taiga Interface?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past four decades, satellite observations have shown intensified global greening. At the same time, widespread browning and reversal of or stalled greening have been reported at high latitudes. One of the main reasons for this browning/lack of greening is thought to be warming-induced water stress, i.e., soil moisture depletion caused by earlier spring growth and increased summer evapotranspiration. To investigate these phenomena, we use MODIS collection 6, Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies third-generation (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI3g), and Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) satellite-based root-zone soil moisture data. The study area was the Far North of Ontario (FNO), 453,788 km(2) of heterogeneous landscape typical of the tundra-taiga interface, consisting of unmanaged boreal forests growing on mineral and peat soils, wetlands, and the most southerly area of tundra. The results indicate that the increased plant growth in spring leads to decreased summer growth. Lower summer soil moisture is related to increased spring plant growth in areas with lower soil moisture content. We also found that earlier start of growing season leads to decreased summer and peak season maximum plant growth. In conclusion, increased spring plant growth and earlier start of growing season deplete summer soil moisture and decrease the overall summer plant growth even in temperature-limited high latitude ecosystems. Our findings contribute to evolving understanding of changes in vegetation dynamics in relation to climate in northern high latitude terrestrial ecosystems.

TI  - The influence of papillary thyroid microcarcinomas size on the occurrence of lymph node metastases
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUON
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Lymph node metastases (LNM) in papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMC) are common. PTMC greater than 5 mm are considered to be more aggressive. Tumor greater than 5 mm is predictive factor for occurrence of LNM in PTMC, although there are insufficient data regarding this fact. The purpose of this study was to explore the relation between LNM and patients with small (<= 5mm) and large (>5mm) PTMC. The second target was to determine the frequency of multifocality, bilaterality and capsular invasion in small and large PTMC, and their relation with LNM occurrence.Methods: This study included 257 patients with PTMC. In all patients total thyroidectomy was performed, and lymph node checking of central and lateral neck region using sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in clinically N0 patients, or modified radical neck dissection in clinically N1b patients or in case with positive SLN.Results: LNM were detected in 33% of the patients, 27% in the central neck region and 20% in the lateral neck region with 6.23% of skip metastases. LNM were significantly frequent in large PTMC compared with small (46 vs 24%), in the central region (38 vs 19%) and the lateral region (28 vs 14%), with skip metastases 7.62% and 5.26%, respectively. Bilaterality and capsular invasion were frequent in large PTMC. Multifocality and male gander were predictive factors for LNM in small PTMC, while capsular invasion was the only predictive factor in large PTMC.Conclusions: Although LNM are frequent in large PTMC, the percentage of LNM is not negligible in small PTMC, especially if they are multifocal.

TI  - He Modified Letter Turned Commaike Modified Letter Turned Commaana ia i ka pono (it is a recognizing of the right thing): how one indigenous worldview informs relational values and social values
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ideas of relational values and social values are gaining prominence in sustainability science. Here, we ask: how well do these value conceptions resonate with one Indigenous worldview? The relational values concept broadens conceptions of values beyond instrumental and intrinsic values to encompass preferences and principles about human relationships that involve more-than-humans. The social values concept, an umbrella idea, captures a plurality of values related to society and the common good. After a general description of these two concepts as expressed in the Western peer-reviewed literature, we adopt the lens of relational values to engage with decades of scholarly work and millennia of wisdom based on Indigenous Hawaiian worldviews. We describe five long-standing Hawaiian values that embody notions of appropriate relationships, including human-ecosystem relationships: pono (similar to righteousness, balance); hoModified Letter Turned Commaomana (similar to creating spirituality); malama (similar to care); kuleana (similar to right, responsibility); aloha (similar to love, connection). We find that all five resonate deeply with, and help to enrich, relational value concepts. We then draw on these Hawaiian values to discuss differences between relational values and social values frameworks; though both concepts add useful elements to the discourse about values, the relational values concept may be particularly well positioned to represent elements often important to indigenous worldviews-elements such as reciprocity, balance, and extension of "society" beyond human beings. As global processes (e.g., IPBES) commit to better reflecting Indigenous and local knowledge and embrace diverse value concepts as (purported) avenues toward representing values held by diverse communities, our findings suggest that relational values offer special promise and a crucial contribution.

TI  - Field effectiveness of new visceral leishmaniasis regimens after 1 year following treatment within public health facilities in Bihar, India
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background An earlier open label, prospective, non-randomized, non-comparative, multi-centric study conducted within public health facilities in Bihar, India (CTRI/2012/08/002891) measured the field effectiveness of three new treatment regimens for visceral leishmaniasis (VL): single dose AmBisome (SDA), and combination therapies of AmBisome and miltefosine (AmB+Milt) and miltefosine and paromomycin (Milt+PM) up to 6 months follow-up. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP) recommended an extended follow up at 12 months post-treatment of the original study cohort to quantify late relapses. Methods The 1,761 patients enrolled in the original study with the three new regimens were contacted and traced between 10 and 36 months following completion of treatment to determine their health status and any occurrence of VL relapse. Results Of 1,761 patients enrolled in the original study, 1,368 were traced at the extended follow-up visit: 711 (80.5%), 295 (83.2%) and 362 (71.5%) patients treated with SDA, AmB+Milt and Milt+PM respectively. Of those traced, a total of 75 patients were reported to have relapsed by the extended follow-up; 45 (6.3%) in the SDA, 25 (8.5%) in the AmB+Milt and 5 (1.4%) in the Milt+PM arms. Of the 75 relapse cases, 55 had already been identified in the 6-months follow-up and 20 were identified as new cases of relapse at extended follow-up; 7 in the SDA, 10 in the AmB+Milt and 3 in the Milt+PM arms. Conclusion Extending follow-up beyond the standard 6 months identified additional relapses, suggesting that 12-month sentinel follow-up may be useful as a programmatic tool to better identify and quantify relapses. With limited drug options, there remains an urgent need to develop effective new chemical entities (NCEs) for VL.Author summary In 2010, the WHO Expert Committee recommended liposomal amphotericin B (in single or multiple doses) along with three short combination treatment regimens containing liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB), miltefosine (Milt) and/or paromomycin (PM) as preferred options to replace the existing miltefosine monotherapy for kala-azar treatment in South Asia. The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) in partnership with Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Science (RMRI-Regional ICMR institute), State Health Society Bihar, and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) conducted a phase 4 field effectiveness study to determine the effectiveness and to assess the safety and feasibility of using single dose LAmB, and the combination therapies of LAmB+Milt and Milt+PM for the treatment of VL at public healthcare facility settings in India. Based on the provisional results of this effectiveness study at 6 months follow-up, the Indian government revised the national policy in August 2014, introducing SDA as first option and Milt+PM as second option to replace miltefosine monotherapy in the kala-azar elimination initiative. National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme (NVBDCP) expert committee recommended to follow up this large cohort of patients for one year to identify relapses yielding further evidence on new treatment regimens.

TI  - A range-wide model of contemporary, omnidirectional connectivity for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As habitat destruction leads to species extinctions globally, conservation planning that accounts for population-level connectivity and gene flow is an urgent priority. Models that only approximate habitat potential are incomplete because areas of high habitat potential may be isolated, whereas intermixed areas of lower habitat potential may still be critical for maintaining connectivity between and among populations. We developed a range-wide, omnidirectional (coreless) connectivity model and map for the threatened Mojave desert tortoise at a high spatial resolution (30 m), based on empirical movement data and a circuit-theoretic approach to estimating connectivity. Specifically, we first estimated habitat potential (i.e., quality) for tortoise movement (as distinct from habitat potential more generally) across its range using hypotheses based on the published literature, linear mixed models, multiple environmental factors derived from remotely sensed data, and recent solar and wind development footprints. The resultant raster output was used to represent landscape conductance in a circuit-theoretic model of connectivity, which relates the flow of electrical current through a circuit to the movement of tortoises through the landscape. We then modeled potential connectivity across the range of the tortoise using Circuitscape software and the Julia numerical programming language. Intermediate distances from minor roads, intermediate values of annual average maximum temperature, and increasing density of desert washes were among the strongest predictors of movement habitat quality. There was also strong evidence for increased habitat quality for movement with increasing amounts of vegetation cover. The resulting connectivity model and map was determined to accurately reflect important areas for tortoise movement, but we encourage others to do their own evaluation of the model within local areas of interest and as more data become available. Accordingly, the map can provide an important component to improve management decisions that have the potential to influence the conservation of connected desert tortoise populations throughout the range.

TI  - Delineating ground deformation over the Tengiz oil field, Kazakhstan, using the Intermittent SBAS (ISBAS) DInSAR algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in subsurface pore pressures and stresses due to the extraction of hydrocarbons often cause deformation over oil and gas fields. This can have significant consequences, including ground subsidence, induced seismicity and well failures. Geodynamic monitoring is an important requirement in recognising potential threats in sufficient time for remedial measures to be implemented. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is increasingly utilised for monitoring ground deformation over oil and gas reservoirs, achieving greater spatial coverage than traditional field-based surveying techniques. However, ground deformation over oil and gas fields can extend regionally into the surrounding rural landscape, where many conventional DInSAR techniques are of limited use due to the dynamic nature of the land cover. The Intermittent Small Baseline Subset (ISBAS) method is an advanced DInSAR technique, which considers the intermittent nature of coherence over dynamic land cover types to obtain markedly more ground motion measurements in non-urban regions. In this study, the ISBAS technique is used to delineate deformation over the super-giant Tengiz oil field in rural Kazakhstan. Analysis of ENVISAT data for 2004-2009 reveals a well-defined bowl subsiding with a maximum rate of -15.7 mm/year, corroborated by independent DInSAR studies and traditional levelling data. Subsequent application of ISBAS to Sentinel-1 data reveals significant evolution of deformation over the field in 2016-2017, with subsidence increasing dramatically to a maximum of -79.3 mm/year. The increased density of measurements obtained using the ISBAS technique enables accurate and comprehensive delineation and characterisation of ground deformation in this rural landscape, without the need for corner reflectors. This enhanced information could ultimately aid reservoir characterisation and management, and improve understanding of the risk posed by ground subsidence and fault reactivation.

TI  - Re-Discovering Ancient Landscapes: Archaeological Survey of Mound Features from Historical Maps in Northwest India and Implications for Investigating the Large-Scale Distribution of Cultural Heritage Sites in South Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Incomplete datasets curtail the ability of archaeologists to investigate ancient landscapes, and there are archaeological sites whose locations remain unknown in many parts of the world. To address this problem, we need additional sources of site location data. While remote sensing data can often be used to address this challenge, it is enhanced when integrated with the spatial data found in old and sometimes forgotten sources. The Survey of India 1 '' to 1-mile maps from the early twentieth century are one such dataset. These maps documented the location of many cultural heritage sites throughout South Asia, including the locations of numerous mound features. An initial study georeferenced a sample of these maps covering northwest India and extracted the location of many potential archaeological sites-historical map mound features. Although numerous historical map mound features were recorded, it was unknown whether these locations corresponded to extant archaeological sites. This article presents the results of archaeological surveys that visited the locations of a sample of these historical map mound features. These surveys revealed which features are associated with extant archaeological sites, which were other kinds of landscape features, and which may represent archaeological mounds that have been destroyed since the maps were completed nearly a century ago. Their results suggest that there remain many unreported cultural heritage sites on the plains of northwest India and the mound features recorded on these maps best correlate with older archaeological sites. They also highlight other possible changes in the large-scale and long-term distribution of settlements in the region. The article concludes that northwest India has witnessed profound changes in its ancient settlement landscapes, creating in a long-term sequence of landscapes that link the past to the present and create a foundation for future research and preservation initiatives.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Nomogram to Predict Lymphedema After Axillary Surgery and Radiation Therapy in Women With Breast Cancer From the NCIC CTG MA.20 Randomized Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Regional nodal irradiation for women with breast cancer is known to be an important risk factor for the development of upper extremity lymphedema, but tools to accurately predict lymphedema risks for individual patients are lacking. This study sought to develop and validate a nomogram to predict lymphedema risk after axillary surgery and radiation therapy in women with breast cancer.Methods and Materials: Data from 1832 women accrued on the MA.20 trial between March 2000 and February 2007 were used to create a prognostic model with National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Version 2.0 grade 2 or higher lymphedema as the primary endpoint. Multivariable logistic regression estimated model performance. External validation was performed on data from a single large academic cancer center (N = 785).Results: In the MA.20 trial cohort, 3 risk factors were predictive of lymphedema risk: body mass index (adjusted odds ratio, 1.05 per unit body mass index; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.08, P < .001), extent of axillary surgery (adjusted odds radio for 8-11 lymph nodes removed, 3.28 [95% CI, 1.53-7.89] P = .004; 12-15 lymph nodes, 4.04 [95% CI, 1.76-10.26] P = .002; >= 16 nodes, 5.08 [95% CI, 2.26-12.70] P < .001), and extent of nodal irradiation (adjusted odds radio for limited, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.08-2.56] P = .02; for extensive, 2.31 [95% CI, 1.28-4.10] P = .004). A nomogram was created from these data that predicted lymphedema risk with reasonable accuracy confirmed by both internal (concordance index, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.64-0.74) and external validation (concordance index, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.76).Conclusions: The nomogram created from the MA.20 randomized trial data using clinical information may be useful for lymphedema screening and risk stratification for therapeutic intervention trials.

TI  - Computer Model Calibration Based on Image Warping Metrics: An Application for Sea Ice Deformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice plays an important role in the global climate. Sea ice models governed by physical equations have been used to simulate the state of the ice including characteristics such as ice thickness, concentration, and motion. More recent models also attempt to capture features such as fractures or leads in the ice. These simulated features can be partially misaligned or misshapen when compared to observational data, whether due to numerical approximation or incomplete physics. In order to make realistic forecasts and improve understanding of the underlying processes, it is necessary to calibrate the numerical model to field data. Traditional calibration methods based on generalized least-square metrics are flawed for linear features such as sea ice cracks. We develop a statistical emulation and calibration framework that accounts for feature misalignment and misshapenness, which involves optimally aligning model output with observed features using cutting-edge image registration techniques. This work can also have application to other physical models which produce coherent structures. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - Multitemporal spatial analysis of forest fragments in the Barra Seca River basin, ES: a case study
T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal spatial analysis for monitoring land cover and use is an important tool for understanding the evolutionary dynamics of a certain region. This study aims at determining and using landscape ecology indices to map and analyze the forest landscape structure in the Barra Seca River basin, an area of 2,216.56 km2, in northern Espirito Santo, in 1985, 1996, 2006 and 2016. The forest patches composing the landscape were isolated and classified by area size using remote sensing techniques by supervised classification and the Bhattacharya algorithm. The landscape metrics and indices in the Patch Analyst extension and V- Late 2 Beta allowed identifying 2366, 2540, 3156 and 3052 forest patches in 1985, 1996, 2006 and 2016, respectively. These patches were classified by size into four classes as follows, smaller than 5 ha (C1), between 5 and 10 ha (C2), between 10 and 100 ha (C3), and larger than 100 ha (C4). The landscape metrics was used to determine quantitatively the area index; density and size; shape; edge; proximity and core area using the edge effect of 35, 60 and 120 m for the patch classes and applied to the total forest patches per year. The number of forest patches smaller than 100 ha increased between 1985 and 2016, while larger patches decreased. The patches greater than 100 ha had the most irregular shapes and higher core area index, even for the edge effect of greater distance. The metrics indices show that landscape fragmentation and irregular shaped patches are increasing in the basin while edge effect is being maximized.

TI  - A Network Meta-Analysis of Surgical Treatment in Patients With Early Breast Cancer
T2  - JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: In early breast cancer treatment, the preferred surgical regimen remains a topic of controversy, and conventional pairwise meta-analysis cannot provide a hierarchy based on clinical trial evidence. Therefore, a network metaanalysis was performed both for direct and indirect comparisons and to assess the survival outcomes of surgical regimens.Methods: Randomized clinical trials comparing different surgical regimens for the treatment of early breast cancer were identified. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free-survival (DFS) were analyzed using random-effects network meta-analysis on the hazard ratio (HR) scale and calculated as combined HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All statistical tests were two-sided.Results: The network meta-analysis compared 11 different surgical regimens that consisted of 13 and 17 direct comparisons between strategies for OS (34 trials; n = 23 587 patients) and DFS (32 trials; n = 22 552 patients), respectively. The values of surface under the cumulative ranking for OS and DFS after mastectomy (M)+radiotherapy (RT) were observed to be the largest. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS)+axillary node sampling+RT almost achieved the threshold for inferiority compared with the other surgical treatment arms and was statistically significantly associated with worse OS (HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.94; HR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.92; HR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.96). No statistically significant difference between BCS+sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)+RT vs BCS+SLNB+intraoperative RT was observed in carrying out network meta-analysis (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.64 to 1.36).Conclusions: M+RT is safer than other surgical regimens for the treatment of early breast cancer patients because of the favorable balance between the survival outcomes. Early breast cancer patients who receive BCS should be given SLNB and not axillary node sampling. Intraoperative RT is no better than postoperative RT in patients who receive SLNB.

TI  - The 2017 Noneruptive Unrest at the Caldera of Cerro Azul Volcano (Galapagos Islands) Revealed by InSAR Observations and Geodetic Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An unrest event occurred at the Cerro Azul volcano, Galapagos Islands, South America, in March 2017, leading to significant surface deformation on the southern Isabela Island, without eruption or surface rupture. We collected single-look complex synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images sensed by the Sentinel-1A satellite, obtaining eight differential interferograms, of which four showed extensive surface displacement during the co-unrest period. Geodetic data indicated that the unrest continued from 18 March to 25 March, reaching a negative peak displacement of -32.9 cm in the caldera and a positive peak displacement of 41.8 cm on the south-east plain in the line-of-sight direction. A joint magma source deformation model, consisting of a Mogi source below the caldera and a sill source south-east of the caldera, was inverted by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method combined with the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm, acquiring the best fit with the four interferograms. The magma transport mechanism of the event was explained by magma overflowing from the compressive Mogi to the tensile sill source, resulting in the observed infinity-shaped deformation fields. Additionally, we investigated previous events with eruption rifts and lava lakes in 1979, 1998, and 2008, and proposed a potential hazard of tectonic volcanic activity for further volcanic susceptibility research in the Cerro Azul area.

TI  - Nomination-favoured opinion pool for optical-SAR-synergistic rice mapping in face of weakened flooding signals
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using satellite image data it is possible to distinguish paddy rice from other crops by detecting its unique signals during the initial flooding period for crop mapping and growth monitoring. In recent years Australian rice growers have applied direct drilling sowing method to reduce water usage. This effort, however, has challenged existing algorithms for paddy rice planting area mapping, as the flooding signals have become weaker, especially for the newly introduced water-saving variety YRM 70. In order to alleviate this problem, an optical-SAR-synergistic rice mapping approach is proposed in the time domain in this study. Time-series images from both sensor types were collected in the rice growing seasons. Optical indices and SAR (Synthetic-Aperture Radar) features were generated and analysed. Pixel dependent multiple features are developed to reveal the strongest remote sensing signatures. As the information provided by optical and SAR data are complementary, a novel nomination-favoured opinion pool, NF-OP, is constructed where a pixel is identified as rice if either the optical or SAR data (or both) provide a relatively positive such opinion. In the research, mapping experiments were conducted for the Riverina region of Coleambally, New South Wales, Australia, during the 2016-2017 summer season. The experimental results suggest the following: (1) rice crops sown with the direct drilling method show weakened flooding signals due to the practice of flush floodings and the adoption of water-saving management strategies, especially for directly drilled YRM 70 rice; (2) conventional rice mapping algorithms using only optical or SAR data tend to generate high mis-detection rates (i.e., low true positive rates) for direct drilling rice as a result of weakened flooding signals; (3) by fusing the complementary optical and SAR data with the proposed NF-OP, the mis-detection problem is effectively alleviated, with the true positive rate for directly drilled YRM 70 rice being improved to 82.5% as compared to 54.5% or 44.0% obtained with optical or SAR data only; (4) an overall rice mapping accuracy of 94.7% is achieved with the proposed optical-SAR-synergistic approach, which is 9.5% and 11.5% higher than the respective optical-only and SAR-only algorithms.

TI  - Spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factors of eco-environmental quality based on RS and GIS in Shiyang River Basin, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on RS and GIS, 11 indexes from three aspects including natural capital, social pressure and economic supports were selected. The natural capital index (NCI), social pressure index (SPI), economic support index (ESI), and environment quality evaluation index (EQEI) were constructed by using spatial principal component analysis, variation coefficient method, and analytic hierarchy process. The spatial distribution characteristics and influencing factor of the environmental quality in Shiyang River Basin were analyzed. The results showed that the overall environmental quality was at poor level in Shiyang River Basin. The regions with better classes of environmental quality were mainly concentrated in the upper reaches of Qilian Mountains, and those with poorer classes were mainly concentrated in the middle-lower reaches of low hills land and desert. The EQEI value in Shiyang River Basin had polarization phenomenon from southwest to northeast. With the variation of distance, the value had large variation range, with obvious spatial heterogeneity. The environmental quality showed both high and low aggregation patterns, with " fault" distribution. There were highly clustered hot spots and highly clustered cold spots in the basin. Among the influencing factors of environmental quality , natural capital was the dominant one, social pressure was the second, and economic support was the least contributor.

TI  - Pro - environmental behaviour of adventure tourists: an applicability of value belief norm theory
T2  - TOURISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Extant research has established the role of environmental quality on tourism competitiveness and tourist satisfaction. While the effort to mitigate negative effects of tourism has come from both private and public sectors, cooperation from tourists is still needed for maintaining sustainability especially in nature based tourism. The aim of this study is to investigate the factors which influence the adventure tourists' intentions to behave pro-environmentally. To test this, we use Value Belief Norm theory. The data was collected from 216 adventure tourists at a popular trekking destination of India. The results of the study confirm that value belief norm model predicts adventure tourists' pro-environmental intention. We found that the biospheric and altruistic value has direct positive relation with new environmental paradigm and indirect positive relation with awareness of consequences, ascription of responsibility, personal norms and pro-environmental behavioural intentions. However their egoistic value negatively affects new ecological worldview. Further, the result of the study shows that personal norm is the largest predictor of pro-environmental behaviour of adventure tourists. The study also confirms the mediation effect of the research constructs.

TI  - The Modernities of H. Lawrence Freeman
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - H. Lawrence Freeman's "Negro Jazz Grand Opera," Voodoo, was premiered in 1928 in Manhattan's Broadway district. Its reception bespoke competing, racially charged values that underpinned the idea of the "modern" in the 1920s. The white press critiqued the opera for its allegedly anxiety-ridden indebtedness to nineteenth-century European conventions, while the black press hailed it as the pathbreaking work of a "pioneer composer." Taking the reception history of Voodoo as a starting point, this article shows how Freeman's lifelong project, the creation of what he would call "Negro Grand Opera," mediated between disparate and sometimes apparently irreconcilable figurations of the modern that spanned the late nineteenth century through the interwar years: Wagnerism, uplift ideology, primitivism, and popular music (including, but not limited to, jazz). I focus on Freeman's inheritance of a worldview that could be called progressivist, evolutionist, or, to borrow a term from Wilson Moses, civilizationist. I then trace the complex relationship between this mode of imagining modernity and subsequent versions of modernism that Freeman engaged with during the first decades of the twentieth century. Through readings of Freeman's aesthetic manifestos and his stylistically syncretic musical corpus I show how ideas about race inflected the process by which the qualitatively modern slips out of joint with temporal modernity. The most substantial musical analysis examines leitmotivic transformations that play out across Freeman's jazz opera American Romance (1924-29): lions become subways; Mississippi becomes New York; and jazz, like modernity itself, keeps metamorphosing. A concluding section considers a broader set of questions concerning the historiography of modernism and modernity.

TI  - Impact of Radiation on Locoregional Control in Women with Node-Positive Breast Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Axillary Lymph Node Dissection: Results from ACOSOG Z1071 Clinical Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in node-positive breast cancer (BC) is highly variable. In ACOSOG Z1071, RT after NAC was used at the discretion of treating physicians. Herein, we report the impact of RT and pathologic response on locoregional recurrence (LRR) after NAC.Methods and Materials: ACOSOG Z1071 enrolled women with cT0-4N1-2 BC treated with NAC from 2009 to 2011. Patients underwent sentinel node surgery and completion axillary lymph node dissection. The RT was at the discretion of the treating physicians. Patient outcomes were analyzed as a function of clinical-pathologic factors and use of RT.Results: Of 701 eligible patients, mastectomy was performed in 423 (59.6%) and breast-conserving surgery in 277 (40.4%). After NAC, residual disease was observed in 506 (72.2%), and 195 (27.8%) had a pathologic complete response. Of the patients, 591 (85.3%) received adjuvant RT and 102 (14.7%) did not. Median follow-up was 5.9 years. Forty-three patients (6.1%) experienced LRR, 145 (20.7%) experienced distant metastasis, and 142 (20.4%) died. Patients with pathologic complete response had the best LRR-relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.81; P = .016), distant metastasis-free survival (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.19-0.52; P < .0001), BC-specific survival (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19-0.59; P = .0001) and overall survival (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.240-0.63; P = .001) compared to patients with residual disease after NAC. Patients with triple-negative BC had a higher LRR rate compared to those with hormone receptor-positive BC (HR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.80-12.49). There was a trend toward lower LRR with the use of postmastectomy and regional nodal RT, but there was no impact on overall, disease-free, or BC-specific survival.Conclusion: In the ACOSOG Z1071 trial, in which the use of RT after NAC was at the discretion of the treating physicians, RT was associated with a trend toward decreased LRR. There was no association of RT with overall survival, BC-specific survival, or Disease Specific Survival. Triple-negative BC was associated with higher locoregional relapse rates.

TI  - Active tectonic structures in northeastern Egypt: a geospatial analysis using structural, remote sensing, and seismic data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st Scientific Congress of Junior Geosciences in Egypt (SCJGE)
CL  - Suhag Univ, Sohag, EGYPT
AB  - The seismotectonic activity in Northeastern Egypt is intimately related to the active tectonic structures (mainly faults) which deform the region and induce intraplate seismicity. The present contribution is a new attempt to integrate structural, remote sensing, and seismic data, and implement a reliable geospatial analysis to investigate and assess the nature of the relation between tectonic structures and seismotectonic activity in the Cairo-Suez district which is an active seismic source zone in Northeastern Egypt. The achieved remote sensing and GIS-based geospatial analysis introduces valuable information on the frequency, orientation, and density of investigated tectonic fault trends. The spatial distribution of earthquakes epicenters which recorded during the period (1997-2016) with magnitude (M-L >= 3.0) is evidently interrelated with the detected tectonic trends, and normal faulting with subordinate shear component is the most focal mechanisms indicated from the analyzed seismic events. The depth analysis of the studied earthquakes suggests a "hard linkage" between the major rift-boundary faults in the northern Gulf of Suez rift and the tectonic trends in the southern domain of the Cairo-Suez district, and thus indicates seismic activity on relatively deeper crustal levels. Most of the studied earthquakes have occurred on the WNW-ESE to NW-SE oriented faults in predominantly extensional to transtensional stress regime, which indicating the WNW to NW tectonic trend as an active fault trend. The intraplate seismotectonic activity in Northeastern Egypt is highly controlled by two active tectonic boundaries, the Red Sea-Gulf of Suez rift and Aqaba-Dead Sea transform (to the east) and the Pelusium Shear System (PSS, to the west). Any reliable hypothetical model explaining the seismotectonic setting in such region would consider the Cairo-Suez district as a large transfer zone transmitting the "far-field" stresses northwestward to the PSS with an effective mechanism keeping the within-plate WNW-ESE, NW-SE, and E-W tectonic trends highly prone to rejuvenation and seismic rupture.

TI  - Carrion flies as sentinels for monitoring lagovirus activity in Australia
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lagoviruses are an essential tool for managing wild rabbit populations in Australia. Our understanding of lagovirus epidemiology in Australia currently depends on members of the public submitting liver samples from dead lagomorphs (i.e. rabbits and hares) through a monitoring program called Rabbitscan. However, many wild lagomorphs die in inaccessible locations or are scavenged before sampling can occur, leading to considerable sampling bias. In this study, we screened field-caught carrion flies for the presence of lagoviruses to monitor virus circulation patterns in the landscape, with an aim to establish a less biased epidemiological surveillance tool. Carrion flies were collected from two study sites over a 22-month period and these samples were used to optimize and validate molecular testing methods in this sample type for the currently circulating lagovirus variants. Virus was clearly detectable in field-caught carrion flies using optimized SYBR-green RT-qPCR and RT-PCR assays. However, variant identification was frequently hindered by the low virus loads present in carrion fly samples and spurious RT-PCR amplification. This was overcome by frequent sampling, which effectively acts as replicate sampling to verify inconclusive results. There was generally good correlation between virus detections and variant identification in carrion flies and in samples recovered from wild lagomorphs. The methods reported here provide an additional surveillance tool to monitor lagovirus spread and circulation at a landscape scale, which in turn can help to guide more effective rabbit management programs.

TI  - Forest Damage Assessment Using Deep Learning on High Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Storms can cause significant damage to forest areas, affecting biodiversity and infrastructure and leading to economic loss. Thus, rapid detection and mapping of windthrows are crucially important for forest management. Recent advances in computer vision have led to highly-accurate image classification algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. In this study, we tested and implemented an algorithm based on CNNs in an ArcGIS environment for automatic detection and mapping of damaged areas. The algorithm was trained and tested on a forest area in Bavaria, Germany. . It is a based on a modified U-Net architecture that was optimized for the pixelwise classification of multispectral aerial remote sensing data. The neural network was trained on labeled damaged areas from after-storm aerial orthophotos of a ca. 109km(2) forest area with RGB and NIR bands and 0.2-m spatial resolution. Around 10(7) pixels of labeled data were used in the process. Once the network is trained, predictions on further datasets can be computed within seconds, depending on the size of the input raster and the computational power used. The overall accuracy on our test dataset was 92%. During visual validation, labeling errors were found in the reference data that somewhat biased the results because the algorithm in some instance performed better than the human labeling procedure, while missing areas affected by shadows. Our results are very good in terms of precision, and the methods introduced in this paper have several additional advantages compared to traditional methods: CNNs automatically detect high- and low-level features in the data, leading to high classification accuracies, while only one after-storm image is needed in comparison to two images for approaches based on change detection. Furthermore, flight parameters do not affect the results in the same way as for approaches that require DSMs and DTMs as the classification is only based on the image data themselves, and errors occurring in the computation of DSMs and DTMs do not affect the results with respect to the z component. The integration into the ArcGIS Platform allows a streamlined workflow for forest management, as the results can be accessed by mobile devices in the field to allow for high-accuracy ground-truthing and additional mapping that can be synchronized back into the database. Our results and the provided automatic workflow highlight the potential of deep learning on high-resolution imagery and GIS for fast and efficient post-disaster damage assessment as a first step of disaster management.

TI  - Hyperspectral Sea Ice Image Classification Based on the Spectral-Spatial-Joint Feature with Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is one of the causes of marine disasters. The classification of sea ice images is an important part of sea ice detection. The labeled samples in hyperspectral sea ice image classification are difficult to acquire, which causes minor sample problems. In addition, most of the current sea ice classification methods mainly use spectral features for shallow learning, which also limits further improvement of the sea ice classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a hyperspectral sea ice image classification method based on the spectral-spatial-joint feature with deep learning. The proposed method first extracts sea ice texture information by the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Then, it performs dimensionality reduction and a correlation analysis of the spectral information and spatial information of the unlabeled samples, respectively. It eliminates redundant information by extracting the spectral-spatial information of the neighboring unlabeled samples of the labeled sample and integrating the information with the spectral and texture data of the labeled sample to further enhance the quality of the labeled sample. Lastly, the three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) model is designed to extract the deep spectral-spatial features of sea ice. The proposed method combines relevant textural features and performs spectral-spatial feature extraction based on the 3D-CNN model by using a large amount of unlabeled sample information. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, sea ice classification experiments are carried out on two hyperspectral data sets: Baffin Bay and Bohai Bay. Compared with the CNN algorithm based on a single feature (spectral or spatial) and other CNN algorithms based on spectral-spatial features, the experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better sea ice classification (98.52% and 97.91%) with small samples. Therefore, it is more suitable for classifying hyperspectral sea ice images.

TI  - Can Morphological and Molecular Parameters of the Primary Breast Tumor Predict the Positivity of Nonsentinel Lymph Nodes After Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy?
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the gold standard in the evaluation of the axillary status in patients with breast cancer. In cases meeting the Z0011 criteria, no further surgery is needed, while in the remaining cases axillary dissection is required. The aim of the study was to evaluate which morphological and molecular parameters of primary breast tumor or positive SLN can predict the positivity of nonsentinel lymph nodes (NSLN) in order to avoid unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy.Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on 170 consecutive invasive breast carcinomas, in which SLN biopsy was performed for staging.Results 42 (24%) cases presented SLN metastases, of which 11 were micrometastases, 6 cases met the Z0011 criteria, requiring no subsequent surgery. 25 patients underwent subsequent ANLD, but only 7 cases (28%) had positive NSLN. In this series, only the tumor diameter >20 mm can predict positive nonsentinel lymph nodes (p= 0.058; CI: 0.05787 to 0.8224). Other parameters such as patient's age (p=0.280; CI:0.7544 to 7.998), histological type (p=0.231; CI: 0.05374 to 9.271), histological grade (p=0.929; CI: 0.2351 to 3.515), molecular profile of the tumor (p=0.362; CI: 0.2416 to 4.663), number of positive SLN (p=0.378; CI: 0.1083 to 1.570), presence of extracapsular extension (p=0.625; CI: 0.5066 to 13.96) and lymph node ratio (p=0.656; CI: 0.5068 to 5.768) cannot predict the presence of metastasis in the NSLN.Conclusion: In cases in which the patient does not meet the Z0011 criteria and/or these criteria are not used, axillary lymph node dissection is the surgical treatment of choice.

TI  - Investigation of a Small Landslide in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by InSAR and Absolute Deformation Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the major geohazards in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and have recently increased in both frequency and size. SAR interferometry (InSAR) has been widely applied in landslide research, but studies on monitoring small-scale landslides are rare. In this study, we investigated the performance of Small Baseline Subsets method (SBAS) in monitoring small-scale landslide and further developed a new deformation model to obtain the absolute deformation time series. The results showed that SBAS could well capture the small-scale landslide characteristics including spatiotemporal abnormal displacement and progressive failure processes. The newly developed absolute deformation model further detected the process of landslide details, such as instances of noticeable creeps induced by rainfall and snowmelt. Finally, a conceptual model of the kinematics-based failure mechanism for small-scale landslide was proposed. This study extended the monitoring capability of InSAR and improved our knowledge on the deformation in the frozen ground regions.

TI  - Response of ecosystem water use efficiency to climate change in the Tianshan Mountains, Central Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE) is a popular issue in the comprehensive study of climate change, ecology, and hydrology. Currently, views on the response of EWUE to temperature, precipitation, and drought remain controversial. Based on ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets, both of which were retrieved from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) using the Carnegie Ames Stanford approach (CASA) and surface energy balance algorithms for land (SEBAL) models, respectively, this study comprehensively examined the relationship between EWUE and temperature, precipitation, and drought in the Tianshan Mountains of Central Asia. The results showed that EWUE had an obvious temporal change trend in the Tianshan Mountains. The EWUEs of all vegetation types presented an increasing trend in spring and a decreasing trend in autumn. These results led to a phase shift in the annual cycle of EWUE over the years. Compared with 2000 to 2003, from 2012 to 2016, the annual EWUE cycle had advanced by 32 days. Precipitation generally had a negative effect on EWUE, while temperature had an obvious positive effect on EWUE. The EWUE responses to drought for the different vegetation types showed a variety of change trends. With the increase in drought stress, EWUE not only showed a simple upward or downward trend but also showed an upward trend followed by a downward trend or a downward trend followed by an upward trend. EWUE is more sensitive to changing environments than NPP or ET and is more suitable for analyzing ecosystem responses to global change.

TI  - Remote Sensing Single-Image Superresolution Based on a Deep Compendium Model
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter introduces a novel remote sensing single-image superresolution (SR) architecture based on a deep efficient compendium model. The current deep learning-based SR trend stands for using deeper networks to improve the performance. However, this practice often results in the degradation of visual results. To address this issue, the proposed approach harmonizes several different improvements on the network design to achieve state-of-the-art performance when superresolving remote sensing imagery. On the one hand, the proposal combines residual units and skip connections to extract more informative features on both local and global image areas. On the other hand, it makes use of parallelized 1x1 convolutional filters (network in network) to reconstruct the superresolved result while reducing the information loss through the network. Our experiments, conducted using seven different SR methods over the well-known UC Merced remote sensing data set, and two additional GaoFen-2 test images, show that the proposed model is able to provide competitive advantages.

TI  - A Combined PCA-SIs Classification Approach for Delineating Built-up Area from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a method for delineating built-up areas based on remote sensing data. The proposed method evaluated 13 spectral indices (SIs) commonly used in assessing land use and land cover (LULC) and selected meaningful indices through a principle component analysis (PCA) and spectral separability analysis. These indices are combined into a built-up delineation index set (BDIS). The development was implemented at the example of the built-up area in Qena city, Egypt. The method was evaluated against ground truth data and one recently developed global product using confusion matrix statistics. The BDIS was computed from indices showing a high loading of each one of the most relevant principle components and high separability at the same time. Subsequently, the selected indices, i.e., the transformed difference vegetation index (TDVI), band ratio for a built-up area (BRBA), and a new built-up area index (NBI), was used as input variables for the supervised classification procedures. The results show an increase in the accuracy of the built-up area delineation using BDIS. The overall, producer's, user's accuracies, and Kappa coefficient were 96.3%, 96%, 93%, and 0.946, respectively. The results and a comparison with the global human settlement layer provided by the European Joint Research Center also verified the usefulness of the proposed method for utilizing Landsat 8 OLI imagery data in delineating a built-up area, providing a comprehensive view on built-up area at the local scale.

TI  - Cotton Yield Estimate Using Sentinel-2 Data and an Ecosystem Model over the Southern US
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution data with nearly global coverage from Sentinel-2 mission open a new era for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation from remote sensing. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the potential of using Sentinel-2 biophysical data combined with an ecosystem modeling approach for estimation of cotton yield in the southern United States (US). The Boreal Ecosystems Productivity Simulator (BEPS) ecosystem model was used to simulate the cotton gross primary production (GPP) over three Sentinel-2 tiles located in Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas in 2017. Leaf area index (LAI) derived from Sentinel-2 measurements and hourly meteorological data from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis were used to drive the ecosystem model. The simulated GPP values at 20-m grid spacing were aggregated to the county level (17 counties in total) and compared to the cotton lint yield estimates at the county level which are available from National Agricultural Statistics Service in the United States Department of Agriculture. The results of the comparison show that the BEPS-simulated cotton GPP explains 85% of variation in cotton yield. Our study suggests that the integration of Sentinel-2 LAI time series into the ecosystem model results in reliable estimates of cotton yield.

TI  - Satellite data-driven modeling of field scale evapotranspiration in croplands using the MOD16 algorithm framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key variable linking the global water, carbon and energy cycles, while accurate ET estimates are crucial for understanding cropland water use in context with agricultural management. Satellite remote sensing provides spatially and temporally continuous information that can be used for global ET estimation. The NASA MODIS MOD16A2 operational product provides 500-m 8-day global ET estimates extending from 2001 to present. However, reliable estimates for delineating field level cropland ET patterns are lacking. In this investigation, we modified the MOD16 global algorithm to better represent cropland ET by calibrating model parameters according to C3 and C4 crop types, and incorporating finer scale satellite vegetation inputs to derive 30-m cropland ET estimates over the continental USA (CONUS). Similar overlapping enhanced vegetation index (EVI) records from Landsat and MODIS were used to generate a continuous 30-m 8-day fused EVI and ET record extending from 2008 to 2017 over CONUS croplands. The satellite-based ET estimates were compared with tower based ET observations over different crop types, and more traditional cropland actual ET (AET) estimates derived from reference ET and crop-specific coefficients. The new satellite based 30-m cropland ET estimates (ET30m) corresponded favorably with both tower ET observations (ETflux; R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.70 mm d(-1), bias = 0.04 mm d(-1)) and the baseline global MOD16A2 ET product (ETMOD16). The ET30m results also showed better performance against the ETflux observations than ETMOD16 (R-2 = 0.54, RMSE = 0.82 mm d(-1)) or AET (R-2 = 0.52, RMSE = 2.47 mm d(-1)) for monitoring CONUS croplands. The spatial and temporal patterns of the ET3m results show enhanced delineation of agricultural water use, including impacts from variable climate, cropland area and diversity. The resulting ET30m record is suitable for operational applications promoting more effective agricultural water management and food security.

TI  - An Operational Workflow of Deciduous-Dominated Forest Species Classification: Crown Delineation, Gap Elimination, and Object-Based Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology provide sufficient spatial detail to achieve species-level classification over large vegetative ecosystems. In deciduous-dominated forests, however, as tree species diversity and forest structural diversity increase, the frequency of spectral overlap between species also increases and our ability to classify tree species significantly decreases. This study proposes an operational workflow of individual tree-based species classification for a temperate, mixed deciduous forest using three-seasonal WorldView images, involving three steps of individual tree crown (ITC) delineation, non-forest gap elimination, and object-based classification. The process of species classification started with ITC delineation using the spectral angle segmentation algorithm, followed by object-based random forest classifications. A total of 672 trees was located along three triangular transects for training and validation. For single-season images, the late-spring, mid-summer, and early-fall images achieve the overall accuracies of 0.46, 0.42, and 0.35, respectively. Combining the spectral information of the early-spring, mid-summer, and early-fall images increases the overall accuracy of classification to 0.79. However, further adding the late-fall image to separate deciduous and coniferous trees as an extra step was not successful. Compared to traditional four-band (Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared) images, the four additional bands of WorldView images (i.e., Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near-Infrared2) contribute to the species classification greatly (OA: 0.79 vs. 0.53). This study gains insights into the contribution of the additional spectral bands and multi-seasonal images to distinguishing species with seemingly high degrees of spectral overlap.

TI  - Do airborne laser scanning biomass prediction models benefit from Landsat time series, hyperspectral data or forest classification in tropical mosaic landscapes?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is considered as the most accurate remote sensing data for the predictive modelling of AGB. However, tropical landscapes experiencing land use changes are typically heterogeneous mosaics of various land cover types with high tree species richness and trees outside forests, making them challenging environments even for ALS. Therefore, combining ALS data with other remote sensing data, or stratification by land cover type could be particularly beneficial in terms of modelling accuracy in such landscapes. Our objective was to test if spectral-temporal metrics from the Landsat time series (LTS), simultaneously acquired hyperspectral (HS) data, or stratification to the forest and non-forest classes improves accuracy of the AGB modelling across an Afromontane landscape in Kenya. The combination of ALS and HS data improved the cross-validated RMSE from 51.5 Mg ha(-1) (42.7%) to 47.7 Mg ha(-1) (39.5%) in comparison to the use of ALS data only. Furthermore, the combination of ALS data with LTS and HS data improved accuracies of the models for the forest and non-forest classes, and the overall best results were achieved when using ALS and HS data with stratification (RMSE 40.0 Mg ha(-1), 33.1%). We conclude that ALS data alone provides robust models for AGB mapping across tropical mosaic landscapes, even without stratification. However, ALS and HS data together, and additional forest classification for stratification, can improve modelling accuracy considerably in similar, tree species rich areas.

TI  - The Prediction and Assessment of the Impacts of Soil Sealing on Agricultural Land in the North Nile Delta (Egypt) Using Satellite Data and GIS Modeling
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil sealing is currently one of the most critical barriers to sustainable development, particularly in developing countries such as Egypt. Agriculture is a major component of the Egyptian economy and the country's main source of food security. Urbanization is devouring vast areas of agricultural land, and therefore, in the present study, urbanization was used to determine the degree of soil sealing in a region of Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt. In this work, remote sensing data were used to monitor changes in land use and land cover (LULC) between 1984 and 2016. A field survey and population data were also used in the analysis. Support vector machine (SVM) classification was used to produce LULC maps of the study area. An accuracy assessment was performed by calculating overall accuracy and individual kappa coefficients. Additionally, soil sealing was assessed using data from 1984 to 2016, and the potential expansion of soil sealing until 2048 was simulated using the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model. Our analysis showed that in the study area (i) about 90% of the soils had soil capability degrees between class II and class III; (ii) soil sealing was not uniformly distributed in the study area; (iii) between 1984 and 2016, the area of soil sealing in fertile soils due to urbanization increased by 19,500 hectares; and (iv) between 1984 and 2000, the urban area increased by around 29%, whereas between 2000 and 2010 it increased by around 43.6%. The results suggest that the magnitude of soil sealing is a good indicator of the soil loss rate and the potential for agricultural development in the Nile Delta. The model predicted that by 2048 an area of 32,290 hectares of agricultural soil will be lost to urbanization. This study indicates that the change of LULC has a negative impact on soil sealing. Between 2000 and 2010, the area of agricultural land decreased by 4%, despite an increase in land reclamation in the north of the study area. The amount of soil sealing was found to increase towards the southeast and northeast of the study area, except for the northern parts, where the amount of soil sealing increased towards the east. Our analyses and forecasts are useful for decision-makers responsible for soil-sealing mitigation strategies and soil-sealing protection plans in the Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt.

TI  - Estimation of monthly surface air temperatures from MODIS LST time series data: application to the deserts in the Sultanate of Oman
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature records in remote deserts and inaccessible mountainous regions rely upon data acquired from the nearest meteorological stations, which could be at tens of kilometers apart. The present study provides a reliable approach to extract air temperatures for any distant region using thermal data of satellite images. The study postulates that if there is a strong correlation between land surface temperatures (LST) from satellite images and air temperature records from ground meteorological stations, hence, air temperatures (day/night) could be directly extrapolated from regression equations with high confidence results. Data utilized in this study were obtained from 12 meteorological stations settled and distributed upon different physiographic units of Oman. Satellite images were acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product. Regression analysis of max and min air temperatures from weather stations was conducted versus day and night LST from MODIS Aqua LST (MYD11A2) images. Results showed that the regression coefficients for the selected locations are strong for the night/min (R-2 = 0.81-0.94) and day/max (R-2 = 0.72-0.92) correlations of the 12 stations. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the statistical models are 0.97 and 1.98 for the night and day temperatures, respectively. Moreover, the association between each pair of the data is significant at the 99% level (p < 0.01). As MODIS data cover large geographic extents, it was possible to produce national diurnal and annual air temperature maps of accurate records with considering the variation of the physiographic setting.

TI  - Modelling discontinuous terrain from DSMs using segment labelling, outlier removal and thin-plate splines
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Models of ground surface elevations are crucial to many applications of remotely sensed data, including estimates of the height relative to ground of non-ground objects, such as buildings and vegetation. In highly engineered regions, such as cities, there are many discontinuities in both the ground surface and the surface of non ground objects. Sub-metre resolution elevation data for these regions are increasingly available. At these resolutions there is sufficient information and a growing need to improve model accuracies by incorporating discontinuities. Here we provide a new method for generating high resolution models of discontinuous ground surfaces from breakline data and digital surface models derived from remotely sensed data. The method uses segment based filtering, outlier removal and multiresolution thin-plate spline surface fitting. Breaklines are included in the fitted surface using partial derivatives and a breakline-aware method for transferring between different resolutions. We demonstrate our method using elevation data derived from photogrammetry for suburban regions of Perth, Western Australia, and Vaihingen, Germany. We produced ground surface models with noticeable qualitative and quantitative improvements when breaklines are included, at an increased computational cost of approximately 10% when all other parameters remained the same. For LiDAR derived elevations, we report our residual error against a number of other methods recorded using the ISPRS Ground Filtering Test Sites.

TI  - Surgical resection based on ontogenetic cancer field theory for cervical cancer: mature results from a single-centre, prospective, observational, cohort study
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Previous findings from our centre suggest that carcinoma of the cervix propagates within ontogenetic cancer fields, tissue compartments defined by staged morphogenesis. We aimed to determine whether surgical treatment that accounts for stage-associated, ontogenetic cancer fields and their associated lymphoid tissues results in locoregional tumour control without the need for adjuvant radiotherapy.Methods We did the final clinical and histopathological evaluation of data from, the single-centre, observational, cohort study, the Leipzig School Mesometrial Resection Study. Patients of any age with stage IB1, IB2, IIA1, IIA2, or IIB cervical cancer (according to 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO]) had total mesometrial resection or extended mesometrial resection and therapeutic lymph node dissection, done on the basis of ontogenetic cancer fields. We defined sentinel node, first-line, second-line, and third-line lymph node regions as progressive regional cancer fields. Primary outcomes were disease-specific survival and recurrence-free survival, and treatment-related morbidity (assessed with the Franco-Italian glossary). Applying Cox proportional hazard models, ontogenetic local (T) and regional (N) tumour staging was compared with pathological T and N staging. This trial is registered with the German Clinical Trials Register, number DRKS00015171.Findings Between Oct 16, 1999, and June 27, 2017, 523 patients were treated per protocol and followed up for a median of 61 . 8 months (IQR 49 . 3-94 . 8). In 495 patients with cervical cancer treated with cancer field surgery, 5-year diseasespecific survival was 89 . 4% (95% CI 86 . 5-92 . 4) and recurrence-free survival was 83 . 1% (79 . 7-86 . 6). In the perprotocol population of 523 patients, treatment-related morbidity comprised 112 (21%) grade 2 and 15 (3%) grade 3 complications. The most common moderate and severe treatment-related complications and sequelae were wound dehiscence (17 [3%]), hydronephrosis (17 [3%]), bowel obstruction (26 [5%]), and lymph oedema (33 [6%]). One patient (< 1%), who received total mesometrial resection, died from postoperative brain infarction.Interpretation Total or extended mesometrial resection with therapeutic lymph node dissection based on ontogenetic cancer fields results in good survival outcomes of patients with cervical cancer in our institution, but needs to be investigated further in multicentre trials.

TI  - Uncertainty as a Key Influence in the Decision To Admit Patients with Transient Ischemic Attack
T2  - JOURNAL OF GENERAL INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - International Stroke Conference
CL  - Houston, TX
AB  - Background Patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) are at high risk of subsequent vascular events. Hospitalization improves quality of care, yet admission rates for TIA patients vary considerably. Objectives We sought to identify factors associated with the decision to admit patents with TIA. Design We conducted a secondary analysis of a prior study's data including semi-structured interviews, administrative data, and chart review. Participants We interviewed multidisciplinary clinical staff involved with TIA care. Administrative data included information for TIA patients in emergency departments or inpatient settings at VA medical centers (VAMCs) for fiscal years (FY) 2011 and 2014. Chart reviews were conducted on a subset of patients from 12 VAMCs in FY 2011. Approach For the qualitative data, we focused on interviewees' responses to the prompt: "Tell me what influences you in the decision to or not to admit TIA patients." We used administrative data to identify admission rates and chart review data to identify ABCD(2) scores (a tool to classify stroke risk after TIA). Key Results Providers' decisions to admit TIA patients were related to uncertainty in several domains: lack of a facility TIA-specific policy, inconsistent use of ABCD(2) score, and concerns about facilities' ability to complete a timely workup. There was a disconnect between staff perceptions about TIA admission and facility admission rates. According to chart review data, staff at facilities with higher admission rates in FY 2011 reported consistent reliance on ABCD(2) scores and related guidelines in admission decision-making. Conclusions Many factors contributed to decisions regarding admitting a patient with TIA; however, clinicians' uncertainty appeared to be a key driver. Further quality improvement interventions for TIA care should focus on facility adoption of TIA protocols to address uncertainty in TIA admission decision-making and to standardize timely evaluation of TIA patients and delivery of secondary prevention strategies.

TI  - ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL EVAPOTRANSPIRATION (PET) USING SATELLITE IMAGERY IN ARID LANDS
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is one of the main sources of water loss in arid regions. Although FAO Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) method is one of the accurate method to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET). Nevertheless, it is a point-based method and requires several weather data such as radiation, wind speed, air humidity and temperature, which is not available in all regions. Therefore, this study is aimed to estimate PET equivalent to FAO-PM model using satellite data and Priestly-Taylor (PT) model in Yazd province, located in Central Iran. Daily net radiation and soil heat flux, which are used in PT method, were calculated using Landsat 5 data. Then, the net radiation data were integrated with ground data to estimate PET through PT equation. Although similarity between ground-based Priestly-Taylor (PT land) and satellite-based Priestly-Taylor (PT image) was observed, FAO-PM had higher PET values (RMSE=4.74 mmd(-1)) compared to other methods in all climatic zones of the study area. Therefore, results of PT image method can be replaced with PT land results to estimate potential evapotranspiration, in regions with limitation or lack of weather data. Finally, linear regression model were used for presenting relationship between ground-based FAO-PM and PT land. For this purpose, 70% and 30% of ground data were used for modeling and testing, respectively at different Selianinov climatic zones of the study area. Maximu RMSE for modeled and test data were 4.6 and 2.93, respectively. The model output was applied on PT image to get the FAO-PM image with maximum RMSE of 3.67. It can be concluded that the defined regression equations for each climate zones in this study, can be used to convert values of satellite- based Priestly Taylor method (PT image) as independent variable (X) to equivalent of FAO-PM PET.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Erosion in the Chaohu Lake Basin through Modified Soil Erodibility Combined with Gravel Content in the RUSLE Model
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - It is generally acknowledged that soil erosion has become one of the greatest global threats to the human-environment system. Although the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) has been widely used for soil erosion estimation, the algorithm for calculating soil erodibility factor (K) in this equation remains limited, particularly in the context of China, which features highly diverse soil types. In order to address the problem, a modified algorithm describing the piecewise function of gravel content and relative soil erosion was used for the first time to modify the soil erodibility factor, because it has been proven that gravel content has an important effect on soil erosion. The Chaohu Lake Basin (CLB) in East China was used as an example to assess whether our proposal can improve the accuracy of soil erodibility calculation and soil erosion estimation compared with measured data. Results show that (1) taking gravel content into account helps to improve the calculation of soil erodibility and soil erosion estimation due to its protection to topsoil; (2) the overall soil erosion in the CLB was low (1.78 Mg.ha(-1).year(-1)) the majority of which was slight erosion (accounting for 85.6%) and no extremely severe erosion; and (3) inappropriate land use such as steep slope reclamation and excessive vegetation destruction are the main reasons for soil erosion of the CLB. Our study will contribute to decision-makers to develop soil and water conservation policies.

TI  - An Accurate Method to Correct Atmospheric Phase Delay for InSAR with the ERA5 Global Atmospheric Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) has proven its unprecedented ability and merits of monitoring ground deformation on a large scale with centimeter to millimeter accuracy. However, atmospheric artifacts due to spatial and temporal variations of the atmospheric state often affect the reliability and accuracy of its results. The commonly-known Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) appears in the interferograms as ghost fringes not related to either topography or deformation. Atmospheric artifact mitigation remains one of the biggest challenges to be addressed within the DInSAR community. State-of-the-art research works have revealed that atmospheric artifacts can be partially compensated with empirical models, point-wise GPS zenith path delay, and numerical weather prediction models. In this study, we implement an accurate and realistic computing strategy using atmospheric reanalysis ERA5 data to estimate atmospheric artifacts. With this approach, the Line-of-Sight (LOS) path along the satellite trajectory and the monitored points is considered, rather than estimating it from the zenith path delay. Compared with the zenith delay-based method, the key advantage is that it can avoid errors caused by any anisotropic atmospheric phenomena. The accurate method is validated with Sentinel-1 data in three different test sites: Tenerife island (Spain), Almeria (Spain), and Crete island (Greece). The effectiveness and performance of the method to remove APS from interferograms is evaluated in the three test sites showing a great improvement with respect to the zenith-based approach.

TI  - Intercomparison of AMSR2-and MODIS-Derived Land Surface Temperature Under Clear-Sky Conditions
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in various fields, including hydrological, meteorological, and agricultural studies. Passive microwave techniques provide a practicable method to retrieve LST under both clear and cloudy conditions. In this study, LST derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature data during nighttime in the period 2015-2016 using a physically-based algorithm was compared with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product MYD11A1 over 16 study sites that represent four different land cover types, i.e., barren/sparsely vegetated, grasslands, croplands, and evergreen broadleaf forest. Compared to MODIS-derived LST, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of AMSR2-derived LST is 6.0 K and the bias is 4.4 K over all study sites. For barren/sparsely vegetated sites, LST was overestimated by 6.7 K. To eliminate the systematic bias induced by the penetration depth effect of microwave radiation over barren/sparsely vegetated sites, a linear regression between AMSR2- and MODIS-derived LST was applied and the RMSE decreases from approximately 7.8 to 3.5 K. For the other three land cover types, the bias ranges from approximately 1.4 to 4.2 K and the RMSE ranges from approximately 2.1 to 5.9 K. The bias between AMSR2- and MODIS-derived LST is related to vegetation coverage. The value of bias increases with the decrease of normalized difference vegetation index. Furthermore, the RMSE has a strong dependency on precipitable water vapor (PWV). It presents a descending pattern of RMSE with the increase of PWV.

TI  - Influencing Mechanisms of Urban Heat Island on Respiratory Diseases
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Urban heat island (UHI) is being intensified with the progress of urbanization. Meanwhile, respiratory diseases caused by high temperature become common. This study explores the influences of UHI on respiratory diseases (J00 J99)and the evolutionary characteristics of the spatial pattern of such influences.Methods: The pattern-process-function and the influencing mechanism of UHI on respiratory diseases were evaluated through landscape pattern indexes from 1992 to 2018 in Tianjin, China. The basis was on data from Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS remote-sensing images, meteorological stations, and mortality of respiratory diseases.Results: The fluctuating influence of UHI on the respiratory diseases in Tianjin has increased from 1992 to 2018, showing a significant phase-based characteristic. During 2011-2018, the influence has soared greatly, and mortality risk has increased by 101%, and the influenced area has reached 349 km(2). Furthermore, the regional space clustered, and the influenced patches are in irregular shape, and the highly influenced area is enlarged. Moreover, the indexes of the landscape level of the influenced areas all decrease. The patches at all levels are fragmented and distributed discontinuously. Spatially, the influenced areas gradually extend from the urban center to the suburbs.Conclusion: UHI causes a higher mortality of respiratory diseases because it increases daily average air temperature in summer. With respect to landscape pattern, the influenced areas at low level is highly interconnected and relatively concentrated, whereas the influenced area at high level is distributed in clusters. In general, the influenced area is fragmented and discontinuously distributed in urban center.

TI  - Developing a common globally applicable method for optical remote sensing of ecosystem light use efficiency
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the use of spectral reflectance to determine ecosystem photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUE) during mid-growing season for 32 globally distributed flux tower sites. Surface reflectance for 133 spectral bands were extracted for areas around the flux towers from imagery collected by the Hyperion instrument on the Earth Observing 1 satellite. The average reflectance spectra were matched with LUE derived from CO2 flux data collected using eddy covariance techniques from the La Thuile Fluxnet Synthesis Dataset, resulting in 79 observations collected between 2000 and 2007. LUE was calculated from daily gross ecosystem production (GEP) and incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) from the flux towers and MODE fraction of absorbed PAR (fPAR). An examination of all possible two band normalized difference vegetation indices found that no index performed better than R-2 of 0.55, although 60 of the bands were included in normalized difference indices with a R-2 > 0.45. A partial least squares regression (PLSR) using all spectral bands produced a R-2 of 0.81, suggesting the use of this approach to develop a globally-applicable retrieval method for LUE using spectral imagery from future missions flying imaging spectrometers, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission.

TI  - New ECOSTRESS and MODIS Land Surface Temperature Data Reveal Fine-Scale Heat Vulnerability in Cities: A Case Study for Los Angeles County, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid 21st century urbanization combined with anthropogenic climate warming are significantly increasing heat-related health threats in cities worldwide. In Los Angeles (LA), increasing trends in extreme heat are expected to intensify and exacerbate the urban heat island effect, leading to greater health risks for vulnerable populations. Partnerships between city policymakers and scientists are becoming more important as the need to provide data-driven recommendations for sustainability and mitigation efforts becomes critical. Here we present a model to produce heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps driven by surface temperature data from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) new Ecosystem Spaceborne Thermal Radiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS) thermal infrared sensor. ECOSTRESS was launched in June 2018 with the capability to image fine-scale urban temperatures at a 70 m resolution throughout different times of the day and night. The HVI model further includes information on socio-demographic data, green vegetation abundance, and historical heatwave temperatures from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Aqua spacecraft since 2002. During a period of high heat in July 2018, we identified the five most vulnerable communities at a sub-city block scale in the LA region. The persistence of high HVI throughout the day and night in these areas indicates a clear and urgent need for implementing cooling technologies and green infrastructure to curb future warming.

TI  - Trends in numbers of the Critically Endangered Chinese Crested Tern Thalasseus bernsteini and sympatrically nesting Greater Crested Tern T. bergii in the Matsu Archipelago, Taiwan
T2  - BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese Crested Tern Thalasseus bernsteini (CCT) is likely the most critically endangered seabird species in Asia. The Matsu, Penghu, Jiushan, and Wuzhishan Archipelagos along the China coastline, plus Yeonggwang County in South Korea, are the five areas where this species is currently confirmed to breed. According to census and historical data collected in the Matsu Archipelago from 2004 to 2017, there was an average of 10 +/- 4 adult CCT individuals at the Matsu Islands Tern Refuge (MITR) during the breeding season. CCT nested only in association with Greater Crested Terns T. bergii (GCT) among seven protected islands in the MITR, and the numbers of observed breeding individuals of the two species were positively correlated (r = 0.59, P < 0.001). We used generalized linear models to examine the effects of chlorophyll-a concentrations in surrounding marine habitats, typhoon frequency, and in-season shifts in colony location on inter-annual variation in numbers of breeding individuals and productivity (chick:adult ratios) of both CCT and GCT at the MITR from 2004 to 2017. Average chlorophyll-a concentrations during July-August obtained from the MODIS satellite were positively correlated with the annual maximum number of GCT at the MITR, but not that of CCT. In addition, we found that nest abandonment events during early incubation at the mixed-species colonies were associated with in-season shifts in colony location and delayed nesting chronology, thereby extending nesting into the peak typhoon season during July and August. The effects of in-season colony shifts on nesting chronology and the additive effects of typhoons caused a significant decline in CCT breeding success during the study period. We propose more rigorous monitoring to ascertain the root causes of in-season colony shifts of terns and then determine possible solutions. Additionally, creating educational programmes to increase public awareness towards seabird conservation could prove beneficial.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Ice Phenology and Dynamics of Europe's Largest Coastal Lagoon (The Curonian Lagoon)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A first-ever spatially detailed record of ice cover conditions in the Curonian Lagoon (CL), Europe's largest coastal lagoon located in the southeastern Baltic Sea, is presented. The multi-mission synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements acquired in 2002-2017 by Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1 A/B, and supplemented by the cloud-free moderate imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, are used to document the ice cover properties in the CL. As shown, satellite observations reveal a better performance over in situ records in defining the key stages of ice formation and decay in the CL. Using advantages of both data sources, an updated ice season duration (ISD) record is obtained to adequately describe the ice cover season in the CL. High-resolution ISD maps provide important spatial details of ice growth and decay in the CL. As found, ice cover resides longest in the south-eastern CL and along the eastern coast, including the Nemunas Delta, while the shortest ice season is observed in the northern CL. During the melting season, the ice melt pattern is clearly shaped by the direction of prevailing winds, and ice drift velocities obtained from a limited number of observations range within 0.03-0.14 m/s. The pronounced shortening of the ice season duration in the CL is observed at a rate of 1.6-2.3 days year(1) during 2002-2017, which is much higher than reported for the nearby Baltic Sea regions. While the timing of the freeze onset and full freezing has not changed much, the dates of the final melt onset and last observation of ice have a clear decreasing pattern toward an earlier ice break-up and complete melt-off due to an increase of air temperature strongly linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Notably, the correlation between the ISD, air temperature, and winter NAO index is substantially higher when considering the lagoon-averaged ISD values derived from satellite observations compared to those derived from coastal records. The latter clearly demonstrated the richness of the satellite observations that should definitely be exploited in regional ice monitoring programs.

TI  - Ethnic Identity as a Cultural Safety Resource of Local Communities in the Context of Globalization
T2  - TARIH KULTUR VE SANAT ARASTIRMALARI DERGISI-JOURNAL OF HISTORY CULTURE AND ART RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of globalization, the main threat to the cultural security of local communities is the spiritual expansion of Western civilization, which results in changes in the worldview and lifestyle of people. Under the threat of spiritual expansion, they activate protective mechanisms in order to preserve, reproduce, and transmit cultural norms and values that serve as spiritual guidelines in social uncertainty and global chaos. The ethnic identity, being one of these mechanisms, has the capacity to ensure the ontological security of the community, preserve its cultural identity and mobilize it for positioning and defending its interests.The constructivist paradigm serves the methodological basis of the study and allows considering the ethnic identity as a way of organizing the socio-cultural existence of community on the basis of its "symbolic" boundaries' identification. The transformational approach which makes it possible to characterize the processes of the modern world and their impact on local societies is methodologically significant for the study. The concept of "socio-cultural crisis", manifested in the destruction of the value-semantic and symbolic world of ethnic communities is conceptual to identify the destructive influence of globalization processes on the life of local communities. The riskological approach allows revealing the specifics of the current risks to the cultural safety of local communities. The study concludes that under the risks and threats to the cultural security of local communities, they activate the resource potential of ethnic identity, which allows maintaining their personal integrity and socio-cultural uniqueness. The resource potential of ethnic identity makes it possible to act as a social behavior regulator and ensure the cultural security of both individuals and groups, forming symbolic boundaries between the worlds of "us" and "them".

TI  - Oncological safety and perioperative morbidity in low-risk endometrial cancer with sentinel lymph-node dissection
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: and Purpose: In endometrial cancer, staging is performed surgically. Controversy about the required extent of lymph node removal is ongoing. In low-risk endometrial cancer (FIGO Stage 1, endometrioid histology, Grades 1 and 2), the risk of lymph-node involvement is 4-17%. Since the introduction of near-infrared optics and the use of indocyanine green, the role of sentinel lymph node removal is increasing and could offer an appropriate balance between the morbidity of a complete lymph-node dissection and the risk of missing lymph-node involvement.Methods: In this retrospective comparative study on low-risk endometrial cancer, the extent of surgical lymph-node assessment (no lymphadenectomy vs removal vs lymphadenectomy) in two European institutions was compared and analyzed on the basis of perioperative data and oncological outcome.Results: The study included 279 patients from: 103 (36.9%) had no lymphadenectomy, 118 (42.3%) underwent SLN removal and 58 (20.8%) underwent pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy. There were significant differences among the groups in blood loss (p = 0.000), operation time (p = 0.000), and severity of postoperative complications (p = 0.063). In comparing only sentinel lymph-node removal vs no lymphadenectomy, there were no significant differences. No significant difference was seen between the extent of lymphadenectomy removal and the risk of recurrence. Age and Lymphovascular space invasion positivity were significant risk factors for recurrence (p = 0.004 and p = 0.019).Conclusions: In early-stage, endometrial cancer, Grade 1 and 2, sentinel lymph node removal offers a convincing balance between oncological safety and perioperative morbidity. Especially in LVSI-positive cases, lymph-node evaluation in any form is crucial.

TI  - Application of Sentinel-2 Multispectral Data for Habitat Mapping of Pacific Islands: Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sustainable and ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is a priority of Pacific Island countries basing their economy on marine resources. The urgency of management coral reef systems and associated coastal environments, threatened by the effects of climate change, require a detailed habitat mapping of the present status and a future monitoring of changes over time. Here, we present a remote sensing study using free available Sentinel-2 imagery for mapping at large scale the most sensible and high value habitats (corals, seagrasses, mangroves) of Palau Republic (Micronesia, Pacific Ocean), carried out without any sea truth validation. Remote sensing 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' classification methods applied to 2017 Sentinel-2 imagery with 10 m resolution together with comparisons with free ancillary data on web platform and available scientific literature were used to map mangrove, coral, and seagrass communities in the Palau Archipelago. This paper addresses the challenge of multispectral benthic mapping estimation using commercial software for preprocessing steps (ERDAS ATCOR) and for benthic classification (ENVI) on the base of satellite image analysis. The accuracy of the methods was tested comparing results with reference NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA) habitat maps achieved through Ikonos and Quickbird imagery interpretation and sea-truth validations. Results showed how the proposed approach allowed an overall good classification of marine habitats, namely a good concordance of mangroves cover around Palau Archipelago with previous literature and a good identification of coastal habitats in two sites (barrier reef and coastal reef) with an accuracy of 39.8-56.8%, suitable for survey and monitoring of most sensible habitats in tropical remote islands.

TI  - Informal genomic surveillance of regional distribution of <i>Salmonella</i> Typhi genotypes and antimicrobial resistance via returning travellers
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) is the causative agent of typhoid fever, a systemic human infection with a burden exceeding 20 million cases each year that occurs disproportionately among children in low and middle income countries. Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay for treatment, but resistance to multiple agents is common. Here we report genotypes and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants detected from routine whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 533 S. Typhi isolates referred to Public Health England between April 2014 and March 2017, 488 (92%) of which had accompanying patient travel information obtained via an enhanced surveillance questionnaire. The majority of cases involved S. Typhi 4.3.1 (H58) linked with travel to South Asia (59%). Travel to East and West Africa were associated with genotypes 4.3.1 and 3.3.1, respectively. Point mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR), associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, were very common (85% of all cases) but the frequency varied significantly by region of travel: 95% in South Asia, 43% in East Africa, 27% in West Africa. QRDR triple mutants, resistant to ciprofloxacin, were restricted to 4.3.1 lineage II and associated with travel to India, accounting for 23% of cases reporting travel to the country. Overall 24% of isolates were MDR, however the frequency varied significantly by region and country of travel: 27% in West Africa, 52% in East Africa, 55% in Pakistan, 24% in Bangladesh, 3% in India. MDR determinants were plasmid-borne (IncHI1 PST2 plasmids) in S. Typhi 3.1.1 linked to West Africa, but in all other regions MDR was chromosomally integrated in 4.3.1 lineage I. We propose that routine WGS data from travel-associated cases in industrialised countries could serve as informal sentinel AMR genomic surveillance data for countries where WGS is not available or routinely performed.Author summary Our data demonstrate how routine WGS data produced by Public Health England can be further mined for informal passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhi circulating in different geographical regions where typhoid is endemic. We have shown the public health utility of a simplified approach to WGS reporting based on the GenoTyphi genotyping framework and nomenclature, which doesn't require the generation of a phylogenetic tree or other phylogenetic analysis. These approaches yielded results consistent with previously reported antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns of S. Typhi, including prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and fluoroquinolone resistance in different regions in association with different pathogen variants. These data provide a rationale and framework for the extraction and reporting of geographically stratified genotype and AMR data from public health labs in non-endemic countries. Prospective analysis and reporting of such data could potentially detect shifts in regional S. Typhi populations, such as replacement or spread of different subclades and the emergence and dissemination of MDR, fluoroquinolone resistant and/or extensively drug resistant S. Typhi, providing valuable data to inform typhoid control measures in low and middle income countries that are still building their genomics capacity.

TI  - Focused Ultrasound Surveillance of Lymph Nodes Following Lymphoscintigraphy Without Sentinel Node Biopsy: A Useful and Safe Strategy in Elderly or Frail Melanoma Patients
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) has become standard of care in clinically localized melanoma patients. Although it is minimally invasive, advanced age and/or comorbidities may render SNB inadvisable in some patients. Focused ultrasound follow-up of SNs identified by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy may be an alternative in these patients. This study examines the outcomes in patients managed in this way at a major melanoma treatment center. Methods All patients with clinically localized cutaneous melanoma who underwent lymphoscintigraphy and in whom SNB was intentionally not performed due to advanced age and/or comorbidities were included. Results Between 2000 and 2009, 160 patients (5.2% of the total) underwent lymphoscintigraphy without SNB because of advanced age and/or comorbidities. Compared with the 2945 patients who had a SNB, the 160 patients were older, had thicker melanomas that were more often located in the head and neck region, and had more SNs in more nodal regions. Of the 160 patients, 150 (94%) were followed with ultrasound examination of their SNs at each follow-up visit; this identified 33% of the nodal recurrences before they became clinically apparent. Compared with SN-positive patients who were treated by completion lymph node dissection, observed patients who developed nodal recurrence had more involved nodes when a delayed lymphadenectomy was performed. Melanoma-specific survival, recurrence-free survival, and distant recurrence-free survival rates were similar, while regional lymph node-free survival was worse. Conclusions Lymphoscintigraphy with focused ultrasound follow-up of SNs is a reasonable management alternative to SNB in patients who are elderly and/or have substantial comorbidities.

TI  - A Population-Based Comparison of the AJCC 7th and AJCC 8th Editions for Patients Diagnosed with Stage III Cutaneous Malignant Melanoma in Sweden
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Cutaneous melanoma is steadily increasing worldwide. The new AJCC 8th edition was recently launched and introduced several changes in melanoma staging, particularly for stage III. We conducted a population-based registry study with the purpose to evaluate the impact and prognostic accuracy of the new classification in Sweden. Methods Consecutive patients diagnosed with stage III melanoma between January 2005 and September 2017 were identified by the Swedish Melanoma Registry (SMR) and included for analyses. Patients with multiple primary melanomas were excluded. Patients were classified according to the AJCC 7th as well as the 8th edition. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) was retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. Results A total of 2067 eligible patients were identified from the SMR; 1150 patients (57%) changed stage III subgroup when reclassified according to the AJCC 8th edition. The median 5- and 10-year MSS for the whole cohort of stage III melanoma patients was 59% and 51% respectively. The MSS for substage IIIA, B, and C were all improved when patients were reclassified by using to the AJCC 8th edition. The newly defined substage IIID had the worst prognosis with a 10-year MSS of 16%. Conclusions A high proportion of patients diagnosed with stage III melanoma in Sweden between 2005 and 2017 was restaged to another subgroup, when they were reclassified according to the AJCC 8th of staging manual. We established an improved MSS for all substages compared with the former AJCC 7th edition. This may have implications on decisions about adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Survival outcomes after sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim This study evaluated the prognosis after sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for early gastric cancer. Methods For 100 patients who underwent SNNS (between August 13, 2003 and December 17, 2018) at our hospital, the survival outcomes were investigated. Results (a) SN were detected with a diagnostic accuracy of 0.98. (b) Of seven patients who had positive SN metastasis, three underwent standard gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. Among them, one patient died of recurrence (bone) and the other two patients were alive 4.5 and 14.7 years after surgery. The remaining four patients with positive SN who underwent diminished gastrectomy with lymphatic basin dissection at their request are alive 2.8, 6.0, 6.9 and 10.8 years after surgery without recurrence. (c) No patients who underwent diminished gastrectomy died of gastric cancer after surgery. (d) In the period following diminished gastrectomy, one patient underwent total gastrectomy and five patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection, and they survived for longer than 5 years. (e) As a result of SNNS, the gastric cancer-specific cumulative 5-year survival rate was 98.5%. Conclusions Diminished gastrectomy during SNNS resulted in a satisfactory prognosis. However, regular follow-up after surgery is needed to detect secondary cancer of the remaining stomach.

TI  - Scale Accuracy Evaluation of Image-Based 3D Reconstruction Strategies Using Laser Photogrammetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid developments in the field of underwater photogrammetry have given scientists the ability to produce accurate 3-dimensional (3D) models which are now increasingly used in the representation and study of local areas of interest. This paper addresses the lack of systematic analysis of 3D reconstruction and navigation fusion strategies, as well as associated error evaluation of models produced at larger scales in GPS-denied environments using a monocular camera (often in deep sea scenarios). Based on our prior work on automatic scale estimation of Structure from Motion (SfM)-based 3D models using laser scalers, an automatic scale accuracy framework is presented. The confidence level for each of the scale error estimates is independently assessed through the propagation of the uncertainties associated with image features and laser spot detections using a Monte Carlo simulation. The number of iterations used in the simulation was validated through the analysis of the final estimate behavior. To facilitate the detection and uncertainty estimation of even greatly attenuated laser beams, an automatic laser spot detection method was developed, with the main novelty of estimating the uncertainties based on the recovered characteristic shapes of laser spots with radially decreasing intensities. The effects of four different reconstruction strategies resulting from the combinations of Incremental/Global SfM, and the a priori and a posteriori use of navigation data were analyzed using two distinct survey scenarios captured during the SUBSAINTES 2017 cruise (doi: 10.17600/17001000). The study demonstrates that surveys with multiple overlaps of nonsequential images result in a nearly identical solution regardless of the strategy (SfM or navigation fusion), while surveys with weakly connected sequentially acquired images are prone to produce broad-scale deformation (doming effect) when navigation is not included in the optimization. Thus the scenarios with complex survey patterns substantially benefit from using multiobjective BA navigation fusion. The errors in models, produced by the most appropriate strategy, were estimated at around 1% in the central parts and always inferior to 5% on the extremities. The effects of combining data from multiple surveys were also evaluated. The introduction of additional vectors in the optimization of multisurvey problems successfully accounted for offset changes present in the underwater USBL-based navigation data, and thus minimize the effect of contradicting navigation priors. Our results also illustrate the importance of collecting a multitude of evaluation data at different locations and moments during the survey.

TI  - Spatial predication of flood zonation mapping in Kan River Basin, Iran, using artificial neural network algorithm
T2  - WEATHER AND CLIMATE EXTREMES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is one of the significant natural disasters, which is treated as one of the main global concerns which increased occurrence has led to an increase in mortality rates and economic losses. Various methods have been developed and proposed for the analysis of this natural disaster. Iran is among several countries in the world, which faces severe problems of flood each year particularly in urban catchments. The present study aims to utilize GIS spatial analysis functions, data from Hydrometric and Rain-Gauge stations, satellite images, and thematic data layers in the form of Artificial Neural Network Algorithm for prediction of discharge values and spatial modeling of floods in Kan River Basin located in Tehran province. An optimized artificial neural network of 7 inputs, including slope, slope curvature, flow accumulation, NDVI, geological units, soil type, and rainfall data along with eight, sixteen and one neurons for the first, second and output hidden layers, respectively, were designed and developed. The output of the neural network was discharge values in stations. According to Table.2 in the result section, ANN method has one of the highest correlation and lowest RMSE in flood modeling. Precision parameters such as R-2, RMSE and MAE were used to show the efficiency of the proposed model which yielded the values of 0.82, 0.18, and 0.13, respectively. The results obtained by the present study can be employed in future environmental planning at local scale as a means for improving the management of environmental risks and crises. The present study showed that an integrated utilization of GIS spatial analysis function with neural network algorithm is one of the high efficiency methods for predicting the potential of natural disasters such as floods.

TI  - A Simple Method to Improve Estimates of County-Level Economics in China Using Nighttime Light Data and GDP Growth Rate
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - County-level economic statistics estimation using remotely sensed data, such as nighttime light data, has various advantages over traditional methods. However, uncertainties in remotely sensed data, such as the saturation problem of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS) NSL (nighttime stable lights) data, may influence the accuracy of this remote sensing-based method, and thus hinder its use. This study proposes a simple method to address the saturation phenomenon of nighttime light data using the GDP growth rate. Compared with other methods, the NSL data statistics obtained using the new method reflect the development of economics more accurately. We use this method to calibrate the DMSP-OLS NSL data from 1992 to 2013 to obtain the NSL density data for each county and linearly regress them with economic statistics from 2004 to 2013. Regression results show that lighting data is highly correlated with economic data. We then use the light data to further estimate the county-level GDP, and find that the estimated GDP is consistent with the authoritative GDP statistics. Our approach provides a reliable way to capture county-level economic development in different regions.

TI  - A New Vegetation Index to Detect Periodically Submerged Mangrove Forest Using Single-Tide Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are tropical trees and shrubs that grow in sheltered intertidal zones. Accurate mapping of mangrove forests is a great challenge for remote sensing because mangroves are periodically submerged by tidal floods. Traditionally, multi-tides images were needed to remove the influence of water; however, such images are often unavailable due to rainy climates and uncertain local tidal conditions. Therefore, extracting mangrove forests from a single-tide imagery is of great importance. In this study, reflectance of red-edge bands in Sentinel-2 imagery were utilized to establish a new vegetation index that is sensitive to submerged mangrove forests. Specifically, red and short-wave near infrared bands were used to build a linear baseline; the average reflectance value of four red-edge bands above the baseline is defined as the Mangrove Forest Index (MFI). To evaluate MFI, capabilities of detecting mangrove forests were quantitatively assessed between MFI and four widely used vegetation indices (VIs). Additionally, the practical roles of MFI were validated by applying it to three mangrove forest sites globally. Results showed that: (1) theoretically, Jensen-Shannon divergence demonstrated that a submerged mangrove forest and water pixels have the largest distance in MFI compared to other VIs. In addition, the boxplot showed that all submerged mangrove forests could be separated from the water background in the MFI image. Furthermore, in the MFI image, to separate mangrove forests and water, the threshold is a constant that is equal to zero. (2) Practically, after applying the MFI to three global sites, 99-102% of submerged mangrove forests were successfully extracted by MFI. Although there are still some uncertainties and limitations, the MFI offers great benefits in accurately mapping mangrove forests as well as other coastal and aquatic vegetation worldwide.

TI  - Severe Fire Danger Index: A Forecastable Metric to Inform Firefighter and Community Wildfire Risk Management
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite major advances in numerical weather prediction, few resources exist to forecast wildland fire danger conditions to support operational fire management decisions and community early-warning systems. Here we present the development and evaluation of a spatial fire danger index that can be used to assess historical events, forecast extreme fire danger, and communicate those conditions to both firefighters and the public. It uses two United States National Fire Danger Rating System indices that are related to fire intensity and spread potential. These indices are normalized, combined, and categorized based on a 39-yr climatology (1979-2017) to produce a single, categorical metric called the Severe Fire Danger Index (SFDI) that has five classes; Low, Moderate, High, Very High, and Severe. We evaluate the SFDI against the number of newly reported wildfires and total area burned from agency fire reports (1992-2017) as well as daily remotely sensed numbers of active fire pixels and total daily fire radiative power for large fires (2003-2016) from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) across the conterminous United States. We show that the SFDI adequately captures geographic and seasonal variations of fire activity and intensity, where 58% of the eventual area burned reported by agency fire records, 75.2% of all MODIS active large fire pixels, and 81.2% of all fire radiative power occurred when the SFDI was either Very High or Severe (above the 90th percentile). We further show that SFDI is a strong predictor of firefighter fatalities, where 97 of 129 (75.2%) burnover deaths from 1979 to 2017 occurred when SFDI was either Very High or Severe. Finally, we present an operational system that uses short-term, numerical weather predictions to produce daily SFDI forecasts and show that 76.2% of all satellite active fire detections during the first 48 h following the ignition of nine high-profile case study fires in 2017 and 2018 occurred under Very High or Severe SFDI conditions. The case studies indicate that the extreme weather events that caused tremendous damage and loss of life could be mapped ahead of time, which would allow both wildland fire managers and vulnerable communities additional time to prepare for potentially dangerous conditions. Ultimately, this simple metric can provide critical decision support information to wildland firefighters and fire-prone communities and could form the basis of an early-warning system that can improve situational awareness and potentially save lives.

TI  - Thermal Infrared Imaging to Identify Surface Mines
T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mines show spectral resemblance with other landscape features; hence, their identification with satellite imagery can be difficult. To address this, land surface temperature (LST) derived from thermal infrared images of satellite remote sensing data was used to differentiate mines. Higher surface temperatures were observed for mined land than other classes (built-up and fallow land) in nighttime data. This indicates that the increased surface temperature of the other classes is due to solar heating while geothermal and pyrite oxidation contribute warmth at mined sites. Nighttime LST can be used to locate mines and their spatial extent despite the low spatial resolution of satellite data. It also confirms a mine's heat island phenomenon due to geothermal energy.

TI  - Regression to the Mean in the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Excess 30-day readmissions have declined substantially in hospitals initially penalized for high readmission rates under the Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP). Although a possible explanation is that the policy incentivized penalized hospitals to improve care processes, another is regression to the mean (RTM), a statistical phenomenon that predicts entities farther from the mean in one period are likely to fall closer to the mean in subsequent (or preceding) periods owing to random chance.OBJECTIVE To quantify the contribution of RTM to declining readmission rates at hospitals initially penalized under the HRRP.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study analyzed data from Medicare Provider and Analysis Review files to assess changes in readmissions going forward and backward in time at hospitals with high and low readmission rates during the measurement window for the first year of the HRRP (fiscal year [FY] 2013) and for a measurement window that predated the FY 2013 measurement window for the HRRP among hospitals participating in the HRRP. Hospital characteristics are based on the 2012 survey by the American Hospital Association. The analysis included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older with an index hospitalization for 1 of the 3 target conditions of heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and who were discharged alive from February 1, 2006, through June 30, 2014, with follow-up completed by July 30, 2014. Data were analyzed from January 23, 2018, through March 29, 2019.EXPOSURES Hospital Readmission Reduction Program penalties.MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The excess readmission ratio (ERR), calculated as the ratio of a hospital's readmissions to the readmissions that would be expected based on an average hospital with similar patients. Hospitals with ERRs of greater than 1.0 were penalized.RESULTS A total of 3258 hospitals were included in the study. For the 3 target conditions, hospitals with ERRs of greater than 1.0 during the FY 2013 measurement window exhibited decreases in ERRs in the subsequent 3 years, whereas hospitals with ERRs of no greater than 1.0 exhibited increases. For example, for patients with heart failure, mean ERRs declined from 1.086 to 1.038 (-0.048; 95% CI, -0.053 to -0.043; P<.001) at hospitals with ERRs of greater than 1.0 and increased from 0.917 to 0.957 (0.040; 95% CI, 0.036-0.044; P<.001) at hospitals with ERRs of no greater than 1.0. The same results, with ERR changes of similar magnitude, were found when the analyses were repeated using an alternate measurement window that predated the HRRP and followed up hospitals for 3 years (for patients with heart failure, mean ERRs declined from 1.089 to 1.044 [-0.045; 95% CI, -0.050 to -0.040; P<.001] at hospitals with below-mean performance and increased from 0.915 to 0.948 [0.033; 95% CI, 0.029 to 0.037; P<.001] at hospitals with above-mean performance). By comparing actual changes in ERRs with expected changes due to RTM, 74.3% to 86.5% of the improvement in ERRs for penalized hospitals was explained by RTM.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most of the decline in readmission rates in hospitals with high rates during the measurement window for the first year of the HRRP appeared to be due to RTM. These findings seem to call into question the notion of an HRRP policy effect on readmissions.

T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We describe a new multi-temporal classification for forest/non-forest classes for a 1.3 million square kilometer area encompassing the Xingu River basin, Brazil. This region is well known for its exceptionally high biodiversity, especially in terms of the ichthyofauna, with approximately 600 known species, 10% of which are endemic to the river basin. Global and regional scale datasets do not adequately capture the rapidly changing land cover in this region. Accurate forest cover and forest cover change data are important for understanding the anthropogenic pressures on the aquatic ecosystems. We developed the new classifications with a minimum mapping unit of 0.8 ha from cloud free mosaics of Landsat TM5 and OLI 8 imagery in Google Earth Engine using a classification and regression tree (CART) aided by field photographs for the selection of training and validation points.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth is a limited and non-renewable natural resource that is directly affected by the population growth pressures. In order to make the optimal use of land, it is necessary to be aware of bad land use/land cover (LULC) changes and the ways in which human beings make use of the land, which is possible by detecting LULC change. In this study, remote sensing (RS)/geographic information systems (GIS) were used, and Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images from the years 1986, 2000, and 2016 were analyzed for changes. The aim was using multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network and systematic points statistical analysis (SPSA) for predicting the trend of LULC changes in RS/GIS. The satellite images of three different years were classified into five classes. Variables such as proximity to the road network were considered as effective parameters in growth and development. The SPSA with scattering point trends and points kernel shape also showed the effect of changes on each factor and urban zone. According to the results, during the 30 years, 10.6% of agricultural lands were destroyed and urban areas increased by 23.4%. Agricultural lands and open lands have changed more than other LULCs and have become urban areas with the highest rates of change in the southern parts of the river on the southern and northern margin of the city. These results were shown some layers had more effective on changes, and some region according to desirable for urban developments had more changes that should be considered in urban planning.

M3  - Review
AB  - To determine the role of noninvasive, minimally invasive diagnostic modalities and current management recommendations for cN0 PNC, a literature review using PubMed and Web of Science search engines were conducted. We found that for predicting ILN+: physical exam has limitations, nomograms are not validated, conventional computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging/positron imaging tomography scans have minimal role, and dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy is the most reliable minimally invasive modality. Adverse pathological features: G3, stage >= T2, presence of LVI, and rare histopathological variants are important predictors of ILN+ and their presence warrants prophylactic ILND or dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the absence of these adverse pathological features conservative management is justified. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Detection of PM<sub>2.5</sub> plume movement from IoT ground level monitoring data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analysed a data set from 10 low-cost PM2.5 sensors using the Internet of Things (IoT) for air quality monitoring in Mae Sot, which is one of the most vulnerable areas for high PM2.5 concentration in Thailand, during the 2018 burning season. Our objectives were to understand the nature of the plume movement and to investigate possibilities of adopting IoT sensors for near real-time forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations. Sensor data including PM2.5 and meteorological parameters (wind speed and direction) were collected online every 2 min where data were grouped into four zones and averaged every 15 min interval. Results of diurnal profile plot revealed that PM2.5 concentrations were high around early to late morning (3:00-9:00) and gradually reduced till the rest of the day. During the biomass burning period, maximum daily average concentration recorded by the sensors was 280 mu g/m(3) at Thai Samakkhi while the minimum was 13 mu g/m(3) at Mae Sot. Lag time concentrations, attributed by biomass burning (hot spots), significantly influenced the formation of PM2.5 while the disappearance of PM2.5 was found to be influenced by moderate wind speed. The PM2.5 concentrations of the next 15 min at the downwind zone (MG) were predicted using lag time concentrations with different wind categories. The next 15 min predictions of PM2.5 at MG were found to be mainly influenced by its lag time concentrations (MG_Lag); with higher wind speed, however, the lag time concentrations from the upwind zones (MS_Lag and TS_Lag) started to show more influence. From this study, we have found that low-cost IoT sensors provide not only real-time monitoring information but also demonstrate great potential as an effective tool to understand the PM2.5 plume movement with temporal variation and geo-specific location.

The aim of this study was to assess the false-negative rate of ultrasound (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in axillary node staging at breast cancer diagnosis. All patients with a newly diagnosed breast cancer who had an indeterminate or suspicious axillary node sampled with an FNAC between 2007 and 2014 were included in the study. FNAC results were compared to the final histopathological results of surgically removed axillary lymph nodes. Patient demographics, tumor, and nodal characteristics were analyzed. Diagnostic accuracy tests were performed using IBM SPSS, version 22. A total of 3515 patients with breast cancer were identified, 675 of whom had ultrasound-guided FNAC of ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes (mean age: 55 years; Range: 26-84). A benign (C2) result was observed in 52% (n = 351) and a malignant (C5) result in 35% (n = 238). C1 was obtained in 11% (n = 76), C3 in 0.6% (n = 4), and C4 in 0.9% (n = 6). Of the 238 patients with a malignant (C5) FNAC, 99.6% had confirmed axillary lymph node metastatic disease on histopathology. Of the 351 patients with benign FNAC (C2), 31% (n = 108) of patients had a positive lymph node on histology. The false-negative rate of preoperative FNAC remains too high (31%) to omit definitive surgical staging of the axilla. The high diagnostic accuracy when a positive FNAC is obtained allows appropriate tailored decisions regarding definitive therapy.

TI  - Comparison of basin morphometry analyses derived from different DEMs on two drainage basins in Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphometric analyses provide important data about basins and their drainage networks. Many data sources which are produced from different techniques can be used in this analysis. Two areas which have similar areal and formal features but have different vegetation density were selected as study areas (Kabisre and Koyunluyusufozu Basin). Selected parameters were implemented to both basins using five different datasets: ASTER GDEM, SRTM DEM, ALOS DSM (30 m) and TOPO DEMs (30 m and 10 m). The TOPO DEMs were produced from 1:25.000 scaled digitized topographical maps. The morphometric analyses' result of TOPO DEMs (10 m resolution) was used as the benchmark data for comparing the results of the other data sources. As a result, SRTM DEMs gave the most compatible results with the results of reference data for the study area of Kabisre Basin that has heavy vegetation and the ALOS DSMs gave the closest results to the reference data in study area on Koyunluyusufozu Basin that is deprived of vegetation.

T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper deals with linguocultural values (the supreme guidelines of behavior expressed in communication) in a narrative aspect on the material of fairy-tales, parables, jokes and fiction texts. The correlation of subject plots and norms of worldview is discussed. I argue that there is logic in motifs succession and that narrative types considerably determine such guidelines. In fairy-tales behavioral norms mostly consist in everyday utilitarian and moral prescriptions concerning adversities, prohibitions, intelligence manifestation, courage, generosity, etc. The objective of parables is to make people think over the major issues of reason for being and to consider various ways of approaching wisdom as the main value of dignified people who can take responsible actions and empathize with others. Jokes are used to critically expose various absurdities and hence to affirm committal to reasonable behavior integrated with self-control. Fiction text subject plots are predominantly concerned with choices people have to take in their life, thus the norms of behavior orient us to make efforts in pursuit of the objectives we design, but at the same time these norms restrict our opportunities and compel us to comprehend the limits of our existence.

TI  - Dynamics of Shrimp Farming in the Southwestern Coastal Districts of Bangladesh Using a Shrimp Yield Dataset (SYD) and Landsat Satellite Archives
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The shrimp-farming area and shrimp yield are continuously changing in the southwestern coastal districts of Bangladesh. The three southwestern coastal districts, Bagerhat, Satkhira, and Khulna, along with Rampal, a subdistrict of Bagerhat, contribute 75% of the total shrimp yield of Bangladesh. However, the shrimp yield and farming area have declined in Bagerhat district, and the cause of this decline is uncertain. In this research, the differences in the shrimp yield were quantified using a shrimp yield dataset (SYD) and k-means classification. A supervised image classification approach was applied to quantify the spatiotemporal changes and identify the influencing factors behind the declining shrimp-farming area and yield in Rampal, Bagerhat district, using Landsat satellite archives. K-means classification reveals that, between 2015 and 2017, the shrimp yield in Bagerhat district declined significantly compared to Satkhira and Khulna. The satellite-based monitoring results affirm that the shrimp-farming area of Rampal also decreased rapidly, from 21.82% in 2013 to 6.52% in 2018. This research estimates that approximately 70% of the shrimp-farming area was lost in Rampal since December 2013. Hence, the findings of this research might motivate the responsible bodies to declare the shrimp-farming coastal area as a shrimp zone and implement an active policy to protect the vulnerable shrimp-farming industry and shrimp farmers, considering it is the second-largest export earning source in Bangladesh after ready-made garments.

TI  - Partial Linear NMF-Based Unmixing Methods for Detection and Area Estimation of Photovoltaic Panels in Urban Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spectral-resolution hyperspectral data are acquired by sensors that gather images from hundreds of narrow and contiguous bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data offer unique opportunities for characterization and precise land surface recognition in urban areas. So far, few studies have been conducted with these data to automatically detect and estimate areas of photovoltaic panels, which currently constitute an important part of renewable energy systems in urban areas of developed countries. In this paper, two hyperspectral-unmixing-based methods are proposed to detect and to estimate surfaces of photovoltaic panels. These approaches, related to linear spectral unmixing (LSU) techniques, are based on new nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithms that exploit known panel spectra, which makes them partial NMF methods. The first approach, called Grd-Part-NMF, is a gradient-based method, whereas the second one, called Multi-Part-NMF, uses multiplicative update rules. To evaluate the performance of these approaches, experiments are conducted on realistic synthetic and real airborne hyperspectral data acquired over an urban region. For the synthetic data, obtained results show that the proposed methods yield much better overall performance than NMF-unmixing-based methods from the literature. For the real data, the obtained detection and area estimation results are first confirmed by using very high-spatial-resolution ortho-images of the same regions. These results are also compared with those obtained by standard NMF-unmixing-based methods and by a one-class-classification-based approach. This comparison shows that the proposed approaches are superior to those considered from the literature.

TI  - Predicting metastasis in clinically negative axillary lymph nodes with minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value in luminal A-like breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We investigated the usefulness of the minimum ADC value of primary breast lesions for predicting axillary lymph node (LN) status in luminal A-like breast cancers with clinically negative nodes in comparison with the mean ADC. Methods Forty-four luminal A-like breast cancers without axillary LN metastasis at preoperative clinical evaluation, surgically resected with sentinel LN biopsy, were retrospectively studied. Mean and minimum ADC values of each lesion were measured and statistically compared between LN positive (n = 12) and LN negative (n = 32) groups. An ROC curve was drawn to determine the best cutoff value to differentiate LN status. Correlations between mean and minimum ADC values and the number of metastatic axillary LNs were investigated. Results Mean and minimum ADC values of breast lesions with positive LN were significantly lower than those with negative LN (mean 839.9 +/- 110.9 vs. 1022.2 +/- 250.0 x 10(- 6) mm(2)/s, p = 0.027, minimum 696.7 +/- 128.0 vs. 925.0 +/- 257.6 x 10(- 6) mm(2)/s, p = 0.004). The sensitivity and NPV using the best cutoff value from ROC using both mean and minimum ADC were 100%. AUC of the minimum ADC (0.784) was higher than that of the mean ADC (0.719). Statistically significant negative correlations were observed between both mean and minimum ADCs and number of positive LNs, with stronger correlation to minimum ADC than mean ADC. Conclusions The minimum ADC value of primary breast lesions predicts axillary LN metastasis in luminal A-like breast cancer with clinically negative nodes, with high sensitivity and high NPV.

TI  - Is everybody human? The relationship between humanity and animality in Western and Amerindian myth narratives
T2  - CULTURE & PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The general problem this research approaches is the observation that, in Western cultures, Human occupies a central place and is identified with the cosmological wholeness-a worldview which is in tune with the paradigm of massive abuses that are practiced against animals who(1) are exploited by industry worldwide and with the environmental catastrophe we witness nowadays. Departing from that problem, this paper presents and discusses the Western notion indicated above, comparing it with the notion of Yanomami indigenous people about human's place in the universe. We use a dialogical methodology pertinent to semiotic-cultural constructivism in psychology, focusing on the relationship between "human" and non-human animal in the two mentioned cultures, through the analysis of two creation myths: The Book of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew-Christian Bible; and The Falling Sky: Words from a Yanomami Shaman, a set of narratives from indigenous leader Davi Kopenawa. Results show that Western and Amerindian narratives present mostly opposite conceptions concerning the relationships between "humanity" and animality and that meanings for "human" and "animal" differ essentially in both. From the tension with Amerindian cosmology and its relationship with nonhuman animal, we call into question the ethno-anthropocentrism that is present in Western psychology since its birth. Given that psychology lays its foundations on a worldview that presupposes a strict split between nature and Humanity (assuming, e.g. an insurmountable incompatibility between the impulse of our "natural" desires and the regulation and prohibitions imposed by "culture"), this research intends to draw attention to the fact that the naturalist ontology is not an a priori nor a necessary condition for the construction of self-identity in the world. Whereas this presupposed Human "alienation" from nature remains taken for granted in the hegemonic theoretical-methodological reflections in psychology, we discuss the limits of Eurocentered psychology research and its implications in a dialogical epistemology.

TI  - Spatiotemporal LULC change impacts on groundwater table in Jhargram, West Bengal, India
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater resources are the significant factor for maintaining life. The land use/cover (LULC) change and its effect on the groundwater table would enhanced land use and groundwater management for arid areas. This paper proposes a technique to LULC effects on the groundwater table. LULC extract based on time-series Landsat imagery (1988, 1993, 1998, 2003, 2007, 2013 and 2017) and its effect on the groundwater table. SVM algorithm used for classification of LULC features and its higher accuracy. In the study area, groundwater data (2001-2012) used for groundwater table change analysis. The result showed that 1.03 mbgl (Metres Below Ground Level) groundwater decreased in the study area. Analysis of the time-series climate data (1988-2014) based on the study area shows apex's for maximum temperature increased between 0.2 and 0.8 degrees C and 0.3 to 1.5 degrees C for minimum apexes. At the same time, analysis of historical rainfall data indicated that rainfall decreased by 10 mm, respectively during the years 1988-2014. The classification results showed that the SVM algorithm overall accuracy of 86.67% and the kappa coefficient of 0.82. The relationships among LULC and, climate, groundwater change values showed both positive and negative correlations. This paper highlighted the LULC change effect on the groundwater table change in arid areas.

TI  - Sources of microplastics pollution in the marine environment: Importance of wastewater treatment plant and coastal landfill
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the role of a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent and an abandoned coastal landfill as pathways for microplastics (MPs) input into the marine environment. MPs were first analyzed in raw sewage influent, sludge and effluent samples, and their fate was studied along a distance gradient from the WWTP in three matrices: surface water, sediments and wild mussels. All suspected MN were characterized according to their polymer nature using micro-Raman spectroscopy. The investigated WWTP had an estimated daily discharge of 227 million MPs. MPs were found in all matrices with a decreasing abundance from the effluent. Strong MPs abundances (higher than those found near the WWTP effluent) were observed in the vicinity of the coastal landfill suggesting its importance as a MPs entry route into the marine coastal environment. Our study supports the idea that blue mussels are a promising sentinel species for MPs ( < 200 mu m).

TI  - Added Value of Atmosphere-Ocean Coupling in a Century-Long Regional Climate Simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A twentieth century-long coupled atmosphere-ocean regional climate simulation with COSMO-CLM (Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling, Climate Limited-area Model) and NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) is studied here to evaluate the added value of coupled marginal seas over continental regions. The interactive coupling of the marginal seas, namely the Mediterranean, the North and the Baltic Seas, to the atmosphere in the European region gives a comprehensive modelling system. It is expected to be able to describe the climatological features of this geographically complex area even more precisely than an atmosphere-only climate model. The investigated variables are precipitation and 2 m temperature. Sensitivity studies are used to assess the impact of SST (sea surface temperature) changes over land areas. The different SST values affect the continental precipitation more than the 2 m temperature. The simulated variables are compared to the CRU (Climatic Research Unit) observational data, and also to the HOAPS/GPCC (Hamburg Ocean Atmosphere Parameters and Fluxes from Satellite Data, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre) data. In the coupled simulation, added skill is found primarily during winter over the eastern part of Europe. Our analysis shows that, over this region, the coupled system is dryer than the uncoupled system, both in terms of precipitation and soil moisture, which means a decrease in the bias of the system. Thus, the coupling improves the simulation of precipitation over the eastern part of Europe, due to cooler SST values and in consequence, drier soil.

TI  - Bimodal climate control of shoreline change influenced by Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation variability along the Cooloola Sand Mass, Queensland, Australia
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave climate in southeast Queensland, Australia has been correlated to changes in the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), but observations of shoreline change associated with the variable wave climate have been limited due to a paucity of aerial photography, LiDAR, and other beach profiling datasets in this region. A multi-decadal, sub-annual temporal resolution shoreline dataset spanning 1996 to 2017 was produced using satellite imagery collected by Landsat 5, 7, and 8. A total of 147 shoreline positions were delineated using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index on cloud-free imagery and corrected for horizontal offsets forced by variable tide stages at the satellite flyover time. The relative influence of SOI, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Subtropical Ridge Latitude (STR-L) and Pressure (STR-P) on shoreline dynamics along the Cooloola Sand Mass in Queensland are assessed by performing cross correlations between their respective index values and shoreline change distances calculated by the Digital Shoreline Analysis System. A bimodal climate control of shoreline change is observed dependent upon the phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO). IPO modulates the impacts of ENSO on eastern Australia through its control over the position of the South Pacific Convergence Zone and elevating/lowering of tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures. During negative IPO, SOI is negatively correlated to the Cooloola Sand Mass shoreline indicating that the shoreline retreats during negative SOI phases. During positive IPO, the impacts of SOI are weakened and the STR becomes the primary driver of shoreline change with shoreline response being contingent upon its orientation. The SW-NE aligned Noosa North shoreline erodes in response to poleward movement of the STR, likely due to the enhanced cross-shore wave attack as a result of anti-clockwise wave rotation. The opposite response is shown at the SE-NW aligned Rainbow Beach shoreline, which is oriented almost parallel to the incident wave direction and is sheltered by the Double Island Point headland. These results suggest that climate control on shoreline change at Cooloola Sand Mass, and likely other sand islands in the region, is two-tiered, whereby interdecadal variability of the IPO governs the relative influence of SOI and STR under the different IPO phases. The linked climate and shoreline variability correlation shown in this study provides significant insight into how the Cooloola Sand Mass shoreline will respond to future climate changes under a global warming scenario.

TI  - Triple tracer (blue dye, indocyanine green, and Tc99) compared to double tracer (indocyanine green and Tc99) for sentinel lymph node detection in endometrial cancer: a prospective study with random assignment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is increasingly being used in the treatment of apparent early-stage endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether three tracers (blue dye, indocyanine green (ICG), and technetium-99 (Tc99)) performed better than two (ICG and Tc99).Study Design Prospective study of all consecutive patients (n=163) diagnosed with clinical early-stage endometrial cancer from 2015 to 2017. All patients were randomly assigned to receive a mixture of ICG and Tc99 with or without blue dye. Subgroup analysis for detection rates was performed for each group (double versus triple tracer).Results One hundred and fifty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria. Eighty patients received ICG and Tc99 with unilateral and bilateral SLN detection rates of 97.5% and 81.3%, respectively. Seventy-seven patients received all three tracers with unilateral and bilateral detection rates of 93.5% and 80.5%, respectively. Only one patient in the triple tracer group was detected by blue dye alone. No significant differences were noticed in unilateral or bilateral detection rates between the two groups, nor in the detection of lymph node metastasis.Conclusion The addition of blue dye to ICG and Tc99 did not demonstrate any improvement in SLN detection.

TI  - The Proliferation of Monism to the East and the Making of the Religion of the Future in Early Twentieth-Century Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGIOUS HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study illuminates the transnational proliferation of monism, a worldview that drew on evolutionary theory to unify both science and religion and ultimately replace traditional religions. Particular attention is paid to how monism was transmitted from Germany via Japan to Korea in the early twentieth century, and how this impacted local endeavours to imagine a religion of the future. A prominent figure in this trajectory was the religious thinker Yi Tonhwa (1884-1950) who endeavoured to use the tenets of monism to transform the Ch'ondogyo, "Religion of the Heavenly Way," one of the most prominent religions in Korea at the time, into a universal religion of the future. The result was among the closest to a monist religion the world had seen, although the efforts to align the Ch'ondogyo with modern scientific thought also deprived the religion of native elements. This would have significant repercussions for the religion as the scientific optimism that had sustained the global monist movement faded away after 1945.

TI  - Predictive factors for lymph node metastases in vulvar cancer. An analysis of the AGO-CaRE-1 multicenter study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Lymph node (LN) metastasis is the most important prognostic factor in primary vulvar cancer. Assessing risk factors for the incidence and extent of LN metastases may help to select the optimal treatment strategy for each individual patient.Methods. In a subgroup analysis of the large multicenter AGO-CaRE-1 study we included all patients treated with radical groin dissection. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed in order to detect factors associated with the prevalence and extent of nodal involvement.Results. In total, 1162 patients were analyzed. Univariate analyses detected age, ECOG as well as multiple tumor characteristics such as FIGO stage, grading, depth of invasion, tumor diameter, and (lymph)vascular space invasion to be related with the prevalence of LN metastases. Interestingly, only tumor stage, tumor diameter and depth of infiltration were found to be significantly associated with the number of LN metastases. In multivariate analysis, age (OR 1.03), lymphvascular space invasion (OR 4.97), tumor stage (OR 2.22) and depth of infiltration (OR 1.08) showed an association with the prevalence of LN metastases. Regarding the number of metastatic LNs, only tumor stage (OR 221) or, if excluded, tumor diameter (OR 1.02) were tested significant.Conclusion. This large analysis of the multicenter AGO-CaRE-1-study identified lymphvascular space invasion, tumor stage, and depth of infiltration as factors with the strongest association regarding the prevalence of LN metastasis. Interestingly, tumor stage or, if excluded, tumor diameter were the only factors associated with the prevalence as well as the extent of LN metastases. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Using High-Spatiotemporal Thermal Satellite ET Retrievals for Operational Water Use and Stress Monitoring in a California Vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In viticulture, deficit irrigation strategies are often implemented to control vine canopy growth and to impose stress at critical stages of vine growth to improve wine grape quality. To support deficit irrigation scheduling, remote sensing technologies can be employed in the mapping of evapotranspiration (ET) at the field to sub-field scales, quantifying time-varying vineyard water requirements and actual water use. In the current study, we investigate the utility of ET maps derived from thermal infrared satellite imagery over a vineyard in the Central Valley of California equipped with a variable rate drip irrigation (VRDI) system which enables differential water applications at the 30 x 30 m scale. To support irrigation management at that scale, we utilized a thermal-based multi-sensor data fusion approach to generate weekly total actual ET (ETa) estimates at 30 m spatial resolution, coinciding with the resolution of the Landsat reflectance bands. Crop water requirements (ETc) were defined with a vegetative index (VI)-based approach. To test capacity to capture stress signals, the vineyard was sub-divided into four blocks with different irrigation management strategies and goals, inducing varying degrees of stress during the growing season. Results indicate derived weekly total ET from the thermal-based data fusion approach match well with observations. The thermal-based method was also able to capture the spatial heterogeneity in ET over the vineyard due to a water stress event imposed on two of the four vineyard blocks. This transient stress event was not reflected in the VI-based ETc estimate, highlighting the value of thermal band imaging. While the data fusion system provided valuable information, latency in current satellite data availability, particularly from Landsat, impacts operational applications over the course of a growing season.

TI  - An empirical adjusted ENSO ocean energetics framework based on observational wind power in the tropical Pacific
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - According to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) energetics theory, the work done by the wind on the ocean, known as wind power, has a strong forcing relationship with ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) changes, wherein negative (positive) tropical Pacific wind power anomalies contribute to warm (cold) ENSO events. The ENSO energetics framework assumes a mean state characterized by easterly winds, westward currents and a thermocline shoaling from west to east such that positive zonal wind power anomalies will induce a La Nina state and negative anomalies will induce an El Nino state. In this study, tropical Pacific wind power is computed using satellite data and its correlations with Nino 3.4 SST anomalies evaluated and compared to the conventional dynamical predictors, namely warm water volume and wind stress. Analysis of the spatial and temporal structure of climatological wind power and its variability during individual ENSO events reveals sign inconsistencies in which certain wind power anomalies (e.g. those associated with westerly wind events in the far west) are positive despite forcing the system towards an El Nino state. These results show that the conventional ENSO energetics framework makes assumptions about the climatological state that are not always consistent with observations. We apply sign adjustments to the computation of a tropical Pacific wind power index that include the directional aspect of the wind power perturbations and find that these adjustments greatly enhance the lead correlations between wind power and Nino3.4 SST anomalies, which are now comparable to conventional dynamical predictors.

TI  - Wall-to-Wall Parcel-Level Mapping of Agricultural Land Abandonment in the Polish Carpathians
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimations of the extent of agricultural land abandonment (ALA) are critical to the sustainable management of agricultural resources and forestry, the understanding of ALA determinants, and the development of future agricultural policies. Although ALA is widespread in Europe, mapping it over large areas using remote sensing data is difficult as a result of the complexity of this phenomenon. This study aims to develop methods for a detailed wall-to-wall regional-scale mapping of ALA using vegetation height and secondary forest succession indicators. The rates and distribution of ALA were analyzed at the parcel and communal level in the Polish Carpathians using a high-resolution vegetation height model (VHM) derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and topographic data. Depending on the parcel-level secondary forest succession threshold (10, 20, and 50%), the regional ALA rates were 18.8, 9.0, and 2.1%, respectively. Regardless of the threshold, abandoned grasslands covered about three times more area than abandoned croplands. The highest ALA rates were observed in communes located in the western part of the study area, as well as east and south of Rzeszow. We found that areas receiving European Union Common Agricultural Policy payments very rarely showed signs of secondary forest succession and land abandonment. The developed method proved to be effective for detailed ALA mapping at various spatial scales.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the total impact of digitalization on processes of identification. The development of information and communication technologies has generated new formats of socialization, inculturation and identification. Verification and construction of own identity is increasingly taking place in the Internet environment, but this environment sets more rigid framework and algorithms for this process. These changes began to affect all aspects of society, transforming not only the ways and contexts of communication and interaction, but also influencing the value-normative system and culture in General, setting the frame of research of social and humanitarian science. Due to the fact that new technologies have changed the idea of distance, time, space, indicating the transboundary nature of these phenomena have changed and approaches to the study of these phenomena. The development of digital technologies has led to the change of models and methods of identification and representation. Initially, the virtualization of everyday cultural practices and interactions allowed a person to try on different masks and statuses on an anonymous polygon of multiple identities, then forming the possibilities of personal auto projects and virtual personality, represented in the network space and subsequently appropriated in real life. These phenomena have a direct impact on a person by changing the ways of perception, thinking and worldview, making new demands on his competencies, forming a request for the nonlinearity of thinking and multi-channel perception of information. Now it is impossible to hide in the network, separating the virtual profile from the real identity. Today, the process of digitalization increasingly began to show - make visible, limit of virtuality, becoming, rather, the basis for integrity, in the truest sense of the word identity, identity, combining digital, virtual and real identity in the most transparent digital environment, creating conditions for the emergence of new opportunities, challenges and threats to the cultural foundations of society and embodying in reality the prophetic vision of the Matrix from the Wachowski brothers.

TI  - East China Sea ecosystem under multiple stressors: Heterogeneous responses in the sea surface chlorophyll-a
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The East China Sea and southern Yellow Sea ecosystems have undergone drastic changes over the past decades. The changes in the ecosystems are attributable to both natural and anthropogenic stressors. We analyzed the seasonal and interannual variability of the sea surface chlorophyll-a in the East China Sea and the southern Yellow Sea using a suite of remotely sensed data (1998-2012). When seen on a Large Marine Ecosystem level, there seems no trend in the region. However, when seen on a sub-regional scale, heterogeneous responses can be recognized among the subregions. There was an increasing trend of chlorophyll-a in the vicinity of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River mouth, while there was a decreasing trend in the southeastern slope area which can be attributed to anthropogenic nutrient enrichment and warming, respectively. Contrary to some previous studies, our analysis clearly showed that the summer-autumn averaged chlorophyll-a decreased by about 14% in a large area (circa 178,000 km(2)) in the northeastern East China Sea after 2003 coinciding with the initial impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam. Our analysis demonstrates that our ability to detect the trends in response to multiple stressors largely depends on choosing an appropriate spatiotemporal scale.

TI  - A robust method for reconstructing global MODIS EVI time series on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining high quality remote sensing vegetation index that is not noticeably affected by abiotic factors is critical for agricultural, ecological, climate and hydrological studies. Here we developed a computationally efficient and well-performed denoising method for reconstructing remote sensing vegetation indices, namely wWHd (weighted Whittaker with dynamic parameter lambda in spatial). The single parameter lambda is automatically estimated for every pixel by a multiple linear regression. Weights updating and the inherit nature of Whittaker make Whittaker robust for contaminations. We applied the wWHd on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for reconstructing 500 m resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) at global scale and for the period of 2000-2017. To demonstrate its robustness, wWHd was compared with four well-known denoising methods, i.e. Fourier-based approach (Fourier), Savitzky-Golay filter (SG), Asymmetric Gaussian (AG) and double logistic (DL) at 16,000 randomly selected sites. All approaches were evaluated using two indices at each site: (1) root mean square error (RMSE) between observed best quality EVI and gap-filled EVI series, and (2) roughness of gap-filled EVI series. Results show that wWHd has an RMSE (indicating fidelity) of similar to 0.032, which is similar to Fourier and SG at similar to 90% sampled sites, but outperforms (similar to 0.02 less in the RMSE) AG and DL at similar to 45% and similar to 25% sampled sites. Among the four, wWHd has the lowest (best) roughness of similar to 0.003. These performances demonstrate that wWHd balances fidelity and roughness well. Another advantage is that the wWHd is computationally more efficient than others, and is currently the only one denoising method deployed on the GEE. Our results suggest that it is promising to use the proposed wWHd method for processing remote sensing vegetation indices with high spatiotemporal resolution and the reconstructed EVI product should be widely used by global community.

TI  - Achieving the Full Vision of Earth Observation Data Cubes
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation imagery have traditionally been expensive, difficult to find and access, and required specialized skills and software to transform imagery into actionable information. This has limited adoption by the broader science community. Changes in cost of imagery and changes in computing technology over the last decade have enabled a new approach for how to organize, analyze, and share Earth observation imagery, broadly referred to as a data cube. The vision and promise of image data cubes is to lower these hurdles and expand the user community by making analysis ready data readily accessible and providing modern approaches to more easily analyze and visualize the data, empowering a larger community of users to improve their knowledge of place and make better informed decisions. Image data cubes are large collections of temporal, multivariate datasets typically consisting of analysis ready multispectral Earth observation data. Several flavors and variations of data cubes have emerged. To simplify access for end users we developed a flexible approach supporting multiple data cube styles, referencing images in their existing structure and storage location, enabling fast access, visualization, and analysis from a wide variety of web and desktop applications. We provide here an overview of that approach and three case studies.

TI  - Characterising spatial and temporal patterns of urban evolution in Sub-Saharan Africa: The case of Accra, Ghana
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanisation and globalisation are creating relentless spatial transformation across the globe. There is a growing interest in understanding and conceptualising the emergent and often contested spatial morphologies and typologies in cities as they mediate the competing demands of global and local forces. This paper examines spatial and temporal development patterns in a Sub-Saharan Africa context using Accra, the capital and rapidly growing city of Ghana, as case study and explores the emerging urban form. By classifying Landsat satellite images (1986-2017) and using landscape/spatial metrics to characterise Accra's spatial development along four concentric rings, we find growing complexity and fragmented spatial growth patterns in Accra. Despite the spatial fragmentation, a Contiguity Index of 0.64, 0.49 and 0.56 for 1986, 2000, and 2017 respectively show that Accra's urban form is not amorphous nor polycentric but monocentric. The study demonstrates that using landscape metrics to characterise spatial development patterns under buffer zones leads to better understanding of the temporal and changing form of the city under various conditions. We reflect on the implications of these findings for urban policy and planning in Accra and other similar Sub-Saharan African cities.

TI  - "What use is there in Mozart living on?..": Mozart and Salieri in modernist aesthetic practices
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the reception of the image of Mozart and Salieri in literary criticism and writing practices of the early 20th century. The moment of the cultural crisis (the end of symbolism domination as the leading modernist paradigm) intensified the struggle for "one's own Pushkin," Pushkin's aesthetic legacy and Pushkin's unique place in culture. At the time of reconfiguration of aesthetic fields (at the very beginning of the 1910s), the discussion around Pushkin's name is important in terms of defining the pantheon of modernist classics. For example, in the fierce public dispute between V. Bryusov and K. Balmont, which broke out in 1913, there are clear references to Pushkin's "little tragedy" - "Mozart and Salieri" - read by literary rivals, equally claiming to be "classic of symbolism," in the auto-design key. The gaps between general knowledge, literary-theoretical reflection, and poetic creativity are revealed. The proteic (polyphonic) nature of the Pushkin text allows representatives of competing literary groups to read often opposite meanings into it. The article defines the source of V. Brasov' s Salierian reputation, its auto-interpretation character. Such a source is Bryusov's journalism, in particular, the article "The right to work" - with an apology for his approach to creativity, which goes back to the image of the Pushkin master. The younger poets, constructing the posthumous Bryusov myth on the Salierian platform, were in many ways sensitive to his promise. Due to their aesthetic and axio logical complexity, the articles by V. Khodasevich and M. Tsvetaeva dedicated to Bryusov ("Bryusov" (1924) and "Hero of labor" (1925)) stand out against the background of the Bryusov's mortemology of the Russian diaspora. Vladislav Khodasevich will see the "Salierian" beginning in Bryusov's "algebraism," sober calculation and hard work. Marina Tsvetaeva examines the image of Bryusov in a similar way. Tsvetaeva refuses Pushkin's inheritance not only to Bryusov but also to his opponent Balmont. Tsvetaeva considers the basis of the inheritance to be the ability "to sing Russian songs" and "the sameness of our love that brings us together." According to Tsvetaeva, it is these qualities that are possessed by the poet of the next symbolist generation, Alexander Blok.

TI  - Night sky photometry over Warsaw (Poland) evaluated simultaneously with surface-based and satellite-based cloud observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Light pollution is a widely distributed form of anthropogenic pollution that threatens both biodiversity and human health. One of the most popular indicators is known as night sky brightness (NSB), measured with photometric techniques. In the study, we report results of the very first, long-term photometric survey of NSB over Poland's capital, Warsaw, for 636 nights between 2014 and 2016 using a sky quality meter (SQM). Data were collected for all-weather conditions and, for the first time, we simultaneously use two independent sources of cloud amount data: surface-based (SYNOP) and satellite based (Meteosat/SEVIRI). Results show that Warsaw is significantly polluted by light, with average NSB of 18.65 +/- 0.06 mag(SQM)/arcsec(2) (15 times higher than unpolluted sky). Zenithal NSB is almost unaffected by moonlight. During astronomical nights, cloud cover was the dominant determinant of NSB, increasing by 7 times for overcast sky. In general, the sky brightened by similar to 0.2 mag(SQM)/arcsec(2) for each 10% increase in cloud fraction. Satellite-based cloud amount data was found to be a very reliable alternative to traditional SYNOP observations. No statistically significant difference was found for average NSB calculated using satellite and SYNOP datasets. This finding is of particular importance, since the coverage of surface-based data is limited, while satellite observations can be obtained for any location on Earth, and collocate with any NSB photometric station. Our investigation also highlighted that SYNOP data are unreliable when cloud amount is low. This is due to the different fields of view for SQM (20 degrees) and SYNOP (180 degrees) observations of broken cloud. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the aspect of professional communication, the challenge to a comparative description of special vocabulary is currently due to the strengthening of international relations because of the accelerated development of young and promising oil industries. The consequence of this growth is the need for high-quality technical translation, which actualizes the study of culturally specific metaphorical models for the formation of terms. Thus, the analysis of terms in the field of "Desulfurization of oils and oil products" is relevant not only for terminography, international communication, scientific and technical translation in this area but also for revealing the significance of the terminology's connections with the national picture of the world and cultural aspects. Oil refining and, in particular, desulphurization of oils and oil products remains unexplored from the point of view of cultural linguistics and cognitive terminology. In connection with the indicated gap, this study is aimed at solving the problem associated with a comparative description of culturally specific metaphorical models in Russian, English, and Chinese on the material of the term system "Desulphurization of oils and oil products".The analysis technique is multi-stage. At the first stage, the definitional analysis was used to determine the meaning of the term and to determine semantic groups. Next is a quantitative analysis to organize the data.At the second stage, the analysis of the internal form made it possible to determine: 1) the feature underlying the nomination in the formation of terminological meaning, the degree of its metaphor; 2) to which model the terminological metaphor can be attributed.At the next stage, frame analysis allowed us to obtain data for comparative analysis. A comparative analysis of the semantic parameters of the metaphor in relation to the Russian, English and Chinese languages was based on a synthesis of the cultural and cognitive experience of a person who, with the help of a metaphor, reflects the established deep connections between objects, phenomena, properties and relationships at the level of figurative nomination.A cognitive description of the term involves the interpretation of data obtained by linguistic methods.The analysis shows the quantitative mismatch of metaphorical models in the three studied languages. This discrepancy is actualized by various images in a metaphorical conceptualization due to different pictures of the world and cultural concepts of Russian, English-speaking peoples and Chinese.The presence of a large number of asymmetric (15 terms out of 65), partially symmetrical (12 terms out of 65), non-metaphorical terms (15 terms out of 65), and a small number of matching metaphorical models (6 out of 28 models) in the three languages studied are significant differences in national scientific pictures of the world, which in turn are formed under the influence of the specifics of the worldview of the nation.

TI  - Synergy of Satellite, In Situ and Modelled Data for Addressing the Scarcity of Water Quality Information for Eutrophication Assessment and Monitoring of Swedish Coastal Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monthly CHL-a and Secchi Depth (SD) data derived from the full mission data of the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; 2002-2012) were analysed along a horizontal transect from the inner Braviken bay and out into the open sea. The CHL-a values were calibrated using an algorithm derived from Swedish lakes. Then, calibrated Chl-a and Secchi Depth (SD) estimates were extracted from MERIS data along the transect and compared to conventional monitoring data as well as to data from the Swedish Coastal zone Model (SCM), providing physico-biogeochemical parameters such as temperature, nutrients, Chlorophyll-a (CHL-a) and Secchi depth (SD). A high negative correlation was observed between satellite-derived CHL-a and SD (rho = -0.91), similar to the in situ relationship established for several coastal gradients in the Baltic proper. We also demonstrate that the validated MERIS-based estimates and data from the SCM showed strong correlations for the variables CHL-a, SD and total nitrogen (TOTN), which improved significantly when analysed on a monthly basis across basins. The relationship between satellite-derived CHL-a and modelled TOTN was also evaluated on a monthly basis using least-square linear regression models. The predictive power of the models was strong for the period May-November (R-2: 0.58-0.87), and the regression algorithm for summer was almost identical to the algorithm generated from in situ data in Himmerfjarden bay. The strong correlation between SD and modelled TOTN confirms that SD is a robust and reliable indicator to evaluate changes in eutrophication in the Baltic proper which can be assessed using remote sensing data. Amongst all three assessed methods, only MERIS CHL-a was able to correctly depict the pattern of phytoplankton phenology that is typical for the Baltic proper. The approach of combining satellite data and physio-biogeochemical models could serve as a powerful tool and value-adding complement to the scarcely available in situ data from national monitoring programs. In particular, satellite data will help to reduce uncertainties in long-term monitoring data due to its improved measurement frequency.

TI  - Propagation of the Azov Sea waters in the Black sea under impact of variable winds, geostrophic currents and exchange in the Kerch Strait
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and hydrological data were used to study the propagation of the Azov waters (Azov plume - AP) in the Black Sea, its relation to wind forcing, eddy dynamics, and water balance in the Azov and Black Seas. Strong north winds increase the inflow of the Azov waters in the basin and their further transport to the west along the Crimean coast. AP usually extends from the Kerch Strait to the west up to cape Chauda and Feodosiya Bay over the shallow areas less than 30 m deep. In winter-early spring, when northeast storms and the Rim Current are the most intense, they penetrate further up to cape Meganom or even to the southwestern Crimean coast. Near the capes, AP may detach from the coast and get trapped in the mesoscale anticyclones formed beyond the capes. Salinity gradients between the AP and the Black Sea waters induce the formation of frontal geostrophic currents, reaching 10 cm/s, which can constitute half of the total geostrophic velocity in this part of the basin. During the strong south winds, AP is transported both to the east and west of the Kerch Strait, or the inflow of the Azov waters is completely blocked. These storms are the reason of the highest turbidity in the vicinity of the Kerch Strait, which is related to the wave-induced coastal erosion and resuspension of bottom sediments over the shallow Kerch-Taman shelf.Altimetry and in-situ data on sea level difference in the two basins were used to study the variability of the barotropic transport near the Kerch Strait, and its dependence on the water balance in the two basins, wind direction and magnitude. The greatest difference between mean sea level in the Azov Sea and the Black Sea in winter increases the inflow of the Azov waters in cold season. Rise of the dynamic sea level over the coastal part of the Black Sea in winter caused by the intensification of cyclonic circulation partly compensates this difference and decreases the exchange. North, and northwest winds with magnitude 12-16 m/s increase the barotropic velocity in the strait by 30-40 cm/s, while south, and southwest winds with the same magnitude decrease it by 20-30 cm/s. Turbidity near the strait that is an indicator of AP has significant interannual variability. In 2003-2015 it declines over the whole Kerch-Taman shelf, which is related to the decrease of the inflow of the Azov waters into the Black Sea in this period.

TI  - The Influence of Signal to Noise Ratio of Legacy Airborne and Satellite Sensors for Simulating Next-Generation Coastal and Inland Water Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, operational ocean color satellite sensors are designed with a legacy perspective for sampling the open ocean primarily in the visible domain, while high spatial resolution sensors such as Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3, and Landsat8 are increasingly used for observations of coastal and inland water quality. Next-generation satellites such as the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) and Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) sensors are anticipated to increase spatial and/or spectral resolution. An important consideration is determining the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) needed to retrieve typical biogeochemical products, such as biomass, in aquatic systems, and whether legacy sensors can be used for algorithm development. Here, we evaluate SNR and remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs) uncertainty for representative bright and dim targets in coastal California, USA. The majority of existing sensors fail to meet proposed criteria. Despite these limitations, uncertainties in retrieved biomass as chlorophyll or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) remain well below a proposed threshold of 17.5%, suggesting that existing sensors can be used in coastal systems. Existing commercially available in-water and airborne instrument suites can exceed all proposed thresholds for SNR and R-rs uncertainty, providing a path forward for collection of calibration and validation data for future satellite missions.

TI  - Lithological mapping in the Central African Copper Belt using Random Forests and clustering: Strategies for optimised results
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Trident project is located in the Domes region of the Central African Copper Belt and hosts a number of mineralised systems including the Sentinel (Ni) and Enterprise (Cu) deposits. The project has received extensive systematic geochemical soil sampling in addition to high resolution airborne geophysical coverage. This data rich environment enables experimentation with machine learning strategies which aim to produce or refine geological maps from limited direct observations.In this study we present a series of three case studies that test lithological classification using the supervised Random Forests algorithm. These studies inform the situations encountered in mineral exploration including early stage lithology mapping and more mature stage map refinement. We also present a fourth study, using the unsupervised algorithms k-means and Self-Organising Maps, to identify clusters, potentially associated with lithology in absence of a priori geological information. Our case studies are most relevant to the situation where the geology of a prospect is largely concealed beneath extensive cover rocks, with some rock types being poorly expressed or even absent in outcrop.We find that sampling from limited outcrop produces a RF lithology prediction that is likely to be incorrect. We demonstrate that balancing sample size through a combination of decimation and bootstrapping can improve results. Additionally, we identify some important indicators in both the predicted geology and uncertainty metrics which could alert an explorer to an inability of their training data to make accurate predictions and to the presence of lithological classes not expressed in outcrop. Sampling from a mature lithology map enables further map refinement and acts as an objective audit of the existing product. Information entropy (H) is calculated as a metric to describe quantitatively the uncertainty associated with classification, provide valuable information on the geological complexity of the mapped region and highlight areas which are potentially misclassified. Clusters obtained using the k-means algorithm produced a result more consistent with lithology in this instance and was faster; however Self Organising Maps remains attractive due to the production of additional metrics to assess algorithm performance. Clustering could be used either in the development of a first pass interpretation, or in the critical appraisal and subsequent refinement of existing interpretations.

TI  - Dynamics of Students' Axiological Orientations in the Learning Process at Pedagogical University
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The system of axiological orientations determines the content direction of the personality and forms the basis of its views on the world around, other people, oneself, basis of world outlook, core of motivation and "philosophy of life". Axiological orientations are considered as the most important component of the internal structure of the personality. They provide stability and continuity of its behaviour and activities, and are reflected in the worldview, moral ideas, principles, and beliefs. The author presents the results of a case study to identify the dynamics of students' axiological orientations in the process of teaching at a pedagogical university and to determine the possibility of optimizing the development of individual axiological orientations through targeted psychological impact and training. Under the influence of such training, there is a change in the perceptions of subjects on the values associated with future life and professional activity. The study involved 58 people - third- and fourth-year students. There were used such surveys as the Rokeach Value Survey (RVS), the Schwartz Value Survey (SVS) and S.S. Bubnova's survey "Diagnosis of the real structure of individual's axiological orientations". The obtained experimental data indicate that the system of students' axiological orientations has a dynamic nature, and the formation of students' axiological orientations is one of the most important ways of solving the problem of training a specialist.

TI  - Geospatial probabilistic modelling for release area mapping of snow avalanches
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents GIS-based mapping of snow avalanche release areas using probabilistic occurrence ratio (POR) model. The proposed method utilized the topographical and avalanche occurrence dataset. The avalanche occurrence topographical factors such as slope, aspect, curvature and elevation generated from ASTER-GDEM V2 whereas vegetation cover from Landsat 8 OLI were considered in the proposed model. An avalanche inventory map of avalanche occurrence locations was prepared for training and validation of the model. From avalanche inventory map, 80% of avalanche occurrence data for training and remaining 20% was used for validation of the model. Finally, avalanche release area map was generated using the POR model and classified into five categories based on the Jenks natural break method. The R A -index and ROC-AUC methods were used for validation of the avalanche release area map. The validation accuracy of the model is confirmed as 92.41% and 89.13% as per success and prediction rates.

TI  - Classification Assessment of Real Versus Simulated Compact and Quad-Pol Modes of ALOS-2
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Compact polarimetry (CP) offers a tradeoff with fully polarimetric modes in terms of swath width, power budget, and polarimetric information content. In this letter, a classification comparison is made among real CP, simulated CP (SCP), and quad polarimetric (QP) data acquired from the L-band SAR system on board the ALOS-2 satellite. The Wishart supervised classification scheme is used to compare data modes over two regions of a mixed test site in India. The quantitative classification assessment indicates that the QP data have higher classification accuracy than any other polarimetric combinations for both regions. The comparative classification accuracy of real versus SCP data is different for the two regions. The overall accuracy of the real CP data is slightly higher similar to 1% than SCP for region 1, which is dominated by urban and rice classes, whereas it is lower by similar to 9% for the agricultural crop dominated region 2.

TI  - Farms or Forests? Understanding and Mapping Shifting Cultivation Using the Case Study of West Garo Hills, India
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Attempts to study shifting cultivation landscapes are fundamentally impeded by the difficulty in mapping and distinguishing shifting cultivation, settled farms and forests. There are foundational challenges in defining shifting cultivation and its constituent land-covers and land-uses, conceptualizing a suitable mapping framework, and identifying consequent methodological specifications. Our objective is to present a rigorous methodological framework and mapping protocol, couple it with extensive fieldwork and use them to undertake a two-season Landsat image analysis to map the forest-agriculture frontier of West Garo Hills district, Meghalaya, in Northeast India. We achieve an overall accuracy of similar to 80% and find that shifting cultivation is the most extensive land-use, followed by tree plantations and old-growth forest confined to only a few locations. We have also found that commercial plantation extent is positively correlated with shortened fallow periods and high land-use intensities. Our findings are in sharp contrast to various official reports and studies, including from the Forest Survey of India, the Wastelands Atlas of India and state government statistics that show the landscape as primarily forested with only small fractions under shifting cultivation, a consequence of the lack of clear definitions and poor understanding of what constitutes shifting cultivation and forest. Our results call for an attentive revision of India's official land-use mapping protocols, and have wider significance for remote sensing-based mapping in other shifting cultivation landscapes.

TI  - Estimation of Land Surface Temperature for the Western Tannu-Ola Range in the Tyva Republic
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat-8 wintertime satellite imagery is analyzed to map the land surface temperature for the Western Tannu-Ola Range located in the southwestern part of the Tyva Republic. The analysis of spectral characteristics of the landscape cover allowed identifying the altitudinal and zonal complexes. The result of satellite imagery processing for January 20 and 29, 2017 is presented in the form of the map of surface temperature for the vegetation (landscape) cover of the range. The land surface temperature map shows that the land surface is significantly cooled in January due to the Siberian High. The mapped January values of temperature varied from -13 to -36 degrees C. The map clearly demonstrates the temperature inversion in the mountain-hollow terrain as well as the edge of different-colored temperature shades corresponding to the vegetation of different altitudinal and zonal complexes. The mutual interference of temperature contours and the introduction of mountain steppes along the northern and southern macroslopes are typical of the altitudinal zonation caused by the mountain terrain.

AB  - KS is a 33-year-old Caucasian married woman who works full time as an accountant and has one daughter who is 2 years old. She enjoys reading and exercising in her spare time. She initially presented in July 2015 at the age of 31 years with a 1-cm breast mass in the left inner breast, which prompted a mammogram to be obtained. The mammogram revealed diffuse and occasionally grouped left breast calcifications. Additionally, there was focal edema at the site of the mass. A follow-up mammogram was recommended to document stability in 6 months, which demonstrated an interval increase in number and size of segmental pleomorphic calcifications in the lower inner breast spanning 6 cm in size. A stereotactic core needle biopsy was completed and revealed high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) that was estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive.SURGICAL TREATMENT: KS underwent genetic testing due to her young age at diagnosis of noninvasive breast cancer. She was tested with the breast/ovarian cancer panel, which was negative for mutation.She preceded to bilateral nipple-sparing mastectomy with left sentinel node biopsy and immediate implant reconstruction in February 2016. The operative pathology revealed 3.3 cm of high-grade DCIS. The surgical margins were negative (less than 1 mm posteriorly and less than 2 mm anteriorly). There was 1 sentinel node and 2 nonsentinel nodes negative for malignancy. The right breast was negative for cancer and both retro areolar margins were negative.KS did well during the ensuing routine follow-up every 6 to 12 months in surgical oncology at an academic medical center. She was not recommended to take adjuvant endocrine therapy given the benefit of bilateral mastectomy.In 2017, at a routine oncology follow-up visit, she expressed a desire to have more children. After a negative clinical exam, she and her husband were advised that future contraception may be pursued.PREGNANCY-ASSOCIATED BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS: KS was in her usual state of good health when she noticed a left breast mass in the inferior reconstructed breast in June 2017. She presented to the nurse practitioner (NP) in the surgical oncology clinic for evaluation. At that time, she was 17 weeks pregnant and being seen in the same facility for high-risk obstetrics and gynecology care. KS had no other concerning symptoms for recurrent cancer, and her pregnancy had been progressing smoothly.The surgical oncology NP noted a 1-cm firm superficial mass in the breast at 6 o'clock. She had no other bilateral breast findings or adenopathy. Upon review of systems, she denied new persistent headache, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, weight loss, night sweats, or fatigue.Due to her pregnancy and the superficial presentation of the breast mass, a left breast ultrasound was ordered. It revealed an 8-mm irregular hypoechoic mass 7 cm from the nipple at the 6 o'clock position in the reconstructed breast.A diagnostic workup ensued with a left breast ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy. KS was given a diagnosis of clinical stage T1b, N0, grade 2 invasive micropapillary carcinoma: ER positive (Allred 6), PR positive (Allred 8), HER2/neu, immunohistochemistry 3+, and fluorescence in situ hybridization amplified.After discussion of this recurrent cancer diagnosis, her team opted for a bilateral diagnostic mammogram (with abdominal shielding) and bilateral axillary and breast ultrasound to evaluate the contralateral breast and lymph nodes. There was no adenopathy, a small amount of accessory breast tissue in the right axillary tail region, and a biopsy clip was noted in the left inferior breast at 6 o'clock. The new cancer was not seen on mammogram, likely due to the proximity to the implant.

TI  - Exploring Influence of Sampling Strategies on Event-Based Landslide Susceptibility Modeling
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores two modeling issues that may cause uncertainty in landslide susceptibility assessments when different sampling strategies are employed. The first issue is that extracted attributes within a landslide inventory polygon can vary if the sample is obtained from different locations with diverse topographic conditions. The second issue is the mixing problem of landslide inventory that the detection of landslide areas from remotely-sensed data generally includes source and run-out features unless the run-out portion can be removed manually with auxiliary data. To this end, different statistical sampling strategies and the run-out influence on random forests (RF)-based landslide susceptibility modeling are explored for Typhoon Morakot in 2009 in southern Taiwan. To address the construction of models with an extremely high false alarm error or missing error, this study integrated cost-sensitive analysis with RF to adjust the decision boundary to achieve improvements. Experimental results indicate that, compared with a logistic regression model, RF with the hybrid sample strategy generally performs better, achieving over 80% and 0.7 for the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient, respectively, and higher accuracies can be obtained when the run-out is treated as an independent class or combined with a non-landslide class. Cost-sensitive analysis significantly improved the prediction accuracy from 5% to 10%. Therefore, run-out should be separated from the landslide source and labeled as an individual class when preparing a landslide inventory.

TI  - Estimation of forest cover in Ukrainian Polissia using classification of seasonal composite Landsat 8 OLI images
T2  - SYLWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Training dataset for modelling of forest cover was created after classification of multispectral satellite imagery IKONOS-2 with spatial resolution 3.2 m (acquisition date - 12.08.2011). As a result, we created binary forest cover map with 2 categories: 'forest' and 'not-forest'. That allowed us to compute the tree canopy cover for each pixel of Landsat 8 OLI, using vector grid with cell size of 30x30 m. Classification model was developed using training dataset that included 17,000 observations, 10,000 of them represented results of IKONOS-2 classification. Aiming to avoid errors of agricultural lands inclusion into forest mask because of lack of data, additionally we collected about 7000 random observations with canopy cover 0% that had been evenly distributed within unforested area. Random Forest (RF) model we developed allowed us to create continuous map of forests within study area that represents in each pixel value of tree canopy closeness (0-100%). To convert it into a discrete map, we recoded all values less than 30% as 'no data' and values from 30 to 100% as 1. Forest mask for two selected administrative districts of Chernihiv region (NE Ukraine) was created after screening map from small pixel groups that covered area less than 0.5 ha. Obtained results were compared with Global Forest Change (GFC) map and proved that GFC data can be used for forest mapping with tree canopy closeness threshold 40%. On considerable areas of abandoned agricultural lands in the analysed regions of Ukraine, forest stands are formed by Scots pine, silver birch, black alder and aspen. Existence of such forests substantially increases (on 6-8%) the forested area of Gorodnya and Snovsk districts of Chernihiv region - comparing to official forest inventory data. However, such stands are not protected and have high risks to be severed by wildfires, illegal cuttings with aim to renew the agricultural production, by diseases, insects and other natural disturbances.

TI  - A multi-temporal phenology based classification approach for Crop Monitoring in Kenya
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The SBAM (Satellite Based Agricultural Monitoring) project, funded by the Italian Space Agency aims at: developing a validated satellite imagery based method for estimating and updating the agricultural areas in the region of Central-Africa; implementing an automated process chain capable of providing periodical agricultural land cover maps of the area of interest and, possibly, an estimate of the crop yield. The project aims at filling the gap existing in the availability of high spatial resolution maps of the agricultural areas of Kenya. A high spatial resolution land cover map of Central-Eastern Africa including Kenya was compiled in the year 2000 in the framework of the Africover project using Landsat images acquired, mostly, in 1995. We investigated the use of phenological information in supporting the use of remotely sensed images for crop classification and monitoring based on Landsat 8 and, in the near future, Sentinel 2 imagery. Phenological information on crop condition was collected using time series of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) based on Landsat 8 images. Kenyan countryside is mainly characterized by a high number of fragmented small and medium size farmlands that dramatically increase the difficulty in classification; 30 m spatial resolution images are not enough for a proper classification of such areas. So, a pan-sharpening FIHS (Fast Intensity Hue Saturation) technique was implemented to increase image resolution from 30 m to 15 m. Ground test sites were selected, searching for agricultural vegetated areas from which phenological information was extracted. Therefore, the classification of agricultural areas is based on crop phenology, vegetation index behaviour retrieved from a time series of satellite images and on AEZ (Agro Ecological Zones) information made available by FAO (FAO, 1996) for the area of interest. This paper presents the results of the proposed classification procedure in comparison with land cover maps produced in the past years by other projects. The results refer to the Nakuru County and they were validated using field campaigns data. It showed a satisfactory overall accuracy of 92.66 % which is a significant improvement with respect to previous land cover maps.

TI  - Coupled Biospheric Synchrony of the Coastal Temperate Ecosystem in Northern Patagonia: A Remote Sensing Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last century, climate change has impacted the physiology, distribution, and phenology of marine and terrestrial primary producers worldwide. The study of these fluctuations has been hindered due to the complex response of plants to environmental forcing over large spatial and temporal scales. To bridge this gap, we investigated the synchrony in seasonal phenological activity between marine and terrestrial primary producers to environmental and climatic variability across northern Patagonia. We disentangled the effects on the biological activity of local processes using advanced time-frequency analysis and partial wavelet coherence on 15 years (2003-2017) of data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) onboard the Terra and Aqua satellites and global climatic variability using large-scale climate indices. Our results show that periodic variations in both coastal ocean and land productivity are associated with sea surface temperature forcing over seasonal scales and with climatic forcing over multi-annual (2-4 years) modes. These complex relationships indicate that large-scale climatic processes primarily modulate the synchronous phenological seasonal activity across northern Patagonia, which makes these unique ecosystems highly exposed to future climatic change.

TI  - Normalization method for multi-sensor high spatial and temporal resolution satellite imagery with radiometric inconsistencies
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Distributed systems of small satellites are generating a new type of remote sensing data: multi-spectral data with high spatial and temporal resolution and near-daily global coverage, This data is proving to be valuable for monitoring land cover change. However, in order to achieve widespread application for this purpose, all satellites in the distributed system, or constellation, must acquire imagery with accurate georeferencing and consistent radiometric properties. In this research, we developed a method to automatically co-register and radiometrically normalize a temporally dense series of smallsat images using geocorrected reference imagery. To demonstrate the approach, we normalized a smallsat image time series at both the pixel and the polygon level, smoothing spectral indices through time to detect both abrupt and gradual changes. Using PlanetScope imagery, we tested these methods in a forested region of British Columbia, Canada heavily impacted by forest fires in 2017. By examining the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the acquired imagery before and after the fires, we found that this method allowed simple identification of burned and unburned areas, which was not readily possible without applying the normalization method. Our result suggests that the developed approach can help fully exploit remote sensing datasets that have high spatial resolution and are acquired with high frequency but potentially contain radiometric inconsistencies in order to quickly identify land cover changes.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma: A series of seven cases
T2  - ARCHIVES OF PLASTIC SURGERY-APS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine malignancy affecting the skin, for which timely diagnosis and aggressive treatment are essential. MCC has most often been reported in Caucasians, and case reports in Asians are rare. This study presents our experiences with the surgical treatment and radiotherapy of MCC in Asian patients.Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of seven MCC patients between 2000 and 2018 from a single institution, and analyzed patient characteristics, tumor characteristics, surgical treatment, sentinel lymph node evaluation, reconstruction, adjuvant radiation therapy, and prognosis.Results Eight MCC lesions occurred in seven patients, most commonly in the head and neck region. All patients underwent surgical excision with reconstruction. The final surgical margin was 1.0 cm in most cases, and reconstruction was most commonly performed with a split-thickness skin graft. Five patients received adjuvant radiotherapy, and two patients received sentinel lymph node biopsy. During the follow-up period, three patients remained well, two died from other causes, one experienced recurrence, and one was lost to follow-up.Conclusions We treated seven Asian MCC patients and our series confirmed that MCC is a very dangerous cancer in Asians as well. Based on our experiences, thorough surgical excision of MCC with histopathological clearance should be considered, with sentinel lymph node evaluation if necessary, followed by appropriate reconstruction and careful postoperative observation. Adjuvant radiation therapy is also recommended for all Asian MCC patients. The results of this case series may provide guidance for the treatment of Asian MCC patients in the future.

TI  - Ship Detection Based on Complex Signal Kurtosis in Single-Channel SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown that complex information in single-channel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery has practically always been underrated. This improves the perception of their potential for ocean monitoring. Based on the in-depth interpretation of complex signal kurtosis (CSK), this paper proposes a new ship detection method based on CSK in single-channel SAR imagery. The proposed method consists of two main parts, i.e., region proposal and target identification. The basic idea is to first detect potential ship locations based on the region proposal. Then, the final ship target is acquired based on the target identification. Compared to conventional methods based on detected products, e.g., the constant false alarm rate (CFAR), the proposed method has three advantages. First, CSK can take advantage of both non-Gaussianity and noncircularity, which is the fundamental concept distinguishing complex signal analysis from the real case. Second, the proposed method can be intrinsically free of false alarms caused by radio frequency interference (RFI). Finally, the proposed method can avoid missing detection in dense target situations. This methodology has been demonstrated over significant data sets acquired from Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X, and Gaofen-3. These results validate that CSK is a vital indicator of ship detection. Complex information is expected to play a more important role in single-channel SAR imagery.

TI  - Characterization and Distribution of Seagrass Habitats in a Caribbean Nature Reserve using High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Field Sampling
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective management of seagrass habitats requires detailed information about seagrass condition and distribution. This paper addresses the first step of a larger study to assess long-term changes in seagrass distribution within Caja de Muertos Island Nature Reserve, Puerto Rico. A high-spatial-resolution characterization of seagrass beds in the reserve was conducted using a WorldView-2 (WV-2) image and field data set. The WV-2-derived seafloor reflectance and bathymetry data were used to conduct an object-based image analysis (OBIA). The selection of bands for this analysis was based on in situ spectral water attenuation measurements. The resulting polygons of the OBIA were classified through a supervised classification and contextual editing. Calibration and validation of the image were conducted using 164 sampling sites. Together with traditional accuracy assessment tools, a reliability map was created to provide another metric for evaluating the map accuracy. Overall accuracy was 96.59%, and the total seagrass accuracy was 100%. Seagrass beds were found mainly west and north of the island and were mostly composed of a combination of Thalassia testudinum and Syringodium filiforme. Results suggested that light availability was not a limiting factor for seagrass colonization at the study area and that strong wave energy may be an important factor in regulating seagrass distribution. This seagrass habitat map improved upon previous mapping efforts and represents the first high-spatial-resolution map for the reserve. The data and methods used proved to be effective for mapping seagrass habitats within a highly complex benthic environment.

TI  - A Parametric Approach to Unmixing Remote Sensing Crop Growth Signatures
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are often measured or reported over wide spatial footprints with heterogeneous ground cover. Different types of vegetation, however, have unique signatures that evolve throughout the growing season. Without additional information, signals corresponding to individual vegetation types are unidentifiable from satellite measurements. In this paper, we propose a parametric mixture model to describe satellite data monitoring crop development in the US Corn Belt. The ground cover of each satellite footprint is primarily a mixture of corn and soybean. Using auxiliary data from multiple sources, we model the aggregate satellite signal, and identify the signatures of individual crop types, using nonlinear parametric functions. Estimation is performed using a Bayesian approach, and information from auxiliary data is incorporated into the prior distributions to identify distinct crop types. We demonstrate our parametric unmixing approach using data from the European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. Lastly, we compare our model estimates for the timing of key crop phenological stages to USDA ground-based estimates. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.

TI  - Aggregated Deep Fisher Feature for VHR Remote Sensing Scene Classification
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of very high resolution satellite image acquisition technology, remote sensing scene classification has become an important and challenging task. In this article, aiming at tackling this task, we propose a hybrid architecture, i.e., aggregated deep Fisher feature (ADFF), which can make full use of deep convolutional features' rich semantic information and unsupervised encoding's high robustness. Unlike the previous methods, we first explore the optimal encoding layer in the pretraining CNN model, which naturally fuses the local and global image information in a novel way, making the ability of semantic acquisition further enhanced. ADFF can learn more suitable internal features from the remote sensing data, boosting the final performance. We evaluate our algorithm based on several public datasets, and the results show that our approach achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed ADFF obtains average classification accuracy of 98.81%, 95.21%, 86.01%, and 88.79%, respectively, on the UC Merced Land-Use, RSSCN7, NWPU-RESISC45 (10% for training), and NWPU-RESISC45 (20% for training) datasets.

TI  - Influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality in China, 2010-15: a population-based study
T2  - LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The estimation of influenza-associated excess mortality in countries can help to improve estimates of the global mortality burden attributable to influenza virus infections. We did a study to estimate the influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality in mainland China for the 2010-11 through 2014-15 seasons.Methods We obtained provincial weekly influenza surveillance data and population mortality data for 161 disease surveillance points in 31 provinces in mainland China from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention for the years 2005-15. Disease surveillance points with an annual average mortality rate of less than 0.4% between 2005 and 2015 or an annual mortality rate of less than 0.3% in any given years were excluded. We extracted data for respiratory deaths based on codes J00-J99 under the tenth edition of the International Classification of Diseases. Data on respiratory mortality and population were stratified by age group (age <60 years and z60 years) and aggregated by province. The overall annual population data of each province and national annual respiratory mortality data were compiled from the China Statistical Yearbook. Influenza surveillance data on weekly proportion of samples testing positive for influenza virus by type or subtype for 31 provinces were extracted from the National Sentinel Hospital-based Influenza Surveillance Network. We estimated influenza-associated excess respiratory mortality rates between the 2010-11 and 2014-15 seasons for 22 provinces with valid data in the country using linear regression models. Extrapolation of excess respiratory mortality rates was done using random-effect meta-regression models for nine provinces without valid data for a direct estimation of the rates.Findings We fitted the linear regression model with the data from 22 of 31 provinces in mainland China, representing 83.0% of the total population. We estimated that an annual mean of 88 100 (95% CI 84 200-92 000) influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths occurred in China in the 5 years studied, corresponding to 8.2% (95% CI 7.9-8.6) of respiratory deaths. The mean excess respiratory mortality rates per 100 000 person-seasons for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses were 1.6 (95% CI 1.5-1.7), 2.6 (2.4-2.8), and 2.3 (2.1-2.5), respectively. Estimated excess respiratory mortality rates per 100 000 person-seasons were 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-1.9) for individuals younger than 60 years and 38.5 (36.8-40.2) for individuals aged 60 years or older. Approximately 71 000 (95% CI 67 800-74 100) influenza-associated excess respiratory deaths occurred in individuals aged 60 years or older, corresponding to 80% of such deaths.Interpretation Influenza was associated with substantial excess respiratory mortality in China between 2010-11 and 2014-15 seasons, especially in older adults aged at least 60 years. Continuous and high-quality surveillance data across China are needed to improve the estimation of the disease burden attributable to influenza and the best public health interventions are needed to curb this burden.

TI  - Analysis of deformation characteristics for a reservoir landslide before and after impoundment by multiple D-InSAR observations at Jinshajiang River, China
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The stability of reservoir bank slopes is always of great concern in hydropower construction. After impounding, some unstable slopes may fail, leading to landslides with significant displacements. This work investigated the vertical and horizontal displacements of the Yizicun landslide before and after impoundment of the Xiluodu Reservoir on the Jinshajiang River, southwestern China using InSAR technique and data from ALOS PAL-SAR, ENVISAT-ASAR, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1. The purpose was to explore the relationships between the ground surface deformation and the landslide movement mode, and to make further analysis on its deformation characteristics. Combining with field investigations, the analysis of InSAR reveals that the Yizicun landslide was a push type before impoundment and is a pull type after impoundment. This landslide is largely a whole slump with multiple slip surfaces. After the impoundment of the reservoir, the landslide boundary had a tendency to spread, and its rear edge has extended backward about 20 m. More fissures and secondary landslides appeared on the southern boundary than those in the north. The horizontal movement changed from southwestward to westward, and the vertical deformation increased. The current stability of the landslide might be subjected to a combined action of ground water levels and precipitation intensity. The study also indicates that InSAR has many inimitable advantages in the study of reservoir landslides, such as backtracking for stability of bank slopes before impounding, three-dimensional monitoring of active areas, landslide movement mode analysis and so on. Thus, it is a suitable method to efficiently analyze landslide deformation characteristics before and after reservoir impoundment, which is of great significant for detecting and monitoring reservoir landslides.

M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review This review aimed to introduce the regulations management and current situations of drug safety evaluation in China.Recent Findings The nationwide implementation of good laboratory practice and good clinical practice guarantees the quality of pre-marketing drug safety evaluation. In recent years, post-marketing drug safety monitoring is changing from passive mode to the combination of active and passive monitoring. A national adverse drug reaction monitoring sentinel alliance has been created to actively identify, report, and evaluate adverse reactions, with more than 1.4 million cases reported in 2017. But the quality of the reports is not optimal, with few reports from drug manufacturers, low rate of severe reports, and trend of lag reporting.Summary Drug safety evaluation in China is transitioning from passive monitoring to a combination mode. Drug pharmacovigilance is a powerful tool for active monitoring, but participation by drug manufacturers would be essential to an effective drug safety evaluation system.

TI  - Classification of Mangrove Species Using Combined WordView-3 and LiDAR Data in Mai Po Nature Reserve, Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have significant social, economic, environmental, and ecological values but they are under threat due to human activities. An accurate map of mangrove species distribution is required to effectively conserve mangrove ecosystem. This study evaluates the synergy of WorldView-3 (WV-3) spectral bands and high return density LiDAR-derived elevation metrics for classifying seven species in mangrove habitat in Mai Po Nature Reserve in Hong Kong, China. A recursive feature elimination algorithm was carried out to identify important spectral bands and LiDAR (Airborne Light Detection and Ranging) metrics whilst appropriate spatial resolution for pixel-based classification was investigated for discriminating different mangrove species. Two classifiers, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) were compared. The results indicated that the combination of 2 m resolution WV-3 and LiDAR data yielded the best overall accuracy of 0.88 by SVM classifier comparing with WV-3 (0.72) and LiDAR (0.79). Important features were identified as green (510-581 nm), red edge (705-745 nm), red (630-690 nm), yellow (585-625 nm), NIR (770-895 nm) bands of WV-3, and LiDAR metrics relevant to canopy height (e.g., canopy height model), canopy shape (e.g., canopy relief ratio), and the variation of height (e.g., variation and standard deviation of height). LiDAR features contributed more information than spectral features. The significance of this study is that a mangrove species distribution map with satisfactory accuracy can be acquired by the proposed classification scheme. Meanwhile, with LiDAR data, vertical stratification of mangrove forests in Mai Po was firstly mapped, which is significant to bio-parameter estimation and ecosystem service evaluation in future studies.

TI  - A Method for the Destriping of an Orbita Hyperspectral Image with Adaptive Moment Matching and Unidirectional Total Variation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orbita hyperspectral satellite (OHS) is the first hyperspectral satellite with surface coating technology for sensors in the world. It includes 32 bands from visible to near-infrared wavelengths. However, technology such as the fabricating process of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors makes the image contain a lot of random and unsystematic stripe noise, which is so bad that it seriously affects visual interpretation, object recognition and the application of the OHS data. Although a large number of stripe removal algorithms have been proposed, very few of them take into account the characteristics of OHS sensors and analyze the causes of OHS data noise. In this paper, we propose a destriping algorithm for OHS data. Firstly, we use both the adaptive moment matching method and multi-level unidirectional total variation method to remove stripes. Then a model based on piecewise linear least squares fitting is proposed to restore the vertical details lost in the first step. Moreover, we further utilize the spectral information of the OHS image, and extend our 2-D destriping method to the 3-D case. Results demonstrate that the proposed method provides the optimal destriping result on both qualitative and quantitative assessments. Moreover, the experimental results show that our method is superior to the existing single-band and multispectral destriping methods. Also, we further use the algorithm to the stripe noise removal of other real remote sensing images, and excellent image quality is obtained, which proves the universality of the algorithm.

TI  - Studying the Impact on Urban Health over the Greater Delta Region in Egypt Due to Aerosol Variability Using Optical Characteristics from Satellite Observations and Ground-Based AERONET Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This research addresses the aerosol characteristics and variability over Cairo and the Greater Delta region over the last 20 years using an integrative multi-sensor approach of remotely sensed and PM10 ground data. The accuracy of these satellite aerosol products is also evaluated and compared through cross-validation against ground observations from the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) project measured at local stations. The results show the validity of using Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on the Terra and Aqua platforms for quantitative aerosol optical depth (AOD) assessment as compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), and POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER). In addition, extracted MISR-based aerosol products have been proven to be quite effective in investigating the characteristics of mixed aerosols. Daily AERONET AOD observations were collected and classified using K-means unsupervised machine learning algorithms, showing five typical patterns of aerosols in the region under investigation. Four seasonal aerosol emerging episodes are identified and analyzed using multiple indicators, including aerosol optical depth (AOD), size distribution, single scattering albedo (SSA), and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE). The movements and detailed aerosol composition of the aforementioned episodes are demonstrated using NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) back trajectories model in collaboration with aerosol subtype products from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) mission. These episodes indicate that during the spring, fall, and summer, most of the severe aerosol events are caused by dust or mixed related scenarios, whereas during winter, aerosols of finer size lead to severe heavy conditions. It also demonstrates the impacts of different aerosol sources on urban human health, which are presented by the variations of multiple parameters, including solar radiation, air temperature, humidity, and UV exposure. Scarce ground PM10 data were collected and compared against satellite products, yet owed to their discrete nature of availability, our approach made use of the Random Decision Forest (RDF) model to convert satellite-based AOD and other meteorological parameters to predict PM10. The RDF model with inputs from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications version 2 (MERRA-2) and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) datasets improves the performance of using AOD products to estimate PM10 values. The connection between climate variability and aerosol intensity, as well as their impact on health-related PM2.5 over Egypt is also demonstrated.

TI  - Monitoring Trace Gases over the Antarctic Using Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral Sounder Onboard GaoFen-5: Algorithm Description and First Retrieval Results of O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and HCl
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - AIUS (Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral Sounder) is an infrared occultation spectrometer onboard the Chinese GaoFen-5 satellite, which covers a spectral range of 2.4-13.3 mu m (750-4100 cm(-1)) with a spectral resolution of about 0.02 cm(-1). AIUS was designed to measure and to study the chemical processes of ozone (O-3) and other trace gases in the upper troposphere and stratosphere over the Antarctic. In this study, the AIUS retrieval methodology is described. A comparison between AIUS measurements and simulated spectra illustrates that AIUS measurements agree well with the simulated spectra. To first evaluate the reliability of the AIUS retrieval algorithm, three retrieval O-3 experiments were performed based on ACE-FTS (Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier transform spectrometer) observed spectra. A comparison with the ACE-FTS official products shows that the relative difference of these three retrieval experiments was mostly within 10% between 20 and 70 km. These retrieval experiments demonstrate that the retrieval algorithm described in this study provided reliable results and reliably. Furthermore, O-3, H2O, and HCl profiles were retrieved from 24 orbits of AIUS measurements and compared with the official Aura /MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) level-2 v4.2 profiles. The relative difference was mostly within 10% (about 0.02-0.4 ppm) between 18 and 58 km for the O-3 retrieval, within 10% (0-0.5 ppm) between 15 and 80 km for the H2O retrieval, and within 10% (about 0.1 ppb) between 30 and 60 km for the HCl retrieval. A good agreement in the retrieved trace gas profiles was reached between AIUS and MLS.

TI  - Potential influence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on phytoplankton primary productivity in the northern Gulf of Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nine years after the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill (20 April-15 July 2010), the recovery of primary productivity at the ocean surface remains to be investigated. Here, we used the normalized fluorescence line height (nFLH) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer as an indicator of chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a). First, from the spatiotemporal variations of nFLH between 2001 and 2017, a reduction of nFLH after the DwH oil spill was observed (for a relatively long period, from 2011 to 2014). Second, a stepwise multiple regression model was used to examine which of the following environmental factors could explain the annual variations in nFLH: river discharge, total nitrogen load, total phosphorus load, photosynthetically available radiation, sea surface temperature and wind speed. Results show that river discharge, sea surface temperature and wind speed are the primary factors that regulated the annual nFLH variations in the DwH area during the pre-spill years. In contrast, this same model could not explain the reduction of nFLH for the four years after the DwH oil spill. After 2015, nFLH appears to have resumed to the pre-spill concentrations. Here we suggest that the nFLH reduction between 2011 and 2014 could have originated from the DwH oil spill, although the exact mechanism is yet to be determined.

TI  - Wavelength Nonlinearity of Multi-Channel Solar Spectrometer with Common Grating Rotating Axis
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF LASERS-ZHONGGUO JIGUANG
M3  - Article
AB  - To improve the wavelength calibration accuracy of multi-channel grating scanning spectrometers, the principle of linear wavelength scanning of traditional single-channel grating spectrometers is first introduced. Then, the theoretical nonlinear relationship between the spectrometer's output wavelength and the moving distance of the lead screw is derived based on the common grating axis error. Given the nonlinear relationship, wavelength calibration of a prototype of Fengyun-3 solar irradiance spectrometer is performed. The results demonstrate that the calibration accuracy of the traditional calibration is 0.08 nm, and the calibration accuracy is increased to 0.03 nm by using the wavelength nonlinear formula. This result satisfies the requirements of the instrument's specifications. Thus, the wavelength nonlinear relationship of a multi-channel grating scanning spectrometer is verified.

TI  - Ionospheric Correction of InSAR Time Series Analysis of C-band Sentinel-1 TOPS Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Copernicus Sentinel-1A/B satellites operating at C-band in terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode bring unprecedented opportunities for measuring large-scale tectonic motions using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). Although the ionospheric effects are only about one-sixteenth of those at L-band, the measurement accuracy might still be degraded by long-wavelength signals due to the ionosphere. We implement the range split-spectrum method for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR with C-band Sentinel-1 TOPS data. We perform InSAR time series analysis and evaluate these ionospheric effects using data acquired on both ascending (dusk-side of the Sentinel-1 dawn-dusk orbit) and descending (dawn-side) tracks over representative midlatitude and low-latitude (geomagnetic latitude) areas. We find that the ionospheric effects are very strong for data acquired at low latitudes on ascending tracks. For other cases, ionospheric effects are not strong or even negligible. The application of the range split-spectrum method, despite some implementation challenges, largely removes ionospheric effects, and thus improves the InSAR time series analysis results.

TI  - Does Deforestation Trigger Severe Flood Damage at Hoeryeong City in North Korea?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - North Korea has suffered flood damage every year since 1995. It is assumed that this damage is linked to deforestation. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of deforestation on the occurrence of floods in North Korea using spatial statistical techniques. The research was conducted at Hoeryeong City, which experienced disastrous flooding in 2016. A land-use change map was produced using two Landsat data sets from 1977 and 2016. The flood-damaged areas map, landform map, and the distance from the nearest stream map were also used in the spatial statistical analysis. In the deforestation zone, area of soil loss over 200 tons/yr increased by 14 km(2) (16.6%), while that under 50 tons/yr decreased by 25 km(2) (29.3%). In addition, the land-use change, runoff coefficient, and peak time runoff increased from 0.31 to 0.46, 56.3 mm/hr to 60.8 mm/hr, and 128.2 m(3)/sec to 206.6 m(3)/sec, respectively. Also, spatial statistical analysis results showed that land-use change was concluded to strongly affect the occurrence of floods. In conclusion, deforestation at Hoeryeong City contributed to severe flooding due to changes in land-use policy. The results of this study will help decision makers to establish the North Korean forest restoration policy and countermeasures against flood damage.

TI  - Effect of dust deposition on spectrum-based estimation of leaf water content in urban plant
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral technology has equipped large-scale efforts to estimate leaf water content. In an urban environmental context, these efforts may be hampered by dust deposition on leaves. However, the influence of dust deposition on the accuracy of estimating water content is still to be elucidated. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the influence of dust deposition on the spectrum-based estimation of water content in Shanghai, China. We measured the amount of dust deposition, water content, and the spectrum of 707 sample leaves. We then derived the spectrum-based indexes of water content and assessed the influence of dust deposition on the performance of such indexes in estimating leaf water content. The results revealed that dust-polluted leaves retained the correlations between the observed water content indexes, which includes Equivalent Water Thickness (EWT) and Fuel Water Content (FWC), with spectrum-based indexes. However, these correlation coefficients dramatically varied with the changes in dust deposition amount. EWT had weaker while FWC got stronger correlation coefficients with spectral indexes for dusty leaves compared with clean cases. The spectral indexes were correlated with EWT at a consistently stronger extent than with FWC, suggesting an advantage of using EWT over FWC to represent the leaf water content. The correlations between EWT and spectral indexes were stronger with leaf samples from the same tree species compared with the case of using leaf samples from mixed species. These findings can strengthen the understanding of the influence of dust pollution on leaf water content estimation using spectral indexes.

M3  - Comparative Study
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In the surgical treatment of breast cancer, "de-escalating" is becoming more popular, especially in the treatment of axilla. Axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy has become a routine treatment for axillary-negative breast cancer patients because it can effectively reduce the occurrence of upper limb lymphedema, so that some patients with sentinel lymph node negative can be exempted from axillary lymph node dissection. However, in recent years, several international clinical studies, such as AMAROS trial, explored the use of radiotherapy instead of dissection when 1 to 2 sentinel lymph nodes were positive. The results showed that radiotherapy can reduce the incidence of upper limb edema by nearly 50% compared with dissection. How to interpret the results of such non-inferiority studies, and how to treat the impact of axillary dissection and axillary radiotherapy on the occurrence of lymphedema? Based on the review of literature in recent 10 years, the incidence and hazard ratio of edema related to the two axillary treatments were compared. The conclusion is the hazard ratios are close to each other, around 3 for both arms. The results of clinical studies such as radiotherapy instead of axillary dissection need to be carefully interpreted. At the same time, axillary dissection is still suitable for some patients at current stage, and the corresponding prevention of upper limb lymphedema still needs attention.
AB  - 乳腺癌外科治疗尤其是腋窝处理方式中的"减法"理念日益获得关注和实践。腋窝前哨淋巴结活检因可有效降低上肢淋巴水肿的发生，成为临床腋窝阴性乳腺癌患者的常规处理方式，部分前哨淋巴结阴性的患者得以免除腋窝淋巴结清扫。近年来几项国际临床研究聚焦于当前哨淋巴结1~2枚阳性时以放疗代替清扫，结果显示，放疗相较于清扫可以将上肢水肿发生率降低近50%。为了理性解读上述非劣效性研究结果，正确看待腋窝淋巴结清扫和腋窝放疗对上肢淋巴水肿发生的影响，本文在复习近10年来相关文献的基础上，比较分析了两种腋窝处理方式的水肿发生率及风险比，结果显示二者接近，风险比约为3。对于以放疗取代腋窝淋巴结清扫的临床研究结果尚需审慎解读。腋窝淋巴结清扫在现阶段依然适用于部分患者，相应的上肢淋巴水肿的预防也依然需要给予关注。.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variability of Glacier Surface Velocities and Outlet Areas on James Ross Island, Northern Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern Antarctic Peninsula was affected by a significant warming over the second half of the 20th century and the collapse of several ice shelves. Local climate conditions on James Ross Island on the northeastern coast can differ strongly from the main part of the Antarctic Peninsula. This paper reports the spatial and temporal variability of glacier surface velocities and the area of their outlets throughout James Ross Island, and evaluates potential relationships with atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Velocity estimates were retrieved from intensity feature tracking of scenes from satellite synthetic aperture radar sensors TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X between 2014 and 2018, which were validated against ground observations. Calving front positions back to 1945 were used to calculate outlet area changes for the glaciers by using a common-box approach. The annual recession rates of almost all investigated glacier calving fronts decelerated for the time periods 2009-2014 and 2014-2018 in comparison to the period 1988-2009, but their velocity patterns differed. Analysis of atmospheric conditions failed to explain the different patterns in velocity and area changes. We suggest a strong influence from local bathymetric conditions. Future investigations of the oceanic conditions would be necessary for a profound understanding of the super-position of different influencing factors.

AB  - Clinical staging is important for determining the extent of disease in animals with malignant cancers. The status of the lymph node will help determine whether adjuvant treatment is indicated. Historically, the regional anatomic lymph node has been sampled to determine the presence or absence of metastatic disease, but there is increasing evidence that the regional anatomic lymph node is often different to the sentinel lymph node. As a result, several sentinel lymph node mapping techniques have been described for more accurate clinical staging of oncologic patients.

AB  - In this study the structural changes of fores t fragments greater than 1km(2) located in the northern portion of the Belem Endemism Center (CEB) area were evaluated. Data were obtained from orbital images of the Landsat 5 and 8 satellite from 1985 and 2018 and seven landscape analysis indices were applied to the FRAGSTATS v. 4.2. Size, shape and proximity of the fragments were considered. The result of the temporal analysis showed that, during this period, there was an increase in the number (quantity) of fragments, reduction in the average size of the total area of the fragments, and a significant reduction of aggregation promoting the increase in the fragmentation level that may affect the fragmentation maintenance of local biodiversity, as it refers to the decrease in the amount of total habitat area in the study area landscape.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this paper were to develop, evaluate and apply the remote sensing based on models of ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N) and total phosphorus (TP) for the Yi and Shu River in Linyi Economic Development Zone, Shandong Province, China. The scenes of Landsat-8 OLI satellite data were used to establish the relationship between the planetary reflectance and the measured data for five years (i.e., 2014-2017). The five spectral bands (i.e., Coastal, Blue, Green, Red, NIR) were used to obtain the most suitable modeling factor from the different band combinations. The liner regression analysis showed that red band both had highest correlation with NH3-N and TP in Yi and Shu River. For the Yi River, the co-efficient of determination (R-2) of red band was 0.541 for the NH3-N model and 0.498 for the TP model. For the Shu River, the co-efficient of determination (R-2) of red band was 0.643 for the NH3-N model and 0.565 for the TP model. The best-fit Models were validated with measured data and found that the errors of the NH3-N and TP models of the Yi River were 34.93% and 29.33%, respectively, and while 33.66% and 32.48% for the Shu River. With the models, the distribution diagrams of NH3-N and TP were generated, which can be assisted analysis of spatial and temporal for Yi and Shu River. The results showed that the established models could indicate the trend of NH3-N and TP in rivers that was validated by field visit. The proposed approach in this paper has satisfactory validity and practicability, thus could be reference for study on NH3-N and TP in water based on remote sensing.

TI  - 3DOF Adaptive Line-Of-Sight Based Proportional Guidance Law for Path Following of AUV in the Presence of Ocean Currents
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to achieve high-precision path following of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in the horizontal plane, a three degrees-of-freedom adaptive line-of-sight based proportional (3DOFAPLOS) guidance law is proposed. Firstly, the path point coordinate system is introduced, which is suitable for the conversion of an arbitrary path. Then, the appropriate look-ahead distance is obtained by an improved adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) according to three degrees-of-freedom (3DOF), including the cross-track error, the curvature of reference path, and the forward speed. Moreover, combining three degrees-of-freedom ALOS (3DOFALOS) with proportional guidance law, the desired heading is calculated considering the drift angle. 3DOFAPLOS has two functions: in the convergence stage, 3DOFALOS plays a leading role, making AUV converge to the path more quickly and smoothly. In the guidance stage, proportional guidance law plays a major role in effectively resisting the influence of drift angle and making AUV sail along the reference path. If the path is curved, 3DOFALOS makes contributions in both stages, adjusting look-ahead distance in real time with respect to curvature. The stability of the designed closed system is proved by Lyapunov theory. Both simulation and experiment results have verified that 3DOFAPLOS has a satisfactory result, which improves tracking performance more than 50% compared with the traditional line-of-sight (LOS). Specifically, the mean average error (MAE) of path following under 3DOFAPLOS can be reduced by about 60%, and the root mean square error (RMSE) can be reduced by about 50% compared with LOS.

TI  - DYNAMICS OF VEGETATION INDEX IN ARID DESERT REGION OF NORTHWEST CHINA USING ON MODIS DATA
T2  - BANGLADESH JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Arid desert grassland in Northwest China is an important ecological barrier and animal husbandry production base in the western frontier regions of China. Analysis of the temporal and spatial dynamics of vegetation growth under certain climatic conditions is of great significance for the analysis of regional ecological changes and vegetation succession processes. In order to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamic processes of different vegetation growth and the main factors of vegetation growth in the arid desert areas of China, the 250-meter resolution vegetation index MOD13A1 data product obtained by medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) was used to study the temporal and spatial variations of NDVI from 2000 to 2016 in typical arid desert in Northwest China. The results showed that seasonal and interannual variations in vegetation growth can cause seasonal and interannual synchronized changes in NDVI. Overall, the typical desert steppe vegetation showed a degraded trend in the past 17 years. The most important climatic factors affecting NDVI changes within each year were precipitation and temperature. Precipitation conditions were the main factors affecting the interannual volatility of NDVI. Precipitation and mean temperature were more correlated with NDVI during the whole growth period (May to September) than during other growth periods. The comprehensive analysis of meteorological data such as temperature and precipitation show that the climate change in the region was relatively small in the past 17 years, but it was generally becoming colder and drier, which were not conducive to vegetation growth and ecological environment improvement. It was necessary to strengthen the management and protection of desert grassland in this area and formulate a scientific and efficient Water-grass-livestock utilization system.

TI  - Hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimates from a Geostationary Satellite Based on an Ensemble Learning Algorithm and Their Spatiotemporal Patterns over Central East China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depths (AODs) have been widely used to estimate surface fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations over areas that do not have PM2.5 monitoring sites. To date, most studies have focused on estimating daily PM2.5 concentrations using polar-orbiting satellite data (e.g., from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), which are inadequate for understanding the evolution of PM2.5 distributions. This study estimates hourly PM2.5 concentrations from Himawari AOD and meteorological parameters using an ensemble learning model. We analyzed the spatial agglomeration patterns of the estimated PM2.5 concentrations over central East China. The estimated PM2.5 concentrations agree well with ground-based data with an overall cross-validated coefficient of determination of 0.86 and a root-mean-square error of 17.3 mu g m(-3). Satellite-estimated PM2.5 concentrations over central East China display a north-to-south decreasing gradient with the highest concentration in winter and the lowest concentration in summer. Diurnally, concentrations are higher in the morning and lower in the afternoon. PM2.5 concentrations exhibit a significant spatial agglomeration effect in central East China. The errors in AOD do not necessarily affect the retrieval accuracy of PM2.5 proportionally, especially if the error is systematic. High-frequency spatiotemporal PM2.5 variations can improve our understanding of the formation and transportation processes of regional pollution episodes.

TI  - Climate Change Made Major Contributions to Soil Water Storage Decline in the Southwestern US during 2003-2014
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water shortage is a critical issue for the Southwest US (SWUS), the typical arid region that has experienced severe droughts over the past decades, primarily caused by climate change. However, it is still not quantitatively understood how soil water storage in the SWUS is affected by climate change. We integrated the time-series data of water storage and evapotranspiration derived from satellite data, societal water consumption, and meteorological data to quantify soil water storage changes and their climate change impacts across the SWUS from 2003 to 2014. The water storage decline was found across the entire SWUS, with a significant reduction in 98.5% of the study area during the study period. The largest water storage decline occurred in the southeastern portion, while only a slight decline occurred in the western and southwestern portions of the SWUS. Net atmospheric water input could explain 38% of the interannual variation of water storage variation. The climate-change-induced decreases in net atmospheric water input predominately controlled the water storage decline in 60% of the SWUS (primarily in Texas, Eastern New Mexico, Eastern Arizona, and Oklahoma) and made a partial contribution in approximately 17% of the region (Central and Western SWUS). Climate change, primarily as precipitation reduction, made major contributions to the soil water storage decline in the SWUS. This study infers that water resource management must consider the climate change impacts over time and across space in the SWUS.

TI  - How Does Scale Effect Influence Spring Vegetation Phenology Estimated from Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indexes?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important land-surface parameter, vegetation phenology has been estimated from observations by various satellite-borne sensors with substantially different spatial resolutions, ranging from tens of meters to several kilometers. The inconsistency of satellite-derived phenological metrics (e.g., green-up date, GUD, also known as the land-surface spring phenology) among different spatial resolutions, which is referred to as the scale effect on GUD, has been recognized in previous studies, but it still needs further efforts to explore the cause of the scale effect on GUD and to quantify the scale effect mechanistically. To address these issues, we performed mathematical analyses and designed up-scaling experiments. We found that the scale effect on GUD is not only related to the heterogeneity of GUD among fine pixels within a coarse pixel, but it is also greatly affected by the covariation between the GUD and vegetation growth speed of fine pixels. GUD of a coarse pixel tends to be closer to that of fine pixels with earlier green-up and higher vegetation growth speed. Therefore, GUD of the coarse pixel is earlier than the average of GUD of fine pixels, if the growth speed is a constant. However, GUD of the coarse pixel could be later than the average from fine pixels, depending on the proportion of fine pixels with later GUD and higher growth speed. Based on those mechanisms, we proposed a model that accounted for the effects of heterogeneity of GUD and its co-variation with growth speed, which explained about 60% of the scale effect, suggesting that the model can help convert GUD estimated at different spatial scales. Our study provides new mechanistic explanations of the scale effect on GUD.

TI  - Ground subsidence characteristics associated with urbanization in East China analyzed with a Sentinel-1A-based InSAR time series approach
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengxian County in East China has experienced rapid urban development over the past decades, resulting in environmental problems associated with rapid urbanization, such as pollution, resource depletion, land subsidence, among others. In this study, we analyzed ground subsidence in Fengxian and Peixian counties associated with urbanization and mining activities by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time series technology, using 26 Sentinel-1A SAR images taken between July 2015 and March 2017. The results reveal that during the study period serious subsidence occurred in Fengxian town and the area of northern Peixian county. The maximum subsidence rate of the study area reached 75 mm/a, with an average subsidence rate of 15.9 mm/a. The subsidence rate was higher in the newly established districts east of Fengxian town than in the old town district. The most severe ground displacement in Peixian County occurred in the Zhang-shuang-lou mining area, while Peixian town itself was stable. These different spatial distributions of ground subsidence in the two county towns are highly correlated with their differing types of economic activities. We conclude that the relationship between ground subsidence and urbanization in these two county towns provides the basis for scientific decision-making regarding urban development.

TI  - <i>StfNet</i>: A Two-Stream Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal image fusion is considered as a promising way to provide Earth observations with both high spatial resolution and frequent coverage, and recently, learning-based solutions have been receiving broad attention. However, these algorithms treating spatiotemporal fusion as a single image super-resolution problem, generally suffers from the significant spatial information loss in coarse images, due to the large upscaling factors in real applications. To address this issue, in this paper, we exploit temporal information in fine image sequences and solve the spatiotemporal fusion problem with a two-stream convolutional neural network called StfNet. The novelty of this paper is twofold. First, considering the temporal dependence among image sequences, we incorporate the fine image acquired at the neighboring date to super-resolve the coarse image at the prediction date. In this way, our network predicts a fine image not only from the structural similarity between coarse and fine image pairs but also by exploiting abundant texture information in the available neighboring fine images. Second, instead of estimating each output fine image independently, we consider the temporal relations among time-series images and formulate a temporal constraint. This temporal constraint aiming to guarantee the uniqueness of the fusion result and encourages temporal consistent predictions in learning and thus leads to more realistic final results. We evaluate the performance of the StfNet using two actual data sets of Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) acquisitions, and both visual and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - Enterprise LST Algorithm Development and Its Evaluation with NOAA 20 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite land surface temperatures (LSTs) have been routinely produced for decades from a variety of polar-orbiting and geostationary satellites, which makes it possible to generate LST climate data globally. However, consistency of the satellite LSTs from different satellite missions is a concern for such purpose; an enterprise satellite LST algorithm is desired for the LST production through different satellite missions, or at the least, through series satellites of a satellite mission. The enterprise LST algorithm employs the split window technique and uses the emissivity explicitly in its formula. This research focuses on the enterprise LST algorithm design, development and its evaluations with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) 20 (N20) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data available since 5 January 2018. In this study, the enterprise LST algorithm was evaluated using simulation dataset consisting of over 2000 profiles from SeeBor collection and the results show a bias of 0.19 K and 0.34 K and standard deviation of 0.48 K and 0.69 K for nighttime and daytime, respectively. The in situ observations from seven NOAA Surface Radiation budget (SURFRAD) sites and two Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) sites were used for LST validation. The results indicate a bias of -0.3 K and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.06 K for SURFRAD stations and a bias of 0.2 K and a RMSE of similar to 2 K for BSRN sites. Further, the cross-satellite analysis presents a bias of 0.7 K and an RMSE of 1.9 K for comparisons with AQUA MODIS LST (MYD11_L2, Collection 6). The enterprise N20 VIIRS LST product reached the provisional maturity in February 2019 and is ready for users to use in their applications.

TI  - Integrating citizen science and remotely sensed data to help inform time-sensitive policy decisions for species of conservation concern
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) uses a Species Status Assessment (SSA) framework to inform Endangered Species Act (ESA) policy decisions. A major challenge for development of SSAs includes inconsistent or incomplete monitoring throughout a species' range, which can result from inadequate time and funding for data collection prior to final rulings. In 2014, the USFWS initiated an SSA for the Sprague's pipit (Anthus spragueii; hereafter pipit), a migratory songbird scheduled for consideration as Threatened or Endangered in fall 2015. At the time, researchers had no field data to identify the spatial distribution of habitat across the geographic extent of the pipit's wintering grounds or to forecast the species' response to probable future scenarios of environmental conditions or conservation efforts during winter. In addition, the timing of the ESA decision precluded range-wide surveys on the pipit's wintering grounds. We present an SSA case study to demonstrate how citizen science and remotely sensed data could be integrated to help inform time-sensitive policy decisions for species of conservation concern. We developed three independent estimates of potential pipit habitat, and we assumed that spatial congruence among models provided increased evidence of habitat likely to support our focal species. We do not suggest that our approach replace more robust analyses, but rather illustrate an alternative strategy to obtain baseline information for SSAs and other policy decisions when data and time are lacking.

TI  - The geoheritage of Lubango-Tundavala road traverse in the Serra da Leba (SW Angola): Outcrops characterization and numerical assessment for outdoor educational activities and geoconservation purpose
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was carried out in the Serra da Leba, Southwest of Angola, at selected sites along the road linking the city of Lubango to the Tundavala Gorge. Its main objectives are the identification, location, geological and geomorphological characterization of each site, the evaluation of its geoheritage value and its integration into an educational itinerary (the Lubango-Tundavala road traverse).The geological framework of the study are Proterozoic granitoids and quartzites.Seven sites were highlighted, from southeast to northwest along the road traverse: 1) Castle Hill (Eburnean granitoids); 2) Chapel Rock (Eburnean granitoids); 3) Overlooking the Tundavala earth dam (Mapunda River. Eburnean granitoids and post-Eburnean quartzites); 4) Tundavala Water catchment and treatment station (Eburnean granitoids and post-Eburnean quartzites); 5) Enchanted City (post-Eburnean quartzites); 6) Valley of the Ruins (post-Eburnean quartzites); 7) Viewpoint of the Tundavala Gorge (post-Eburnean quartzites).The sites were selected using mainly the results of fieldwork (observation, production of representations, measurement, data interpretation and modeling), the interpretation of remote sensing data and published literature and cartography.As a result of the evaluation by application of the numerical assessment methodology, the site of the Lubango-Tundavala road traverse with the highest total value is the "Viewpoint of the Tundavala Gorge". However, the calculated ranking of all the sites shows the "Overlooking the Tundavala earth dam (Mapunda River)" site with the best position, being therefore considered the place with the highest geoheritage value in the area under evaluation. This is justified by its high-use value and consequently higher management value. Using the previously characterized and evaluated sites, several field activities to include in a field guide that allow highlighting aspects such as landscapes, outcrops, lithologies, structures and resources were proposed.The sites of this road traverse are of great scientific, didactic and aesthetic/photographic value, levels. For this reason and for the vulnerability of some of them, they should be preserved and protected by legislation.

TI  - The valuation of ecosystem services from the Totonac indigenous worldview
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Totonac culture is characterized by having a richness of knowledge about the use and management of natural resources; nevertheless, due to several factors, there has been a decrease in the conservation and transmission of such knowledge. Hence, the main objective of this work was to describe the different ecosystem services of the flora of a Totonac population, in order to contribute to the preservation of traditional knowledge. The municipality of Filomeno Mata, Veracruz, Mexico was chosen as the case study. This municipality is characteristic of the mountain region of totonacapan. To meet the objective, semi-structured interviews were applied to the target population in 2016. There were talks with key informants and a field trip through a directed transect that served for the observation and collection of the species. It was found that the ecosystem services most recognized by the population are grouped into four categories; in order of importance, the most named were placed in the category of supply, information, habitat and regulation, respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to conduct multidisciplinary studies in indigenous communities for the rescue and preservation of valuable knowledge about the use of natural capital, as well as the understanding of the indissoluble association between culture and ecosystems. Local actions to protect and restore ecosystems, benefit both direct and indirect users at the national or international scale.

TI  - Evaluating Empirical Regression, Machine Learning, and Radiative Transfer Modelling for Estimating Vegetation Chlorophyll Content Using Bi-Seasonal Hyperspectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Different types of methods have been developed to retrieve vegetation attributes from remote sensing data, including conventional empirical regressions (i.e., linear regression (LR)), advanced empirical regressions (e.g., multivariable linear regression (MLR), partial least square regression (PLSR)), machine learning (e.g., random forest regression (RFR), decision tree regression (DTR)), and radiative transfer modelling (RTM, e.g., PROSAIL). Given that each algorithm has its own strengths and weaknesses, it is essential to compare them and evaluate their effectiveness. Previous studies have mainly used single-date multispectral imagery or ground-based hyperspectral reflectance data for evaluating the models, while multi-seasonal hyperspectral images have been rarely used. Extensive spectral and spatial information in hyperspectral images, as well as temporal variations of landscapes, potentially influence the model performance. In this research, LR, PLSR, RFR, and PROSAIL, representing different types of methods, were evaluated for estimating vegetation chlorophyll content from bi-seasonal hyperspectral images (i.e., a middle- and a late-growing season image, respectively). Results show that the PLSR and RFR generally performed better than LR and PROSAIL. RFR achieved the highest accuracy for both images. This research provides insights on the effectiveness of different models for estimating vegetation chlorophyll content using hyperspectral images, aiming to support future vegetation monitoring research.

TI  - Optical interpretation of oil emulsions in the ocean - Part I: Laboratory measurements and proof-of-concept with AVIRIS observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical identification and quantification of various marine-spilled oils play an important role in oil spill monitoring, assessment, and response. Through weathering processes, oil may become emulsified in two forms of oil water mixture: water in oil (WO) and oil in water (OW). These two forms of oil emulsion are significantly different in their volume concentration (oil/water ratio), physical properties (viscosity, density, thickness), and optical properties (spectral reflectance (R-u(lambda), sr(-1)), and spectral absorption (a(lambda), m(-1))). In this study, the optical properties of both types of oil emulsion, with different volumetric concentrations, are determined from carefully prepared oil emulsion samples, with the aim of helping to interpret optical remote sensing imagery. The concentrations of stable WO and OW emulsions range from 45% to 95% and from 0.025% to 3%, respectively. They exhibit different R-u spectral shapes in the near-infrared and shortwave-infrared wavelengths, with five "-CH" molecular bonds evident in the WO emulsion spectra. R-u (600-1400 nm) of OW emulsions increases with volume concentrations from 0% to 3.0%, but R-u (600-2400 nm) of the WO emulsions decreases with volume concentrations from 45% to 100%. On the other hand, for a fixed concentration (80%), R-u (600-2400 nm) of WO emulsions increases monotonically with thicknesses of up to similar to 0.4 mm, beyond which R-u (600-2400 nm) no longer increases with oil thickness. The difference between the R-u spectral shapes of OW and WO emulsions, as well as the statistical relationships between volume concentrations and R-u (NIR-SWIR) and between oil thickness and Ru (NIR-SWIR), provide the basis for developing optical models to classify oil emulsion types and for quantifying oil volume from remote sensing imagery. The potential of such an application is demonstrated using hyperspectral AVIRIS imagery collected over the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM).

TI  - Variations in hospital resource use across stroke care teams in England, Wales and Northern Ireland: a retrospective observational study
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To identify the main drivers of inpatient stroke care resource use, estimate the influence of stroke teams on the length of stay (LoS) of its patients and analyse the variation in relative performance across teams.Design For each of four types of stroke care teams, a two-level count data model describing the variation in LoS and identifying the team influence on LoS purged of patient and treatment characteristics was estimated. Each team effect was interpreted as a measure of stroke care relative performance and its variation was analysed.Setting This study used data from 145396 admissions in 256 inpatient stroke care teams between June 2013 and July 2015 included in the national stroke register of England, Wales and Northern Ireland-Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme.Results The main driver of LoS, and thus resource use, was the need for stroke therapy even after stroke severity was taken into account. Conditional on needing the therapy in question, an increase in the average amount of therapy received per inpatient day was associated with shorter LoS. Important variations in stroke care performance were found within each team category.Conclusions Resource use was strongly associated with stroke severity, the need for therapy and the amount of therapy received. The variations in stroke care performance were not explained by measurable patient or team characteristics. Further operational and financial analyses are needed to unmask the causes of this unexplained variation.

AB  - The article analyzes the withstanding of two worldviews - traditionalism and antitraditionalism - in the context of the conflict between the "right populism" and the modern liberalism. The authors define the ideology of the modern liberal order as antitraditionalism because it differs from the classical liberalism and should not be mixed with neoliberalism. Its basic feature is the intention to overcome every identity, because the identity, according to the antitraditionalist ideology, chains humans with narrow frames of stereotypes imposed from outside. The overcoming of identity opens the world of new possibilities and new values. In the chapter on the basics of antitraditionalism, the authors distinguish two ideological sources of this worldview. Firstly, it is Christianity that claims the principles of equality. The second source is Marxism where "being defines conscience", and both the "discriminated conscience of the exploited" and the "suppressing conscience of the dominating class" exist. The progress of the new ideology is described in the chapter on the revolution of antitraditionalism. The influence of the struggle between two trends on inner political processes is analyzed in the chapter on the party delimitations and political discussions. It is stressed that Russia was a pioneer of antitraditionalism in the Soviet period but now counters the new "liberal" values. The traditionalist wave in Europe and USA was provoked by immigration crisis, discussion around issues of gender and perception of nationalism. The authors conclude that the beginning of a new ideological and political fight in the modern world as well as the occurrence of the traditionalist reaction to a peaceful antitraditionalist revolution (which has been taking place since the second half of 20th century) is a regular process.

T2  - ANIMAL MODELS AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the first detection and isolation of B. pseudohinzii (Bordetella pseudohinzii) in laboratory mice in China. Forty-one B. pseudohinzii strains were isolated from 3094 mice in 33 different laboratory animal facilities in southern China. The isolates were identified through culture and genome sequenceing. Phylogenetic analysis based on the sequences of 16S rRNA and OmpA genes demonstrated that these strains were on the same clade as other B. pseudohinzii strains isolated from mice. Experimental infected mice presented an asymptomatic infection. B. pseudohinzii replicated in both the respiratory tract and the digestive tract. Most importantly B. pseudohinzii shed via feces and infected a group of sentinel mice in a separate cage via cage padding contaminated with B. pseudohinzii-positive feces, indicating that B. pseudohinzii could transmit efficiently among mice and contaminate environmental facilities. Our study highlights the importance of routine monitoring of the pathogen in laboratory mice and provides vital insights into the transmission of Brodetellae in rodents and human.

TI  - A tentative test for measuring the sub-millimeter settlement and uplift of a high-speed railway bridge using COSMO-SkyMed images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzed the dynamic behaviors of a high-speed railway (HSR) bridge and evaluated the possibility of measuring the sub-millimeter settlement and uplift using COSMO-SkyMed images. The capability of synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) technologies with the purpose of sub-millimeter deformation monitoring without ground control points has rarely been studied. In this paper, we conducted a tentative test for measuring the sub-millimeter settlement and uplift of a HSR bridge. Persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) were jointly detected to increase the point density. The temperature model was introduced to separate the thermal expansion and linear deformation. By analyzing the HSR structure and time-series deformation, we infer that PS points correspond to double-bounce scatterers mainly generated by the interactions between the girder and track slab and between the girder and fender, and DS points correspond to single-bounce scatterers generated by the bridge girder surface. The accuracy of linear deformation velocity and time-series deformation were evaluated, respectively. Under the assumptions by qualitative analysis, the results demonstrate that COSMO-SkyMed is capable of achieving sub-millimeter accuracy in linear deformation velocity. However, the leveling validation implies that it is difficult to achieve sub-millimeter accuracy in time-series deformation because of the uncertainties from incorrect ground data, location and time difference between the InSAR and ground data, the presence of lateral deformation, improper removal of the atmospheric phase screen, and inconsistency between the air temperature and bridge temperature.

TI  - Modernist Unilateralism and the Urban Development Policies of Contemporary Iran
T2  - MANZAR-THE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL OF LANDSCAPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical cities have generally been the product of a kind of partnership between the general public and the government. In the historical era, due to the alignment of the public sector's worldview and the powerful class of the community, there has not been a significant difference between the taste and view, and as a result, the decisions and measures of these two groups about the city have resulted in some sort of sustainable coordination. However, with the emergence of modernity in the Iranian community, a gap in approaches has been emerged between the authority and the public class, leading to the formation of unilateralist approaches regarding urbanism policies. In the Qajar era, these policies are mainly limited to governmental spaces, but from the Pahlavi era, these policies lead to changes in the urban residential contexts without paying attention to the role of people in this process. This paper seeks to investigate the relationship between the emergence of modernity and unilateralism in the Iranian community and its impact on urbanism policies in the country's developmental and civil plans. This descriptive-explanatory research by analyzing the obtained data through library method attempts to investigate the relationship of government as an elite part of the community in connection with the general public, before and after the emergence of modernity, and in this way discusses the reason of the formation of unilateralist approaches towards urban development policies. This paper is aimed at investigating the policies adopted in the field of residential contexts development in historical periods after the emergence of modernity. In fact, it seeks to approve the hypothesis that the policies pursued in the urban development topic in various eras due to the lack of democratic structures and institutions in some way have relied on a unilateralist view and without the people's participation.

TI  - Persistent Place-Making in Prehistory: the Creation, Maintenance, and Transformation of an Epipalaeolithic Landscape
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL METHOD AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Most archaeological projects today integrate, at least to some degree, how past people engaged with their surroundings, including both how they strategized resource use, organized technological production, or scheduled movements within a physical environment, as well as how they constructed cosmologies around or created symbolic connections to places in the landscape. However, there are a multitude of ways in which archaeologists approach the creation, maintenance, and transformation of human-landscape interrelationships. This paper explores some of these approaches for reconstructing the Epipalaeolithic (ca. 23,000-11,500 years BP) landscape of Southwest Asia, using macro- and microscale geoarchaeological approaches to examine how everyday practices leave traces of human-landscape interactions in northern and eastern Jordan. The case studies presented here demonstrate that these Epipalaeolithic groups engaged in complex and far-reaching social landscapes. Examination of the Early and Middle Epipalaeolithic (EP) highlights that the notion of "Neolithization" is somewhat misleading as many of the features we use to define this transition were already well-established patterns of behavior by the Neolithic. Instead, these features and practices were enacted within a hunter-gatherer world and worldview.

TI  - Utility of Level III Axillary Node Dissection in Melanoma Patients with Palpable Axillary Lymph Node Disease
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial II results suggest that future radical axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) will be performed for bulkier metastatic disease. The utility of level III lymph node (LN) dissection in melanoma patients with palpable metastatic axillary disease was assessed. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent ALND (levels I-III) for metastatic melanoma from 2005 to 2017. We assessed the frequency of level III positive nodes in patients undergoing radical axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND) for metastatic melanoma as well as the prognostic role and factors predictive of level III LN positivity. Results A total of 190 patients underwent ALND during the study period. Of these, 85 patients had palpable axillary disease, of which 71 had separate level III pathologic assessment. Level III LNs were positive in 16.9% of patients with palpable disease versus 0% with positive sentinel LN. The 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with palpable disease was 82.9%, 58.9%, and 39.0%, respectively. Median disease-free survival was 26.8 months, and the axillary recurrence rate was 8.2%. High level I/II LN ratio, BRAF mutation, and total LN examined were significant predictors of level III positivity (all p <= 0.05). Patients with positive level III LN had significantly worse OS (median 18.6 months vs. not reached, p = 0.001). No preoperative factors were predictive of level III LN positivity. Conclusions Level III axillary disease is not uncommon in melanoma patients with clinically palpable nodal disease and provides useful prognostic information for OS. We recommend that full level I-III ALND be considered in this patient cohort.

TI  - TEACHING RUSSIAN THROUGH THE PRISM OF CONCEPT THEORY: <i>CULTURE</i>, <i>MENTALITY AND ASPECTS OF LANGUAGE</i>
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual approach opens new perspectives in teaching foreign languages - the Russian one as a foreign language among others. These perspectives are connected with deep mental plunge of students into the conceptosphere of the language and culture. The plunge (realized on lexical, grammar and phonetical levels on the language) results in enlarging students' views of connection between language and mentality, language and world-perception, language and national culture, as well as in general improvement of their motivation against the background of positive involvement into multidimensional understanding of language structure elements. The paper suggests using the four-stage methodology of teaching lexis that provide broadening students' notion of a word, its lexical context, its symbolic and value connotations and its connections with other elements of language and culture. The paper tackles upon the problem of applying conceptual approach to teaching grammar material, and suggests an exemplary methodology of teaching different grammar structures of the Russian language, using the material of two experiments with a group of American high school seniors, studying Russian at an initial stage. The methodology combines elements of conscious-comparative method and technology of critical thinking, and aims at emotional and intellectual involvement of students into the process of learning new grammar structure of a foreign language. The paper argues that introducing the notion of 'phonetic concept', to denote a structured element of people's mentality, basically expressed at the phonetic level of a language, can be effectively used in theory and practice of teaching foreign languages. On the example of the Russian language, the authors make an assumption that there is a systematic connection between a long and light breath, absence of any possible indicator of aspiration, a relaxed tip of the tongue, so characteristic of Russian pronunciation, on the one hand, and a hearty-meditative worldview, peculiar for Russian culture, on the other.

TI  - Soil roughness retrieval from TerraSar-X data using neural network and fractal method
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to estimate the surface roughness (rms) using TerraSar-X data in HH polarization. Simulation of data is carried out at a wide range of moisture and roughness using the Integral Equation Model (IEM). The inversion method is based on Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network. Inversion technique is performed in two steps. In the first step, the neural network is trained using synthetic data. The inputs of the first neural network are the backscattering coefficient and incidence angle, and the moisture is the output. In the next step, three neural networks are built based on a prior and without prior information on roughness. The inputs of three neural network are backscattering coefficient, estimated moisture in the first step and incidence angle and the roughness is output. The validation of the proposed methods is carried out based on synthetic and real data. Ground roughness measurements are extracted from Digital Terrain Model (DTM) using the fractal method. The accuracy of moisture from synthetic data is 6.1 vol% without prior information on moisture and roughness. The roughness (rms) accuracy of synthetic datasets is 0.61 cm without prior information and is 0.31 cm and 0.38 cm for rms lower than 2 cm and rms between 2 and 4 cm, with prior information on roughness. The result's analysis of the simulated data showed that the prior information on roughness strongly improves the accuracy of roughness and moisture estimates. The accuracy of rms estimates for the TerraSar-X image in the HH polarization is about 0.9 cm in the case of no prior information on roughness. The accuracy improves to 0.57 cm for rms lower than 2 cm and 0.54 cm for rms between 2 and 4 cm with prior information on roughness. An overestimation of rms for rms lower than 2 cm and an underestimation of rms for rms higher than 2 cm are observed. The results of the accuracy of the synthetic and real data showed that the X band in HH polarization has a very good potential to estimate the soil roughness.

TI  - Remote sensing and landsat image enhancement using multiobjective PSO based local detail enhancement
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing images, the common artifacts caused by existing contrast enhancement methods, need to be minimized because pieces of important information are widespread throughout the image in the sense of both spatial locations and intensity levels. In this regard enhancement techniques not merely restore the contrast but also decrease intensity distortion of satellite images. To achieve this goal, in this paper, the image is first enhanced by applying sigmoid function. Then multiobjective PSO method is adopted to maximize the information content, carried in the image with a continuous intensity transform function while preserving the image intensity by using the gamma-correction approach. The proposed technique is implemented using MATLAB and tested over Landsat satellite images provided by USGS. The qualitative results have clearly shown that the proposed image enhancement technique can preserve the significant detail of the original image.

TI  - Prediction and performance assessment of global solar radiation in Indian cities: A comparison of satellite and surface measured data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The design and performance assessment of solar photovoltaic/thermal system requires the knowledge of global solar radiation. Generalised models to assess the monthly average global solar radiation of twelve locations in India were established using sunshine hours available for 14 years (2000-2014) obtained from the World Radiation Data Centre (WRDC), Russia. Statistical analysis is carried out to assess the accurate model to estimate the global solar radiation which includes mean bias error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, the coefficient of determination and uncertainty at 95%. Also, the assessment of the global radiation values obtained from satellite data by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is performed. Further, Global Performance Indicator (GPI) is introduced to find the ranking of models from the overall performance of the investigated models by scaling statistical indicators. The comparison of the NREL estimated data and WRDC data shows that the satellite data overestimates the surface measured data between 10 and 15% for seven locations, whereas, for the remaining four stations, it is between 7 and 9.5%.

TI  - New Perspectives in Landslide Displacement Detection Using Sentinel-1 Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-borne radar interferometry is a fundamental tool to detect and measure a variety of ground surface deformations, either human induced or originated by natural processes. Latest development of radar remote sensing imaging techniques and the increasing number of space missions, specifically designed for interferometry analyses, led to the development of new and more effective approaches, commonly referred to as Advanced DInSAR (A-DInSAR) or Time Series Radar Interferometry (TS-InSAR). Nevertheless, even if these methods were proved to be suitable for the study of a large majority of ground surface dynamic phenomena, their application to landslides detection is still problematic. One of the main limiting factors is related to the rate of displacement of the unstable slopes: landslides evolving too fast decorrelate the radar signal making the interferometric phase useless. This is the reason why A-DInSAR techniques have been successfully applied exclusively to measure very slow landslides (few centimetres per year). This study demonstrates how the C-band data collected since 2014 by the Sentinel-1 (S1) mission and properly designed interferometric approaches can pull down this restriction allowing to measure rate of displacements ten times higher than previously done, thus providing new perspectives in landslides detection. The analysis was carried out on a test site located in the Cortina d'Ampezzo valley (Eastern Italian Alps), which is affected by several earth flows characterized by different size and kinematics.

TI  - The Parallel SBAS Approach for Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath Deformation Time-Series Generation: Algorithm Description and Products Quality Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an advanced differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) processing chain, based on the Parallel Small BAseline Subset (P-SBAS) technique, for the efficient generation of deformation time series from Sentinel-1 (S-1) interferometric wide (IW) swath SAR data sets. We first discuss an effective solution for the generation of high-quality interferograms, which properly accounts for the peculiarities of the terrain observation with progressive scans (TOPS) acquisition mode used to collect S-1 IW SAR data. These data characteristics are also properly accounted within the developed processing chain, taking full advantage from the burst partitioning. Indeed, such data structure represents a key element in the proposed P-SBAS implementation of the S-1 IW processing chain, whose migration into a cloud computing (CC) environment is also envisaged. An extensive experimental analysis, which allows us to assess the quality of the obtained interferometric products, is presented. To do this, we apply the developed S-1 IW P-SBAS processing chain to the overall archive acquired from descending orbits during the March 2015-April 2017 time span over the whole Italian territory, consisting in 2740 S-1 slices. In particular, the quality of the final results is assessed through a large-scale comparison with the GPS measurements relevant to nearly 500 stations. The mean standard deviation value of the differences between the DInSAR and the GPS time series (projected in the radar line of sight) is less than 0.5 cm, thus confirming the effectiveness of the implemented solution. Finally, a discussion about the performance achieved by migrating the developed processing chain within the Amazon Web Services CC environment is addressed, highlighting that a two-year data set relevant to a standard S-1 IW slice can be reliably processed in about 30 h. The presented results demonstrate the capability of the implemented P-SBAS approach to efficiently and effectively process large S-1 IW data sets relevant to extended portions of the earth surface, paving the way to the systematic generation of advanced DInSAR products to monitor ground displacements at a very wide spatial scale.

TI  - Mast Cell Responses to Viruses and Pathogen Products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Mast cells are well accepted as important sentinel cells for host defence against selected pathogens. Their location at mucosal surfaces and ability to mobilize multiple aspects of early immune responses makes them critical contributors to effective immunity in several experimental settings. However, the interactions of mast cells with viruses and pathogen products are complex and can have both detrimental and positive impacts. There is substantial evidence for mast cell mobilization and activation of effector cells and mobilization of dendritic cells following viral challenge. These cells are a major and under-appreciated local source of type I and III interferons following viral challenge. However, mast cells have also been implicated in inappropriate inflammatory responses, long term fibrosis, and vascular leakage associated with viral infections. Progress in combating infection and boosting effective immunity requires a better understanding of mast cell responses to viral infection and the pathogen products and receptors we can employ to modify such responses. In this review, we outline some of the key known responses of mast cells to viral infection and their major responses to pathogen products. We have placed an emphasis on data obtained from human mast cells and aim to provide a framework for considering the complex interactions between mast cells and pathogens with a view to exploiting this knowledge therapeutically. Long-lived resident mast cells and their responses to viruses and pathogen products provide excellent opportunities to modify local immune responses that remain to be fully exploited in cancer immunotherapy, vaccination, and treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  - Crowd-Driven and Automated Mapping of Field Boundaries in Highly Fragmented Agricultural Landscapes of Ethiopia with Very High Spatial Resolution Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the extent and location of field boundaries is critical to food security analysis but remains problematic in the Global South where such information is needed the most. The difficulty is due primarily to fragmentation in the landscape, small farm sizes, and irregular farm boundaries. Very high-resolution satellite imagery affords an opportunity to delineate such fields, but the challenge remains of determining such boundaries in a systematic and accurate way. In this paper, we compare a new crowd-driven manual digitization tool (Crop Land Extent) with two semi-automated methods (contour detection and multi-resolution segmentation) to determine farm boundaries from WorldView imagery in highly fragmented agricultural landscapes of Ethiopia. More than 7000 one square-kilometer image tiles were used for the analysis. The three methods were assessed using quantitative completeness and spatial correctness. Contour detection tended to under-segment when compared to manual digitization, resulting in better performance for larger (approaching 1 ha) sized fields. Multi-resolution segmentation on the other hand, tended to over-segment, resulting in better performance for small fields. Neither semi-automated method in their current realizations however are suitable for field boundary mapping in highly fragmented landscapes. Crowd-driven manual digitization is promising, but requires more oversight, quality control, and training than the current workflow could allow.

TI  - Assessing changes in Tanzania's Kwakuchinja Wildlife Corridor using multitemporal satellite imagery and open source tools
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kwakuchinja Wildlife Corridor (KWC) connects Tanzania's Tarangire and Lake Manyara national parks. The KWC has historically been an avenue for 25 species of wildlife, including African elephants (Loxodonta africana), to move between the two parks -movement which is essential to maintain herd size and animal well-being. Unfortunately, due to increasing human settlement and agriculture prevalent in the corridor, the health of the corridor was listed as 'critical' in 2009. The ability to map, monitor, and model landuse dynamics is essential to conservationists seeking to preserve free animal movement through the KWC. We show that land cover change in the corridor can be mapped using open-source satellite image products and applications. We demonstrate this process by comparing landcover maps derived from Landsat data in 2002 and 2017. The imagery was acquired and processed in the open-source Google Earth Engine and QGIS software. Results show that agriculture increased by 35.6% and woodlands decreased by 67.4% in the KWC study area in the period between 2002 and 2017. While some of the farmland increase was simple expansion of pre-existing fields, most of the increase occurred along the newly paved (in 2005) road A104.

TI  - Global validation of columnar water vapor derived from EOS MODIS-MAIAC algorithm against the ground-based AERONET observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The water vapor is a relevant greenhouse gas in the Earth's climate system, and satellite products become one of the most effective way to characterize and monitor the columnar water vapor (CWV) content at global scale. Recently, a new product (MCD19) was released as part of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Collection 6 (C6). This operational product from Multi-Angle Implementation for Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm includes a high 1 km resolution CWV retrievals. This study presents the first global validation of MAIAC C6 CWV obtained from MODIS MCD19A2 product. This evaluation was performed using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations at 265 sites (2000-2017). Overall, the results show a good agreement between MAIAC/AERONET CWV retrievals, with correlation coefficient higher than 0.95 and RMS error lower than 0.250 cm. The binned error analysis revealed an underestimation (similar to 10%) of Aqua CWV retrievals with negative bias for CWV higher than 3.0 cm. In contrast, Terra CWV retrievals show a slope of regression close to unity and a low mean bias of 0.075 cm. While the accuracy is relatively similar between 1.0 and 5.0 cm for both sensor products, Terra dataset is more reliable for applications in humid tropical areas (> 5.0 cm). The expected error was defined as +/- 15%, with > 68% of retrievals falling within this envelope. However, the accuracy is regionally dependent, and lower error should be expected in some regions, such as South America and Oceania. Since MODIS instruments have exceeded their design lifetime, time series analysis was also presented for both sensor products. The temporal analysis revealed a systematic offset of global average between Terra and Aqua CWV records. We also found an upward trend (similar to 0.2 cm/decade) in Terra CWV retrievals, while Aqua CWV retrievals remain stable over time. The sensor degradation influences the ability to detect climate signals, and this study indicates the need for revisiting calibration of the MODIS bands 17-19, mainly for Terra instrument, to assure the quality of the MODIS water vapor product. Finally, this study presents a comprehensive validation analysis of MAIAC CWV over land, raising the understanding of its overall quality.

TI  - A Portal Offering Standard Visualization and Analysis on top of an Open Data Cube for Sub-National Regions: The Catalan Data Cube Example
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of data that Sentinel fleet is generating over a territory such as Catalonia makes it virtually impossible to manually download and organize as files. The Open Data Cube (ODC) offers a solution for storing big data products in an efficient way with a modest hardware and avoiding cloud expenses. The approach will still be useful up to the next decade. Yet, ODC requires a level of expertise that most people who could benefit from the information do not have. This paper presents a web map browser that gives access to the data and goes beyond a simple visualization by combining the OGC WMS standard with modern web browser capabilities to incorporate time series analytics. This paper shows how we have applied this tool to analyze the spatial distribution of the availability of Sentinel 2 data over Catalonia and revealing differences in the number of useful scenes depending on the geographical area that ranges from one or two images per month to more than one image per week. The paper also demonstrates the usefulness of the same approach in giving access to remote sensing information to a set of protected areas around Europe participating in the H2020 ECOPotential project.

TI  - The Effect of Surface Fire in Savannah Systems in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, on the Backscatter of C-Band Sentinel-1 Images
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Savannahs are mixed woody-grass communities where low-intensity surface fires are common, affecting mostly the grass layer and rarely damaging trees. We investigated the effect of surface fires in a savannah system in the Kruger National Park, South Africa, on the backscatter of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C-band Sentinel-1A images. Pre-fire and post-fire dual polarized (VH, VV) C-band backscatter values were examined for 30 burn events. For all events, a systematic backscatter decrease from pre-fire to post-fire conditions was observed, with mean backscatter decreases of 1.61 dB and 0.99 dB for VH and VV, respectively. A total of 90% and 75% of the burn events showed a decrease in VH and VV backscatter greater than 0.43 dB, the overall absolute radiometric of Sentinel-1A products. The VH data were, overall, 1.7 times more sensitive to surface fire effects than the VV data. C-band data are likely sensitive to a reduction in grass biomass typical of surface fires, as well as in grass/soil moisture levels. Early season fires had higher backscatter decreases due to greater early season moisture conditions. For region with more than 30% woody cover, the effect of fire on the C-band backscatter was reduced. Denser woody communities tend to produce lower grass fuel load and less intense surface fires, and limit the penetration of C-band microwaves to the ground where most savannah fires and associated effects occur. This research provides evidence that C-band space-borne SAR is sensitive to the effects of surface-level fires in southern African savannahs. The unique availability of frequent and spatially detailed C-band data from the Sentinel-1 SAR constellation provide new opportunities for burned area mapping and systematic monitoring in savannahs systems, for instance, for fine-scale fire propagation studies.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in patients with T1N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma: selective neck dissection compared with wait and watch surveillance
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of the neck in patients with clinical T1N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is controversial. The aim of this study was to report the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a consecutive group of patients with stage 1 disease at a time closest to two years after primary surgery. Of 216 patients treated between 2007 and 2012 (after excluding early death and regional recurrence), 195 were eligible. HRQoL was measured using the University of Washington quality of life questionnaire version 4. The overall response rate was 65% (126/195). HRQoL outcomes were good, but compared with patients in the wait and watch group, those who had selective neck dissection (SND) had more problems regarding appearance (14% compared with 1%, p = 0.008) and pain (19% compared with 6%, p = 0.04). Similar trends were seen for shoulder (14% compared with 8%), mood (16% compared with 8%), and speech (5% compared with 1%), and for poorer overall QoL (30% compared with 16%). It is difficult to establish why patients did or did not have neck dissection in a retrospective sample, but it is likely that those who had SND had larger tumours. The findings highlight the impact that SND has on HRQoL in domains such as appearance, pain, speech, swallowing, and chewing. Previous studies on SND have tended to focus on injury to the accessory nerve and shoulder function, but these new data emphasise the need to include other domains in future trials that compare wait and watch, SND, and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Soil and climactic predictors of canine coccidioidomycosis seroprevalence in Washington State: An ecological cross-sectional study
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coccidioidomycosis is a predominantly respiratory infection of animals and humans caused by soil-dwelling fungi. Long known to be endemic to North American deserts, locally acquired human cases first emerged in Washington State in 2010. To inform development of an environmental niche map, we conducted an ecological cross-sectional study of the association between soil and climactic variables and canine seroprevalence in Washington State, at the zip code tabulation area level. Soil predictors included soil texture (per cent sand, silt and clay), pH, electrical conductivity and water storage capacity; climactic predictors included mean annual air temperature and liquid precipitation. Clustering was evaluated with Moran's I, and four modelling approaches were adopted a priori: two models without any smoothing (logistic regression and quasi-logistic regression) and two smoothing models (non-spatial and spatial smoothing). No evidence was found for clustering, and both smoothing models resulted in marked attenuation of all coefficients. Temperature was found to have a positive effect in the non-smoothing models (prevalence odds ratio, logistic model: 1.70, 95% confidence interval 1.02, 2.84). While no other significant associations were found, there was suggestive evidence of a positive effect for pH. Despite the limitations inherent to the ecological and cross-sectional nature of these data, these findings provide insight for the development of an environmental niche map in Washington State and demonstrate the utility of using data from an animal sentinel to predict human disease risk.

T2  - Mayo Clinic proceedings. Innovations, quality & outcomes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if a hospital-wide symptom-based alcohol withdrawal protocol may result in significant clinical improvements to patient outcomes, safety, and hospital efficiency.METHODS: Retrospective/prospective cohort study between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016 (pre-protocol), and between March 1, 2017 and August 7, July 2017 (post-protocol). Pre-protocol patients were identified retrospectively using International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision codes (F10.1, F10.2, and Z71.4). Post-protocol patients were identified by the use of a unique alcohol withdrawal order set in their electronic medical record. The primary endpoint was average length of stay. Secondary outcomes included death, escalation of care as defined as requiring intensive care unit (ICU) consultation or the rapid response team, average ICU length of stay, respiratory failure, average benzodiazepine usage, and incidence of seizures.RESULTS: The study included 276 patients in the pre-protocol group and 145 patients in the post-protocol group. There was a significant reduction found in the primary endpoint of average length of stay (7.15±6.5 days vs 5.7 ± 5.6 days; P=.02). There was a significant reduction in the average benzodiazepine use, use of adjunctive medications, need for ICU consultation or rapid response team, respiratory failure, average ICU length of stay, use of neurologic imaging, and the need for lumbar puncture.CONCLUSION: Implementation of a Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, Revised-based alcohol withdrawal protocol may significantly improve quality of care, patient safety, and treatment effectiveness in a large, mixed medical/surgical, urban community-based academic medical center.

TI  - Monitoring the regional deformation of loess landslides on the Heifangtai terrace using the Sentinel-1 time series interferometry technique
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heifangtai terrace of Gansu Province is a hotspot for loess landslide research, as massive and continuous landslides occur here every year. Detecting the spatial and temporal deformations of landslides and acquiring precursor information are very important for hazard prediction and risk management. In this paper, 51 newly launched Sentinel-1a scenes using the novel terrain observation with progressive scans (TOPS) mode from March 2015 to November 2017 are gathered, and a preprocessed chain of TOPS with the small baseline subset interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology is generated to obtain the deformation time-series. Our results show that (1) 44 active landslides with mean deformation velocities ranging from - 12.3 to - 58.57 mm yr(-1) along the steepest slope, were detected and consisted of 18 loess-bedrock landslides, 12 loess flows, 7 loess flow-slides, and 7 loess slides; (2) four typical active regions and two potential risk places were recognized on the basis of high coherent point distribution, the average measured velocities along the steep slope and high-resolution orthographic images; (3) geological structures and special geomorphologies (e.g., cracks, sinkholes and concave gullies) can be mainly attributed to induce reactivity via long term irrigation. Finally, our research also demonstrates the potential ability of Sentinel-1 TOPS images to be applied to the monitoring of loess landslides, which is essential for risk mitigation and emergence management.

TI  - Integration of High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry with Cryogenic Ion Vibrational Spectroscopy
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe an instrumental configuration for the structural characterization of fragment ions generated by collisional dissociation of peptide ions in the typical MS2 scheme widely used for peptide sequencing. Structures are determined by comparing the vibrational band patterns displayed by cryogenically cooled ions with calculated spectra for candidate structural isomers. These spectra were obtained in a linear action mode by photodissociation of weakly bound D-2 molecules. This is accomplished by interfacing a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Velos Pro to a cryogenic, triple focusing time-of-flight photofragmentation mass spectrometer (the Yale TOF spectrometer). The interface involves replacement of the Orbitrap's higher-energy collisional dissociation cell with a voltage-gated aperture that maintains the commercial instrument's standard capabilities while enabling bidirectional transfer of ions between the high-resolution FT analyzer and external ion sources. The performance of this hybrid instrument is demonstrated by its application to the a(1), y(1) and z(1) fragment ions generated by CID of a prototypical dipeptide precursor, protonated L-phenylalanyl-L-tyrosine (H+-Phe-Tyr-OH or FY-H+). The structure of the unusual z(1) ion, nominally formed after NH3 is ejected from the protonated tyrosine (y(1)) product, is identified as the cyclopropane-based product is tentatively identified as a cyclopropane-based product.

TI  - Paediatric melanoma: clinical update, genetic basis, and advances in diagnosis
T2  - LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Paediatric melanoma is rare and challenging to diagnose. The three subtypes are Spitzoid melanoma, melanoma arising in a congenital melanocytic nevus, and conventional (also known as adult-type) melanoma. Spitzoid melanomas have characteristic histopathological and genomic aberrations. Despite frequent involvement of the sentinel lymph nodes, most cases have an uneventful clinical course. Among congenital nevi, the risk of melanoma varies by projected size in adulthood, with the greatest risk in large or giant nevi. The clinical course is generally aggressive and accounts for most melanoma-related deaths in childhood. In conventional melanoma, superficial spreading and nodular melanoma account for most cases, with risk factors and presentation largely similar to adult disease. In this Review, we discuss advances in histological diagnosis using adjunctive molecular assays, and summarise the genetic basis of paediatric melanoma.

TI  - An Action Plan Towards Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Altimetry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimeters have been producing, as of 1992, an amazing and historic record of sea level changes. As Europe moves into full operational altimetry, it has become imperative that the quality of these monitoring signals with their uncertainties should be controlled, fully and properly descripted, but also traced and connected to undisputable standards and units. Excellent quality is the foundation of these operational services of Europe in altimetry. In line with the above, the strategy of the Fiducial Reference Measurements for Altimetry (FRM4ALT) has been introduced to address and to achieve reliable, long-term, consistent, and undisputable satellite altimetry products for Earth observation and for sea-level change monitoring. FRM4ALT has been introduced and implemented by the European Space Agency in an effort to reach a uniform and absolute standardization for calibrating satellite altimeters. This paper examines the problem and the need behind the FRM4ALT principle to achieve an objective Earth observation. Secondly, it describes the expected FRM products and services which are to come into being out of this new observational strategy. Thirdly, it outlines the technology and the services required for reaching this goal. And finally, it elaborates upon the necessary resources, skills, partnerships, and facilities for establishing FRM standardization for altimetry.

TI  - Spatial growth of Phnom Penh, Cambodia (1973-2015): Patterns, rates, and socio-ecological consequences
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work maps and interprets the evolution of the urban footprint of Phnom Penh from 1973 to 2015 and reviews its main socio-ecological impacts. The quantified patterns of urban growth and land-use change are based on the processing and analysis of Landsat satellite images (MSS, TM, and OLI sensors) and are enhanced by observation- and interview-based information obtained in the field. The growth of Phnom Penh is shown to have encroached initially on the fertile agricultural lands of the Mekong River floodplain, but since 2006 the city has been sprawling predominantly over natural lakes and wetlands that until then were functional components of the urban mosaic and underpinned the livelihoods of its population. Urban land areas increased from 3000 ha in 1973 to 4000 ha in 1990, subsequently soaring to 25,000 ha in 2015, i.e. an average annual increase of 850-1000 ha. The discussion of these changes focuses on (i) changing livelihoods on the urban fringe; (ii) the numerous, and sometimes large, real-estate projects that have sprung up around the city centre on former wetland areas and are funded by strongly imbricated capital interests between the nation's elites and foreign investors; (iii) a comparison of the urban growth figures with other Asian cities; and (iv) current land policies in Cambodia. The results call for urgent policymaking to address the diseconomies that arise from the impending loss of ecosystem services; from the accentuation of flood hazards caused by the rapid, ongoing suppression of wetland habitats at the delta head of the eighth largest river in the world; and from the unequal distribution of the costs and benefits of urban growth among the metropolitan population.

TI  - A Novel Inpainting Algorithm for Recovering Landsat-7 ETM+ SLC-OFF Images Based on the Low-Rank Approximate Regularization Method of Dictionary Learning With Nonlocal and Nonconvex Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 31, 2003, the scan line corrector (SLC) of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) on-board the Landsat-7 satellite failed, resulting in strips of data lost in all ETM+ images acquired since then. In this paper, we proposed a novel inpainting algorithm for recovering the ETM+ SLC-off images. The two slopes of the boundaries of each missing stripe were extracted through the Hough transform, ignoring the slope of the edge of the strip that overlaps the edge of the image. An adaptive dictionary was then developed and trained using ETM+ SLC-on images acquired before May 31, 2003 so that the physical characteristics and geometric features of the ground coverage of the data-missing strips can be considered during recovery. To make the algorithm computationally efficient, data-missing strips were repaired along their slope directions by using the logdet (center dot) low-rank nonconvex model along with the dictionary. The algorithm was tested using the simulated ETM+ SLC-off images created from a multiband ETM+ SLC-on image file and compared to the high accuracy low-rank tensor completion (HaLRTC), logDet, and tensor nuclear norm (TNN) algorithms. The results show that the ETM+ images restored using the new algorithm have lower RMSE, higher PSNR and structure similarity (SSIM) values, and better visualization. These results indicate that the new algorithm performs better than the other three algorithms and can efficiently and accurately restore the data-missing stripes.

TI  - Modeling thermal comfort in different condition of mind using satellite images: An Ordered Weighted Averaging approach and a case study
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important signs of decreasing quality of life in urban environments is the reduction of thermal comfort. Heat discomfort has a negative impact on physical and mental performance of humans. Hence, it is of outmost importance to monitor thermal comfort patterns in cities and study its effect on people. The main objective of this study is to present a spatial multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model for modeling thermal comfort for Tehran as a case study. For doing so, the reflectance and thermal information extracted from Landsat-8 satellite images, ASTER digital elevation model, MOD07 water vapor, and meteorological/climatic datasets were used. Several indicators including the downward shortwave radiation (SWD) and longwave radiation (LWD) to surface, upward longwave radiation (LWU) from the surface, brightness, greenness and wetness of the surface were derived. An Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) method was adapted considering different mental circumstances e.g., extremely pessimistic, pessimistic, neutral, optimistic and extremely optimistic. Our findings determine the geographical variation of thermal comfort across our study area e.g., the cold periods of the year are spread in the west and north-west side and the warm periods of the year on the west and north-west, while the central, northern, and eastern regions have a more favorable thermal comfort than other regions. The areal percentage of very suitable thermal comfort category for very pessimistic, pessimistic, neutral, optimistic, and very optimistic during the warm period of the year was 2.7, 5.1, 4.4, 13.4 and 1.18, respectively and in the cold period of the year was 9.1, 13.3, 18.3, 28.9 and 33.9, respectively. In both warm and cold periods with increasing degree of optimism, the area of favorable thermal comfort classes increases, while the area of unfavorable thermal comfort categories decreases. Our results and conclusions drawn from our proposed approach are useful for urban planners and public health researcher for monitoring quality of life in cities.

TI  - Remote sensing analysis for surface urban heat island detection over Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and human activity within an urban system produce many destructive and irreversible effects on natural environment such as air pollution and climate changes. One of the important effects of climate change is the formation of surface urban heat island (SUHI) which is an area with higher temperature than surroundings. It is important to study the surface urban heat islands to understand the complexity of the climate systems and to lessen their impact on the environment. In this paper, an approach for detecting SUHIs based on the combination between a set of Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) night vision images and Spot5 data was proposed. To accurately detect SUHIs over Jeddah City, it is important to determine the land surface temperature (LST). To achieve this goal, pixel values of Landsat images were converted to represent at sensor temperature. The spot image was classified using supervised classification techniques to determine feature types in the scene, the emissivity value for each pixel was assigned using classification-based emissivity and NDVI-based emissivity. Then, the two values of at sensor temperature and feature emissivity were linked together to retrieve an accurate LST. Based on the results of this study, the SUHIs over Jeddah City appeared as small boundaries in the South area of the city, as a result of the land use patterns. The difference between urban and non-urban areas ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. The SUHIs over Petromin neighborhood and Almohajer neighborhood were presented. Night vision Landsat 8 offers an effective framework to delineate and monitor behavior, movement, and size of SUHIs. The early detection of SUHIs by remote sensing data contributes in discovering environmental imbalance and helps to identify problems and developing solutions.

TI  - Hydrological impacts of afforestation in the semiarid Patagonia: A modelling approach
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Afforestation has been widely encouraged with different goals, including as a strategy to tackle global warming. However, the side-effects of this land-use transformation have been in many cases underestimated. Particularly, the hydrological impacts may become relevant in (semi)arid regions where water is a key element. In this work, we evaluated the hydrological effects triggered by afforestation with ponderosa pine in the semiarid Argentine Patagonia that is currently a focus of afforestation programs. For this purpose, we used complementary approaches that included hydrological modelling (DINAQUA model), satellite image analysis, and soil wetness data. All analyses provided convergent results into hydrological effects of afforestation. The modelling results showed that afforestation significantly increased transpiration in relation to native grass-shrub steppe. In the steppe in degraded condition, transpiration accounted for only 10% (40 mm year(-1)) of total water flux, whereas in adult pine plantations, it accounted for up to 73% (277 mm year(-1)). Deep drainage was also severely affected by afforestation as it decreased from 182 mm year(-1) in the steppe to zero in adult plantations, according to model simulations. Estimates from Landsat images also showed that evapotranspiration was higher in plantations compared with the steppe. Soil wetness data also revealed significantly drier soils in plantations. Our results indicate that pine plantations in the semiarid Patagonia evaporate all rainfall inputs, resulting in zero deep drainage and groundwater recharge. If the afforested area in the region increases, downstream meadow ecosystems, which are hotspots of primary productivity, may be negatively impacted.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass and Its Spatial Distribution in Coastal Wetlands Utilizing Planet Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal salt marshes are biologically productive ecosystems that generate and sequester significant quantities of organic matter. Plant biomass varies spatially within a salt marsh and it is tedious and often logistically impractical to quantify biomass from field measurements across an entire landscape. Satellite data are useful for estimating aboveground biomass, however, high-resolution data are needed to resolve the spatial details within a salt marsh. This study used 3-m resolution multispectral data provided by Planet to estimate aboveground biomass within two salt marshes, North Inlet-Winyah Bay (North Inlet) National Estuary Research Reserve, and Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) Long-Term Ecological Research site. The Akaike information criterion analysis was performed to test the fidelity of several alternative models. A combination of the modified soil vegetation index 2 (MSAVI(2)) and the visible difference vegetation index (VDVI) gave the best fit to the square root-normalized biomass data collected in the field at North Inlet (Willmott's index of agreement d = 0.74, RMSE = 223.38 g/m(2), AIC(w) = 0.3848). An acceptable model was not found among all models tested for PIE data, possibly because the sample size at PIE was too small, samples were collected over a limited vertical range, in a different season, and from areas with variable canopy architecture. For North Inlet, a model-derived landscape scale biomass map showed differences in biomass density among sites, years, and showed a robust relationship between elevation and biomass. The growth curve established in this study is particularly useful as an input for biogeomorphic models of marsh development. This study showed that, used in an appropriate model with calibration, Planet data are suitable for computing and mapping aboveground biomass at high resolution on a landscape scale, which is needed to better understand spatial and temporal trends in salt marsh primary production.

TI  - Digital mapping of peatlands - A critical review
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Peatlands offer a series of ecosystem services including carbon storage, biomass production, and climate regulation. Climate change and rapid land use change are degrading peatlands, liberating their stored carbon (C) into the atmosphere. To conserve peatlands and help in realising the Paris Agreement, we need to understand their extent, status, and C stocks. However, current peatland knowledge is vague estimates of global peatland extent ranges from 1 to 4.6 million km(2), and C stock estimates vary between 113 and 612 Pg (or billion tonne C). This uncertainty mostly stems from the coarse spatial scale of global soil maps. In addition, most global peatland estimates are based on rough country inventories and reports that use outdated data. This review shows that digital mapping using field observations combined with remotely-sensed images and statistical models is an avenue to more accurately map peatlands and decrease this knowledge gap. We describe peat mapping experiences from 12 countries or regions and review 90 recent studies on peatland mapping. We found that interest in mapping peat information derived from satellite imageries and other digital mapping technologies is growing. Many studies have delineated peat extent using land cover from remote sensing, ecology, and environmental field studies, but rarely perform validation, and calculating the uncertainty of prediction is rare. This paper then reviews various proximal and remote sensing techniques that can be used to map peatlands. These include geophysical measurements (electromagnetic induction, resistivity measurement, and gamma radiometrics), radar sensing (SRTM, SAR), and optical images (Visible and Infrared). Peatland is better mapped when using more than one covariate, such as optical and radar products using nonlinear machine learning algorithms. The proliferation of satellite data available in an open-access format, availability of machine learning algorithms in an open-source computing environment, and high-performance computing facilities could enhance the way peatlands are mapped. Digital soil mapping allows us to map peat in a cost-effective, objective, and accurate manner. Securing peatlands for the future, and abating their contribution to atmospheric C levels, means digitally mapping them now.

TI  - Real-time prediction of influenza outbreaks in Belgium
T2  - EPIDEMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal influenza is a worldwide public health concern. Forecasting its dynamics can improve the management of public health regulations, resources and infrastructure, and eventually reduce mortality and the costs induced by influenza-related absenteism. In Belgium, a network of Sentinel General Practitioners (SGPs) is in place for the early detection of the seasonal influenza epidemic. This surveillance network reports the weekly incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) cases, which makes it possible to detect the epidemic onset, as well as other characteristics of the epidemic season. In this paper, we present an approach for predicting the weekly ILI incidence in real-time by resorting to a dynamically calibrated compartmental model, which furthermore takes into account the dynamics of other influenza seasons. In order to validate the proposed approach, we used data collected by the Belgian SGPs for the influenza seasons 2010-2016. In spite of the great variability among different epidemic seasons, providing weekly predictions makes it possible to capture variations in the ILI incidence. The confidence region becomes more representative of the epidemic behavior as ILI data from more seasons become available. Since the SIR model is then calibrated dynamically every week, the predicted ILI curve gets rapidly tuned to the dynamics of the ongoing season. The results show that the proposed method can be used to characterize the overall behavior of an epidemic.

TI  - Shoreline Evolution of Lagoon Sandy Spits and Adjacent Beaches, Lagoa dos Patos, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of lagoon sandy spits is dependent on sediment supply (mainly through longshore transport) and is often related to erosion of updrift beaches under high-angle waves. This paper provides an understanding of the short-to medium-term shoreline evolution of three symmetrical lagoon sandy spits and the related erosion of the adjacent bay beaches of Lagoa dos Patos, Brazil. To do so, two of the most widely used methods to quantify shoreline changes were applied: the transects-from-baseline method and the change polygon method. A historical analysis of the shoreline movement of approximately three decades (1984-2013), was carried out, aiming to track the source of sediments to the spits. Alternate phases of shoreline stability, deposition, and recession (less frequent) in short time intervals (years) showed correlation with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode indexes. Shoreline stability along beaches in the medium term (60.4% of Arambare and 73.9% of Graxaim beaches, by the linear regression rate calculation), together with the very low average shoreline change rate of +0.7 m y(-1) found using both methods, demonstrates that the sediment supply to the spits has been significantly reduced in the past three decades. Furthermore, the large-scale subaqueous portions of the spits are under wave-induced sedimentary reworking accompanied by the up-building of sandbanks from the submerged bars, followed by its landward migration and merging to the spit's shoreline. These results suggest that the spits of Lagoa dos Patos have their growth limited once the amount of sediment supply has been significantly reduced.

TI  - Transformation of Religion in the European Union Countries as a Subject of Academic Research
T2  - CONTEMPORARY EUROPE-SOVREMENNAYA EVROPA
M3  - Article
AB  - The transformations of religious landscape are taking place in the modern European society. The authors highlight three main factors of these changes. The first one is secularization, which has led to a sharp decline in the influence of religious organizations (mainly churches of different Christian confessions) on the political, social and personal life of Europeans. The culture of a secular society is widespread. Christian values are giving way to secular values of political correctness and multiculturalism, and human rights have become a new sacredness. The second factor of transformation is the change in the ethnic composition of the most European countries as a result of large-scale migration. Associations of Islam followers provide significant influence in a number of European countries. This process leads to a kind of parallelism - new European Muslims create their models of legal, social, family and domestic relations, distancing themselves from the style of life of indigenous population. The third important factor is the worldview pluralism, which generates new religion- and belief communities, usually being a minority, according to the right of each person's choice of world-view in democratic societies. All these factors are closely linked to religious educational strategies of EU countries. The analysis of these factors and their consequences constitutes the actual content of modem European theoretical and empirical researches of religious Studies. The article deals with the most important areas, topics and problems of such research presented in the academic field of the new scientific community - the European Academy of religion.

TI  - Impact of Urban Growth on Air Quality in Indian Cities Using Hierarchical Bayesian Approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several studies have found rising ambient particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in urban areas across developing countries. For setting mitigation policies source-contribution is needed, which is calculated mostly through computationally intensive chemical transport models or manpower intensive source apportionment studies. Data based approach that use remote sensing datasets can help reduce this challenge, specially in developing countries which lack spatially and temporally dense air quality monitoring networks. Our objective was identifying relative contribution of urban emission sources to monthly PM2.5 ambient concentrations and assessing whether urban expansion can explain rise of PM2.5 ambient concentration from 2001 to 2015 in 15 Indian cities. We adapted the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) emission framework in a land use regression (LUR) model to estimate concentrations by statistically modeling the impact of urban growth on aerosol concentrations with the help of remote sensing datasets. Contribution to concentration from six key sources (residential, industrial, commercial, crop fires, brick kiln and vehicles) was estimated by inverse distance weighting of their emissions in the land-use regression model. A hierarchical Bayesian approach was used to account for the random effects due to the heterogeneous emitting sources in the 15 cities. Long-term ambient PM2.5 concentration from 2001 to 2015, was represented by a indicator R (varying from 0 to 100), decomposed from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) derived AOD (aerosol optical depth) and angstrom exponent datasets. The model was trained on annual-level spatial land-use distribution and technological advancement data and the monthly-level emission activity of 2001 and 2011 over each location to predict monthly R. The results suggest that above the central portion of a city, concentration due to primary PM2.5 emission is contributed mostly by residential areas (35.0 +/- 11.9%), brick kilns (11.7 +/- 5.2%) and industries (4.2 +/- 2.8%). The model performed moderately for most cities (median correlation for out of time validation was 0.52), especially when assumed changes in seasonal emissions for each source reflected actual seasonal changes in emissions. The results suggest the need for policies focusing on emissions from residential regions and brick kilns. The relative order of the contributions estimated by this study is consistent with other recent studies and a contribution of up to 42.8 +/- 14.1% is attributed to the formation of secondary aerosol, long-range transport and unaccounted sources in surrounding regions. The strength of this approach is to be able to estimate the contribution of urban growth to primary aerosols statistically with a relatively low computation cost compared to the more accurate but computationally expensive chemical transport based models. This remote sensing based approach is especially useful in locations without emission inventory.

TI  - Development of an Operational Algorithm for Automated Deforestation Mapping via the Bayesian Integration of Long-Term Optical and Microwave Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequent fine-scale monitoring of deforestation using satellite sensors is important for the sustainable management of forests. Traditional optical satellite sensors suffer from cloud interruption, particularly in tropical regions, and recent active microwave sensors (i.e., synthetic aperture radar) demonstrate the difficulty in data interpretation owing to their inherent sensor noise and complicated backscatter features of forests. Although the sensor integration of optical and microwave sensors is of compelling research interest, particularly in the conduct of deforestation monitoring, this topic has not been widely studied. In this paper, we introduce an operational algorithm for automated deforestation mapping using long-term optical and L-band SAR data, including a simple time-series analysis of Landsat stacks and a multilayered neural network with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer and Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2, followed by sensor integration based on the Bayesian Updating of Land-Cover. We applied the algorithm over a deciduous tropical forest in Cambodia in 2003-2018 for validation, and the algorithm demonstrated better accuracy than existing approaches, which only depend on optical data or SAR data. Owing to the cloud penetration ability of SAR, observation gaps of optical data under cloudy conditions were filled, resulting in a prompter detection of deforestation even in the tropical rainy season. We also investigated the effect of posterior probability constraints in the Bayesian approach. The land-cover maps (forest/deforestation) created by the well-tuned Bayesian approach achieved 94.0% +/- 4.5%, 80.0% +/- 10.1%, and 96.4% +/- 1.9% for the user's accuracy, producer's accuracy, and overall accuracy, respectively. In the future, small-scale commission errors in the resultant maps should be improved by using more sophisticated machine-learning approaches and considering the reforestation effects in the algorithm. The application of the algorithm to other landscapes with other sensor combinations is also desirable.

TI  - A Model for Complex Subsidence Causality Interpretation Based on PS-InSAR Cross-Heading Orbits Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are subject to subsidence due to varying natural and anthropogenic causes. Often, subsidence is interpreted and correlated to a single causal factor; however, subsidence is usually more complex. In this study, we adopt a new model to distinguish different causes of subsidence in urban areas based on complexity. Ascending and descending Sentinel-1 data were analyzed using permanent scatterer interferometry (PS-InSAR) and decomposed to estimate vertical velocity. The estimated velocity is correlated to potential causes of subsidence, and modeled using different weights, to extract the model with the highest correlations among subsidence. The model was tested in Alexandria City, Egypt, based on three potential causes of subsidence: rock type, former lakes and lagoons dewatering (FLLD), and built-up load (BL). Results of experiments on the tested area reveal singular patterns of causal factors of subsidence distributed across the northeast, northwest, central south, and parts of the city center, reflecting the rock type of those areas. Dual causes of subsidence are found in the southwest and some parts of the southeast as a contribution of rock type and FLLD, whereas the most complex causes of subsidence are found in the southeast of the city, as the newly built-up areas interact with the rock type and FLLD to form a complex subsidence regime. Those areas also show the highest subsidence values among all other parts of the city. The accuracy of the final model was confirmed using linear regression analysis, with an R-2 value of 0.88.

TI  - The Impact of the Land Cover Dynamics on Surface Urban Heat Island Variations in Semi-Arid Cities: A Case Study in Ahmedabad City, India, Using Multi-Sensor/Source Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the behavior of land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) from MODIS data over Ahmedabad city, Gujarat state (India), from 2003 to 2018. Summer and winter LST patterns were analyzed, both daytime and nighttime. Ahmedabad, one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities in India, is characterized by a semi-arid climate. The investigation focuses on the SUHI variations due to warming or cooling trends of both urban and rural areas, providing quantitative interpretations by means of multi-sensor/source data. Land cover maps, normalized differential vegetation index, surface albedo, evapotranspiration, urban population, and groundwater level were analyzed across the years to assess their impact on SUHI variations. Moreover, a field campaign was carried out in summer 2018 to measure LST in several rural and urban sites. During summer daytime, the rural zone exhibits a higher average LST than the urban area, resulting in a mean negative SUHI, typical of arid cities, while a slight positive SUHI (mean intensity of 0.4 degrees C) during winter daytime is present. An evident positive SUHI is found only during summer (1.8 degrees C) and winter nighttime (3.2 degrees C). The negative SUHI intensity is due to the low vegetation presence in the rural area, dominated by croplands turning into bare land surfaces during the pre-monsoon summer season. Higher LST values in the rural area than in the urban area are also confirmed by the field campaign, with an average difference of about 5 degrees C. Therefore, the impact of the rural LST in biasing the SUHI is evident, and a careful biophysical interpretation is needed. For instance, within the urban area, the yearly intensity of the summer daytime SUHI is not correlated with the evapotranspiration, while the correspondent summer daytime LST exhibits a significant negative correlation (-0.73) with evapotranspiration. Furthermore, despite the city growth across the years, the urban area does not generally reveal a temporal increase of the magnitude of the heat island but an enlargement of its spatial footprint.

TI  - Effect of Anisotropy on Ionospheric Scintillations Observed by SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies pertaining to small scale structures producing scintillations using synthetic aperture radars (SARs) have predominantly been conducted at low-latitude regions. The highlatitude region (auroral belt and polar caps) is highly dynamic and varies in response to stimuli from solar winds and the magnetosphere in complex ways. In this paper, the authors have shown the capability of SAR for scintillation observation in the auroral region. An attempt has been made to fit an irregularity anisotropy model to SAR measurements for characterizing the ionospheric irregularities in the auroral regions. The dependency of anisotropy irregularity model on parameters, such as irregularity structure (axial ratio), their orientation with respect to magnetic field lines, and the ionospheric plasma drift, is closely studied using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-2 datasets acquired over Alaska. Geomagnetic indices and total electron content data are consistent with the occurrence of the scintillation event under study. Drift velocity measurements from high-frequency radars in the super dual array radar network (SuperDARN) showed that the anisotropy is independent of the magnitude and the azimuth angle of the plasma drift. The typical range of orientation angle suitable for the high latitude regions probed by ALOS-2 is demonstrated to be between 120 degrees-135 degrees. This paper explores the idea of inferring irregularity anisotropy by comparing the amplitude scintillation (S4) index measured in SAR data pairs using two well-established techniques. The image contrast technique heavily relies on the accurate modeling of anisotropy, whereas the radar cross-sectional enhancement method is independent of it. This feature has been exploited in the S4 comparison to finally fit the choice of irregularity axial ratio and conclude that the sheet-like structures best describe the ionospheric irregularity structure in the region under observation.

TI  - Baleen whale ecology in arctic and subarctic seas in an era of rapid habitat alteration
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - Biophysical changes in marine ecosystems of the Arctic and subarctic sectors of the Atlantic and Pacific are now evident, driven primarily by sea ice loss, ocean warming and increases in primary productivity. As upper trophic species, baleen whales can serve as sentinels of ecosystem reorganization in response to these biophysical alterations, via changes in their ecology and physiological condition. This paper is the first to review baleen whale ecology in high-latitude marine ecosystems of both the north Atlantic and north Pacific. Oceanographically, these sectors offer four contrasting habitats to baleen whales: (i) a broad-deep-strait and deep-shelf inflow system in the Northeast Atlantic (NEA), (ii) a combination of inflow and outflow systems north of Iceland in the central North Atlantic (CNA), (iii) an outflow shelf and basin in the Northwest Atlantic (NWA), and (iv) a narrow-shallow-strait inflow shelf system in the Pacific sector. Information on baleen whale ecology from visual and passive acoustic surveys, combined with available telemetry and diet studies, show contrasting patterns of baleen whale occurrence among sectors. In brief, arctic and subarctic waters in the Atlantic sector support a far greater number of seasonally-migrant baleen whales than the Pacific sector. Thousands of humpback, fin and common minke whales occupy the diverse habitats of the Atlantic sector. These species all exhibit flexible diets, focused primarily on euphausiids (krill) and forage fishes (e.g., capelin, herring, sand lance), which are now responding to ecosystems altered by climate change. Conversely, the Pacific sector supports a far greater number of arctic-endemic bowhead whales than the Atlantic sector, as well as a large population of seasonally-migrant gray whales. Currently, differences in migratory timing and, to a lesser extent, foraging behaviors, serves to restrict prey competition between the arctic-endemic bowhead whale and seasonally migrant baleen whale species in both sectors. Regional aspects of changes in prey type and availability will likely impact future migratory timing, habitat selection, body condition and diet of baleen whales. Tracking variability in these attributes can provide valuable input to ecosystem models and thereby contribute the sentinel capability of baleen whales to forecasts of future states of high latitude marine ecosystems.

TI  - Usability of water surface reflectance for the determination of riverine dissolved methane during extreme flooding in northeastern Siberia
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 5th International Symposium on Arctic Research (ISAR)
CL  - Tokyo, JAPAN
AB  - An extreme flooding event occurred from June to July 2017 in the Indigirka River lowland of northeastern Siberia. We used Landsat 8 satellite surface reflectance data to detect the flood inundation area and extract water color for delineating different water sources. We also took direct samples of dissolved methane concentrations in the river water. Relatively high concentrations of dissolved methane (0.7-1.1 mu mol l(-1), or mu M) were observed in four tributary areas in 2017 during the flood's recession, while the values remained low in the main channel (0.2-0.3 mu M). In contrast, the concentrations of dissolved methane were low in both the main channel and tributaries during the non-flood period of 2016 (0.1-0.2 mu M). We then used 2017 satellite reflectance data with an empirical model to estimate the spatial differences of dissolved methane concentration for water sources contributing to the methane-poor main channel and methane-rich tributaries and applied the results to the calculation of riverine methane in the study region (approx. 200 x 300 km). This approach to estimating dissolved methane concentrations using satellite reflectance can provide a new tool for environmental monitoring of flood events in remote areas.

TI  - Experimental field evidence that out-group threats influence within-group behavior
T2  - BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In social species, conspecific outsiders present various threats to groups and their members. These out-group threats are predicted to affect subsequent within-group interactions (e.g., affiliation and aggression) and individual behavior (e.g., foraging and vigilance decisions). However, experimental investigations of such consequences are rare, especially in natural conditions. We used field-based call playbacks and fecal presentations on habituated wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula)-a cooperatively breeding, territorial species-to examine postinteraction responses to the simulated threat of a rival group. Dwarf mongooses invested more in grooming of groupmates, foraged closer together, and more regularly acted as sentinels (a raised guard) after encountering indicators of rival-group presence compared to control conditions. These behavioral changes likely arise from greater anxiety and, in the case of increased vigilance, the need to seek additional information about the threat. The influence of an out-group threat lasted at least 1 h but individuals of different dominance status and sex responded similarly, potentially because all group members suffer costs if a contest with rivals is lost. Our results provide field-based experimental evidence from wild animals that out-group threats can influence within-group behavior and decision making, and suggest the need for greater consideration of the lasting impacts of social conflict.

TI  - Night-time lights and their influence on summer night land surface temperature in two urban cities of Zimbabwe: A geospatial perspective
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Owing to the developments that exist in urban landscapes, urban areas experience climates that are different from their surroundings even when in the same climatic region. This is a prominent phenomenon in most urban areas and is commonly known as Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI). An understanding of some of the drivers of SUHI is imperative for cities worldwide if they endeavor to suppress the socio-economic mishaps related to extremely high UHI. In this study, we sought to explain the drivers of SUHI in two developing cities in Zimbabwe using remote sensing data. We do this through the use of a classification and regression model. The model used climate, land descriptors and anthropogenic activity data as predictor variables against summer night land surface temperature. Using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE) for evaluation, modelled SUHI was strongly related to actual SUHI. We also found out that night-time lights, a proxy of anthropogenic activity, contributed more to summer night surface urban heat island as compared to other variables used in the study. This study adds more knowledge on the likely drivers of UHI for southern African cities. By identifying SUHI drivers in urban cities, it is plausible to formulate policies or initiatives that regulate extreme summer night SUHI.

TI  - WorldView-2 Data for Hierarchical Object-Based Urban Land Cover Classification in Kigali: Integrating Rule-Based Approach with Urban Density and Greenness Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of high-resolution satellite data, such as WorldView-2, has opened the opportunity for urban land cover mapping at fine resolution. However, it is not straightforward to map detailed urban land cover and to detect urban deprived areas, such as informal settlements, in complex urban environments based merely on high-resolution spectral features. Thus, approaches integrating hierarchical segmentation and rule-based classification strategies can play a crucial role in producing high quality urban land cover maps. This study aims to evaluate the potential of WorldView-2 high-resolution multispectral and panchromatic imagery for detailed urban land cover classification in Kigali, Rwanda, a complex urban area characterized by a subtropical highland climate. A multi-stage object-based classification was performed using support vector machines (SVM) and a rule-based approach to derive 12 land cover classes with the input of WorldView-2 spectral bands, spectral indices, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture measures and a digital terrain model (DTM). In the initial classification, confusion existed among the informal settlements, the high- and low-density built-up areas, as well as between the upland and lowland agriculture. To improve the classification accuracy, a framework based on a geometric ruleset and two newly defined indices (urban density and greenness density indices) were developed. The novel framework resulted in an overall classification accuracy at 85.36% with a kappa coefficient at 0.82. The confusion between high- and low-density built-up areas significantly decreased, while informal settlements were successfully extracted with the producer and user's accuracies at 77% and 90% respectively. It was revealed that the integration of an object-based SVM classification of WorldView-2 feature sets and DTM with the geometric ruleset and urban density and greenness indices resulted in better class separability, thus higher classification accuracies in complex urban environments.

TI  - Assessing edge effect on the spatial distribution of selected forest biochemical properties derived using the Worldview data in Dukuduku forests, South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work explores the potential of the high-resolution WorldView-2 sensor in quantifying edge effects on the spatial distribution of selected forest biochemical properties in fragmented Dukuduku forest in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Specifically, we sought to map fragmented patches within forested areas in Dukuduku area, using very high spatial resolution WorldView-2 remotely sensed data and to statistically determine the effect of these fragmented patches on the spatial distribution of selected forest biochemical properties. Edge effects on carbon, LAI and foliar nitrogen were quantified based on the models derived by Omer et al. (IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing, 2015, 8, 4825). Edge effect statistical results on the spatial distribution of carbon, LAI and nitrogen showed significant (alpha = 0.05) variations with change in distance from fragmented patches (>150 m(2)). Forest foliar carbon concentrations significantly (p-value = 0.016) increased from 44.8% to 45.3% with increasing distance (25-375 m) from fragmented patches. A similar trend was observed for LAI. Nevertheless, for nitrogen the results show that its concentration significantly (p = 0.016) decreased with increase in distance from the fragmented patches. Overall, the findings of this work underscore the invaluable potential and strength of WorldView-2 data set in assessing edge effect on the spatial distribution of selected forest biochemical properties.

TI  - Estimation of foliar nitrogen using remotely sensed data: A quantitative review
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Several ecosystems have been significantly altered by anthropogenic nitrogen inputs. The timely estimation of nitrogen concentration is essential for ensuring environmental sustainability. Academic publications between 1966 and 2016 were reviewed to assess the potential of remotely sensed information to estimate nitrogen concentrations for various applications. A discriminatory keyword search and a set of inclusion criteria was used to develop a representative sample (n = 100). Results revealed that the global distribution of academic publications is skewed towards the Northern Hemisphere with the largest research gap occurring within Africa. Moreover, prior to 2006, research into the remote estimation of nitrogen had a minor presence in literature, with the agricultural sector being the most extensively researched (56%). Freely available, high spatial and temporal resolution imagery has afforded research into the remote estimation of nitrogen in the African continent, particularly in the subject area of policy and management, the capacity to grow.

TI  - DSM and DTM generation from VHR satellite stereo imagery over plastic covered greenhouse areas
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Review
AB  - Agriculture under Plastic Covered Greenhouses (PCG) has represented a step forward in the evolution from traditional to industrial farming. However, PCG-based agricultural model has been also criticized for its associated environmental impact such as plastic waste, visual impact, soil pollution, biodiversity degradation and local runoff alteration. In this sense, timely and effective PCG mapping is the only way to help policy-makers in the definition of plans dealing with the trade-off between farmers' profit and environmental impact for the remaining inhabitants.This work proposes a methodological pipeline for producing high added value 3D geospatial products (Digital Surface Models (DSM) and Digital Terrain Models (DTM)) from VHR satellite imagery over PCG areas. The 3D information layer provided through the devised approach could be very valuable as a complement to the traditional 2D spectral information offered by VHR satellite imagery to improve PCG mapping over large areas.This methodological approach has been tested in Almeria (Southern Spain) from a WorldView-2 VHR satellite stereo-pair. Once grid spacing format DSM and DTM were built, their vertical accuracy was assessed by means of lidar data provided by the Spanish Government (PNOA Programme).Regarding DSM completeness results, the image matching method based on hierarchical semi-global matching yielded much better scores (98.87%) than the traditional image matching method based on area-based matching and cross-correlation threshold (86.65%) when they were tested on the study area with the highest concentration of PCG (around 85.65% of PCG land cover). However, both image matching methods yielded similar vertical accuracy results in relation to the finally interpolated DSM, with mean errors ranging from 0.01 to 0.35 m and random errors (standard deviation) between 0.56 and 0.82 m. The DTM error figures also showed no significant differences between both image matching methods, although being highly dependent on DSM-to-DTM filtering error, in turn closely related to greenhouse density and terrain complexity.

TI  - Migratory flight on the Pacific Flyway: strategies and tendencies of wind drift compensation
T2  - BIOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Applications of remote sensing data to monitor bird migration usher a new understanding of magnitude and extent of movements across entire flyways. Millions of birds move through the western USA, yet this region is understudied as a migratory corridor. Characterizing movements in the Pacific Flyway offers a unique opportunity to study complementary patterns to those recently highlighted in the Atlantic and Central Flyways. We use weather surveillance radar data from spring and autumn (1995-2018) to examine migrants' behaviours in relation to winds in the Pacific Flyway. Overall, spring migrants tended to drift on winds, but less so at northern latitudes and farther inland from the Pacific coastline. Relationships between winds and autumn flight behaviours were less striking, with no latitudinal or coastal dependencies. Differences in the preferred direction of movement (PDM) and wind direction predicted drift patterns during spring and autumn, with increased drift when wind direction and PDM differences were high. We also observed greater total flight activity through the Pacific Flyway during the spring when compared with the autumn. Such complex relationships among birds' flight strategies, winds and seasonality highlight the variation within a migration system. Characterizations at these scales complement our understanding of strategies to clarify aerial animal movements.

TI  - Effect of the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 trial on axillary management in breast cancer patients in the Australian setting
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 Trial demonstrated that early breast cancer patients with positive axillary sentinel lymph nodes treated with breast-conserving surgery and breast radiotherapy had no additional oncologic benefit of proceeding to an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The extent to which practice has changed in Australia remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Z0011 trial on the management of positive axillary sentinel nodes at an Australian institutional level. We reviewed all breast cancer cases treated at the Sydney Adventist Hospital over a 10-year period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. Patients who fulfilled the Z0011 trial criteria were selected. These patients were divided into two groups according to the year of surgery, before and after 1 January 2011 when the Z0011 study was published. Clinicopathologic data and axillary surgical management were compared. Of the 237 patients fulfilling the Z0011 trial criteria, there were 73 patients before and 158 patients after 1 January 2011. In the earlier group the rate of proceeding to an ALND following a positive sentinel node was 78.1% compared to 43.7% in the latter group (P < 0.0001). There was a significant decline in the rate of ALND over this 10-year period (r = -0.79, P = 0.006). The Z0011 trial has influenced the surgical management of the axilla leading to a significant reduction in the rate of an ALND in patients fulfilling the Z0011 trial criteria at our institution.

The main aims of this study are: the petrographic, geotechnical and structural characterization of the Boboyo rockmass (Cameroon); the mapping of the fracture network of the site using satellite data SRTM; and the morpho-surface evaluation of the rock-mass. The field campaigns were carried out on a scale between 1/100 and 1/1000. They enabled to identify the occurrence of plagioclase, microcline, biotite and oxides distributed on the site, confirming the granitic nature of the rock-mass. The classification of the samples by the geotechnical tests,took into account the five-point compensation rule, introduced by the NFP18-545 standard. Thus the Los-Angeles and Micro-Deval tests gave respective values of 31.8% and 10.3%. The samples showed a resistance to dynamic fragmentation of 23.10%. The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was obtained from a triangulated irregular network (TIN). It allowed modeling, analyzing and visualizing the phenomena related to the topographic surface. The map of the lineaments showed on the structural plane, 162 lineaments distributed in a principal direction N-S and two preferential directions N-S and E-W, which represent the set of brittle structures (fracture, diaclase, vein, paraclase) attributed to a phase of intense deformation of the rock-mass. The total length of the lineaments is 11279.83 m, with maximum length of a lineament at 1443.5 m, and mean length of lineament about 352.49 m. The morpho-surface automatic extraction enabled to estimate the area of the already exploited rock-mass at approximately 23730.774 m(2) and the unexploited area at approximately 271317.655 m(2).

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF GENERAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMultimorbidity is a complex issue in modern medicine and a more nuanced understanding of how this phenomenon occurs over time is needed.AimTo determine the prevalence, characteristics, and patterns of patients living with multimorbidity, specifically the unique combinations (unordered patterns) and unique permutations (ordered patterns) of multimorbidity in primary care.Design and settingA retrospective cohort analysis of the prospectively collected data from 1990 to 2013 from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network electronic medical record database.MethodAdult primary care patients who were aged >= 18 years at their first recorded encounter were followed over time. A list of 20 chronic condition categories was used to detect multimorbidity. Computational analyses were conducted using the Multimorbidity Cluster Analysis Tool to identify all combinations and permutations.ResultsMultimorbidity, defined as two or more and three or more chronic conditions, was prevalent among adult primary cam patients and most of these patients were aged <65 years. Among female patients with two or more chronic conditions, 6075 combinations and 14 891 permutations were detected. Among male patients with three or more chronic conditions, 4296 combinations and 9716 permutations were detected. While specific patterns were identified, combinations and permutations became increasingly rare as the total number of chronic conditions and patient age increased.ConclusionThis research confirms that multimorbidity is common in primary care and provides empirical evidence that clinical management requires a tailored. patient-centred approach. While the prevalence of multimorbidity was found to increase with increasing patient age, the largest proportion of patients with multimorbidity in this study <65 years.

TI  - Clinical importance and surgical management of sentinel lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa of melanoma patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Patients with a primary melanoma below the knee may have lymphatic drainage to a sentinel node (SN) in the popliteal fossa. The purpose of this study was to analyze lymphatic drainage to this site and to describe clinical features and surgical management of SNs in the popliteal fossa.Methods: Patients with a primary melanoma below the knee presenting to Melanoma Institute Australia between 1992 and 2013 were analyzed. Those found to have a popliteal SN were evaluated. Data on imaging, SN biopsy, completion lymph node dissection, morbidity and follow-up were analyzed.Results: Lymphoscintigraphy showed drainage to a popliteal SN in 176 of 3902 cases of melanoma below the knee (4.5%). In 96 of these patients (55%) a popliteal SN biopsy was attempted. The procedure failed to identify the node(s) in seventeen of them (18%). Thirteen of the 79 patients (17%) had a positive popliteal SN and in eight (10%) this was the only positive node. The tumor stage of ten patients (13%) changed as a result of the popliteal node biopsy. A positive popliteal node was associated with an increased risk of recurrence and diminished overall survival. Popliteal SN biopsy did not improve regional control or survival.Conclusion: Melanomas below the knee infrequently drain to lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa. Although popliteal SN biopsy can be challenging, it is worthwhile, providing improved staging and guiding subsequent management.

TI  - Cloud fraction retrieval and its variability during daytime from ground-based sky imagery over a tropical station in India
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total Sky Imager (TSI) is operated at a high altitude station in the Western Ghats of the Indian sub-continent from June 2012 to June 2013. The TSI image content is classified as clear, thin and thick clouds using red blue ratio (RBR) threshold technique and then cloud fraction (CF) is retrieved. An algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy of CF retrieval, by adapting the methodologies used in earlier studies and new developments are suggested in sections of the validation of clear sky image and the aerosol correction factor. Time series of thin, thick and total CF are constructed for each day at 5 min interval. These measurements at high temporal resolution are first of their kind over a tropical station in India. Both thick and thin CFs showed high temporal variability. The transition from one season to another season also showed distinct CF variability. Monthly mean CF showed a mono model distribution in the winter months (December and January) and a bimodal distribution in the pre-monsoon months (March, April, May) including February. During the monsoon season (JJAS) about 90% CF is observed throughout the day. The post-monsoon months (October, November) show a bimodal distribution with one peak in the morning hours and another peak in the afternoon hours. Unlike thin CF, total and thick CFs showed almost similar variability. The comparison of CF retrieved from MODIS (Terra and Aqua) and TSI showed a good correlation for overcast sky conditions, while partial cloudy skies showed less correlation due to the effect of satellite viewing angles. Such continuous measurements of CF at high temporal resolution are essential for cloud radiative forcing studies.

TI  - A Novel Approach to SAR Ocean Wind Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach to a Bayesian ocean wind retrieval from high-range bandwidth synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is demonstrated and validated using global Sentinel-1 (S1) A and B WV data acquired in October 2016 and January 2017. These spectral parameters are defined from the full-resolution image cross spectra. The first parameter is the integral spectral value (ISV) defined as the signed spectral energy at high-range wavenumber. Two other parameters, the azimuth phase plane slope (APPS) and range phase plane slope (RPPS), are the slope of the phase plane from the image cross spectra. Together with the normalized radar cross section (NRCS), these parameters form the input to our data-driven model for ocean wind retrieval. The model is trained on S1B from October 2016 data and validated on S1A and S1B from January 2017 data colocated with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) atmospheric wind model as "ground" truth. The APPS proves to be the result of two sinusoidal functions, one symmetric and one antisymmetric, the antisymmetric part is in direct relation with the azimuth wind direction. Our Bayesian model achieves standard deviations of 1.73 m/s and 49.26 degrees for January 2017 S1B data set with a bias of 0.03 m/s and -1.55 degrees, corresponding results for January 2017 S1A data were 1.79 m/s and 49.95 degrees with biases 0.41 m/s and -1.89 degrees. Including data with ECMWF wind speed above 7 m/s we achieve standard deviations of 1.81 m/s and 33.16 degrees with biases 0.1 m/s and -1.31 degrees for the January 2017 S1B data set.

T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The on chip communication intention is difficult due to communication necessities and the difficulty of the objective application is great. Notably, different communication areas might be actualized utilizing a similar chip range, for example, to enable various parallel applications to be stacked onto the device. So the system on chip (SoC) deployed in different topologies with different design parameters to achieve the requirements of the target application. Classical communication methods such as point to point, the bus is not an appropriate solution for future SoCs. That is difficult to send signals starting with one end then onto the next term of a clock cycle. Issues, for example, global wire delay and global synchronization will restrict us. With a specific end goal to beat these problems, architect utilizes new models, procedures, and tools from network design field and apply them to SoCs plan that prompts modern worldview called network on a chip. In this paper, the design components used and the operation of the proposed architecture is same with network on chip (NoC) approach. But it differs in the communication architecture with the introduction of the on-chip peripheral bus. And it differs from the NoC by its switching networks. We modified the switching system that is developed to support dynamically reconfigurable network. Due to this modification in the switching system restrict the area and the power use of the NoC.

TI  - Erosion risk assessment through morphometric indices for prioritisation of Arjuna watershed using ALOS-PALSAR DEM
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Pressure of growing population rates and unsustainable usage of resources have greatly affected the productivity of agricultural lands due to land degradation. In a developing country such as India, degradation of land happens mainly due to the action of fluvial resources. The morphometric analysis of the drainage basin and channel network gives a detailed understanding of the geo-hydrological behaviour of drainage basin and expresses the prevailing climate, geology, geomorphology, and structural antecedents of the catchment which is very decisive in identifying regions vulnerable to soil erosion. Advancement in Remote Sensing (DEM) products and GIS techniques has made the assessment of morphometric indices more accurate, effective and less time consuming. Therefore, in this study, to assess the vulnerability of soil erosion in Arjuna watershed of vaippar basin, morphometric indices-based prioritisation of 16 sub-watersheds have been carried out using high-resolution ALOS-PALSAR DEM with a spatial resolution of 12.5m. The linear and shape parameters which are responsible for soil erodability are assigned ranking using Compound Factor (CF) technique to arrive at the prioritisation of sub-watersheds. Based on the CF values, sub-watershed are classified into three categories of priority as high (5-7), medium (7-9), and low (9-12), respectively. The sub-watersheds such as Kamba Ittu Malai, Arjuna Nadi, Mela Gopulapuram, and Kodikulam come under the high priority category, whereas Muvaraivenran, Thaniparai, Chittar River,Vadugapatti, Perumalswamiuchi, Ayan Karisalkulam, Kurukkamuttu malai, and Satpur R.F come under the medium priority category and the Ramachandrapuram, Arjunapuram, Kovil Aru, and Periyar River sub-watersheds come under the low priority category.

TI  - Merkel cell carcinoma of the eyelid: A review
T2  - SURVEY OF OPHTHALMOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, aggressive tumor of both epithelial and neuroendocrine origin, which carries a mortality rate of up to 40%. MCC tumors typically present as painless, expanding nodules on the sun-exposed skin areas of older, white patients. Eyelid and periocular tumors comprise approximately 2.5% of all cases of MCC and may be mistaken for chalazia or basal cell carcinomas. Immunosuppression is a significant risk factor, particularly in solid-organ-transplant recipients, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and patients with HIV. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often used for accurate staging of head and neck MCC. Treatment includes wide local excision, commonly with the addition of radiotherapy for improved locoregional disease control. Historically, adjuvant chemotherapy had been reserved for metastatic disease, but immunotherapy and targeted chemotherapies are currently being investigated for use in primary disease. The clinical characteristics of all available published cases of eyelid MCC are summarized in this article. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Comparison of statistical algorithms for daily syndromic surveillance aberration detection
T2  - BIOINFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Motivation: Public health authorities can provide more effective and timely interventions to protect populations during health events if they have effective multi-purpose surveillance systems. These systems rely on aberration detection algorithms to identify potential threats within large datasets. Ensuring the algorithms are sensitive, specific and timely is crucial for protecting public health. Here, we evaluate the performance of three detection algorithms extensively used for syndromic surveillance: the 'rising activity, multilevel mixed effects, indicator emphasis' (RAMMIE) method and the improved quasi-Poisson regression-based method known as 'Farrington Flexible' both currently used at Public Health England, and the 'Early Aberration Reporting System' (EARS) method used at the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. We model the wide range of data structures encountered within the daily syndromic surveillance systems used by PHE. We undertake extensive simulations to identify which algorithms work best across different types of syndromes and different outbreak sizes. We evaluate RAMMIE for the first time since its introduction. Performance metrics were computed and compared in the presence of a range of simulated outbreak types that were added to baseline data.Results: We conclude that amongst the algorithm variants that have a high specificity (i.e. >90%), Farrington Flexible has the highest sensitivity and specificity, whereas RAMMIE has the highest probability of outbreak detection and is the most timely, typically detecting outbreaks 2-3 days earlier.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Assessment of Changing Land Surface Temperature and Depleting Water in the Lake Chad Area
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Chad is located at the south of the Sahara Desert in an arid region. The lake's water resources are under severe pressure due to the basic needs of the growing population around the lake, global warming, and increasing irrigation demands. Numerous land cover change studies have measured the rate of depletion of the lake's surface water. However, the contribution of the increasing high temperatures in the region which is also a compounding factor has received little attention. In this study, an assessment of the changes in surface water extent of Lake Chad from 1973-2017 was carried out through a land cover analysis. The potential influence of the rising land surface temperatures on the water losses was also studied. The extraction of the land cover was done using maximum likelihood classification. The results show that between 1973 and 1987, the lake lost 12,796.81km(2) of its surface water area. This period coincided with a season of drought and dry seasons reported to have occurred in the lake's area during the 1970s. Between 1987 and 2003, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +1.54 degrees C and +962.71km(2) respectively. Between 2003 and 2017, average temperature rise and change in surface water area was +3.69 degrees C and -25.17km(2) respectively. These results provide further evidence of the alarming rate of water loss in the lake's environment, and suggest a link between rising land surface temperatures and diminution of the lake's water. The findings inform efforts directed at addressing the ecological problem facing the lake.

TI  - African Art in Deep Time: De-race-ing Aesthetics and De-racializing Visual Art
T2  - JOURNAL OF AESTHETICS AND ART CRITICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In two essays in the ART/Artifact (1988) exhibition catalog, white American museum curator Susan Vogel and white American philosopher Arthur Danto pronounce that Africans do not distinguish between art and nonart. Although seemingly objective empirical statements, their assertions about Africa and its art are racially based ruminations of a white supremacist worldview. I argue that in theorizing within the category of race they produced racialized aesthetics that commit the Eurocentric fallacy of upholding systemic racist objectives. I argue that (1) their assertions fail to be about African art, but about hegemony and power; (2) as the longest enduring artistic activity of humanity, African art is an important check to racialized aesthetics; (3) art is produced outside the category of race and from a critically conscious awareness of the world; and (4) art bespeaks creativity and presupposes the artistic and moral values of a culture in the manipulation and transformation of physical reality.

TI  - Metachronous Contralateral Male Breast Cancer: Case Report and Literature Review
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and consequently understudied. Here we present the case of contralateral breast cancer in a male patient nearly a quarter century following his initial breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. The epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, characterization, treatment, and prognosis of male breast cancer are reviewed. MBC accounts for <1% of all breast cancer with an estimated incidence nearly 1.25 per 100,000 person years. Our patient tested positive for ATM mutation of undetermined significance. More commonly in males, a BRCA2 mutation confers a >1 in 15 lifetime risk of breast cancer and is present in >11% of MBC patients, while BRCA1 is present in an estimated <1.5% of MBC patients. The risk of contralateral breast cancer developing in a male with a unilateral lesion is much higher than for a primary male breast cancer in the general population. Men tend to be diagnosed at a later age and stage than females. Prognosis for male and female breast cancer is similar considering both age of patient and stage of the tumor at diagnosis, and similar treatment paradigms have resulted in similar outcomes. Although lumpectomy with radiation therapy may have the same prognosis as mastectomy, the standard of care for male breast cancer continues to be simple mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy.

M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito surveillance in large urban areas of the southern USA that border Mexico has become increasingly important due to recent transmission of Zika virus and chikungunya virus in the Americas as well as the continued threat of dengue and West Nile viruses. The vectors of these viruses, Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Culex quinquefasciatus, co-occur in residential areas, requiring vector control entities to deploy several different trap types, often expensive and labor-intensive, to surveil these ecologically different species. We evaluated the use of a single trap type, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention autocidal gravid ovitraps (AGOs), to monitor all 3 vector species across residential neighborhoods in San Antonio, TX, over 12 wk (epiweeks 24-35). Mosquito abundance was highest early in our surveillance period (epiweek 25) and was driven largely by Cx. quinquefasciatus. The AGOs collected significantly more Cx. quinquefasciatus than both Aedes species, with more Ae. aegypti collected than Ae. albopictus. The average number of Ae. aegypti captured per trap was consistent across most neighborhoods except for 2 areas where one had significantly the highest and the other with the lowest mosquitoes collected per trap. The average number of Ae. albopictus captured per trap varied with no clear pattern, and Cx. quinquefasciatus were trapped most often near forested hill country neighborhoods. These results indicate that AGOs are appropriate for detecting and tracking the relative abundance of Ae. aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Cx. quinquefasciatus across a large and diverse urban landscape over time and therefore may be an inexpensive and streamlined option for vector surveillance programs in large cities.

TI  - Extinction thresholds and negative responses of Afrotropical ant-following birds to forest cover loss in oil palm and agroforestry landscapes
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Afrotropical ant-following birds are vulnerable to forest loss and disturbance, but critical habitat thresholds regarding their abundance and species richness in human-dominated landscapes, including industrial oil palm plantations, have never been assessed. We measured forest cover through Landsat imagery and recorded species richness and relative abundance of 20 ant-following birds in 48 plots of 1-km(2), covering three landscapes of Southwest Cameroon: Korup National Park, smallholder agroforestry areas (with farms embedded in forest), and an industrial oil palm plantation. We evaluated differences in encounter frequency and species richness among landscapes, and the presence of critical thresholds through enhanced adaptive regression through hinges. All species were detected in Korup National Park and the agroforestry landscape, which had similar forest cover (>85%). Only nine species were found in the oil palm plantation (forest cover = 10.3 +/- 3.3%). At the 1-km(2) scale, the number of species and bird encounters were comparable in agroforests and the protected area: mean species richness ranged from 12.2 +/- 0.6 in the park and 12.2 +/- 0.6 in the agroforestry matrix to 1.0 +/- 0.4 in the industrial oil palm plantation; whereas encounters decreased from 34.4 +/- 3.2 to 26.1 +/- 2.9 and 1.3 +/- 0.4, respectively. Bird encounters decreased linearly with decreasing forest cover, down to an extinction threshold identified at 24% forest cover. Species richness declined linearly by ca. one species per 7.4% forest cover lost. We identified an extinction threshold at 52% forest cover for the most sensitive species (Criniger chloronotus, Dicrurus atripennis, and Neocossyphus poensis). Our results show that substantial proportions of forests are required to sustain complete ant-following bird assemblages in Afrotropical landscapes and confirm the high sensitivity of this bird guild to deforestation after industrial oil palm development. Securing both forest biodiversity and food production in an Afrotropical production landscape may be best attained through a combination of protected areas and wildlife-friendly agroforestry.

TI  - THE NEW DATA OF STUDENT DEBT
T2  - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Where you go to college and what you choose to study has always been important, but, with the help of data science, it may now determine whether you get a student loan. Silicon Valley is increasingly setting its sights on student lending. Financial technology ("fintech") firms such as SoFi, CommonBond, and Upstart are ever-expanding their online lending activities to help students finance or refinance educational expenses. These online companies are using a wide array of alternative, education-based data points-ranging from applicants' chosen majors, assessment scores, the college or university they attend, job history, and cohort default rates-to determine creditworthiness. Fintech firms argue that through their low overhead and innovative approaches to lending they are able to widen access to credit for underserved Americans. Indeed, there is much to recommend regarding the use of different kinds of information about young consumers in order assess their financial ability. Student borrowers are notoriously disadvantaged by the extant scoring system that heavily favors having a past credit history. Yet there are also downsides to the use of education-based, alternative data by private lenders. This Article critiques the use of this education-based information, arguing that while it can have a positive effect in promoting social mobility, it could also have significant downsides. Chief among these are reifying existing credit barriers along lines of wealth and class and further contributing to discriminatory lending practices that harm women, black and Latino Americans, and other minority groups. The discrimination issue is particularly salient because of the novel and opaque underwriting algorithms that facilitate these online loans. This Article concludes by proposing three-pillared regulatory guidance for private student lenders to use in designing, implementing, and monitoring their education-based data lending programs.

TI  - Mapping cropland extent of Southeast and Northeast Asia using multi-year time-series Landsat 30-m data using a random forest classifier on the Google Earth Engine Cloud
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland extent maps are useful components for assessing food security. Ideally, such products are a useful addition to countrywide agricultural statistics since they are not politically biased and can be used to calculate cropland area for any spatial unit from an individual farm to various administrative unites (e.g., state, county, district) within and across nations, which in turn can be used to estimate agricultural productivity as well as degree of disturbance on food security from natural disasters and political conflict. However, existing cropland extent maps over large areas (e.g., Country, region, continent, world) are derived from coarse resolution imagery (250 m to 1 km pixels) and have many limitations such as missing fragmented and\or small farms with mixed signatures from different crop types and\or farming practices that can be, confused with other land cover. As a result, the coarse resolution maps have limited useflness in areas where fields are small ( < 1 ha), such as in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, coarse resolution cropland maps have known uncertainties in both geo-precision of cropland location as well as accuracies of the product. To overcome these limitations, this research was conducted using multi-date, multi-year 30-m Landsat time-series data for 3 years chosen from 2013 to 2016 for all Southeast and Northeast Asian Countries (SNACs), which included 7 refined agro-ecological zones (RAEZ) and 12 countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Japan, North Korea, Laos, South Korea, and Brunei). The 30-m (1 pixel = 0.09 ha) data from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM + ) were used in the study. Ten Landsat bands were used in the analysis (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1 SWIR2, Thermal, NDVI, NDWI, LSWI) along with additional layers of standard deviation of these 10 bands across 1 year, and global digital elevation model (GDEM)-derived slope and elevation bands. To reduce the impact of clouds, the Landsat imagery was time-composited over four time-periods (Period 1: January- April, Period 2: May-August, and Period 3: September-December) over 3-years. Period 4 was the standard deviation of all 10 bands taken over all images acquired during the 2015 calendar year. These four period composites, totaling 42 band data-cube, were generated for each of the 7 RAEZs. The reference training data (N = 7849) generated for the 7 RAEZ using sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) helped generate the knowledge-base to separate croplands from non-croplands. This knowledge-base was used to code and run a pixel-based random forest (RF) supervised machine learning algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing environment to separate croplands from non-croplands. The resulting cropland extent products were evaluated using an independent reference validation dataset (N = 1750) in each of the 7 RAEZs as well as for the entire SNAC area. For the entire SNAC area, the overall accuracy was 88.1% with a producer's accuracy of 81.6% (errors of omissions = 18.4%) and user's accuracy of 76.7% (errors of commissions = 23.3%). For each of the 7 RAEZs overall accuracies varied from 83.2 to 96.4%. Cropland areas calculated for the 12 countries were compared with country areas reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and other national cropland statistics resulting in an R-2 value of 0.93.The cropland areas of provinces were compared with the province statistics that showed an R-2 = 0.95 for South Korea and R-2 = 0.94 for Thailand. The cropland products are made available on an interactive viewer at www.croplands. org and for download at National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC): https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/node/1281.

TI  - Bluetongue in Europe - the risk of animal import from restricted zones
T2  - MEDYCYNA WETERYNARYJNA-VETERINARY MEDICINE-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Bluetongue (BT) is a vector-borne viral disease effecting ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV), transmitted mainly by bites from midges of the genus Culicoides. Since the end of 20th century, BTV is endemic in several European countries and the disease is caused mainly by BTV-8 and BTV-4 infections. Bluetongue virus is characterized by high genetic diversity. To date, over 29 BTV serotypes have been documented, including recently discovered atypical serotypes BTV (25-27). The disease has a high economic impact as it causes economic losses due to animal mortality, reduced productivity and restrictions on the movement of animals. Several reports and numerous observations indicate the contribution of animal movements to the spread of BTV infections. Thus, bluetongue surveillance that includes testing of sentinel animals as well as virological testing of animals susceptible to BTV infection imported from restricted zones due to the presence of BTV is a key factor in maintaining a BT-free status.

TI  - Multidrug-resistant <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> isolated from canine faeces in a public park in Quito, Ecuador
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study focused on estimating the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases, carbapenemases and MCR-1-producing Escherichia coli in canine faeces from a public park in Quito, Ecuador.Methods: Phenotypic and genotypic characterisation of E. coli isolated from 50 canine faecal samples recovered from a city park in Quito was performed. In addition, a multiple choice survey was conducted among 50 dog owners.Results: Of the 50 faecal samples, 20 (40.0%) presented E. coli resistant to ceftriaxone. Moreover, 23 E. coli isolates were recovered for further analysis. All of the isolates showed as multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype (resistant to three or more antibiotic families). Resistance to carbapenems, tigecycline and amikacin was not observed. No major clonal relatedness was observed among the resistant isolates. The ESBL genes bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-55) and bla(CTX-M-65) were the most common. Two isolates harboured the bla(CMY-2) gene and one isolate harboured both mcr-1 and bla(CTX-M-65). Statistical analysis showed that older people were more conscious of collecting and disposing of dog faeces than subjects aged <35 years (P < 0.05).Conclusion: The finding of MDR E. coli in dog faeces in a city park in Ecuador illustrates the importance of analysing canine faeces in public settings (e.g. parks, playgrounds) as part of surveillance programmes for MDR E. coli. In addition, this research might be a sentinel sampling method to gain a better understanding of community sources of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae at human-animal-environment interfaces.

TI  - Global Detection of Long-Term (1982-2017) Burned Area with AVHRR-LTDR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the first global burned area (BA) product derived from the land long term data record (LTDR), a long-term 0.05-degree resolution dataset generated from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) images. Daily images were combined in monthly composites using the maximum temperature criterion to enhance the burned signal and eliminate clouds and artifacts. A synthetic BA index was created to improve the detection of the BA signal. This index included red and near infrared reflectance, surface temperature, two spectral indices, and their temporal differences. Monthly models were generated using the random forest classifier, using the twelve monthly composites of each year as the predictors. Training data were obtained from the NASA MCD64A1 collection 6 product (500 m spatial resolution) for eight years of the overlapping period (2001-2017). This included some years with low and high fire occurrence. Results were tested with the remaining eight years. Pixels classified as burned were converted to burned proportions using the MCD64A1 product. The final product (named FireCCILT10) estimated BA in 0.05-degree cells for the 1982 to 2017 period (excluding 1994, due to input data gaps). This product is the longest global BA currently available, extending almost 20 years back from the existing NASA and ESA BA products. BA estimations from the FireCCILT10 product were compared with those from the MCD64A1 product for continental regions, obtaining high correlation values (r(2) 0.9), with better agreement in tropical regions rather than boreal regions. The annual average of BA of the time series was 3.12 Mkm(2). Tropical Africa had the highest proportion of burnings, accounting for 74.37% of global BA. Spatial trends were found to be similar to existing global BA products, but temporal trends showed unstable annual variations, most likely linked to the changes in the AVHRR sensor and orbital decays of the NOAA satellites.

TI  - GROUND DEFORMATION ASSESSMENT OF THE ALBERTINE GRABEN USING INSAR
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on deformation of the land surface is vital for planning of infrastructure especially in areas such as the Albertine graben with substantial amounts of oil discoveries. Traditionally, global positioning systems, precise leveling and geotechnical techniques have been used for assessing and monitoring ground deformations. While these techniques provide accurate information, they are point based, expensive, time consuming and labour intensive over large area monitoring. This study explored an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) approach for mapping deformation over Buliisa oil discovery area located in the Western arm of the East African rift valley. The method was implemented by measuring the phase differences of ALOS PALSAR data acquired between 2007 and 2011. Deformation estimates varied between -0.45m to +0.34m while the mean displacements varied from -0.10m to 0.089m. High ground deformation was detected in the Southern, North Eastern and North Western parts contributed by agricultural activity and drilling pad constructions. Generally, analysis of ALOS PALSAR data using InSAR approach provides a viable option for assessing land surface deformation in Buliisa oil exploration area.

TI  - Evaluation of Luojia 1-01 nighttime light imagery for impervious surface detection: A comparison with NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface detection is significant to urban dynamic monitoring and environment management. One of the most effective approaches to evaluating the impervious surface is the use of nighttime light imagery. However, little work on this subject was carried out with the new generation nighttime light data from Luojia 1-01 satellite, which has a finer spatial resolution than the predecessors such as the nightlight data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Satellite. Therefore, this study conducted the first investigation of the capacity of Luojia 1-01 nighttime light data in detecting the extent and degree of impervious surfaces. Focusing on three cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, several maps of the spatial extent of impervious surface areas were first extracted from two types of nighttime lights data (Luojia 1-01 and NPP-VIIRS data) by applying a dynamic threshold segmentation method. Meanwhile, a series of polynomial regression models were adopted to estimate the relation between imperiousness degree and light intensity. The results compared with the reference data derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) show that Luojia 1-01 data can produce a more precise map of the spatial extent of impervious surfaces than NPP-VIIRS data owing to the finer spatial resolution and the wider measurement range. Nevertheless, Luojia 1-01 data failed to provide reliable estimates of the imperviousness degree in comparison with NPP-VIIRS data as this nighttime light imagery with finer spatial resolution can better discriminate the surfaces that have the same imperviousness degree but are illuminated with different light intensities, consequently resulting in a weak correlation between imperviousness degree and light intensity. The over- and under-estimates of imperviousness degree suggested an increase in spatial resolution of nightlight imagery does not always improve the accuracy and reliability of nighttime light-based estimations. These study results confirmed that Luojia 1-01 nightlight imagery is a potential and promising data source for mapping the spatial extent of impervious surface areas, but difficult to accurately estimate the imperviousness degree. Future research may improve the accuracy of imperviousness degree estimation by integrating the Luojia 1-01 nightlight imagery with other useful data sources.

TI  - Zonation of Landslide Susceptibility and Risk Assessment in Serchhip town, Mizoram
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A landslide is the downward-slope movement of soil, rock or organic material under the influence of gravity. It can be caused by a variety of reasons like intense or prolonged rainfall, earthquakes, geomorphology, slope variations and human activities. Landslides include debris flow, slide, toppling or falling movements, and many landslides exhibit a combination of two or more types of movements. Mizoram is one of the most disastrous landslide-prone areas in India. The state experienced landslides yearly during monsoon season. Landslides are a natural disaster. Though landslide occurs naturally, one of the main factors contributing to landslide in city and township can be credited to human interference. The topography of Mizoram is being relatively young; landslide can be a very major economic setbacks. Mostly there are N-S-trending anticlinal strike ridges with steep slopes and narrow intervening synclinal valleys with series of parallel ridges or topographic highs. The other landforms of the state are dissected ridges with deep gorges, spurs, keels, etc. Faulting has produced steep fault scarps. Thus, Mizoram, being a hilly terrain, is extremely prone to landslides. The extent of damage caused varies considerably from place to place, which is mainly caused by human activities and by geological processes assisted by environmental processes. The study area lies in the southern part of the Aizawl district. Remote sensing and GIS techniques are used. Recent advances of satellite remote sensing technology and geographical information system techniques have provided us a more in-depth approach to study landslide phenomena. In the present study, high-resolution satellite data such as QuickBird, IRS and Cartosat-I data were utilized to map the different landslide hazard zones of Serchhip town for undertaking mitigation measures and to identify potential zones of occurrences. Satellite data are utilized for mapping and preparing landslide hazard zones. An in-depth study of slope stability within Serchhip township was also carried out, and it was found that this locality of the town has been severely affected by subsidence and landslides, endangering the lives and property of the people. It was also found that the area comprises very soft shale and interbedded, weathered sandstone and siltstone, which belongs to the Middle Bhuban Formation of Surma Group of Tertiary age. Landslide risk assessment determines the expected degree of loss to landslide and its disruption of economic activities. The correlation of landslide susceptibility with major assets in the region helps to determine the risk assessment. Risk assessment is the final goal. The main objectives are to assess the risk, vulnerability of landslides and mapping, classify the zones of landslide hazards and suggest preventive and remedial measures, methods involving extensive fieldworks and data collections, creation of thematic layers and data analysis. From the present study, it is observed that human activities paired with natural factors have made many parts of Serchhip highly prone to landslides.

T2  - REVISTA PISTIS & PRAXIS-TEOLOGIA E PASTORAL
M3  - Article
AB  - While maintaining a radical relativism, postmodernity disrupts the fundamental concepts of traditional visions, rejecting completely a single and correct view of the world. If the medieval conception has focused on God and modernity on the external reality of the subject, there arises in the contemporary the centrality in the liquid, fluid and oscillating human perspective. Thus, although biblical testimony provides an irrefutable basis for Christ's purpose, a movement emerges within modern evangelicalism that, although enveloped in a new garb, seeks to bring to debate the validity of the doctrine of ecclesiology, offering judgment concerning its legitimacy. It is up to Christian Theology in its critical study to understand the history and development of logical-philosophical perceptions in order to make the concept of the church as a divine institution relevant in the present scenario as well.

TI  - Contending logics of strategic partnership in international politics
T2  - ASIA EUROPE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Faced with the emergence of strategic partnerships (SP), international actors have approached this new phenomenon in the international system through different logics of action. Such logics are tightly associated with the purposes that the SPs are intended to fulfill for the initiating actor. They also tend to reflect the worldview of the initiators as well as their perceptions of the major organizing principles of the international system. In this article, we investigate three different logics: the conventional, the relational, and the functional. These three logics correspond to the strategies of strategic partnering of the United States (US), China, and the European Union (EU) and reflect both the dominant foreign policy orientation of these actors and their self-perceptions as major poles of power in the world. We analyze the construction of these logics by focusing on the relative importance that each of them accords to interests and values when setting up SPs around the world. We contend that an important conceptual gap exists between the major initiators of strategic partnerships, the US and China, which are both to a large extent driven by a self-perception as Great Powers, although the logics with which they seek to fulfill this role diverge substantially. The EU pursues SPs according to a functional logic which in itself also diverge in significant aspects to both the US and China. Taken together, the interests which dictate the necessity of strategic partnerships and the values which condition their feasibility form four distinct patterns of partnering: the homogenous, marriage-of-convenience, come-in-handy, and heterogeneous SPs. These ideal forms of SPs have distinct but contrasting implications for the structure of the international system.

TI  - Detection of short-term urban land use changes by combining SAR time series images and spectral angle mapping
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban sprawl and re-construction of old towns have been leading to great changes of land use in cities of China. To witness short-term urban land use changes, rapid or real time remote sensing images and effective detection methods are required. With the availability of short repeat cycle, relatively high spatial resolution, and weather-independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remotely sensed data, detection of short-term urban land use changes becomes possible. This paper adopts newly released Sentinel-1 SAR data for urban change detection in Tianhe District of Guangzhou City in Southern China, where dramatic urban redevelopment practices have been taking place in past years. An integrative method that combines the SAR time series data and a spectral angle mapping (SAM) was developed and applied to detect the short-term land use changes. Linear trend transformations of the SAR time series data were first conducted to reveal patterns of substantial changes. Spectral mixture analysis was then conducted to extract temporal endmembers to reflect the land development patterns based on the SAR backscattering intensities over time. Moreover, SAM was applied to extract the information of significant increase and decrease patterns. The results of validation and method comparison showed a significant capability of both the proposed method and the SAR time series images for detecting the short-term urban land use changes. The method received an overall accuracy of 78%, being more accurate than that using a bi-temporal image change detection method. The results revealed land use conversions due to the removal of old buildings and their replacement by new construction. This implies that SAR time series data reflects the spatiotemporal evolution of urban constructed areas within a short time period and this study provided the potential for detecting changes that requires continuously short-term capability, and could be potential in other landscapes.

TI  - Can Preoperative Ultrasonography and MRI Replace Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Management of Axilla in Early Breast Cancer-a Prospective Study from a Tertiary Cancer Center
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although SLNB is a less invasive procedure in detecting axillary lymph node metastases(ALNM) in early breast cancer; still, it carries some complications like lymphedema and in addition, performing SLNB requires surgical skills, technical knowledge, presence of facility like preoperative sentinel lymphoscintigraphy, and availability of hand-held gamma probe for intraoperative assessment. We calculated the relative diagnostic strength of preoperative axillary USG and MRI and compared with of SLNB for detection of ALNM in early breast cancer and assessed whether MRI and USG could accurately predict axillary LN status, potentially replacing SLNB. We evaluated 40 cases of clinically node-negative early breast cancer with preoperative axillary USG and MRI and subsequently subjected to SLNB. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of axillary USG were 62.5%, 96.88%, 88.33%, 91.18%, and 90% respectively (p value < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of MRI in detection of ALNM were 75%, 93.75%, 75%, 93.75%, and 90% (p value < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy of combined USG and MRI in detection of ALNM were 87.5%,90.63%, 70%, 96.67%, and 90% respectively (p value < 0.001), which are comparable to previous study series. The diagnostic performance of combined approach of axillary USG and MRI is promising, as the NPV of combined USG and MRI is approaching the NPV of the SLNB in detecting ALNM. Based on above findings, if axillary LNs are found nonsuspicious in preoperative axillary USG and MRI, further axillary dissection may be avoided, and if found suspicious, then ALND may be directly proceeded avoiding SLNB in between.

TI  - Inventory of rock glaciers in Himachal Himalaya, India using high-resolution Google Earth imagery
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Little information about the number, spatial distribution, and characteristics of rock glaciers in Himachal Himalaya is available. This information is crucial to assess the hydrological contribution of permafrost regimes and to understand its response to changing climate. Employing high-resolution satellite data freely accessible through Google Earth, the first comprehensive rock glacier inventory of Himachal Himalaya is presented in this work. The inventory reports 516 rock glaciers in the study area corresponding to an estimated area of 353 km(2) of which 59% have glacier origin and 41% have talus origin. The frontal elevation of the lowest rock glacier in the Himachal Himalaya is 3052 m above sea level which was significantly low, whereas the highest rock glacier occurs at 5503 m above sea level. The mean minimum elevation of rock glaciers was 4484 m above sea level and the maximum was 4900 m above sea level. The majority of the rock glaciers have a northerly aspect (N, NE, NW) followed by westerly aspect signifying that slopes with lower potential incoming solar radiation favour the formation of rock glaciers. The mean annual surface temperature of the rock glaciers derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land surface temperature (1ST) product (MOD11B3) was -1.5 degrees C, with glacier-derived rock glaciers having colder surfaces than talus-derived rock glaciers. The topographical and climatological parameters greatly influenced the formation and development of rock glaciers. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Forest biomass estimation using remote sensing and field inventory: a case study of Tripura, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are the potential source for managing carbon sequestration, regulating climate variations and balancing universal carbon equilibrium between sources and sinks. Further, assessment of biomass, carbon stock, and its spatial distribution is prerequisite for monitoring the health of forest ecosystem. Moreover, vegetation field inventories are valuable source of data for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB), density, and the carbon stored in biomass of forest vegetation. In view of the importance of biomass, the present study makes an attempt to estimate temporal AGB of Tripura State, India, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), leaf area index (LAI) and the field inventory data through geospatial techniques. A model was developed for establishing the relationship between biomass, LAI, and NDVI in the selected study site. The study also aimed to improve method for quantifying and verifying inventory-based biomass stock estimation. The results demonstrate the correlation value obtained between LAI and NDVI were 0.87 and 0.53 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The correlation value between estimated AGB with LAI were found as 0.66 and 0.69, while with NDVI, the values were obtained as 0.64 and 0.94 for the years 2011 and 2014, respectively. The regression model of measured biomass with MODIS NDVI and LAI was developed for the data obtained during the period 2011-2014. The developed model was used to estimate the spatial distribution of biomass and its relationship between LAI and NDVI. The R-2 values obtained were 0.832 for estimated and the measured AGB during the training and 0.826 for the validation. The results indicate that the methodology adopted in this study can help in selecting best fit model for analyzing relationship between AGB and NDVI/LAI and for estimating biomass using allometric equation at various spatial scales. The developed output thematic map showed an average biomass distribution of 32-94 Mg ha(-1). The highest biomass values (72-95 Mg ha (-1)) was confined to the dense region of the forest while the lowest biomass values (32-46 Mg ha(-1)) was identified in the outer regions of the study site.

TI  - Land cover change detection using focused time delay neural network
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of improved satellite technology generates a huge amount of remote sensing data, these data play the crucial role in natural resource management. The land use and land cover (LULC) change intensely affects local environment, as well as the global environment. Therefore, the quantifiable knowledge about LULC changes occur in global scale is important to make effective planning for conservation and precise use of natural resources, that has motivated the scientists to develop the various land cover change detection techniques. In this paper, we have proposed neural network-based approach, i.e., focused time delay neural network (FTDNN)-based approach for land cover change detection, which is a time series prediction-based approach and detect the sudden change in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series. The performance of the proposed method has been addressed by using quantitative and qualitative analysis techniques. For the quantitative evaluation, the proposed algorithm is applied to the standard synthetic data set, which are analogous to EVI time series data set. The performance result of the proposed method compares with the four previously existing data mining-based benchmark techniques. The analysis was shown that the FTDNN-based method significantly outperforms than other techniques. For qualitative analysis, the San Francisco Bay Area data set has been used, which comprises real EVI time series. The proposed FTDNN-based method is applied to the San Francisco Bay Area data set and observe the interesting land cover changes. These outcomes indicate the effectiveness of data mining techniques for the land cover change detection problem.

TI  - High resolution mapping of inundation area in the Amazon basin from a combination of L-band passive microwave, optical and radar datasets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a methodology to map inland water in tropical areas under dense vegetation at high spatial and temporal resolution using multi-source remote sensing data. A new inundation product (SWAF-HR) is presented. It is characterized by a high spatial resolution (30', 1 km) and high temporal resolution (3 days). The SWAF-HR product is estimated over the Amazon basin for the 2010-2016 period. It is based on a downscaling procedure and the synergistic use of: (1) water surface fraction at coarse spatial resolution from an L-band passive microwave sensor (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity - SMOS), (2) Global Surface Water Occurrence from Landsat (GSWO) and (3) the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) Multi-Error-Removed-Improved-Terrain (MERIT) based on the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Thanks to the high capability of L-band microwave emission to reveal surface water under all-weather conditions and beneath the vegetation, the inundated area extent estimated by the SWAP-HR product is always larger than GSWO estimates obtained by the optical sensor (Landsat). SWAF-HR data is compared to ESA CCI and IGBP land covers, two SAR images and flooded areas over the Purus basin computed by the MGB-IPH model simulation. The results show the coherence of spatial and temporal dynamics of the SWAF-HR data. We show that the flooded area of the Branco River floodplain in Roraima (Brazil) varies from 0.2 x 10(4) to 2.7 x 10(4) km(2) whereas the extent of the Bolivian floodplain (Llanos de Moxos) inundation ranges between 0.8 x 10(4) and 8.1 x 10(4) km(2) during 2010-2016. The flooded area in the Branco floodplain gradually decreased from 2010 to 2015 but in 2016, the flooded area has increased during the rainy season. During 2010-2016, the minimum of the inundated surface extent was reached during 2015-2016 reflecting to a drought event related to ENSO. The most important uncertainties of the DEM are located over tropical areas but this information is essential in the downscaling procedure. Therefore, we investigate the impact of the choice of the DEM for the downscaling procedure. It is found that the choice of the DEM introduces 5% of error in the instantaneous water surface extent estimate but can reach up to 10% in the flood probability estimations over seven years. This new SWAF-HR product will be helpful for the understanding of the water, carbon and biogeochemical cycles of the Amazon.

TI  - Agricultural growth and land use land cover change in peri-urban India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Varanasi district is comprised of eight administrative blocks. Owing to economic development, it has shown an increase in urban activities. Analysis of remotely sensed data for a period of two decades reveals that the built-up area increased by about 345% while vegetation decreased by 86% during 1993-2013. Contrary to other observations, land use changes, due to urban growth, increased not only the built area but also the agriculture class. Agricultural area increased by 39% in the two decades. Population density increased from 1217 to 1806 person/km(2) and household density grew from 152 to 273 households/km(2) during 1991-2011. Land absorption coefficient (LAC) and land consumption ratio (LCR) were calculated as demographic indices of land use land cover change (LULC). Vegetation delineation shows that sparse vegetation increased from 40.2 to 90.1 km(2) while dense vegetation decreased from 28.4 to 1.7 km(2) in 1993-2013. There was a distinct shift from agriculture, as a primary economic activity, towards non-agricultural pursuits. In order to frame better strategies for sustainable development and food security, this phenomenon of increasing urbanization around cities needs to be studied. This micro scale study can be helpful in formulating policy for urban areas in developing countries like India which heavily depend on agriculture to sustain their population and economy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological processes that have acted on the Earth's surface through cumulative influence have a consequence of forming topographic features. The Zagros is the most active collisional orogen during Cenozoic and is known as one of the largest mountain belts. Result of fractal analysis appears to bring useful information about the earth surface which is not contained in traditional morphometric measures. Fractal analysis of topographic data of Sentinel 1 DEM is used in this study as a means of characterizing landscapes. Northwestern and Southwestern parts of the study area show higher fractal dimension. Geological processes have impacted much to these relatively older and uplifted formations which are associated with enhanced erosion as compared to those having sooth topographies. Fractal dimension decreases with the direction of younging of the mountain belts trending northeast to the southwest.

TI  - Lemongrass and Cinnamon Bark: Plant Essential Oil Blend as a Spatial Repellent for Mosquitoes in a Field Setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant essential oils (EOs) have been considered as spatial repellents to help disrupt the pathogen transmission cycle of mosquitoes. Our objective was to assess spatial repellency effects of EOs on the tropical yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) and on local mosquito populations in coastal British Columbia (Canada). In laboratory experiments using protocols of the World Health Organization, three of the solitary EOs tested proved repellent to Ae. aegypti: cinnamon bark, lemongrass, and rosemary. Binary combinations of select EOs enhanced the repellent effect of single EOs through synergistic interactions.The EO blend of geranium and peppermint lowered the RD50 (the dose required to obtain 50% repellency) of each solitary EO by >1,000-fold. Compared with binary EO blends, ternary EO blends were typically less repellent to mosquitoes, possibly due to a dilution effect of the most effective EO constituent(s) in the blend. In field experiments, the EO blend of lemongrass and cinnamon bark expressed spatial repellency towards the cool weather mosquito, Culiseta incidens (Thomson) (Diptera: Culicidae), even when this blend was disseminated from devices as much as 1 m away from a sentinel trap releasing attractive vertebrate host odorants and CO2. Deployment of EOs as spatial repellents in small outdoor gatherings could help protect humans from mosquito-borne diseases, particularly when this tactic is coupled with other tools of mosquito management.

TI  - Time Series of Landsat Imagery Shows Vegetation Recovery in Two Fragile Karst Watersheds in Southwest China from 1988 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the implementation of China's afforestation and conservation projects during recent decades, an increasing number of studies have reported greening trends in the karst regions of southwest China using coarse-resolution satellite imagery, but small-scale changes in the heterogenous landscapes remain largely unknown. Focusing on two typical karst regions in the Nandong and Xiaojiang watersheds in Yunnan province, we processed 2,497 Landsat scenes from 1988 to 2016 using the Google Earth Engine cloud platform and analyzed vegetation trends and associated drivers. We found that both watersheds experienced significant increasing trends in annual fractional vegetation cover, at a rate of 0.0027 year(-1) and 0.0020 year(-1), respectively. Notably, the greening trends have been intensifying during the conservation period (2001-2016) even under unfavorable climate conditions. Human-induced ecological engineering was the primary factor for the increased greenness. Moreover, vegetation change responded differently to variations in topographic gradients and lithological types. Relatively more vegetation recovery was found in regions with moderate slopes and elevation, and pure limestone, limestone and dolomite interbedded layer as well as impure carbonate rocks than non-karst rocks. Partial correlation analysis of vegetation trends and temperature and precipitation trends suggested that climate change played a minor role in vegetation recovery. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanisms behind vegetation changes in karst areas and may provide scientific supports for local afforestation and conservation policies.

TI  - K-Matrix: A Novel Change-Pattern Mining Method for SAR Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel method for change-pattern mining in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image time series based on a distance matrix clustering algorithm, called K-Matrix. As it is different from the state-of-the-art methods, which analyze the SAR image time series based on the change detection matrix (CDM), here, we directly use the distance matrix to determine changed pixels and extract change patterns. The proposed scheme involves two steps: change detection in SAR image time series and change-pattern discovery. First, these distance matrices are constructed for each spatial position over the time series by a dissimilarity measurement. The changed pixels are detected by using a thresholding algorithm on the energy feature map of all distance matrices. Then, according to the change detection results in SAR image time series, the changed areas for pattern mining are determined. Finally, the proposed K-Matrix algorithm which clusters distance matrices by the matrix cross-correlation similarity is used to group all changed pixels into different change patterns. Experimental results on two datasets of TerraSAR-X image time series illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Content-based search of earth observation data archives using open-access multitemporal land cover and terrain products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Public Earth Observation (EO) data archives, e.g., MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinels, are valuable sources of information for a broad range of applications. For decision-supporting applications used in urban planning, land management, and sustainable development, images covering regions similar to the study area are prerequisites for high-accuracy decision making. These desirable images cannot be quickly searched for in the EO data archives via image metadata alone but can be obtained through content-based image retrieval methods. Land cover (LC) information, traditionally obtained through image segmentation or classification processing, is typically used in existing methods. Image processing is time consuming and has various accuracy levels for heterogeneous images, thus decreasing retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, the monotemporal LC information used has a limited ability to distinguish among confusable regions with different terrain, e.g., forests located on flatlands or mountains, and to obtain regions, e.g., urban regions, with similar growth rates. In this study, we employ free multiple-year 30 m LC products, a terrain product, and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to accurately and efficiently locate the desired heterogeneous moderate spatial resolution images from various public EO data archives. Regions similar to the query region are detected with two-stage similarity calculations: First, monotemporal pixel-based LC and terrain information are used to filter out the most dissimilar regions; second, object-based LC change and terrain information are used to locate similar regions. Then, the desired images covering these detected similar regions are obtained from EO data archives via image metadata, e.g., geographical location and acquisition time. The experimental results of the two representative query regions show that our method can be used to obtain the desired images within several minutes and has higher accuracy than the LandEx method and a simplified method using only monotemporal LC information. The main contribution of our study is to reveal that LC changes and terrain information are helpful for improving the retrieval accuracy achieved from monotemporal LC information alone. Our method has great operability, with no need to perform EO data acquisition, image processing of raw EO images, or management of computational resources. Our method is conducive to making full use of images in various public EO archives to improve the decision making quality of decision-supporting applications.

TI  - Can We Use Satellite-Based FAPAR to Detect Drought?
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought in Australia has widespread impacts on agriculture and ecosystems. Satellite-based Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) has great potential to monitor and assess drought impacts on vegetation greenness and health. Various FAPAR products based on satellite observations have been generated and made available to the public. However, differences remain among these datasets due to different retrieval methodologies and assumptions. The Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables (QA4ECV) project recently developed a quality assurance framework to provide understandable and traceable quality information for Essential Climate Variables (ECVs). The QA4ECV FAPAR is one of these ECVs. The aim of this study is to investigate the capability of QA4ECV FAPAR for drought monitoring in Australia. Through spatial and temporal comparison and correlation analysis with widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT)/PROBA-V FAPAR generated by Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) drought index, as well as the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture, the study shows that the QA4ECV FAPAR can support agricultural drought monitoring and assessment in Australia. The traceable and reliable uncertainties associated with the QA4ECV FAPAR provide valuable information for applications that use the QA4ECV FAPAR dataset in the future.

TI  - Mapping with Pleiades-End-to-End Workflow
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we introduce an end-to-end workflow for very high-resolution satellite-based mapping, building the basis for important 3D mapping products: (1) digital surface model, (2) digital terrain model, (3) normalized digital surface model and (4) ortho-rectified image mosaic. In particular, we describe all underlying principles for satellite-based 3D mapping and propose methods that extract these products from multi-view stereo satellite imagery. Our workflow is demonstrated for the Pleiades satellite constellation, however, the applied building blocks are more general and thus also applicable for different setups. Besides introducing the overall end-to-end workflow, we need also to tackle single building blocks: optimization of sensor models represented by rational polynomials, epipolar rectification, image matching, spatial point intersection, data fusion, digital terrain model derivation, ortho rectification and ortho mosaicing. For each of these steps, extensions to the state-of-the-art are proposed and discussed in detail. In addition, a novel approach for terrain model generation is introduced. The second aim of the study is a detailed assessment of the resulting output products. Thus, a variety of data sets showing different acquisition scenarios are gathered, allover comprising 24 Pleiades images. First, the accuracies of the 2D and 3D geo-location are analyzed. Second, surface and terrain models are evaluated, including a critical look on the underlying error metrics and discussing the differences of single stereo, tri-stereo and multi-view data sets. Overall, 3D accuracies in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 m in planimetry and 0.2 to 0.4 m in height are achieved w.r.t. ground control points. Retrieved surface models show normalized median absolute deviations around 0.9 m in comparison to reference LiDAR data. Multi-view stereo outperforms single stereo in terms of accuracy and completeness of the resulting surface models.

TI  - CHURCH WOODEN ARCHITECTURE OF THE RUSSIAN NORTH: TRADITIONS AND ORTHODOXY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wooden architecture represents a special direction of the traditional architecture in Russia. To a large extent, its history is the history of the Russian North wooden architecture, which turned the region into a "country of architects". The article discusses issues related to the temple-building tradition: the relationship of peasant customers and carpentry artels, construction without drawings - on the "model" based on the contract ("poryadnya"). In the North and the Arctic conditions, the specifics of the Russian life generated a special type of thinking and mentality, which was supported by the Orthodoxy, including pre-Christian, pagan beliefs of the Slays. Previously, this relationship was called "Dual Faith", "Domestic Orthodoxy". The term "Folk Orthodoxy" is adopted at present. Dealing with the given issue, the author refers to the comparative experience of studying world religions. Peasant cultures of various nations possess a single "cosmic level". Folk varieties of religions and mythologies based on the agricultural structure have survived, being modified into Christianity. The peasants 'worldview is characterized by constant inclusion in cosmic and natural rhythms. The study shows the role and significance of Folk Orthodoxy in the establishment and transformation of the traditional temple architecture of the Russian North and the Arctic. The historical legends about the choice of a place for church construction, the holding of public peers ("bratchina") and widespread building of promise chapels and commercial chapels, characteristic of the Pomorie maritime culture, serve as the thesis confirmation. In folk rituals, many items of church use: candles, holy water, icons, performed values uncharacteristic of Orthodox Culture. Candles were used during divination, holy water at fortune-telling. The icon was perceived not only as a sacred image, but also as a magical object. The study suggests that Folk Orthodoxy has become an integral part of Russian Christian culture, while preserving the tradition and the Orthodox picture of the world. By introducing the topic of wooden church building into the field of national ethnoculturology this paper actually creates a new research direction.

T2  - SCIENTIA FORESTALIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to estimate the timber volume of a plantation of Pinus taeda L. by means of the correlation between spectral data and dendrometric characteristics of the stands. For the forest inventory, a simple random sampling process with fixed area method was used using circular plots of 400 m2. From the images obtained by the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 sensors, the average vegetation indexes per plot were obtained and correlated with the volume per plot obtained by the forest inventory. For the Landsat-8 data, the index with the best correlation was GNDVI with 0.5195 and Sentinel-2, SAVI, with 0.4968. The adjustment of the regression equations with these indices showed adjusted R2 of 0.5145 and Syx (%) of 14.74% for Landsat-8, and 0.4673 and 15.20% for Sentinel-2. According to the analysis of variance, there was no significant difference between the volume estimated by the forest inventory and the Remote Sensing data. However, it is recommended to test the methodology presented here with high spatial resolution images and with other forest species.

TI  - Beyond the park and city dichotomy: Land use and land cover change in the northern coast of Sao Paulo (Brazil)
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural and cultural landscapes of the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State (Brazil) are threatened by increasing urban growth, as a result of inefficient land use management and fast population growth. Our work analysed land use/cover changes (LULCC) between 1985 and 2015 at 5 year intervals, to describe and understand the main processes and drivers of landscape change. LULCC were mapped using Landsat images and geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA), based on the Random Forests supervised algorithm. Over 30 years, we show a dichotomic trend for the two main land change trajectories: forest persistence and fast urban growth. We found only 8% of forest disturbance within the State Parks, while dense urban settlements grew 163% outside the park, mainly replacing rural uses. We estimate that all available land for human settlement may be occupied by 2030 as a result of this fast urban growth. Our study exemplifies a likely pattern of land use change for coastal regions, with fast urban growth driven by economic interests in transforming these regions into urban and touristic hubs, clashing with environmental policies for forest conservation and afforestation. The history of LULCC in the Northern Coast of Sao Paulo State has resulted in several land use conflicts in the present, especially when considering fast urban growth versus a very large proportion of areas where no human settlement is permitted. This complex combination of drivers has led to rural depopulation and decrease in small-scale agricultural uses, reducing the diversity and functionality of the studied landscape.

TI  - Possibilities of the Application of the Medium-Resolution Landsat 8 and the High-Resolution RapidEye Optical Imagery in Visualization and Detection of Changes in the Forest Cover by Windthrows
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents a comparison of the satellite information of medium (Landsat 8, 30 m) and high (RapidEye, 5 m) resolutions for the purpose of examining the visual and quantitative estimates of wind damages and the renovation of the forest cover following the Theodor storm in November 2013 in Medvednica mountain, North-western Croatia. 3D visualization of the whole Medvednica area was derived from the Landsat 8 RGB channels of the visible part of the spectrum, pan-sharpened with the panchromatic channel on 15 m spatial resolution for visual forest damages detection. The spatial sensitivity of different satellite indices (NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, NDMI, NBR, NBR2), based on Landsat 8 imagery, as a quantitative measure of the state of the vegetation cover, was investigated throughout the whole Medvednica area. From the investigated indices, the best detection of the changes in the forest cover was achieved by soil corrected indices such as SAVI and MSAVI in relation to the standard NDVI index. Indices based on the infra-red part of the spectra (NDMI, NBR, NBR2) showed quite good performance in detection of the damages of the forest cover. By the comparative assessment on the chosen pilot area with severe windthrows near Bliznec, a significant advantage of the high-resolution RapidEye imagery in comparison with Landsat 8, was confirmed for the potential purpose of the more precise silvicultural subgroups delineation and monitoring of the success of the restoration of the young forest cover. Based on the obtained results, substantial possibilities of medium and high-resolution satellite imagery have been identified, both for the purpose of damages assessment after natural disasters and for the monitoring of the reforestation on these surfaces, which will be confirmed in the further course of this research.

TI  - Monitoring Drought Impact on Annual Forage Production in Semi-Arid Grasslands: A Case Study of Nebraska Sandhills
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land management practices and disturbances (e.g. overgrazing, fire) have substantial effects on grassland forage production. When using satellite remote sensing to monitor climate impacts, such as drought stress on annual forage production, minimizing land management practices and disturbance effects sends a clear climate signal to the productivity data. This study investigates the effect of this climate signal by: (1) providing spatial estimates of expected biomass under specific climate conditions, (2) determining which drought indices explain the majority of interannual variability in this biomass, and (3) developing a predictive model that estimates the annual biomass early in the growing season. To address objective 1, this study uses an established methodology to determine Expected Ecosystem Performance (EEP) in the Nebraska Sandhills, US, representing annual forage levels after accounting for non-climatic influences. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were used to approximate actual ecosystem performance. Seventeen years (2000-2016) of annual EEP was calculated using piecewise regression tree models of site potential and climate data. Expected biomass (EB), EEP converted to biomass in kg*ha(-1)*yr(-1), was then used to examine the predictive capacity of several drought indices and the onset date of the growing season. Subsets of these indices were used to monitor and predict annual expected grassland biomass. Independent field-based biomass production data available from two Sandhills locations were used for validation of the EEP model. The EB was related to field-based biomass production (R-2 = 0.66 and 0.57) and regional rangeland productivity statistics of the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO) dataset. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), the 3- and 6-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM), which represented moisture conditions during May, June and July, explained the majority of the interannual biomass variability in this grassland system (three-month ESI explained roughly 72% of the interannual biomass variability). A new model was developed to use drought indices from early in the growing season to predict the total EB for the whole growing season. This unique approach considers only climate-related drought signal on productivity. The capability to estimate annual EB by the end of May will potentially enable land managers to make informed decisions about stocking rates, hay purchase needs, and other management issues early in the season, minimizing their potential drought losses.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping and ductal carcinoma in situ
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is typically unassociated with a risk of regional lymph node involvement. Retrospective series maintain that larger tumors or high-grade histopathology may harbor a risk of lymph node involvement. Purpose Our community hospital retrospectively reviewed a series wherein women with DCIS were subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy based on large tumor size and/or high-grade histopathology. Materials and methods 232 consecutive women with a diagnosis of pure DCIS were evaluated independently by two breast surgeons, one who typically offers sentinel node mapping to patients with tumors larger than 10 mm and the other who offers sentinel node mapping to women with grade 3 tumors. 60 women (26%) underwent sentinel node mapping along with appropriate surgery directed to the breast. Women were offered risk-adjusted adjuvant radiotherapy and anti-endocrine therapy. Results At a median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-132 months), 9 women (15%) were identified with regional axillary nodal disease. A statistical analysis was conducted between women who did or did not undergo sentinel node mapping because there was overlap in large tumor size and high grade between the two groups. A univariate logistic regression statistic showed a trend toward a significant relationship between grade 3 tumors and a risk of occult nodal involvement. This was not confirmed by multivariate analysis. Conclusions In our moderate-sized surgical experience evaluating women with pure DCIS who underwent a sentinel node mapping due to large tumor size or high grade histology, we were unable to confirm that either is predictive of occult node involvement.

AB  - New state-of-the-art satellite measurements of tropospheric column NO2 from the TROPOMI instrument on-board Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P), launched in October 2017, allow for an unprecedented high resolution (sub-10km) assessment of UK air quality (AQ) from space. We present the first results from TROPOMI and compare them with its predecessor, the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), to quantify previously unresolved UK pollution hotspots (e.g. Bristol, Southampton and Liverpool). The TROPOMI tropospheric column NO2 data represents a powerful new tool to quantify UK AQ, evaluate atmospheric composition models and potentially derive new emission inventories from space.

TI  - Outpatient breast cancer surgery: Patient satisfaction study and the role of the attending physician
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. - To evaluate the satisfaction of patients with breast cancer treated surgically in an outpatient setting and the role of the attending physician.Methods. - This prospective satisfaction study focused on patients who had a breast cancer surgery as an outpatient procedure, between February and October 2018, at the CHU and Clinique Mutualiste chirurgicale de Saint-Etienne, Loire, France. The data were collected via a satisfaction survey, which was given to the patients during the postoperative visit.Results. - One hundred and four patients were included. The most frequent surgery was partial mastectomy with sentinel lymph node (63.5%). On overall breast cancer surgery, 47.6% were performed on an outpatient basis. Ninety-seven percent of the patients were satisfied, 96.9% would have recommended this procedure to a friend and 47% could resume their daily activities as early as the second day. Among the patients, 16.2% would have preferred to stay on day more in hospital after the surgery. This preference was related to the complexity (P = 0.035) and duration of the surgery (P= 0.025), fatigue (P= 0.03) and feeling of isolation (P= 0.016). Among the patients, 25.5% saw their doctor for organic, psychological, administrative, monitoring and informational issues.Conclusions. - Outpatient breast cancer surgery seems safe and qualitative. Standardized procedures, relevant information about the outpatient procedure and specificities of this type of care, as well as the transmission of information with the attending physician are the keys to success.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most noticeable and direct impacts of urbanization on the environment is the changes in daily and seasonal thermal variable and increase the hydraulic stress. Both are cumulatively formed the urban heat island (UHI) effects. From the sustainability point of view, it is very crucial for research to focus on how to mitigate UHI. Therefore, objective of this study is to evaluate the cooling effects of different types of urban greenery at local and park level. For land surface temperature, Landsat 8-TIRS and for greenery mapping Sentinel 2A imageries have been used. LST was derived using the single channel algorithm, and greenery was mapping using combination of unsupervised (i.e., ISODATA) and supervised (i.e., maximum likelihood) image classification techniques. Numbers of class level metrics like PLAND PD; LPI; AREA_MN etc. used to measure composition and configuration of urban greenery. Ordinary least square regression, multiple linear regression, and spatial auto-regression model were used to measure the cooling effects of urban green space quantitatively.Besides, park level analysis alsowas done using park cooling intensity (PCI) and its relationship with park land use. Results shows that amount of urban greenery in terms of percentage of land cover or average size of the green patch is very important to reduce the UHI. PLAND, LPI, AREA_MN and COHESION negatively related with LST whereas PD, LSI, SHAPE_MN, and ENN_MN positively related with LST. So, fragmented vegetation area, green space with complex shape could increase the LST. If we look at the vegetation types and relation with LST, only dense vegetation and trees and plantation can effectively reduce the LST. Besides PCI negatively related with amount of built-up area and open space within parks. Finally, this study can help to the urban and land use planning to build a heat resilience city.

TI  - Well-intentioned, but poorly implemented: Debris from coastal bamboo fences triggered mangrove decline in Thailand
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Along the Upper Gulf of Thailand, coastal fences and breakwaters have been constructed using bamboo since 2005. Despite their potential benefits, bamboo structures disintegrate within seven years releasing floating debris which severely damages mangrove tree stems. The aim of the study was to investigate whether such stem damage resulted in the decline of Avicennia spp. stands along the Upper Gulf of Thailand. Tree health assessments were conducted to assess the probability of crown dieback in damaged and undamaged trees. Satellite-derived time-series of vegetation indices were used to detect long-term forest decline. In contrast to the unaffected landward mangroves, seaward mangroves were unable to recover from insect-induced defoliation events after the collapse of a nearby fence. Furthermore, there was a significantly higher probability that damaged trees showed signs of moderate-to-severe crown dieback. It is recommended that bamboo fences be secured by replacing individual stems before they become detached.

TI  - Multi-level pedotransfer modification functions of the USLE-K factor for annual soil erodibility estimation of mixed landscapes
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents new pedotransfer functions for realistic and dynamic predictions of the USLE soil erodibility factor (K). Multiple linear regression (MLR) models capturing the factors of the USLE of Fish river watershed in Alabama are developed using a dynamic remotely sensed land cover data from MODIS integrated into ArcSWAT model. The correlation matrix results of a forward stepwise MLR analysis for the period 2001-2011 show that the K-factor is profoundly affected by five variables namely, slope length and steepness, crop management factor, soil permeability, soil moisture content, and soil bulk density. The study demonstrates that the soil moisture content and soil bulk density factors that are commonly unaccounted for in the traditional USLE have a significant impact on K-factor. The predictions of the MLR models developed in the study are verified for the years 2006 and 2011. The results show that the MLR model containing all five variables is a good fit for K-factor (R-2: 0.89 for 2006; 0.94 for 2011). The study shows that the mean values of K estimated for 2001-2011 using the USLE and MLR are respectively, 1.7 and 1.2 times the mean value of the measured K. The strong correlation between the estimated K from the MLR model and the measured K indicates that the use of soil moisture content (R-2=0.84, p<0.05) and soil bulk density (R-2=0.77, p<0.05) as predictor variables gives a better all-inclusive estimation of the soil erodibility factor in regions with noticeable temporal land cover transformations.

TI  - Primary head and neck mucosal melanoma: Predictors of survival and a case series on sentinel node biopsy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Head and neck mucosal melanoma (HNMM) is a rare tumor with a poor outcome. The objective of this study was to assess outcome and prognostic factors for a cohort of patients treated in a head and neck cancer center. In addition, a case series on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was included to evaluate it as a method for staging the node-negative neck.Methods: A retrospective study design was chosen, and 50 patients who were treated from 1973 to 2015 in our institution for primary HNMM were included. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival rates. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to study the influence of possible risk factors on the patients' outcome. These risk factors included patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities.Results: All patients were treated surgically and 50% received adjuvant treatment. The median disease specific survival (DSS) was 38 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 44%. Positive surgical margin (p = 0.004) and distant failure (p = 0.005) were associated with a worse DSS. The median disease-free survival (DFS) was 27 months, with a 5-year disease-free rate of 12%. Only tumor depth >5 mm (p = 0.002) was associated with a worse DFS. Five clinically node-negative patients received SLNB and only the two SLN-positive individuals suffered from distant failure. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and AJCC/UICC stage had no influence on any outcome measure.Conclusions: Positive surgical margin and distant failure are the only independent prognostic factors for DSS. Tumor depth can predict distant failure. SLNB may be a valuable staging tool for the node-negative neck. (C) 2019 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Spatial Process of Surface Urban Heat Island in Rapidly Growing Seoul Metropolitan Area for Sustainable Urban Planning Using Landsat Data (1996-2017)
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon is an important research topic in the scholarly community. There are only few research studies related to the UHI in the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA). Therefore, this study examined the impact of urbanization on the formation of UHI in the SMA as a geospatial study by using Landsat data from 1996, 2006, and 2017. For this purpose, we analyzed the relative variation of land surface temperature (LST) with changes of land use/land cover (LULC) rather than absolute values of LST using gradient, intensity, and directional analyses. It was observed that the impervious surface (IS) has expanded, and the UHI effect was more penetrating in the study area, with considerable loss of other LULC including green surfaces along with the rapid urbanization of the study area. In this study, we divided the IS into persistent IS (PIS) and newly added IS (NAIS). The spatial distribution of the IS, forest surface (FS), PIS, and NAIS was observed based on gradient zones (GZs). The results show that GZ(1) recorded a difference of 6.0 degrees C when compared with the GZ(109) in 2017. The results also show that the city center was warmer than the surrounding areas during the period of study. Results reveal that the mean LST has a strong significant positive relationship with a fraction of IS and PIS in 2006 and 2017. On other hand, the mean LST has a strong negative relationship with a fraction of FS and NAIS in the same time points. Relatively low temperatures were recorded in FS and NAIS in both time points. Further, it was proved that the local climate of the SMA and its surroundings had been affected by the UHI effect. Therefore, urban planners of the SMA should seriously consider the issue and plan to mitigate the effect by improving the green surfaces of the city. More greening-oriented concepts are recommended in both horizontal and vertical directions of the SMA, that can be used to control the negative impact associated with UHI. The overall outputs of the study could be used as a proxy indicator for the sustainability of the SMA and its surroundings.

TI  - Community forest management and forest cover change in Lampung, Indonesia
T2  - FOREST POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Community-based forestry (CBF) is often cited as a way for improving livelihood of local communities while conserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. However, empirical assessments of CBF outcomes are still lacking, especially for their biophysical conditions. This study investigates the extent to which a type of CBF practices in Indonesia, Community Forest (HKM), managed to maintain forest cover. We applied a propensity scoring approach to empirically measure the rates of deforestation between 2007 and 2016 for Conservation Forests and Protection Forests with and without HKM concessions. Our finding is that HKMs are less effective than Conservation Forests (e.g. National Parks) in reducing forest cover loss, but more effective than other similar forests without CBF management. This is a promising starting point for expanding CBF in Indonesia. We recommend: 1) explicit consideration of biophysical characteristics of CBF locations in designating future sites; 2) providing site-specific financial and technical supports for local communities; 3) utilizing remotely sensed data and propensity scoring for monitoring conservation outcomes.

TI  - Molecular Imaging of the Glomerulus via Mesangial Cell Uptake of Radiolabeled Tilmanocept
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - An unmet need for the clinical management of chronic kidney disease is a predictive tool of kidney function during the first decade of the disease, when there is silent loss of glomerular function. The objective of this study was to demonstrate receptor-mediated binding of tilmanocept to CD206 within the kidney and provide evidence of kinetic sensitivity of this binding to renal function. Methods: Rats were positioned in a PET scanner with the liver and kidneys within the field of view. After an intravenous injection of Ga-68-IRDye800-tilmanocept, using 1 of 2 scaled molar doses (0.02 nmol/g, n = 5; or 0.10 nmol/g, n = 5), or coinjection (n = 3) of 68Ga-IRDye800-tilmanocept (0.10 nmol/g) and unlabeled tilmanocept (5.0 nmol/g), or a negative control, Ga-68-IRDye800-DTPA-galactosyl-dextran (0.02 nmol/g, n = 5), each animal was imaged for 20 min followed by a whole-body scan. Frozen kidney sections were stained for podocytes and CD206 using immunofluorescence. Molecular imaging of diabetic db/db mice (4.9 wk, n = 6; 7.3 wk, n = 4; 13.3 wk, n = 6) and nondiabetic db/m mice (n = 6) was performed with fluorescence-labeled Tc-99m-tilmanocept (18.5 MBq, 2.6 nmol). Thirty minutes after injection, blood, liver, kidneys, and urine were assayed for radioactivity. Renal time-activity curves were generated. Results: Rat PET whole-body images and time-activity curves of Ga-68-IRDye800-tilmanocept demonstrated receptor-mediated renal accumulation with evidence of glomerular uptake. Activity within the renal cortex persisted during the 40-min study. Histologic examination demonstrated colocalization of CD206 and IRDye800-tilmanocept within the glomerulus. The glomerular accumulation of the coinjection and the negative control studies were significantly less than the CD206-targeted agent. The db/db mice displayed a multiphasic renal time-activity curve with high urinary bladder accumulation; the nondiabetic mice exhibited renal uptake curves dominated by a single phase with low bladder accumulation. Conclusion: This study demonstrated receptor-mediated binding to the glomerular mesangial cells and kinetic sensitivity of tilmanocept to chronic renal disease. Given the role of mesangial cells during the progression of diabetic nephropathy, PET or SPECT renal imaging with radiolabeled tilmanocept may provide a noninvasive quantitative assessment of glomerular function.

TI  - Cost-Effectiveness of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Head and Neck Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has shown promise in identifying subclinical nodal metastasis in patients with high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. However, low metastasis rates may indicate that performing such a procedure in all patients may be unnecessary and costly.Materials and methods: A decision model was developed to analyze costs and survival in patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma based on their tumor and nodal metastasis staging and whether or not they received an SLNB. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on the change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (US$) between the different options, with a threshold of $100,000 to determine the most cost-effective strategy. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the results.Results: Not performing an SLNB results in 12.26 QALYs and a cost of $3712.98. Performing an SLNB resulted in a 0.59 decrease in QALYs and an increase in cost of $1379.58 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -2338.27. This trend remained the same across all tumor stages and remained consistent within most sensitivity analyses.Conclusions: In patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the most cost-effective strategy is to not perform SLNBs, regardless of the patient's stage. Low rates of nodal metastasis in addition to low disease-specific death rates were the significant factors in this outcome. Increasing the sensitivity of SLNB would not impact this recommendation unless the rate of nodal metastasis was significantly higher. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation of Satellite-Derived Sensible Heat Flux for TERRA/MODIS Images Over Three Different Landscapes Using Large Aperture Scintillometer and Eddy Covariance Measurements
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensible heat flux (H) is the key component of the earth surface energy balance, which plays a vital role in the evolution of regional climate. The regional and global scale estimation of H is critical and challenging due to the validation of satellite-based estimation of surface energy balance components. This paper focused on the validation and performance evaluation of the satellite-derived H based on a single source remote sensing model in regional scale over three distinct landscapes in northwest China during May to September 2015 using data from TERRA-MODIS and meteorological observations. The results indicated that the remote sensing model with MODIS scenes performed well for the purpose of H estimation, but the influence of different landscapes was noticeable. The satellite-derived H (MODIS_H) was compared with the large aperture scintillometer (LAS)-measured H (LAS_H) and eddy covariance (EC)-measured H (EC_H) over the three different land surfaces. The root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of MODIS_H with respect to LAS_H were 31.63 W/m(2) over alpine grassland, 44.07 W/m(2) over croplands, and 112.98 W/m(2) over mixed forests. The aggregated values (from May to September) of mean and standard deviation showed that the MODIS_H was moderately overestimated with fewer fluctuation over alpine grass-lands, slightly overestimated with moderate fluctuation over croplands, and highly overestimated with higher fluctuation over mixed forests. The larger RMSE and over estimations could be explained by the vegetation heterogeneity, the wind speed profiles, and the complicated thermodynamic states.

Several social conflicts, derived from the transnational mining activity in the study area, encouraged among the Mame people the interest in reviving ritual practices considered traditional. In addition to other political practices rooted in the region, these shape what we call the dialogues of the land, which incorporate added meanings into the strategies of political resistance against the extractive activity.

TI  - Data and resolution requirements in mapping vegetation in spatially heterogeneous landscapes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been argued that even centimeter-level resolution is needed for mapping vegetation patterns in spatially heterogeneous landscapes such as northern peatlands. However, there are few systematic tests for determining what kind of spatial resolution and data combinations are needed and what the differences in mapping accuracy are when different datasets are omitted or included. We conducted 78 different object-based supervised random forest classifications on a patterned fen and its surroundings in Kaamanen, northern Finland, using remotely sensed optical imagery, topography, and vegetation height datasets from different platforms (unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), aerial, satellite) with spatial resolution ranging from 5 cm to 3m. We compared differences in classification performance when we altered (1) classification and segmentation input data and features calculated from the data, or (2) the segmentation scale. We constructed training data with the help of transect-based field sampling and UAV imagery and tested classification accuracy using 412 field-surveyed vegetation plots. The most accurate classifications (75.7% overall accuracy) were obtained when we segmented a 5 cm resolution UAV image with a small segmentation scale and calculated features from all datasets. Classification accuracy was 2.2 percentage points (pp) lower with the most accurate aerial image (50 cm resolution) based classification, and 7.6 pp and 11.9pp lower with the most accurate WorldView-2 (2 m resolution) and PlanetScope (3 m resolution) satellite image based classifications respectively. Classification accuracies were low (46.7-56.0%) when we used only spectral data from one dataset. The inclusion of gray-level co-occurrence matrix textural features increased classification accuracy by 0.4-12.1pp and inclusion of multiple datasets by 8.2-25.0pp. Segmentation scale had a minor effect on classification accuracy (2.5-7.3pp difference between the finest and coarsest segmentation scale); however, both too small and large segmentation scale might lead to suboptimal classification. The differences in land cover type areal coverage were relatively small between classifications with multiple datasets, but if classifications included features from only one dataset, the differences were larger. We conclude that multiple different optical, topographical, and vegetation height datasets should be used when mapping vegetation in spatially heterogeneous landscapes, and that sub-meter resolution data (e.g. UAV or aerial) are necessary for the most accurate maps. Although UAV data is not essentially needed for classification, it is useful for training dataset construction and especially helpful in areas lacking other sub-meter resolution data.

AB  - Remote sensing data and techniques are being utilized for various purposes including natural disasters such as earthquake as well as flood mapping and detection. The research aims to consume liberates Landsat 8 images for investigating crashed airplanes such as MH370. Overall approximately 300 Landsat images with less than 10% clouds within a defined period were processed and utilized through the Google Earth Engine Platform. Due to the variation of materials as well as the colour of airplane body being different from the area in which the plane crash occurred, the characteristics of the template of a plane's shape should be different in terms of albedo, temperature as well as a vegetation index value. The research demonstrates the potential of Landsat 8 data especially, the NDVI, the albedo and reflectance of band 4 are capable of distinguishing between the plane and its surrounding green area. Therefore, our result confirms that during the research period, there was no plane on the location and further adds that there is no evidence from the remote sensing to justify the presence of the crashed MH370 in the site as earlier reported.

TI  - Assessments of Ocean Wind Retrieval Schemes Used for Chinese Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Co-Polarized Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper assesses different retrieval schemes used for the Chinese Gaofen-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (GF-3 SAR) co-polarized data. The data consist of 4186 GF-3 data points and collocated wind information from sources including the ASCAT scatterometer, HY2A-SCAT scatterometer, and National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy wind data set. The VV-polarized geophysical model function (GMF) is a CMOD7 model while the HH-polarized GMF is a hybrid of the CMOD7 and PR model. Assessments involve comparisons between SAR-derived and collocated winds in terms of the root-mean-square difference (RMSD) and bias. First, a comparison between the two retrieval schemes for the VV-polarized data clearly shows that the optimal scheme performs better than the classical scheme for wind speed retrieval. Comparisons for HH-polarized data show similar results. These experiments indicate that the wind speed RMSDs for the GF-3 co-polarized data are within 2 m/s when using the optimal scheme. Moreover, the wind direction RMSDs from the two schemes have no significant difference, with values near 20 degrees. Overall, these assessments indicate that the GF-3 co-polarized data are sufficient for operational wind speed retrieval using the optimal scheme. However, wind direction retrieval requires further improvement.

TI  - The Value of Sentinel-2 Spectral Bands for the Assessment of Winter Wheat Growth and Development
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) and chlorophyll content are strongly related to plant development and productivity. Spatial and temporal estimates of these variables are essential for efficient and precise crop management. The availability of open-access data from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite-delivering global coverage with an average 5-day revisit frequency at a spatial resolution of up to 10 metres-could provide estimates of these variables at unprecedented (i.e., sub-field) resolution. Using synthetic data, past research has demonstrated the potential of Sentinel-2 for estimating crop variables. Nonetheless, research involving a robust analysis of the Sentinel-2 bands for supporting agricultural applications is limited. We evaluated the potential of Sentinel-2 data for retrieving winter wheat LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC). In coordination with destructive and non-destructive ground measurements, we acquired multispectral data from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-mounted sensor measuring key Sentinel-2 spectral bands (443 to 865 nm). We applied Gaussian processes regression (GPR) machine learning to determine the most informative Sentinel-2 bands for retrieving each of the variables. We further evaluated the GPR model performance when propagating observation uncertainty. When applying the best-performing GPR models without propagating uncertainty, the retrievals had a high agreement with ground measurements-the mean R-2 and normalised root-mean-square error (NRMSE) were 0.89 and 8.8%, respectively. When propagating uncertainty, the mean R-2 and NRMSE were 0.82 and 11.9%, respectively. When accounting for measurement uncertainty in the estimation of LAI and CCC, the number of most informative Sentinel-2 bands was reduced from four to only two-the red-edge (705 nm) and near-infrared (865 nm) bands. This research demonstrates the value of the Sentinel-2 spectral characteristics for retrieving critical variables that can support more sustainable crop management practices.

TI  - SAR-to-Optical Image Translation Based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks-Optimization, Opportunities and Limits
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its all time capability, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing plays an important role in Earth observation. The ability to interpret the data is limited, even for experts, as the human eye is not familiar to the impact of distance-dependent imaging, signal intensities detected in the radar spectrum as well as image characteristics related to speckle or steps of post-processing. This paper is concerned with machine learning for SAR-to-optical image-to-image translation in order to support the interpretation and analysis of original data. A conditional adversarial network is adopted and optimized in order to generate alternative SAR image representations based on the combination of SAR images (starting point) and optical images (reference) for training. Following this strategy, the focus is set on the value of empirical knowledge for initialization, the impact of results on follow-up applications, and the discussion of opportunities/drawbacks related to this application of deep learning. Case study results are shown for high resolution (SAR: TerraSAR-X, optical: ALOS PRISM) and low resolution (Sentinel-1 and -2) data. The properties of the alternative image representation are evaluated based on feedback from experts in SAR remote sensing and the impact on road extraction as an example for follow-up applications. The results provide the basis to explain fundamental limitations affecting the SAR-to-optical image translation idea but also indicate benefits from alternative SAR image representations.

TI  - Detecting forest cover changes in the cork oak forests surrounding the Strait of Gibraltar using the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Information based on remote sensing was used to quantify percentage changes in the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) values in cork oak forests (Quercus suber) surrounding the strait of Gibraltar, between the years 2000 and 2018, with EVI values serving as an indirect measure of forest health. The observed changes enable the detection of degradation of ecosystems within this area of high biodiversity, which also provides important habitat to migratory species passing through the strait of Gibraltar. Changes in vegetation cover were analysed for a range of different structural types of cork oak forest (dense forest, scattered forest, and forest mixed with scrubland and grassland). Percentages changes of between +1.11% and +2.42% were observed when comparing the time period of 2009-2018 to that of 2000-2009, depending on the type of forest structure analysed. These results show an overall increase in forest cover within the study area. however. by locating plots with negative EVI values, sparse cork oak forest with grassland was identified as having the greatest losses in forest cover. Cartography with EVI change values per 250 meter pixel was obtained for the protected areas surrounding the Strait of Gibraltar. This information was then matched against historic PNOA (Plan Nacional de Ortofotografia Aerea) images, revealing the presence of desertification. This article covers some of examples of such processes.

TI  - Performance of Surveillance Case Definitions in Detecting Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection Among Young Children Hospitalized With Severe Respiratory Illness-South Africa, 2009-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in young children, but data on surveillance case definition performance in estimating burdens have been limited.Methods. We enrolled children aged <5 years hospitalized for ALRTI (or neonatal sepsis in young infants) through active prospective surveillance at 5 sentinel hospitals in South Africa and collected nasopharyngeal aspirates from them for RSV molecular diagnostic testing between 2009 and 2014. Clinical data were used to characterize RSV disease and retrospectively evaluate the performance of respiratory illness case definitions (including the World Health Organization definition for severe acute respiratory infection [SARI]) in identifying hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed RSV according to age group (<3, 3-5, 6-11, 12-23, and 24-59 months).Results. Of 9969 hospitalized children, 2723 (27%) tested positive for RSV. Signs and symptoms in RSV-positive children varied according to age; fever was less likely to occur in children aged <3 months (57%; odds ratio [OR], 0.8 [95% CI, 0.7-0.9]) but more likely in those aged >= 12 months (82%; OR, 1.7-1.9) than RSV-negative children. The sensitivity (range, 55%-81%) and specificity (range, 27%-54%) of the SARI case definition to identify hospitalized RSV-positive children varied according to age; the lowest sensitivity was for infants aged <6 months. Using SARI as the case definition would have missed 36% of RSV-positive children aged <5 years and 49% of those aged <3 months; removing the fever requirement from the definition recovered most missed cases.Conclusion. Including fever in the SARI case definition lowers the sensitivity for RSV case detection among young children hospitalized with an ALRTI and likely underestimates its burden.

TI  - SPACE-TEMPORAL EVALUATION OF CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND SOIL USE AND COVER IN THE METROPOLITAN REGION OF BAIXADA SANTISTA
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Metropolitan Region of Baixada Santista (MRBS) harbors one of the main port areas of Brazil: the Port of Santos. Due to the accelerated urban development in this region, the monitoring of biophysical parameters is fundamental. Therefore, this paper aims to i) estimate the soil surface temperature (T-s) and identify the Urban Heat Islands (UHI) formation; and ii) compare the T-s and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for MRBS from 1986 to 2016 using Landsat 5 and 8 images. Remote sensing tools are essential to meet the objectives of this work for providing both the spatial and temporal evaluation of a region. The spatial analysis was based on the NDVI to evaluate the vegetation density and size from five previously established classes (i.e., water bodies, urban grid, exposed soil and road corridors, shrub, and dense vegetation). The NDVI mapping showed a significant reduction in the cover area referred to the dense vegetation class (91.7%), while the urban grid category increased by 29.4%, resulting from the urban expansion and green cover reduction over the region during this period. Surface temperature thematic maps showed high-temperature values related to increased urbanization and decreased rainfall. Moreover, an 8 degrees C rise in surface temperature over the last 30 years was registered due to the regional development, which has replaced natural soils by anthropic materials and reduced dense vegetation. This phenomenon has resulted in the formation and intensification of UHI, especially after the 2000s.

TI  - Non-sentinel axillary tumor burden applying the ACOSOG Z0011 eligibility criteria to a large routine cohort
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIn the ACOSOG Z0011 trial, patients with primary breast cancer (BC) and 1-2 tumor-involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) undergoing breast-conserving surgery gained no benefit from completing axillary lymph node dissection (cALND). This paper reports cALND rates performed in clinical routine on patients who would meet the Z0011 criteria. Further, patients still received cALND were analyzed concerning the number of non-sentinel metastases (NSM) to estimate occult axillary tumor burden.MethodsData were retrospectively analyzed from patients treated in 179 German breast centers between 2008 and 2015. Time-trend rates were determined for cALND regarding the presence of axillary macrometastases or micrometastases. Descriptive statistics were used to report the number of NSM depending on the number of SLN removed, tumor-involved SLN, tumor stage (pT1-2), and immunohistochemical subtype. Factors associated with NSM were identified using multivariable logistic regression.ResultsAltogether, data for 188,909 patients were available, of whom 13,741 (7.3%) were identified eligible for the Z0011 criteria. For these patients, the cALND rate for macrometastases declined from 96.4% in 2008 to 49.7% in 2015, for micrometastases from 86.7 to 5.9%. In total 9773 patients still received cALND, 33.4% of whom had NSM. The NSM rates were: 38.8% for pN(1/1sn), 28.6% for pN(1/2sn), and 50.9% for pN(2/2sn). Hormone receptor (HR) positive/HER2+ showed the highest NSM rate (41.6%), HR-/HER2- the lowest rate (29.4%).ConclusionsThe rate of cALND for ACOSOG Z0011 eligible patients has decreased substantially in routine care in our nationwide cohort. Our data reveal a relatively high prevalence of additional axillary NSM tumor burden.

TI  - Serological Markers for Syphilis Among Persons Presenting With Syndromes Associated With Sexually Transmitted Infections: Results From the Zimbabwe STI Etiology Study
T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Syphilis prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa appears to be stable or declining but is still the highest globally. Ongoing sentinel surveillance in high-risk populations is necessary to inform management and detect changes in syphilis trends. We assessed serological syphilis markers among persons with sexually transmitted infections in Zimbabwe. Methods We studied a predominantly urban, regionally diverse group of women and men presenting with genital ulcer disease (GUD), women with vaginal discharge and men with urethral discharge at clinics in Zimbabwe. Syphilis tests included rapid plasma reagin and the Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay. Results Among 436 evaluable study participants, 36 (8.3%) tested positive for both rapid plasma reagin and Treponema pallidum hemagglutination assay: women with GUD: 19.2%, men with GUD: 12.6%, women with vaginal discharge: 5.7% and men with urethral discharge: 1.5% (P < 0.0001). Conclusions Syphilis rates in Zimbabwe are high in sentinel populations, especially men and women with GUD.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Data for Evaluation of Rockfall Potential within a Quarry Slope
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years data acquisition from remote sensing has become readily available to the quarry sector. This study demonstrates how such data may be used to evaluate and back analyse rockfall potential of a legacy slope in a blocky rock mass. Use of data obtained from several aerial LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and photogrammetric campaigns taken over a number of years (2011 to date) provides evidence for potential rockfall evolution from a slope within an active quarry operation in Cornwall, UK. Further investigation, through analysis of point cloud data obtained from terrestrial laser scanning, was undertaken to characterise the orientation of discontinuities present within the rock slope. Aerial and terrestrial LiDAR data were subsequently used for kinematic analysis, production of surface topography models and rockfall trajectory analyses using both 2D and 3D numerical simulations. The results of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based 3D photogrammetric analysis enabled the reconstruction of high resolution topography, allowing one to not only determine geometrical properties of the slope surface and geo-mechanical characterisation but provide data for validation of numerical simulations. The analysis undertaken shows the effectiveness of the existing rockfall barrier, while demonstrating how photogrammetric data can be used to inform back analyses of the underlying failure mechanism and investigate potential runout.

TI  - An Arctic sea ice multi-step classification based on GNSS-R data from the TDS-1 mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the potential of using bistatic radar reflections from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to classify sea ice types in the Arctic Ocean during the sea ice formation period. For this study, we used data obtained from the United Kingdom (UK) TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1) satellite mission. The main objective of the TDS-1 mission is to provide L-band radar reflections of the ocean surface in order to infer wind speed through an estimation of the ocean surface roughness. Given the orbit inclination of TDS-1, polar coverage is obtained providing datasets over the Arctic sea ice cover. Recent studies demonstrated the use of TDS-1 data for accurately deriving ocean-ice detection using the shape of the bistatic radar waveforms derived from delay-Doppler maps. We aim to advance this previous research by demonstrating the sensitivity of GNSS bistatic radar signals to sea ice types. The originality of the study presented in this manuscript is the classification of sea ice types, never implemented before with any GNSS-R mission. For this study, we examined the fall period of October 2015 in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas region, when considerable expanses of young ice, first-year ice (FYI), and multi-year ice (MYI) were present. We developed a sea ice multi-step classification approach based on bistatic radar reflections to generate not only an ocean-ice classification but to classify between the three dominant ice types present. The classification was done in multiple steps based on GNSS bistatic radar observations only and includes checks for spatio-temporal consistency with each dominant class. Validation results are based on the comparison of the GNSS classification against SAR-derived sea ice type maps produced at the US National Ice Center. First, we derived classifications of sea ice-open water samples with a success rate of 97%, comparable to previous studies. Next, the sea ice type classification results identified FYI, MYI and young ice with success rates of 70%, 82% and 81%, respectively, indicating a strong sensitivity of the L-band GNSS bistatic radar signals to the different surface scattering properties of these primary ice types.With this manuscript we demonstrate the potential of the GNSS bistatic radar signals to classify ice types during the sea ice formation period. GNSS bistatic radar signals provide unique forward scattered measurements at L-band, potentially on a daily temporal revisit, that can be used to produce enhanced information on sea ice characteristics, such as those currently generated by other sensors. In order to determine the use of GNSS-R measurements on an operational basis, further studies are needed over a year-long period of sea ice growth and melt to determine the full benefit of GNSS for improving and providing complementary information to that generated by both microwave and optical sensors.

TI  - THE PHENOMENON OF MARGINALITY IN THE LITERATURE OF RUSSIAN AVANT-GARDE OF THE FIRST THIRD OF THE 20TH C
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Book Review
AB  - The monograph under review deals with the analysis of marginality as a defining creative principle of the Russian literary avant-garde. This principle is based on the change of axiological and artistic priorities and establishment of pluralism as a universal characteristic of the world perception of the first third of the twentieth century. The author distinguishes between avant-garde and avant-gardism on the principle of separation of pathos of destruction and pathos of creation. Thence a fresh look at the composition and scope of the Russian avant-garde is proposed. The phenomenon appears in its entirety of not only central, but also peripheral figures, their theoretical search and practical experiments in the field of poetics. The study for the first time has introduced into scientific discourse a number of unexplored authors - representatives of innovative art. Marginality, realized in artistic texts, is considered on a wide material of the authors of both the first and second row, as well as at different levels: genre, anthropological, general cultural. The paper convincingly shows how the worldview principles materialize themselves in the poetics of the unpreparedness, which manifests itself in the physiology of the artistic picture of the world, in the myth of the first creation, the emphasis on the future time, in the change of the paradigm of cultural universals. Consideration of the opposition of avant-garde and neoclassical allows to bring the problem of marginality in the anthropological context. This view makes it possible, in particular, to oppose acmeism and imagism and to prove the latter's bias towards the art of avant-garde. The marginality of the avant-garde is consistently considered on the examples of the relationship between the poet and the crowd, as well as in the context of the motives and images of buffoonery, madness, suicide dominating in the poetry of the avant-garde. Scrupulous analysis of genre-and book-making within the Russian avant-garde constitutes a separate part of the study.

M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important natural resource, which controls the hydrological cycle. To identify the groundwater potentiality, the different geo-environmental factors such as geomorphology, geology, slope, land use/land cover, lineament density, and distance from river, pond frequency, rainfall, soil texture, relief, stream junction frequency and topographic wetness index (TWI) have been used. Groundwater potential map has been prepared using frequency ratio (FR), Shannon's entropy (SE) and analytical hierarchical process (AHP) models in GIS environment. For the calculation of frequency ratio (FR) and Shannon's entropy models, 224 wells have selected randomly in the study area. The AHP is another important method that has also been used to determine the weights of various thematic layers on basis of relative importance scale of Saaty's for the identification of groundwater potential zone. Besides, the weighted overlay method has been applied to generate a single layer of the groundwater potential index (GWPI). GPWI of these three models has been categorized into four distinct classes, namely low, 'moderate', 'good' and 'excellent'. Excellent groundwater potential zones based on these models covers an area of about 11.68%, 10.44% and 10.05% of total basin respectively. Afterwards, composite groundwater potential zone (CGWPZ) has been prepared based on GWPI of FR, Shannon's entroy and AHP models. For the validation of the results from all these models, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve has drawn using the yield data of 60 pumping wells of this study area. The validated results show that the FR, Shannon's entropy and AHP models have achieved very good accuracy (AUC, What is AUC, spell in full=86.6% for FR model, AUC= 80.8% for Shannon's entropy model and AUC= 80.2% for AHP model), while CGWPZ has an excellent accuracy of AUC, 91%).

TI  - Interpolation of Instantaneous Air Temperature Using Geographical and MODIS Derived Variables with Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Several methods have been tried to estimate air temperature using satellite imagery. In this paper, the results of two machine learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, are compared with Multiple Linear Regression and Ordinary kriging. Several geographic, remote sensing and time variables are used as predictors. The validation is carried out using two different approaches, a leave-one-out cross validation in the spatial domain and a spatio-temporal k-block cross-validation, and four different statistics on a daily basis, allowing the use of ANOVA to compare the results. The main conclusion is that Random Forest produces the best results (R-2 = 0.888 +/- 0.026, Root mean square error = 3.01 +/- 0.325 using k-block cross-validation). Regression methods (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression) are calibrated with MODIS data and several predictors easily calculated from a Digital Elevation Model. The most important variables in the Random Forest model were satellite temperature, potential irradiation and cdayt, a cosine transformation of the julian day.

TI  - DETERMINATION OF FLOODING ZONES OF THE FLOODPLAIN ISLANDS ON THE TERRITORY OF THE KUIBYSHEVSKY WATER RESERVOIR USING REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - GEOSFERNYE ISSLEDOVANIYA-GEOSPHERE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water reservoirs islands, particularly islands of the Kuibyshev reservoir (the largest in Eurasia), are little-studied formations with both natural and anthropogenic origin. The reservoir water regime, which can have not only seasonal, but also weekly and daily dynamics, determines high dynamism of islands boundaries, as well as areas of surface and subsurface flooding. Determination of islands flooding zones is necessary both for monitoring of island systems and for efficient and sustainable land use management. The current study was performed to determine the flooding zones of islands of the Kazan District of Variable Backwater, which is located on the territory from the Zelenodolsk-Nizhnie Vyazovye bridge (55 degrees 49'27.1 '' N; 48 degrees 31'05.6 '' E) to the Kazan area (55 degrees 42'51.2 '' N 49 degrees 01'52.9 '' E). The water level on that part of the reservoir is characterized by significant annual fluctuations from 48.6 m to 53.5 m with a Normal Water Level of 53 m. On the area under investigation 262 object were distinguished with the total area of 1856.25 hectares (Fig. 1). To determine the boundaries of island systems at different water levels two multispectral Landsat 8 scenes were picked up: (1) scene from 1st October 2018 (water level in the reservoir - 51.55 m); (2) scene from 28th May 2013 (water level in the reservoir - 53.28). Landsat scenes were converted from Digital Numbers to Top of Atmosphere Reflectance values with subsequent atmospheric correction using DOS1 method. Finally, multispectral imagery was classified as ground or water land cover using Radom Forest technique. To train the classification model 300 points were randomly created on the territory of islands and 89 extra points were distributed on the full scene area. Overall accuracies of land use classification were 93.76% and 90.64% for the scene of 28th May 2013 and the scene of 1st Oct 2018, respectively. The results of land use classification of islands showed that according to the water level, significant areas become flooded (Fig. 3). At minimal water level of 51.55 m islands area were estimated as 2718.97 hectares. When the water level reaches normal water level (53 m), the surface area of islands reduces by 31.7% and estimates as 1857.25 hectares. At maximal water levels of 53.28 m, the island area reduces by another 14% and reaches 1596.76 hectares. Thus, the flood zone for all the floodplain islands of the Kazan region of variable backwater was estimated at 1122.21 hectares. The results showed, that depending on the water level, about 41.2% of the total islands area is subjected to periodic flooding. These areas are characterized by hydromorphic conditions with a corresponding effect on island ecosystems.

TI  - Role of muscle power output as a mediator between gait variability and gait velocity in hospitalized older adults
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute illness requiring hospitalization is a sentinel event leading to functional decline and frequently, long-term disability in older adults. Although functional decline has become a key outcome during and after hospitalization, there is currently no gold standard for measuring functional impairment. The purpose of this study was to compare gait characteristics and muscle performance endpoints of hospitalized older adults based on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score (0-12 points) obtained at admission, and to determine the association underlying the gait impairment. A total of 130 hospitalized older adults (aged >= 75) were included. The primary endpoints were differences in functional capacity between groups, assessed with the 6-m Gait Velocity Test (GVT), verbal and arithmetic GVT, followed by gait pattern data recorded using an inertial sensor unit. Maximal muscle strength (MS) and muscle power (MP) were also measured as muscle performance endpoints. A mediation analysis was performed to understand gait disorders. The walking parameters measured at admission were related to functional status and showed significant differences among phenotype groups (disabled, frail, and prefrail groups), as well as muscle performance endpoints (p < 0.05). Finally, the indirect effect was significant (-0.27; 95%CI, -0.59 to - 0.05), confirming the mediation role of MP between gait variability and gait velocity in this model. MP slightly weakens the relationship between gait variability and gait velocity. In addition to MS and MP, gait velocity and gait pattern parameters are distinguishing factors among acutely hospitalized older adults.

TI  - Effect of climate change and local management on aboveground carbon dynamics (1987-2015) in Zagros oak forests using Landsat time-series imagery
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest carbon stocks are a time-integrated manifestation of various phenomena and processes ranging from tree growth and mortality to natural and human disturbances. Understanding the effects of environmental and human activities is critically important in vulnerable ecosystems like arid and semi-arid forests, given climate variability coupled with historical human activities. Zagros forests are one of the largest vegetation communities in the Middle East. This region is highly affected by dust storms which are mainly a result of the loss of vegetation. This current study is an exploration of changes to aboveground carbon (AGC) density as affected by climate change (CC) and local management from 1987 to 2015 at 5-year intervals based on Landsat imagery and field data, analyzed with stochastic gradient boosting regression. Two sites with different local management practices were selected in Zagros coppice oak forests and AGC density was measured using field sampling. Four climate variables including mean annual temperature, rainfall, and evaporation were used to explore the effect of CC on AGC density dynamics over the study period. Results revealed an upward trend of AGC density in all intervals for both sites (from 6.36 to 7.5 ton ha(-1)) except for the 2010-2015 interval. The decrease of AGC density between 2010 and 2015 was likely related to dieback of oak trees due to different factors such as dust storms, pests, and other diseases. The trend of increasing AGC density in SarfiruzAbad forests was more than in Gahvareh forests, which is indicative of the young forest stand growth created by conservation and regeneration of damaged forests. Due to the large effect of local management on AGC density, our findings indicate that it was difficult to assess the effect of CC on AGC density. Our results suggest that other forests with a high degree of human disturbance, like Zagros forests, can play a role in mitigating global warming if the local management strategies are optimized. Additionally, these results demonstrate that in a region with no historical information about carbon stored in forests and woodlands, like most developing countries, Landsat-based AGC monitoring can provide information for forest managers and policy makers for understanding carbon accounting under human disturbances and CC, which could guide forest management strategies.

TI  - Forty-five years of oceanographic and meteorological observations at a coastal station in the NW Mediterranean: a ground truth for satellite observations
T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine and atmospheric parameters, including temperature observations from surface to 80 m (at 6 depths) are measured since September 1973 on a higher-than-weekly frequency, at a coastal station 4 km offshore L'Estartit (Costa Brava; NW Mediterranean). This constitutes the longest available uninterrupted oceanographic time series in the Mediterranean Sea. The present contribution focuses on observed climatic trends in temperature (degrees C/year) of air (AT; 0.05), sea surface (SST; 0.03), sea at 80 m depth (S80T; 0.02) and sea level (SL; 3.1 mm/year) as well as comparison with trends estimated from coincident high-resolution satellite data. The trending evolution is not uniform across seasons, being significantly higher in spring for both AT and SST, while in autumn for S80T. Other climatological results are a stratification increase (0.02 degrees C/year in summer temperature difference between 20 m (S20T) and S80T), trends in summer conditions at sea (when S20T > 18 degrees C), estimated as 0.5 and 0.9 days/year for the starting day and period respectively, and a decreasing trend of nearly 2 days/year in the period of conditions favourable for marine evaporation (when AT < SST). This last trend may be related to the observed decrease of coastal precipitation in spring. The long-term consistency in the in situ SST measurements presents an opportunity to validate the multi-decadal trends. The good agreement for 2013-2018 (RMS 0.5-0.6, bias - 0.1 to - 0.2; trends of 0.09 degrees C/year in situ vs. 0.06 to 0.08 degrees C/year from satellite) allows considering this observational site as ground truth for satellite observations and a monitoring site for climate change.

TI  - Sentinel-1 SAR instrument improved flight predictions based on measured in-orbit data
T2  - CEAS SPACE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1A SAR mission was launched in April 2014, followed by the Sentinel-1B Spacecraft in April 2016. Since then, several sets of in-orbit data have been evaluated to correlate the thermal model for being able to provide more detailed in-flight predictions. The need for detailed in-flight predictions is justified by the fact that the imaging performance of a SAR instrument depends mainly on the thermal performance of its high dissipative units. Components reaching their temperature limits during operational time define the end of the imaging phase, and thus the timespan during which and how often imaging operations can take place. An STM (Structural/Thermal Model) test correlation is standard throughout all missions, which usually delivers a very reliable model for further in-flight predictions. Nevertheless, this correlation does not give information about thermo-optical property degradation or environmental influences, because the effects in space on the thermally active surfaces are very hard to predict. For this reason, thermal engineers use relatively conservative values for in-flight predictions and End-of-Life thermal performance assessments. This might lead to mission performance limitations which predict a too short feasible imaging time of the Radar instrument. For this reason, the first approach was to evaluate the early acquired in-orbit data and to correlate the thermal model with the thermal configuration at Begin-of-Life to assess the maximum possible high dissipative imaging time possible for the Begin-of-Life situation. Then the flight data over a longer timespan were evaluated to determine potential temperature trends which could be caused by thermo-optical property degradation as well as seasonal-related influences. These two assessments combined, allow a thermal performance prediction for Mission End-of-Life, and thus a reliable determination of potential SAR imaging performance over the full mission time. The paper will present the correlation results of the initially measured in-flight data, the determined long-term in-orbit data over 3years, and the combination of both assessments including its impact on SAR imaging performance over the full mission.

TI  - Regulation of immune responses by tuft cells
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Tuft cells are rare, secretory epithelial cells that generated scant immunological interest until contemporaneous reports in 2016 linked tuft cells with type 2 immunity in the small intestine. Tuft cells have the capacity to produce an unusual spectrum of biological effector molecules, including IL-25, eicosanoids implicated in allergy (such as cysteinyl leukotrienes and prostaglandin D-2) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. In most cases, the extracellular signals controlling tuft cell effector function are unknown, but signal transduction is thought to proceed via canonical, G protein-coupled receptor-dependent pathways involving components of the signalling pathway used by type II taste bud cells to sense sweet, bitter and umami compounds. Tuft cells are ideally positioned as chemosensory sentinels that can detect and relay information from diverse luminal substances via what appear to be stereotyped outputs to initiate both positive and aversive responses through populations of immune and neuronal cells. Despite recent insights, numerous questions remain regarding tuft cell lineage, diversity and effector mechanisms and how tuft cells interface with the immunological niche in the tissues where they reside.

TI  - Combination of Multi-Temporal Sentinel 2 Images and Aerial Image Based Canopy Height Models for Timber Volume Modelling
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal Sentinel 2 optical images and 3D photogrammetric point clouds can be combined to enhance the accuracy of timber volume models on large spatial scale. Information on the proportion of broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models obtained from 3D photogrammetric point clouds. However, the broadleaf-conifer information cannot be obtained from photogrammetric point clouds alone. Furthermore, spectral information of aerial images is too inconsistent to be used for automatic broadleaf-conifer classification over larger areas. In this study we combined multi-temporal Sentinel 2 optical satellite images, 3D photogrammetric point clouds from digital aerial stereo photographs, and forest inventory plots representing an area of 35,751 km(2) in south-west Germany for (1) modelling the percentage of broadleaf tree volume (BL%) using Sentinel 2 time series and (2) modelling timber volume per hectare using 3D photogrammetric point clouds. Forest inventory plots were surveyed in the same years and regions as stereo photographs were acquired (2013-2017), resulting in 11,554 plots. Sentinel 2 images from 2016 and 2017 were corrected for topographic and atmospheric influences and combined with the same forest inventory plots. Spectral variables from corrected multi-temporal Sentinel 2 images were calculated, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) regressions were fitted for each Sentinel 2 scene estimating the BL% for corresponding inventory plots. Variables from the photogrammetric point clouds were calculated for each inventory plot and a non-linear regression model predicting timber volume per hectare was fitted. Each SVM regression and the timber volume model were evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation (CV). The SVM regression models estimating the BL% per Sentinel 2 scene achieved overall accuracies of 68%-75% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 21.5-26.1. The timber volume model showed a RMSE% of 31.7%, a mean bias of 0.2%, and a pseudo-R-2 of 0.64. Application of the SVM regressions on Sentinel 2 scenes covering the state of Baden-Wurttemberg resulted in predictions of broadleaf tree percentages for the entire state. These predicted values were used as additional predictor in the timber volume model, allowing for predictions of timber volume for the same area. Spatially high-resolution information about growing stock is of great practical relevance for forest management planning, especially when the timber volume of a smaller unit is of interest, for example of a forest stand or a forest district where not enough terrestrial inventory plots are available to make reliable estimations. Here, predictions from remote-sensing based models can be used. Furthermore, information about broadleaf and conifer trees improves timber volume models and reduces model errors and, thereby, prediction uncertainties.

TI  - On the Observability of the Time-Variable Lithospheric Signal in Satellite Magnetic Data
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - The lithospheric magnetic field, which is one of the main objectives of ESA's mission Swarm, is slowly varying in time due to an induced component. This variation is small (usually it is omitted in the lithospheric modelling) but recent advances in processing strategies and still-growing amount of satellite data open questions whether such an effect should be considered in the development of the lithospheric models-when using data from missions like CHAMP and Swarm. This effect can now be estimated over a period of 17 years (since the launch of CHAMP), and it is shown how the satellite measurements (over the observable part of the spectrum) can be referenced to one common epoch. For this purpose, we first inverted the magnetic field vector from CHAOS-6 over degrees 21-120, after subtraction of a remanent model, to a vertically integrated susceptibility map. Using this susceptibility distribution and taking into account the evolving core fields from the CHAOS-6 model, the time-varying lithospheric signal is computed. The results depend on the time span and the altitude considered, e.g., an altitude of 400 km and a span of 17 years can produce more than 0.5 nT variations resulting in a peak-to-peak value of nearly 1 nT. The vertically integrated quantities appear to be a useful choice for parameterising lithospheric time variations, also for providing data corrections at the satellite altitude. The effect of the choice of the core field, which enters the inversion, on the lithospheric time variation is also studied-this effect is found less important even for core fields 20 years apart.

TI  - Application of vegetation index time series to value fire effect on primary production in a Southern European rare wetland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire disturbance is an intrinsic component of the Mediterranean biome playing an important role in ecosystem dynamics and processes. However, frequent and severe anthropogenic wildfires can be detrimental to natural ecosystems, particularly in small natural protected areas, where they may hamper the flow of ecosystem services (ES). While post-fire dynamics of individual ES are heavily context-dependent, the primary productivity of the ecosystem can be regarded as a generic driver of several provisioning and regulating ES, as it represents the amount of energy available to plants for storage, growth, and reproduction, which drives future ecosystem structure and functions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of anthropogenic wildfire on the primary productivity of a rare wetland ecosystem in the Natura 2000 site "Torre Guaceto" in Southern Europe. Productivity was estimated by calculating a 15-year time series of vegetation indices (EVI and NDWI) from remotely sensed MODIS imagery. Our results in terms of PP trends may be relevant to assess the change in ecosystems services provided by wetlands. Interactions between wildfire, ecosystem productivity and climate were then analyzed. During the selected period, climate did not play a significant effect on primary productivity, which was mainly driven by post-fire vegetation recovery. Findings of the present study demonstrate that the wildfire affecting the Natural Protected Area of Torre Guaceto in summer 2007 had a major effect on primary productivity, inducing the regeneration of Phragmites australis and the replacement of old individuals by structurally and functionally better ones.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Groundwater Drought Monitoring Using Multi-Satellite Data Based on an Artificial Neural Network
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complex phenomenon caused by lack of precipitation that affects water resources and human society. Groundwater drought is difficult to assess due to its complexity and the lack of spatio-temporal groundwater observations. In this study, we present an approach to evaluate groundwater drought based on relatively high spatial resolution groundwater storage change data. We developed an artificial neural network (ANN) that employed satellite data (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)) as well as Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) models. The Standardized Groundwater Level Index (SGI) was calculated by normalizing ANN-predicted groundwater storage changes from 2003 to 2015 across South Korea. The ANN-predicted 25 km groundwater storage changes correlated well with both the in situ and the water balance equation (WBE)-estimated groundwater storage changes, with mean correlation coefficients of 0.87 and 0.64, respectively. The Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), having an accumulation time of 1-6 months, and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) were used to validate the SGI. The results showed that the SGI had a pattern similar to that of SPEI-1 and SPEI-2 (1- and 2-month accumulation periods, respectively), and PDSI. However, the SGI performance fluctuated slightly due to its relatively short study period (13 years) as compared to SPEI and PDSI (more than 30 years). The SGI, which was developed using a new approach in this study, captured the characteristics of groundwater drought, thus presenting a framework for the assessment of these characteristics.

TI  - Breast deformation during the course of radiotherapy: The need for an additional outer margin
T2  - PHYSICA MEDICA-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate and quantify the extent of breast deformation during the course of breast cancer (BC) radiotherapy (RT). The magnitude of breast deformation determines the additional outer margin needed for treatment planning to deliver a full dose to the target volume. This is especially important when using inverse planning techniques.Methods: A total of 93 BC patients treated with RT and with daily CBCT image guidance were selected for this study. Patients underwent either only breast-conserving surgery (BCS) (n = 5), BCS with sentinel node biopsy (n = 57) or BCS with radical axillary node dissection (n = 31). The treatment area included the whole breast and chest wall (54%) or also the axillary lymph nodes (46%). 3D-registration was conducted between 1731 CBCT images and the respective planning CT images to assess the difference in breast surface.Results: The largest maximum breast surface expansion (MBSE) was 15 mm; the average was 2.4 +/- 2.1 mm. In 294 fractions (17%), the MBSE was >= 5 mm. An outer margin of 8 mm would have been required to cover the whole breast in 95% of the treated fractions. There was a statistically significant correlation between the MBSE and body mass index (r = 0.38, p = 0.001).Conclusions: Significant changes in the breast surface occur during the course of BC RT which should be considered in treatment planning. An additional margin outside the breast surface of at least 8 mm is required to take into account the anatomical changes occurring during BC RT.

TI  - A Two-Season Impact Study of Radiative Forced Tropospheric Response to Stratospheric Initial Conditions Inferred From Satellite Radiance Assimilation
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the impacts of stratospheric temperatures and their variations on tropospheric short-term weather forecasting using the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) system with real satellite data assimilation. Satellite-borne microwave stratospheric temperature measurements up to 1 mb, from the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A), the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), and the Special Sensor microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMI/S), were assimilated into the WRF model over the continental U.S. during winter and summer 2015 using the community Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system. Adjusted stratospheric temperature related to upper stratospheric ozone absorption of short-wave (SW) radiation further lead to vibration in downward SW radiation in winter predictions and overall reduced with a maximum of 5.5% reduction of downward SW radiation in summer predictions. Stratospheric signals in winter need 48- to 72-h to propagate to the lower troposphere while near-instant tropospheric response to the stratospheric initial conditions are observed in summer predictions. A schematic plot illustrated the physical processes of the coupled stratosphere and troposphere related to radiative processes. Our results suggest that the inclusion of the entire stratosphere and better representation of the upper stratosphere are important in regional NWP systems in short-term forecasts.

TI  - Remote Sensing as a Method for Predicting Platinum-Metal Mineralization Based on a Study of the Eastern Sector of the Bushveld Complex
T2  - MOSCOW UNIVERSITY GEOLOGY BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The differentiated Bushveld Complex (the Republic of South Africa) has been studied on the basis of remote space and gravity-magnetic surveying. This article demonstrates the possibility of using Landsat 7 ETM+ multispectral space surveys and brightness parameters to predict platinum mineralization in new promising areas. Analysis of the gravitational field has shown that platinum mineralization in the studied area is concentrated in a rather narrow range of values, which enables one to use these data as a prospecting indicator. The main conclusions were made and the ability of Landsat 7 ETM+ multispectral space surveys to forecast platinum mineralization in new promising areas was demonstrated. These studies demonstrated the efficiency of integrated remote (space and geophysical) methods for the improvement of the approach to prospecting for platinum-copper-nickel mineralization.

TI  - A CIE Color Purity Algorithm to Detect Black and Odorous Water in Urban Rivers Using High-Resolution Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban black and odorous water (BOW) is a serious global environmental problem. Since these waters are often narrow rivers or small ponds, the detection of BOW waters using traditional satellite data and algorithms is limited both by a lack of spatial resolution and by imperfect retrieval algorithms. In this paper, we used the Chinese high-resolution remote sensing satellite Gaofen-2 (GF-2, 0.8 m). The atmospheric correction showed that the mean absolute percentage error of the derived remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) in visible bands is 25.19%. We first measured Rrs spectra of two classes of BOW [BOW with high concentrations of iron (II) sulfide, i.e., BOW1 and BOW with high concentrations of total suspended matter, i.e., BOW2] and ordinary water in Shenyang. Then, in situ R-rs data were converted into R-rs corresponding to the wide GF-2 bands using the spectral response functions. We used the converted Rrs data to calculate several band combinations, including the baseline height, [R-rs(green) - R-rs(red))/(R-rs(green) + R-rs(red)], and the color purity on a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity diagram. The color purity was found to be the best index to extract BOW from ordinary water. Then, Rrs (645) was applied to categorize BOW into BOW1 and BOW2. We applied the algorithm to two synchronous GF-2 images. The recognition accuracy of BOW2 and ordinary water are both 100%. The extracted river water type near Weishanhu Road was BOW1, which agreed well with ground truth. The algorithm was further applied to other GF-2 data for Shenyang and Beijing.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of land use dynamic variation using remote sensing data and landscape pattern in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS & SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban agglomeration of the Yangtze River Delta is one of the fastest expansions of urban regions in China. In this study, the variation of urban construction land and landscape patterns were studied based on the remote sensing image classification data of 2005,2010, and 2015. The results show that: 1) In the region, the change rate of urban construction land in 2010-2015 is significantly higher than that of 2005-2010.; 2) The rapid expansion of urban landscape leads to the reduction of farmland, while the total area of ecological space such as that of forest and waters is almost unchanged.; 3) The farmland fragmentation is enhanced and the corresponding shape is more complicated, but the shape of urban landscape is more continuous and regular during the urban expansion process.; and 4) The interference of human activities to ecological space is increasing. Therefore, the conclusion of this study provides the basic data for the spatial planning and ecological environment protection of urban agglomeration in Yangtze River Delta. Not only that, but it also promotes the sustainable development of ecological resources in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, as well as makes social and economic contributions.

TI  - A Comprehensive and Automated Fusion Method: The Enhanced Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion Model for Monitoring Dynamic Changes of Land Surface
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal fusion methods provide an effective way to generate both high temporal and high spatial resolution data for monitoring dynamic changes of land surface. But existing fusion methods face two main challenges of monitoring the abrupt change events and accurately preserving the spatial details of objects. The Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion method (FSDAF) was proposed, which can monitor the abrupt change events, but its predicted images lacked intra-class variability and spatial details. To overcome the above limitations, this study proposed a comprehensive and automated fusion method, the Enhanced FSDAF (EFSDAF) method and tested it for Landsat-MODIS image fusion. Compared with FSDAF, the EFSDAF has the following strengths: (1) it considers the mixed pixels phenomenon of a Landsat image, and the predicted images by EFSDAF have more intra-class variability and spatial details; (2) it adjusts the differences between Landsat images and MODIS images; and (3) it improves the fusion accuracy in the abrupt change area by introducing a new residual index (RI). Vegetation phenology and flood events were selected to evaluate the performance of EFSDAF. Its performance was compared with the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), the Spatial and Temporal Reflectance Unmixing Model (STRUM), and FSDAF. Results show that EFSDAF can monitor the changes of vegetation (gradual change) and flood (abrupt change), and the fusion images by EFSDAF are the best from both visual and quantitative evaluations. More importantly, EFSDAF can accurately generate the spatial details of the object and has strong robustness. Due to the above advantages of EFSDAF, it has great potential to monitor long-term dynamic changes of land surface.

TI  - Body Mass Index Effect on Health Service Utilization Among Active Duty Male United States Army Soldiers
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Obesity and overweight, defined as body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 and above or 25.0-29.9, respectively, are of significant concern to the military population, due to their associated comorbidities and potential for impaired readiness. In 2016, the US Army reported a prevalence of 17.3% obesity and 52.9% overweight among soldiers, despite both physical demands of the job and Department of Defense (DoD) guidelines which recommend separation from service for those unable to meet body composition standards. This study examines the health service utilization of active duty, male Army soldiers in order to determine the prevalence of obesity and overweight and to estimate the effects of these conditions on readiness. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study utilizing fiscal year (FY) 2015 TRICARE claims and military treatment facility (MTF) encounter data obtained from the Military Health System Data Repository (MDR), for 467,732 US Army male Soldiers on active duty. We obtained basic demographic information (age, race, and rank) from the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS). Next, we calculated BMI for this cohort by matching patients to their vital statistics of height and weight measurements. Finally, we obtained their health service utilization by querying and matching patients to their healthcare claims in 2015 by major diagnostic category. Findings: More than half (51.2%) of subjects had overweight, 28.9% had normal weight, 19.7% had obesity, and less than 1% had underweight. Soldiers with overweight and obesity were most common among the 25-34 years age range and enlisted ranks. Normal weight and underweight soldiers had a median of 7 healthcare visits in FY 2015, compared with 8 for soldiers with overweight and 12 for those with obesity. Soldiers with obesity, but not overweight, had a disproportionately greater number of healthcare encounters for diagnostic categories including musculoskeletal; mental health; ear, nose, and throat; and endocrine system. In contrast, soldiers with obesity had disproportionately fewer healthcare encounters for multiple significant trauma and for infectious and parasitic diseases. Conclusions: More than 70% of soldiers had overweight or obesity in FY 2015, showing the highest prevalence yet measured for these conditions. Previous reports of lower prevalence may be due to the inclusion of circumference-based body fat assessments, which have been criticized for inaccuracy. In our study, disproportionately high health service use by soldiers with obesity suggests decreased readiness, as these soldiers may experience both poorer health and lose necessary training time due to increased provider visits. Proportional usage by soldiers with overweight suggests the protective effect of regular physical activity, though these soldiers should be monitored to ensure that they do not progress to obesity. Additional research should establish the burden of cost, absenteeism, and presenteeism of obesity on the MHS, as well as developing more appropriate field tests for body fat assessment and BMI standards to better support military readiness.

T2  - QUATERNARY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focused on the analysis of land-use/land-cover changes and their impact on flood runoff, flood hazards and inundation, focusing in the Pampanga River basin of the Philippines. The land-cover maps for the years 1996 and 2016 were generated using Landsat images, and the land cover changes were analyzed using TerrSet Geospatial Monitoring and Modeling System (TGMMS). Based on an empirical approach and considering variable factors, the land-cover maps for the future were predicted using Land Change Modeler (LCM). After preparation of land-cover maps for past and future years, flood characteristics were analyzed using a distributed hydrological model named the rainfall runoff inundation (RRI) model with a land-cover map for different years. The impacts of land cover changes on flood runoff, flood volume and flood inundation were analyzed for 50- and 100-year floods. The results show that flood runoff, flood inundation volume and flood extent areas may increase in the future due to land-cover change in the basin.

TI  - State Patriotism and Jewish Nationalism in the Late Russian Empire: The Case of Vladimir Jabotinsky's Journalist Writing on The Russo-Japanese War, 1904-1905
T2  - NATIONALITIES PAPERS-THE JOURNAL OF NATIONALISM AND ETHNICITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In his autobiographical writings, the Russian-Jewish author and the founder of Zionist Revisionism Vladimir Jabotinsky constructed a retrospective self-image, according to which ever since becoming a Zionist early in the 20th century he exclusively clung to a Jewish national identity. This one-dimensional image was adopted by the early historiography of the Revisionist movement in Zionism. Contrary to this trend, much of the recent historiography on Jabotinsky has taken a different direction, describing him, particularly as a young man during the period of his early Zionism in Tsarist Russia, as a Russian-European cosmopolitan intellectual. Both these polarized positions are somewhat unbalanced and simplistic, whereas the figure of Jabotinsky and his worldview that emerge from reading his rich publicist writing in late Tsarist Russia present a far more complex picture of interplay between his deep ethnic-national primordial Jewish affinity, on the one hand, and an array of his different attachments to his non-Jewish surroundings including local, cultural, and civil identities, on the other. Focusing on Jabotinsky's unexplored journalist writings that address the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905, the article discovers a previously unknown identity pattern of the young Jabotinsky-his Russian state patriotism-and traces its relationship to his Jewish nationalism.

T2  - Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objectives: To examine the influence factors on axillary evaluation in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) patients, and the prognosis of different choices of axillary evaluation in a single-center retrospective study. Methods: Totally 1 557 DCIS patients admitted in Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center from January 2006 to November 2016 were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were female. The median age was 49 years (range: 21 to 85 years). Surgical methods included modified radical mastectomy, simple mastectomy (with or without axillary evaluation) and breast conservation surgery (with or without axillary evaluation). Axillary evaluation included axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). T tests, chi(2) test and Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze influence factors on axillary evaluation, respectively. Kaplan-Meier curve and Log-rank analysis were used to evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) and loco-regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) in patients with different surgical methods. Results: Among the 1 557 DCIS patients, there were 1 226 cases received axillary evaluation, while 331 cases not received axillary evaluation. Patients were separated into 3 groups by different axillary evaluation choices: SLNB group (957 cases, 61.46%), ALND group (197 cases, 12.65%) and no evaluation group (403 cases, 25.88%). The patients in SLNB group increased significantly (P=0.000), from 3.85% (60/1 557) in 2006 to 75.19% (1 170/1 557) in 2016. The independent influence factors of receiving axillary evaluation were high nuclear grade (OR=3.191, 95%CI: 1.722 to 5.912, P=0.001) and tumor size>15 mm (OR=1.698, 95%CI: 1.120 to 2.573, P=0.012). Also, patients received breast conservation surgery were more likely to refuse axillary evaluation (OR=0.155, 95%CI: 0.103 to 0.233, P=0.000). There were no significant differences in RFS and LRRFS in patients with different axillary evaluation choices. Conclusions: The investigation in trends and influence factors of different axillary evaluation choices provided basis on surgical precision medicine in DCIS patients. Patients received SLNB increased significantly. The independent influence factors of axillary evaluation were nuclear grade, tumor size and surgical methods. There was no significant differences in prognosis among the groups receiving different axillary evaluations.
AB  - 目的： 探讨乳腺导管原位癌（DCIS）患者的腋窝处理方式及其对预后的影响。 方法： 回顾性分析2006年1月至2016年11月于复旦大学附属肿瘤医院乳腺外科就诊的1 557例DCIS患者的临床资料。患者均为女性，中位年龄49岁（范围：21~85岁）。DCIS外科治疗方式主要有改良根治术、单纯乳房切除（含或不含腋窝淋巴结处理）及保留乳房手术（含或不含腋窝淋巴结处理）。腋窝淋巴结处理方式主要有腋窝淋巴结清扫（ALND）及前哨淋巴结活检（SLNB）。运用t检验及chi(2)检验对年龄、手术方式、核分级、肿瘤大小及术前活检等腋窝处理的相关因素进行单因素分析，采用Logistic回归进行多因素分析，采用Kaplan-Meier曲线及Log-rank检验分析不同腋窝处理方式患者的无复发生存及无局部区域复发生存。 结果： 1 226例患者接受腋窝处理，331例患者未接受腋窝处理。根据腋窝处理方式将患者分组，SLNB组957例（61.46%），ALND组197例（12.65%），未处理组403例（25.88%）。DCIS患者中SLNB的比例从2006年的3.85%（60/1 557）增至2016年的75.19%（1 170/1 557）（P=0.000）。接受腋窝处理的相关因素分析结果显示，保留乳房手术是不进行腋窝处理的独立相关因素（OR=0.155，95%CI：0.103~0.233，P=0.000），核分级高级别（OR=3.191，95%CI：1.722~5.912，P=0.001）和肿瘤最大径>15 mm（OR=1.698，95%CI：1.120~2.573，P=0.012）是接受腋窝处理的独立相关因素。不同腋窝处理方式DCIS患者的无复发生存及无局部区域复发生存均无明显差异。 结论： 本中心DCIS患者腋窝处理方式中，SLNB的应用随时间明显增加，手术方式、核分级、肿瘤大小是影响腋窝处理选择的独立相关因素。不同腋窝处理方式DCIS患者预后无明显差异。.

TI  - Effect of corporate governance on stock market liquidity: empirical evidence from Indian companies
T2  - DECISION
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the crucial role that stock market liquidity can play in the financial markets during times of financial turmoil, little is known about its drivers. The series of high-profile firm failures and economic distresses which have been initiated by liquidity risk mismanagement and model failure has highlighted the mounting importance of stock market liquidity, predominantly in the increasingly integrated global market. Corporate governance has been characterized as a set of mechanisms for board effectiveness and transparent disclosures. It protects investors from opportunistic behavior as it results in improved quality and quantity of information made available to them. It encompasses internal corporate governance variables pertaining to board structure and audit committee characteristics as well as the external corporate variables such as market control and takeovers. Indian companies are required to have more effective boards and are more transparent as required by the corporate governance and tougher disclosure legislations. The information so provided facilitates quality of price formation and helps in improving the stock market liquidity. This paper endeavors to investigate the impact of corporate governance (CG) on the stock market liquidity in Indian companies. The CG and stock market liquidity were measured in the sample BSE 500 listed companies during the FY 2013-FY 2017. Panel data regression model is applied for testing the hypothesized association. In addition, an effort has been made to investigate the overall scope of stock market liquidity in a broader context through a comprehensive analysis of stock market liquidity across industry sectors, size and individual company-specific characteristics. The study provides evidence of the important role played by CG in enhancing stock market liquidity of the company. It can guide the board of directors to enhance financial disclosures which consequently increases stock market liquidity. The analysis provides regulators, educators and investors an insight into the role of CG attributes in capital markets and thus helps them in improving their decision-making. It provides corporate policy makers some of the necessary inputs to chart the course of CG reforms and their enforcement in the country in future.

TI  - The relationship of woody plant size and leaf nutrient content to large-scale productivity for forests across the Americas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Ecosystem processes are driven by both environmental variables and the attributes of component species. The extent to which these effects are independent and/or dependent upon each other has remained unclear. We assess the extent to which climate affects net primary productivity (NPP) both directly and indirectly via its effect on plant size and leaf functional traits.2. Using species occurrences and functional trait databases for North and South America, we describe the upper limit of woody plant height within 200 x 200 km grid-cells. In addition to maximum tree height, we quantify grid-cell means of three leaf traits (specific leaf area, and leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentration) also hypothesized to influence productivity. Using structural equation modelling, we test the direct and indirect effects of environment and plant traits on remotely sensed MODIS-derived estimates of NPP, using plant size (satellite-measured canopy height and potential maximum tree height), leaf traits, growing season length, soil nutrients, climate and disturbances as explanatory variables.3. Our results show that climate affects NPP directly as well as indirectly via plant size in both tropical and temperate forests. In tropical forests NPP further increases with leaf phosphorus concentration, whereas in temperate forests it increases with leaf nitrogen concentration. In boreal forests, NPP most strongly increases with increasing temperature and neither plant size nor leaf traits have a significant influence.4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that at large spatial scales plant size and leaf nutrient traits can improve predictions of forest productivity over those based on climate alone. However, at higher latitudes their role is overridden by stressful climate. Our results provide independent empirical evidence for where and how global vegetation models predicting carbon fluxes could benefit from including effects of plant size and leaf stoichiometry.

M3  - Article
AB  - The online geoprocessing and analysis using state-of-the-art technology are offering automated analytical tools to a large group of users. This paper describes an online geoprocessing and analysis framework, which allows an inexperienced user to perform unsupervised classification of remote sensing data. The parallel computing based geoprocessing and analysis framework adopted in this work has been implemented using Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G). Web Processing Service (WPS) based geoprocessing framework facilitates the deployment of unsupervised classification algorithm on the web in a standardized way. However, it is dynamic in nature to deploy other geoprocessing algorithms. The developed system describes how to process remote sensing data (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, etc.) for classification and sharing the interoperable results in a distributed environment. To validate the classification results, a prototype architecture based on participatory GIS is developed for field data collection, accuracy assessment and online dissemination. The accuracy assessment (i.e., overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient) is performed to validate the derived classification results using collected field data.

TI  - Regression-Based Integrated Bi-sensor SAR Data Model to Estimate Forest Carbon Stock
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study is to estimate the forest aboveground carbon (AGC) stock using integrated space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from COSMO-Skymed (X band) and ALOS PALSAR (L band) with field inventory over a tropical deciduous mixed forest. Carbon acts as a vital constituent in the global decision making policy targeting the impact of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) and climate change. The study proposed an approach to develop regression models for assessing the forest AGC with synergistic use of SAR bi-sensor X and L band sigma nought data. The best-fit integrated aboveground biomass (AGB) model was validated with additional sample points that produced a model accuracy of 78.6%, adjusted R-2 = 0.88, RMSE = 16.6 Mg/ha, standard error of estimates of 16.03 and Willmott's index of agreement of 0.93. Resulting modeled AGB was converted to AGC using conversion factors. L band resulted in higher accuracy of estimates when compared to X band, while the estimation accuracy enhanced on integrating X- and L-band information. Hence, the study presents an approach using integrated SAR bi-sensor X and L bands that enhance the AGB and AGC estimation accuracy, which can contribute to the operational forestry and policy making related to forest conservation, REDD/REDD+ climate change, etc.

TI  - Simulating Rangeland Ecosystems with G-Range: Model Description and Evaluation at Global and Site Scales
T2  - RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland ecosystems and their roles in providing ecosystem services are vulnerable to changes in climate, CO2 concentration, and management. These drivers forcing widespread changes in rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation dynamics create two-way interactions and feedback loops between biogeochemistry and vegetation composition. To support spatial simulation and forecasting in the global rangelands, the G-Range global rangelands model couples biogeochemical submodels from the CENTURY soil organic matter model with dynamic populations' submodels for herbs, shrubs, and trees. Here is presented a model description for G-Range, including novel elements of G-Range and implementation of CENTURY code. An initial evaluation of G-Range at global and site scales follows. G-Range outputs for net primary productivity (NPP) and vegetation cover (herbs, shrubs, trees, bare ground) were evaluated against global MODIS layers at global and site scales, and aboveground and belowground NPP were compared with field data from globally distributed sites. Most model outputs evaluated were within the range of a priori benchmarks for tolerable absolute or relative error (two benchmarks per output, at two scales, for five outputs of NPP and vegetation cover). Trade-offs in model fit among variables, datasets, and scales indicated practical constraints on improving model fit with respect to the selected evaluation datasets, especially field NPP versus MODIS NPP. The relative effects of multiple drivers of rangeland vegetation change were the greatest sources of uncertainty in model outputs. G-Range is best suited to scenario analysis of large-scale and long-term impacts of climate, CO2, and management on rangeland ecosystem processes and vegetation, as well as ecosystem services, such as production of forage and browse and carbon sequestration.

TI  - HOST ASSOCIATIONS OF BITING MIDGES (DIPTERA: CERATOPOGONIDAE: <i>CULICOIDES</i>) NEAR SENTINEL CHICKEN SURVEILLANCE LOCATIONS IN FLORIDA, USA
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying host use is important for understanding transmission of vector-borne pathogens. Despite the importance of biting midges (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) in pathogen transmission, the vector-host relationships of most Culicoides species are poorly documented, even in locations where active arbovirus surveillance is conducted. Polymerase chain reaction-based blood-meal analysis was performed on 663 blood-engorged Culicoides females collected by 7 Florida mosquito control districts at 24 sentinel chicken arbovirus surveillance sites in 2017. A total of 638 blood meals were successfully analyzed to determine host species source, representing 11 Culicoides species. The most commonly bitten host was domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) (presumably sentinel chickens), constituting 565 of 638 (88.6%) the total blood meals. Other common hosts included humans (5.8%), white-tailed deer (Odoocoileus virginianus) (2.5%), and brown basilisk (Basiliscus vittatus) (1.6%). Significant differences in distribution of mammal and avian blood meals were found for a number of Culicoides species, and these patterns did not vary across locations. These results indicate that sentinel chickens are exposed to bites by Culicoides, potentially exposing them to Culicoides-borne pathogens. The findings that vertebrate host use was consistent across locations suggests that each Culicoides species has affinity for one or more specific animal groups, and does not feed randomly upon available animals.

TI  - Multisensor Characterization of Urban Morphology and Network Structure
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The combination of decameter resolution Sentinel 2 and hectometer resolution VIIRS offers the potential to quantify urban morphology at scales spanning the range from individual objects to global scale settlement networks. Multi-season spectral characteristics of built environments provide an independent complement to night light brightness compared for 12 urban systems. High fractions of spectrally stable impervious surface combined with persistent deep shadow between buildings are compared to road network density and outdoor lighting inferred from night light. These comparisons show better spatial agreement and more detailed representation of a wide range of built environments than possible using Landsat and DMSP-OLS. However, they also show that no single low luminance brightness threshold provides optimal spatial correlation to built extent derived from Sentinel in different urban systems. A 4-threshold comparison of 6 regional night light networks shows consistent spatial scaling, spanning 3 to 5 orders of magnitude in size and number with rank-size slopes consistently near -1. This scaling suggests a dynamic balance among the processes of nucleation, growth and interconnection. Rank-shape distributions based on root Area/Perimeter of network components scale similarly to rank-size distributions at higher brightness thresholds, but show both progressive then abrupt increases in fractal dimension of the largest, most interconnected network components at lower thresholds.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characterization of Mangrove Phenology and Disturbance Response: The Bangladesh Sundarban
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work presents a spatiotemporal analysis of the phenology and disturbance response in the Sundarban mangrove forest on the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh. The methodological approach is based on an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the new Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) BRDF and atmospherically corrected reflectance time series, preceded by a Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) separation of Low Rank and Sparse components of the image time series. Low Rank components are spatially and temporally pervasive while Sparse components are transient and localized. The RPCA clearly separates subtle spatial variations in the annual cycle of monsoon-modulated greening and senescence of the mangrove forest from the spatiotemporally complex agricultural phenology surrounding the Sundarban. A 3 endmember temporal mixture model maps spatially coherent differences in the 2018 greening-senescence cycle of the mangrove which are both concordant and discordant with existing species composition maps. The discordant patterns suggest a phenological response to environmental factors like surface hydrology. On decadal time scales, a standard EOF analysis of vegetation fraction maps from annual post-monsoon Landsat imagery is sufficient to isolate locations of shoreline advance and retreat related to changes in sedimentation and erosion, as well as cyclone-induced defoliation and recovery.

The development of this diverse space is one of the debated issues in the history of nomadic societies, which still remains relevant. A wide range of ecological zones led to the formation of a rich worldview which created mythological, ethnic, and symbolic images of spaces. For each particular natural zone there was formed a particular mechanism for comprehending and developing territories.

T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background This study investigates the incidence of post-operative complications and risk factors of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in melanoma patients. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a single cancer institution on 408 consecutive SLNBs. Results Fifty-five post-operative complications occurred in 39 (9.5%) patients and included: wound infection in 24 (5.9%), seroma and lymphorrhea in 15 (3.7%), wound dehiscence in seven (1.7%), lymphocele in six (1.5%) and others in three (0.7%). Univariate analysis failed to identify possible risk factors (i.e. gender, age, lymph node region, number of excised lymph nodes, Breslow index, pT levels, comorbidities, length of surgery and hospital stay). Metastatic sentinel nodes occurred in four of 135 (3%) patients with thin melanoma (Breslow <1 mm) and in 68 of 262 (25.9%) patients with Breslow >1 mm. Conclusion For patients with thin melanoma in whom the incidence of lymph node metastasis is low, the reported post-operative morbidity of almost 10% of SLNB highlights the need for careful patient selection.

TI  - Factors Associated With Osteoporosis Care of Men Hospitalized for Hip Fracture: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - JBMR PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rates of postfracture DXA and pharmacotherapy appear to be declining despite their known benefits in fracture reduction. We sought to identify factors associated with osteoporosis care among male veterans aged 50 years and older after hip fracture and to evaluate trends in rates of care with an observational cohort design using US Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) inpatient, pharmacy, and outpatient encounters and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services outpatient pharmacy claims (2007 to 2014) from men aged 50 years and older treated for hip fracture (N = 7317). We used the Cox proportional hazards model with random effects for the admitting facility. A sensitivity analysis was performed for a subset of patients aged 65 to 99 dually enrolled in Medicare (N = 5821). Overall, approximately 13% of patients had evidence of osteoporosis care within one year of fracture. In the adjusted model, rural residence was associated with lower likelihood of care, and several comorbidities were associated with higher likelihood of receiving care. In sensitivity analyses of patients dually enrolled in Medicare, rural residence remained associated with lower likelihood of osteoporosis care. Overall rates of care decreased over time, but rates of DXA in the VA remained stable. These findings highlight the ongoing problem of low rates of postfracture care among a population with the highest risk of future fracture and its associated morbidity and mortality. The rural disparity in care and differences in rates of care across healthcare delivery systems illustrates the importance of healthcare delivery systems in promoting pharmacotherapy and DXA after sentinel events. Because the VA removes a majority of cost barriers to care, this integrated healthcare system may outperform the private sector in access to care. However, declining rates of pharmacotherapy imply knowledge gaps that undermine quality care. (C) 2019 The Authors.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim's was to verify the influence of changes in land use and occupation in water availability in the river basin Urucui-Preto, Brazil, in the period 1984 to 2007. For the assessment of land use were used images from satellite Landsat 5 TM sensor (Thematic Mapper) and the classification of imagens was made by automatic supervised classification with the maximum likelihood algorithm. For the analysis of the hydrological behavior were used average flow data, maximum and minimum annual, minimum flow with seven days of annual duration (Q7) and flow rates associated with stays of 90% (Q90) and 95% (Q95) of the year. For the association between flow and land use was made the simple correlation between the variables, testing its 5% significance (p < 0.05). The results showed that when comparing the years 1984 and 2007, the Cerrado and Mata Riparian classes decreased 20.9% and 2.4% respectively, Solo Exposed / Crop Field class increased 13.48% and Burned Areas class increased by 9.83%. There were no significant correlations between changes of class variables in the use and occupation of land and the flows, due to the large area of the basin that has consequently reduced the hydrological effects.

TI  - Evaluation of MOD16 Algorithm over Irrigated Rice Paddy Using Flux Tower Measurements in Southern Brazil
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the hydrological cycle. Understanding the ET process has become of fundamental importance given the scenario of global change and increasing water use, especially in the agricultural sector. Determining ET over large agricultural areas is a limiting factor due to observational data availability. In this regard, remote sensing data has been used to estimate ET. In this study, we evaluated the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface ET product estimates (hereafter MOD16 ET - MODIS Global Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Product) over two rice paddy areas in Southern Brazil, through the ET measured using the eddy covariance technique (hereafter EC). The energy balance components were evaluated during fallow and flooded seasons showing latent heat flux dominates in both seasons. The results showed that MOD16 ET underestimated EC measurements. Overall, the RMSE (root mean square error) ranged between 13.40 and 16.35 mm 8-day(-1) and percent bias (PBIAS) ranged between -33.7% and -38.7%. We also assessed the ET (measured and estimated) main drivers, with EC yielding higher correlation against observed net radiation (R-n) and global radiation (R-g), followed by air temperature (Temp) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), whilst MOD16 ET estimates yielded higher correlation against leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR). The MOD16 algorithm was forced with meteorological measurements but the results did not improve as expected, suggesting a low sensitivity to meteorological inputs. Our results indicated when a water layer was present over the soil surface without vegetation (LAI around zero), the largest differences between EC measurements and MOD16 ET were found. In this period, the expected domain of soil evaporation was not observed in MOD16 ET physical processes partition, indicating the algorithm was not able to detect areas with high soil moisture. In general, the MOD16 ET product presented low accuracy when compared against experimental measurements over flooded rice paddy, suggesting more studies are necessary, in order to reduce uncertainties associated to the land cover conditions.

TI  - Use of MODIS NDVI Products to Map Tree Mortality Levels in Forests Affected by Mountain Pine Beetle Outbreaks
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive bark beetle outbreaks have recently occurred in western North American forests, resulting in overstory tree mortality across millions of hectares. Annual aerial surveys are currently used to operationally monitor bark beetle induced tree mortality, though this method is subjective and can exclude some forest areas. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data offer a potential alternative means to develop regional tree mortality maps. Accurate methods using such data could aid natural resource managers in surveys of forests with frequent overstory mortality, helping to prioritize forest treatment and restoration activities. This paper discusses a study to test the potential of using MODIS data to detect tree mortality. We developed and tested an approach to use 250-m resolution MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data products collected during a mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreak and related tree mortality event in the northern Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. The 94 km(2) study area is predominantly lodgepole pine forest with most of the MPB-caused mortality occurring between 2003 and 2008. We used a 2.4-m forest conditions map from 2008 aerial multispectral imagery to calculate percentage of mortality within 240-m pixels for use as reference data. Using either daily or 16-day products, MODIS NDVI change products were calculated for 2008 versus either 2000 or 2003 baselines. MODIS change products were used as predictors in linear regression analysis to assess correlation between MODIS data and the aerial percent forest mortality map. Depending on the MODIS product, linear regression analyses yielded r(2) values ranging from 0.362 to 0.544 without outliers removed and from 0.406 to 0.570 with extreme outliers removed. Daily MODIS NDVI products from 2003 and 2008 were used with exponential regression to improve the r(2) to 0.593. The project showed some MODIS NDVI data potential for mapping percent tree mortality in forests subjected to regional bark beetle outbreaks and severe drought.

TI  - Constraining the Coronal Heights and Readjustment Velocities Based on the Detection of a Few Hundred Seconds Delays in the Z Source GX 17+2
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Neutron star Z-type sources provide a unique platform in order to understand the structure of accretion disk-corona geometry emitting close to the Eddington luminosity. Using RXTE and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array Mission (NuSTAR) satellite data, we performed crosscorrelation function (CCF) studies in GX 17+2 in order to constrain the size of the corona responsible for hard X-rays. From the RXTE data, we found that during horizontal and normal branches, the CCFs show anticorrelated hard (16-30 keV) and soft (2-5 keV) X-ray delays of the order of a few tens to hundred seconds with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.42 +/- 0.11. Few observations shows correlated lags and, on one occasion, coincident with radio emission. We also report an anticorrelated hard X-ray delay of 113 +/- 51 s using the NuSTAR data of GX 17+2. Based on RXTE data, we find that soft and hard X-ray fluxes are varying, indicating the changes in the disk-corona structure during delays. We bridle the size of the corona using relativistic precession, transition layer models, and boundary layer models. Assuming the delays to be a readjustment timescale of the disk-corona structure, the height of the corona was estimated to be similar to 17-100 km. Assuming that the inner region of the truncated disk is occupied by the corona, we constrain the coronal readjustment velocities (nu(corona) = beta nu(disk), where nu(disk) is the radial velocity component of the disk) of the order of beta = 0.06-0.12. This study indicates that the observed delays are primarily dependent on the varying coronal readjustment velocities.

TI  - Land Cover Maps Production with High Resolution Satellite Image Time Series and Convolutional Neural Networks: Adaptations and Limits for Operational Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 satellite mission offers high resolution multispectral time-series image data, enabling the production of detailed land cover maps globally. When mapping large territories, the trade-off between processing time and result quality is a central design decision. Currently, this machine learning task is usually performed using pixel-wise classification methods. However, the radical shift of the computer vision field away from hand-engineered image features and towards more automation by representation learning comes with many promises, including higher quality results and less engineering effort. In particular, convolutional neural networks learn features which take into account the context of the pixels and, therefore, a better representation of the data can be obtained. In this paper, we assess fully convolutional neural network architectures as replacements for a Random Forest classifier in an operational context for the production of high resolution land cover maps with Sentinel-2 time-series at the country scale. Our contributions include a framework for working with Sentinel-2 L2A time-series image data, an adaptation of the U-Net model (a fully convolutional neural network) for dealing with sparse annotation data while maintaining high resolution output, and an analysis of those results in the context of operational production of land cover maps. We conclude that fully convolutional neural networks can yield improved results with respect to pixel-wise Random Forest classifiers for classes where texture and context are pertinent. However, this new approach shows higher variability in quality across different landscapes and comes with a computational cost which could be to high for operational systems.

TI  - A Comparison of WorldView-2 and Landsat 8 Images for the Classification of Forests Affected by Bark Beetle Outbreaks Using a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network: A Case Study in the Sumava Mountains
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this paper is to assess WorldView-2 (WV2) and Landsat OLI (L8) images in the detection of bark beetle outbreaks in the Sumava National Park. WV2 and L8 images were used for the classification of forests infected by bark beetle outbreaks using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and a Neural Network (NN). After evaluating all the available results, the SVM can be considered the best method used in this study. This classifier achieved the highest overall accuracy and Kappa index for both classified images. In the cases of WV2 and L8, total overall accuracies of 86% and 71% and Kappa indices of 0.84 and 0.66 were achieved with SVM, respectively. The NN algorithm using WV2 also produced very promising results, with over 80% overall accuracy and a Kappa index of 0.79. The methods used in this study may be inspirational for testing other types of satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2) or other classification algorithms such as the Random Forest Classifier.

TI  - Influence of environmental drivers on spatio-temporal dynamics of satellite derived chlorophyll a in the Strait of Georgia
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Strait of Georgia is a dynamic region with substantial spatio-temporal variability at lower trophic levels. This variability, in turn, may directly impact resident and migratory fish populations that are of major economic importance. MODIS-Aqua satellite products were used to provide a comprehensive spatial analysis of phytoplankton dynamics from 2003 to 2016 in the Northern and Central Strait of Georgia (SoG) in order to examine the relationships between environmental drivers and satellite-derived chlorophyll a (Chl a). Positive SST anomalies predominated between 2003-2006 and 2013-2016, with the strongest anomalies occurring from 2014 to 2016. Strong positive anomalies in Fraser River discharge, coupled with fewer wind events, led to early stratification during spring 2005 and 2015, resulting in moderate to strong anomalies in Chl a concentrations. Chl a in the Northern SoG was most highly correlated with SST and PAR (r(s) = 0.41, p < 0.01 and r(s) = 0.38, p < 0.01, respectively), whereas Chl a in the Central SoG was most highly correlated with Fraser River discharge (r(s) = 0.43, p < 0.01). Annual median Chl a anomalies were tightly coupled with large-scale climate indices (PDO, NPGO, SOI) in the Northern region; however, no such relationships were observed in the Central SoG, suggesting that variability in Chl a in the Central region is more strongly influenced by localized factors. Results from this study provide critical information regarding the key environmental drivers influencing spatio-temporal dynamics of Chl a in the SoG.

TI  - Deep Learning Architecture for Estimating Hourly Ground-Level PM<sub>2.5</sub> Using Satellite Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of PM2.5 concentration is a canonical predictive challenge due to the distribution of PM2.5 appears serious spatiotemporal variability at multiple scales. Currently, using satellite-based remote sensing data to estimate ground-level PM2.5 is a promising method for providing spatiotemporal continuous information of PM2.5. In this letter, we proposed a deep neural network (DNN)-based PM2.5 prediction model to capture the spatiotemporal variability of ground-level PM2.5 using the remote sensing aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the Himawari-8 satellite along with the conventional meteorological observation variables (denoted as PM25-DNN). The PM25-DNN model was trained and tested using the data from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China in 2017, and we compared the prediction performance between the PM25-DNN and the current state-of-the-art methods in this field. The results show that the PM25-DNN outperforms the other models with the cross-validated coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean prediction error (MPE), and relative prediction error (RPE) were 0.84, 19.9 mu g/m(3), 11.89 mu g/m(3), and 41.21%, respectively. Then, the trained PM25-DNN model was applied to estimate the hourly gridded PM2.5 with 1-km spatial resolution. Our results indicate that the DNN architecture can capture the essential spatiotemporal distribution associated with PM2.5 only using AOD data and conventional meteorological observational variables without more handcrafted features. The proposed PM25-DNN model can greatly improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimation, and it provides a new perspective for PM2.5 monitoring using end-to-end deep learning method.

TI  - An Assessment of Urban Sprawl in Northern Sakarya Province Following the 1999 Earthquake, NW Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying and monitoring the spatial and temporal dynamics of the land use/land cover (LULC) in a given region are critical for better characterizing land use generally, including that for social, economic and environmental purposes. Urbanization plays a key role in modifying land cover and has a widespread impact on the environment, where uncontrolled urban sprawl also leads to disruption of landscapes and habitat and degradation in biodiversity. Monitoring continuous LULC changes can provide helpful insights for decision makers of future planning, in terms of establishing robust land use management planning. However, urban growth is very complex phenomenon and hard to control under unpredictable disasters such as earthquakes. Here, we have focused on Sakarya Province in order to assess LULC change in the city following the 1999 Kocaeli earthquake. For this purpose, three Landsat satellite images were used covering the last two decades. Segmentation process and supervised classification of images were also employed. In the whole study region following the 1999 destructive earthquake, the image analysis result shows that the significant transformation in land use developed in the settlement area from 1291.5 to 1516.3 ha (up to 17.4% in ratio) due to migration. According to the results, a decrease of 21.2% was recorded in forest areas from 3505.7 to 2761.3 ha and a decrease of 15.8% was recorded in inland wetlands from 120.5 to 101.0 ha. In contrast, we have estimated an increase in agricultural areas from 63.2 to 67.2 ha (6.3% in ratio) despite a slight decrease in the 2008-2016 periods. In conclusion, we have observed a northern urban sprawl in the area where the natural balance is estimated to deteriorate in the coming years.

TI  - Oil pollution in the Eastern Arabian Sea from invisible sources: A multi-technique approach
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eastern Arabian Sea (EAS) is affected by oil pollution, as often evidenced by the presence of tarballs along the West Coast of India (WCI). Tarball samples collected during May 2017 along the Goa coast were subject to biomarker fingerprints, and the results matched with Bombay High (BH) oil fingerprints. The present study primarily aims at identifying the potential minor spill areas using Sentinel-imagery. Interestingly, repeated occurrence of oil spills detected at two locations, perfectly matched with BH platforms. The simulated Lagrangian trajectories also depict that tarball particles have originated from those detected locations. In 2017 alone, the quantity of spilled oil was estimated to be 129,3921. However, spills detected offshore regions of Kachchh and Mangalore were found to be caused by ships. This is the first comprehensive study, tracking the oil pollution sources in the EAS through multi-technique approach - chemical, remote sensing and numerical modeling.

TI  - Image fusion for MODIS and Landsat images using top hat based moving technique with FIS
T2  - CLUSTER COMPUTING-THE JOURNAL OF NETWORKS SOFTWARE TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The image fusion technique is widely used in various applications like military, remote sensing, security and medical imaging. In image fusion, two different images with similar index is fused to extract the exact information. The Landsat and Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer images taken from artificial satellite are not perfectly distinguishable. The principal component analysis, discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet transform with spatial frequency are the existing methods used for fusing images. The principal component analysis and discrete cosine transform were applicable only for low precision and low quality applications. Also, the output image faced drawbacks that resulted in blurred image with low recognition rate. In order to obtain image clarity and accuracy, the top hat based moving technique with fuzzy inference system is proposed in this paper. The white top hat and black top hat techniques filter the light and dark character of the image. Then the fusion is performed by fuzzy inference system. The proposed method is used to retrieve satellite images which are highly informative and the image clarity is also high since the entropy value of the proposed method is high when compared to other conventional techniques. The proposed method has higher PSNR value compared with the state-of-the-art techniques which indicates the proposed fused image has good quality.

TI  - Statistical Analysis and Stochastic Modelling of Hydrological Extremes
T2  - WATER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Analysis of hydrological extremes is challenging due to their rarity and small sample size and the interconnections between different types of extremes and gets further complicated by an untrustworthy representation of meso-scale processes involved in extreme events by coarse spatial and temporal scale models as well as biased or missing observations due to technical difficulties during extreme conditions. The special issue Statistical Analysis and Stochastic Modelling of Hydrological Extremes-motivated by the need to apply and develop innovative stochastic and statistical approaches to analyze hydrological extremes under current and future climate conditions-encompass 13 research papers. Case studies presented in the papers exploit a wide range of innovative techniques for hydrological extremes analyses. The papers focus on six topics: Historical changes in hydrological extremes, projected changes in hydrological extremes, downscaling of hydrological extremes, early warning and forecasting systems for drought and flood, interconnections of hydrological extremes and applicability of satellite data for hydrological studies. This Editorial provides an overview of the covered topics and reviews the case studies relevant for each topic.

TI  - Systematic modeling of impacts of land-use and land-cover changes on land surface temperature in Adama Zuria District, Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) has been increasing year after year globally. The present investigation was aimed to study the impact of land-use/land-cover changes on LST in the Adama Zuria District in Ethiopia. Land-use/land-cover, LST and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were extracted from Landsat TM (1989), Landsat ETM + (1999) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2016) using GIS and remote sensing tools. Land surface temperature was assessed using split window algorithm. Land-use/land-cover changes that occurred during 1989-2016 in the study area were evaluated and analyzed using geospatial tools and verified by field data. Results indicated that farmland covered more than 60% during the study period (1989-2016) followed by shrub land (>12%). Most areas with lower LST in 1989 were changed to higher LST in 1999 and 2016 in response to different changes in land-use/land-cover pattern. By linking land-use/land-cover pattern changes and LST using zonal statistics, LST is found to have negative relationship with the extent of vegetation cover. Land surface temperature results showed that the northwestern, south, lake Koka area and along Awash river relatively low LST that ranged between 9 and 21 degrees C in response to the high NDVI values. The eastern, Adama town and western part of the study area showed high LST of up to 42 degrees C. Visual comparison of 1989, 1999 and 2016 images showed that the land-use/land-cover type and NDVI status play a major role for the variability of LST values. Correlation between LST and land-use changes has indicated that changes to settlement/urban land-use/land-cover have influenced LST proportionately. Relevant measures are to be taken by the bodies concerned to minimize land-use/land-cover changes to gain effective control over increasing LST in the study area.

TI  - Effects of damming on the hydrological regime of Punarbhaba river basin wetlands
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1992, damming was performed in Punarbhaba river (India and Bangladesh), disturbing water flow and riparian wetland ecology. We measured the eco-hydrological failure rate, degree of flooding alteration and degree of eco-hydro deficit in relation to indicators of hydrological alteration in riparian wetlands. Normalized Differences Water Index (NDWI) and Modified Normalized Differences Water Index (MNDWI) images derived from Landsat satellite images were studied. A greater intensity of NDWI and MNDWI score were associated with the higher amount of water availability and therefore, monthly NDWI and MNDWI values were used. We showed that due to the attenuation of water availability (52% in pre-monsoon season, 34% in monsoon, and 32% in post-monsoon seasons), most months had a considerable decrease of NDWI/MNDWI scores, often below acceptable ecological thresholds. The registered failure rates for attaining the eco-hydrological threshold exceeded 100%. The estimated degree of flooding alteration in the larger parts of wetlands reached 100%, indicating a high degree of impact. Up to 54% of wetlands were eco-hydrologically deficit and 36% of wetlands were critically affected. Sustenance of ecological flow is necessary to reduce the growing hydrological crisis of the wetland habitat and ecosystem.

AB  - Lake Balkhash is the third largest inland lake in Central Asia after the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea. The Ili River-Balkash Lake Basin resides in the southeastern part of the Republic of Kazakhstan and the western part of China's Ili Prefecture, which belongs to the arid and semi-arid region. In the middle to late 20th century, the Ili River-Balkash Lake Basin was affected by climate change and human activities, and the problems of water ecology and water resources became increasingly prominent, which became the focus of attention for China and Kazakhstan. In this study, the water level derived from radar altimeter data, the water surface area extracted from Landsat data, and the temperature and precipitation data in the basin were comprehensively utilised. Data analysis of the time course and correlation of hydrological, meteorological elements in the lake basin, water dynamic changes, and influencing factors of Lake Balkhash was studied. The results show that the cyclical change of regional climate is the main factor affecting the change of lake water, and human activities in the short term can regulate the change of water volume in Lake Balkhash. The research results in this paper can provide a scientific basis for the solution of water disputes in cross-border rivers between China and Kazakhstan.

TI  - Ground Moving Target 2-D Velocity Estimation and Refocusing for Multichannel Maneuvering SAR with Fixed Acceleration
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult for multichannel maneuvering synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to achieve ground moving target 2D velocity estimation and refocusing. In this paper, a novel method based on back projection (BP) and velocity SAR (VSAR) is proposed to cope with the issues. First, the static scene is reconstructed by BP to solve the imaging problem of multichannel maneuvering SAR. Then, the static clutter is suppressed, and the range velocity is estimated via VSAR processing. As for azimuth velocity estimation and refocusing, a velocity search method based on velocity-aided BP (VA-BP) and VSAR is proposed to accomplish them. First, each azimuth velocity in the search and the estimated range velocity are used to image the moving target in a small-sized subimage space by VA-BP, i.e., matching the range history and the Doppler phase of the moving target in the image processing. Then, multiple sets of multichannel SAR subimages corresponding to different azimuth velocities are generated, and the clutter of each set of multichannel SAR subimages is also suppressed by VSAR processing. After that, the azimuth velocity is estimated by searching the clutter-suppressed subimage of the first spatial receiving channel in each set of multichannel SAR subimages with the best refocusing quality measured by the minimum entropy. Simulation results show the proposed method can reach high accuracy in moving target 2D velocity estimation and refocusing with the absolute error of 2D velocity estimation smaller than 0.1 m/s.

TI  - Incremental Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Large-Scale Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In spite of remarkable success of the convolutional neural networks on semantic segmentation, they suffer from catastrophic forgetting: a significant performance drop for the already learned classes when new classes are added on the data having no annotations for the old classes. We propose an incremental learning methodology, enabling to learn segmenting new classes without hindering dense labeling abilities for the previous classes, although the entire previous data are not accessible. The key points of the proposed approach are adapting the network to learn new as well as old classes on the new training data, and allowing it to remember the previously learned information for the old classes. For adaptation, we keep a frozen copy of the previously trained network, which is used as a memory for the updated network in the absence of annotations for the former classes. The updated network minimizes a loss function, which balances the discrepancy between outputs for the previous classes from the memory and updated networks, and the misclassification rate between outputs for the new classes from the updated network and the new ground-truth. For remembering, we either regularly feed samples from the stored, little fraction of the previous data or use the memory network, depending on whether the new data are collected from completely different geographic areas or from the same city. Our experimental results prove that it is possible to add new classes to the network, while maintaining its performance for the previous classes, despite the whole previous training data are not available.

TI  - Water productivity assessments for dwarf coconut by using Landsat 8 images and agrometeorological data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coastal areas of Northeast Brazil, coconut growers are replacing the tall varieties by the dwarf ones, following incentives for the coconut's water market. The current study aimed to determine and analyze actual evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass production (BIO), for dwarf coconut water productivity (WP) assessments. This was done to subsidize the rational irrigation and crop management, by using Landsat 8 images together with agrometeorological data during the year 2016 in the Camocim County, coastal zone of Ceara state. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was used to retrieve ET, while for BIO estimations we applied the Monteith's radiation use efficiency model (RUE), then the water productivity based on ET was calculated (WPET = BIO/ET). The highest ET and BIO rates, above 4.0 +/- 0.6 mm d(-1) and 140 +/- 37 kg ha(-1) d(-1), respectively, happened from May to July, retrieving WPET pixel values larger than 3.5 kg m(-3). It was noticed some water stress conditions, with the fraction ET to reference evapotranspiration (ET0) dropping below 0.60 from the start of August to the end of the year, affecting the WPET values. Considering also WP in terms of fruits and coconut's water produced, it averaged 1.9 coconut fruits and 0.8 L of coconut water per cubic meter of water consumed, respectively. The results can support techniques for irrigation water storage at the palm root zones, while increasing dwarf coconut yield in Northeast Brazil.

TI  - Health and economic burden of influenza-associated illness in South Africa, 2013-2015
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Economic burden estimates are essential to guide policy-making for influenza vaccination, especially in resource-limited settings. Methods We estimated the cost, absenteeism, and years of life lost (YLL) of medically and non-medically attended influenza-associated mild and severe respiratory, circulatory and non-respiratory/non-circulatory illness in South Africa during 2013-2015 using a modified version of the World Health Organization (WHO) worksheet based tool for estimating the economic burden of seasonal influenza. Additionally, we restricted the analysis to influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI; subsets of all-respiratory illnesses) as suggested in the WHO manual. Results The estimated mean annual cost of influenza-associated illness was $270.5 million, of which $111.3 million (41%) were government-incurred costs, 40.7 million (15%) were out-of-pocket expenses, and $118.4 million (44%) were indirect costs. The cost of influenza-associated medically attended mild illness ($107.9 million) was 2.3 times higher than that of severe illness ($47.1 million). Influenza-associated respiratory illness costs ($251.4 million) accounted for 93% of the total cost. Estimated absenteeism and YLL were 13.2 million days and 304 867 years, respectively. Among patients with influenza-associated WHO-defined ILI or SARI, the costs ($95.3 million), absenteeism (4.5 million days), and YLL (65 697) were 35%, 34%, and 21% of the total economic and health burden of influenza. Conclusion The economic burden of influenza-associated illness was substantial from both a government and a societal perspective. Models that limit estimates to those obtained from patients with WHO-defined ILI or SARI substantially underestimated the total economic and health burden of influenza-associated illness.

TI  - Transhumance as a driving force of landscape change in the marginal grabens of northern Ethiopia
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transhumance between the Afar lowlands and Tigray escarpments has been a common practice in northern Ethiopia. However, the impact of transhumance on landscape changes in the marginal grabens has not been significantly researched. Hence, this study aims to understand the process of transhumance and the linkages between social and biophysical aspects of the graben landscapes of northern Ethiopia. Google Earth (2010-2016) and Landsat Imageries (1995-2015) were used to analyse the spatio-temporal landscape changes. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was applied to measure the change in vegetation cover. Interview and Focus Group Discussions were used to collect perceptions of communities on transhumance and landscape change. The findings reveal that transhumance caused conflicts between the lowlanders and highlanders, which in turn led to displacement of communities. Consequently, the NDVI value of the abandoned settlement increased over time. Conversely, the analysis of Google Earth Imageries and NDVI values show that vegetation cover of the new settlement has decreased. Moreover, the NDVI values of the transhumance areas showed little increase due to the establishments of exclosures in the escarpments. The findings of this study can, therefore, be used to develop targeted interventions aimed at solving transhumance-induced conflicts, displacement of communities and conservation of natural resources.

TI  - Using Farmer Decision Rules for Mapping Historical Land Use Change Patterns from 1954 to 2007 in Rural Northwestern Vietnam
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study revealed how local socioecological knowledge elucidated during participatory rural appraisals and historical remote sensing data can be combined for analyzing land use change patterns from 1954 to 2007 in northwestern Vietnam. The developed approach integrated farmer decision rules on cropping preferences and location, visual and supervised classification methods, and qualitative information obtained during various forms of participatory appraisals. The integration of historical remote sensing data (aerial photo, Landsat, LISS III) with farmer decision rules showed the feasibility of the proposed method to explain crop distribution patterns for the assessment period of 53 years. Our approach is beneficial for data-limited environments, which is a prevalent situation for many developing regions. The derived land use and crop type dataset was used for understanding how anthropogenic activities altered the study area of the Chieng Khoi commune during the assessment period of five decades, and what potential impact this can have on the natural resource base. The newly developed approach offers a methodological pathway that can be easily transferred to local government authorities for a better understanding of cropping transitions and agricultural expansion trends in data-limited rural landscapes. The detected land use change patterns and upland cropping expansion of more than two hundred percent in 53 years not only revealed the consequences of the interactions and feedback between farmers and their land, but further highlighted the urgent need for implementing sustainable land management practices in the case study watershed of the Chieng Khoi commune and northwestern Vietnam in general.

AB  - Monitoring urban sprawl is a vital component to assess landscape changes as it directly affects the quality of life. Multi date landuse and land-cover thematic layers were generated using multi-date high resolution remote-sensing data and Survey of India topo-sheet and spatial changes in urban land-use and urban-sprawl were studied using GIS. The residential and commercial urban area of city increased from 14,865.8 and 2,121.27 hectares in 1991 to 35,564 and 3,527.34 hectares in 2014. This study revealed that 51% of agricultural land and 2% of water bodies have been transformed as other urban land use features, in the form of built-ups. Based on current landscape trends, a 29-year forward simulation for the years 1991 to 2020 was performed using GIS land use change modeller analysis tool. The results show that by 2020 the residential and commercial urban of Chennai would increase to 51,059 and 4,246.7 hectares, respectively.

TI  - Remote Sensing and GIS Contribution to a Natural Hazard Database in Western Saudi Arabia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The most frequent disasters in Western Saudi Arabia are flash floods, earthquakes and volcanism, especially submarine volcanism potentially causing tsunamis in the Red Sea and submarine mass movements, dust storms and droughts. As the consequences and effects of the climate change are expected to have an increasing impact on the intensity and occurrence of geohazards as flash floods, length of drought periods, or dust storms, the systematic, continuous monitoring of these hazards and affected areas using satellite data and integration of the results into a geographic information systems (GIS) database is an important issue for hazard preparedness and risk assessment. Visual interpretation and digital image processing of optical aerial and satellite images, as well as of radar images, combined with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) PALSAR DEM data are used in this study for the mapping and inventory of areas prone to geohazards, such as flash floods or tsunami flooding. Causal or critical environmental factors influencing the disposition to be affected by hazards can be analyzed interactively in a GIS database. How remote sensing and GIS methods can contribute to the detection and continuously, standardized monitoring of geohazards in Western Saudi Arabia as part of a natural hazard geodatabase is demonstrated by several examples, such as the detection of areas prone to hydrological hazards, such as flash floods causing flooding of roads and settlements, the outlining of coastal areas of the Red Sea prone to tsunami flooding and storm surge, the mapping of traces of recent volcanic activity, and of fault/fracture zones and structural features, especially of ring structures.

TI  - The role of cryptic diversity and its environmental correlates in global conservation status assessments: Insights from the threatened bird's-eye primrose (<i>Primula farinosa</i> L.)
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Most of the fundamental questions in conservation biogeography require the description of species geographic boundaries and the identification of discrete biological units within these boundaries. International conservation efforts and institutions rely mainly on traditional taxonomic approaches for defining these boundaries, resulting in significant cryptic diversity going undetected and often extinct. Here, we combine high-throughput genomic data with publicly available environmental data to identify cryptic diversity in the threatened bird's-eye primrose (Primula farinosa). We aim to characterize evolutionary lineages and test whether they co-occur with changes in environmental conditions. These lineages can be used as intraspecific units for conservation to enhance assessments regarding the status of threatened species. Location Europe and temperate Asia (latitude, 40-65 degrees N; longitude, 10 degrees E-115 degrees W). Methods We genotyped 93 individuals from 71 populations at 1,220 loci (4,089 SNPs) across the Eurasian distribution of P. farinosa. We used phylogenomic and population structure approaches to identify intraspecific lineages. We further extracted statistically derived and remotely sensed environmental information, that is land cover, climate and soil characteristics, to define the biotic and abiotic environment inhabited by each lineage and test for niche similarities among lineages. Additionally, we tested for isolation by distance among populations and applied linear and polynomial regressions to identify lineage-environment associations. Results Analyses of genomic data revealed six major lineages within P. farinosa corresponding to distinct geographic areas. Niche similarity tests indicated that lineages occupy distinct abiotic and biotic space. Isolation by distance indicated that geography alone cannot explain genetic divergence within P. farinosa, while lineage-environment associations suggested potential adaptation to different abiotic conditions across lineages. However, relationships with the land cover classes, a proxy for habitat, were weaker. Main conclusion Our results highlight the need for incorporating intraspecific diversity in global assessments of species conservation status and the utility of genomic and publicly available environmental data in conservation biogeography.

TI  - Detection of land use/cover changes of the KOSH region over a period of 14 years using the South African National Land Cover datasets for 2000 and 2014
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple algebraic change detection techniques viz. image difference and image ratio were applied to the South African national land use / cover (NLC) datasets of years 2000 and 2014, prepared in grid format covering the Klerksdorp-Orkney-Stilfontein-Hartebeestfontein (KOSH) region in order to assess land use/land cover changes. Both the 2000 and 2014 NLC datasets were generated from Landsat images using different classification schemes and the code values & attributes of the land cover classes of the two datasets were different/not comparable. In order to make these datasets comparable for change detection, the NLC2000 dataset was examined in ArcView GIS by superimposing it onto the NLC2014 dataset and similarities and differences were identified. For each cover type of the NLC2000 dataset, comparable cover type of the 2014 dataset was identified by making a query to the NLC2000 dataset and after viewing the spatial distributions of selected units in respect of the NLC2014 dataset. Suitable code values of NLC2014 dataset were identified for the NLC2000 dataset and it was later reclassified. The land use / cover change detection study reveals that increase in areas were observed for the cover types: Cultivated common fields (low), Cultivated common fields (med), Mines 2 semi-bare, Wetlands, Urban commercial and Plantations/woodlots mature. The Grassland, Thicket/dense bush, Urban residential (dense trees/bush), Mines 1 bare, and Cultivated common pivots (high) showed a decrease in places. During the 14 years, Grassland had decreased from 2,132.47 km2 (77.35% of the total area) to 1,629.78 km2 (59.11% of the total area) owing to landscape transformation to other land covers (e.g. Cultivated common fields and Urban residential) due to human activities. The percentage increase in areas observed for the Cultivated common fields (low and medium) were 8.21% and 2.96% while the Mines 2 semi-bare, Wetlands, Urban commercial, Plantations/woodlots mature showed increases of 0.67%, 0.32%, 0.28% and 0.23% respectively. The area of Thicket/dense bush decreased from 108.15 km2 to 56.71 km2 (change of 1.87%). Maps of land use/land cover changes and statistics obtained for the changed areas are very useful for identifying various changes occurring in different classes and for monitoring land use dynamics.

TI  - Validation and Accuracy Assessment of MODIS C6.1 Aerosol Products over the Heavy Aerosol Loading Area
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) products over heavy aerosol loading areas. For this analysis, the Terra-MODIS Collection 6.1 (C6.1) Dark Target (DT), Deep Blue (DB) and the combined DT/DB AOD products for the years 2000-2016 are used. These products are validated using AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data from twenty-three ground sites situated in high aerosol loading areas and with available measurements at least 500 days. The results show that the numbers of collections (N) of DB and DT/DB retrievals were much higher than that of DT, which was mainly caused by unavailable retrieval of DT in bright reflecting surface and heavy pollution conditions. The percentage falling within the expected error (PWE) of the DT retrievals (45.6%) is lower than that for the DB (53.4%) and DT/DB (53.1%) retrievals. The DB retrievals have 5.3% less average overestimation, and 25.7% higher match ratio than DT/DB retrievals. It is found that the current merged aerosol algorithm will miss some cases if it is determined only on the basis of normalized difference vegetation index. As the AOD increases, the value of PWE of the three products decreases significantly; the undervaluation is suppressed, and the overestimation is aggravated. The retrieval accuracy shows distinct seasonality: the PWE is largest in autumn or winter, and smallest in summer. The most severe overestimation and underestimation occurred in the summer. Moreover, the DT, DB and DT/DB products over different land cover types still exhibit obvious deviations. In urban areas, the PWE of DB product (52.6%) is higher than for the DT/DB (46.3%) and DT (25.2%) products. The DT retrievals perform poorly over the barren or sparsely vegetated area (N = 52). However, the performance of three products is similar over vegetated area. On the whole, the DB product performs better than the DT product over the heavy aerosol loading area.

TI  - Building a SAR-Enabled Data Cube Capability in Australia Using SAR Analysis Ready Data
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - A research alliance between the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and Geoscience Australia was established in relation to Digital Earth Australia, to develop a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-enabled Data Cube capability for Australia. This project has been developing SAR analysis ready data (ARD) products, including normalized radar backscatter (gamma nought, gamma(0)), eigenvector-based dual-polarization decomposition and interferometric coherence, all generated from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath mode data available on the Copernicus Australasia Regional Data Hub. These are produced using the open source ESA SNAP toolbox. The processing workflows are described, along with a comparison of the gamma(0) backscatter and interferometric coherence ARD produced using SNAP and the proprietary software GAMMA. This comparison also evaluates the effects on gamma(0) backscatter due to variations related to: Near- and far-range look angles; SNAP's default Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM and a refined Australia-wide DEM; as well as terrain. The agreement between SNAP and GAMMA is generally good, but also presents some systematic geometric and radiometric differences. The difference between SNAP's default SRTM DEM and the refined DEM showed a small geometric shift along the radar view direction. The systematic geometric and radiometric issues detected can however be expected to have negligible effects on analysis, provided products from the two processors and two DEMs are used separately and not mixed within the same analysis. The results lead to the conclusion that the SNAP toolbox is suitable for producing the Sentinel-1 ARD products.

TI  - Multi-Hazard Risk Assessment at Community Level Integrating Local and Scientific Knowledge in the Hodh Chargui, Mauritania
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-climatic risk assessments at the regional scale are of little use in the risk treatment decision-making process when they are only based on local or scientific knowledge and when they deal with a single risk at a time. Local and scientific knowledge can be combined in a multi-hazard risk assessment to contribute to sustainable rural development. The aim of this article was to develop a multi-hazard risk assessment at the regional scale which classifies communities according to the risk level, proposes risk treatment actions, and can be replicated in the agropastoral, semi-arid Tropics. The level of multi-hazard risk of 13 communities of Hodh Chargui (Mauritania) exposed to meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought, as well as heavy precipitations, was ascertained with an index composed of 48 indicators representing hazard, exposure, vulnerability, and adaptive capacity. Community meetings and visits to exposed items enabled specific indicators to be identified. Scientific knowledge was used to determine the hazard with Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets, Landsat images, and the method used to rank the communities. The northern communities are at greater risk of agricultural drought and those at the foot of the uplands are more at risk of heavy rains and consequent flash floods. The assessment proposes 12 types of actions to treat the risk in the six communities with severe and high multi-hazard risk.

TI  - The Social Complexity of the Pazyrik Culture in Altai, 550-200 BC
T2  - SOCIAL EVOLUTION & HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The reconstruction of the ancient nomads' social organization based on archaeological materials reveals a number of objective difficulties. However, mass material evidence and developed methodological approaches allow, based on the experience of predecessors, presenting the level of the social complexity. The reflection of this situation is demonstrated by the history of studying the world famous Pazyryk culture. A substantial amount of objective information allowed the authors of the article to consistently solve problems of social interpretation of the existing data set and consider the consistency of the selected signs of statehood in relation to the unification of the Altai nomads in the Scythian-Saka time. Based on the several basic indicators (spatial-territorial-geographical factor; population size and density; economic and cultural types; craft activity; presence of large population consolidation centers; social stratification (including management apparatus), taxation; foreign policy contacts, sign-communicative system; worldview, etc.) it is concluded that the population of the Pazyryk were in the process of socio-political complexity formation of the indicated level.

TI  - Global DNA methylation changes in rock pigeon (<i>Columba livia</i>) as a sentinel species due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons exposure in Tehran (Iran) as a megacity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Global DNA methylation, as an epigenetic modifications, can be a promising genomic marker for monitoring the contaminants and predicting their adverse health effects. The study aims to assess the effects of 16 PAH concentration on the altered DNA methylation levels in the kidney and liver of rock pigeon (Columba livia), as a sentinel species, from Tehran megacity as well as 40 days benzo(a)pyrene in vitro exposure: (0.1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 mg kg(-1) bw). Data indicated that the total LMW-PAH (low molecular weight PAHs) group (120.22, 121.34, 103.69, and 128.79 ng g(-1) dw in liver, kidney, skin, and muscle, respectively) in the Tehran samples have higher levels than the other PAHs groups. In addition, the DNA methylation level had negative relation with the total amount of PAHs in liver and kidney. A comparatively higher global DNA hypomethylation (by 8.65% in liver and 3.76% in kidney) was observed in birds exposed to B(a)P. Our results lead us to suggest that DNA hypomethylation in liver and kidney associated with the B(a)P may be useful biomarker discovery (more than the amount of PAH concentration in different tissues of C. livia) in urban areas. In conclusion, based on the overall results assessed, DNA methylation changes in pigeon may show a new target pathway for evaluation of environmental health.

TI  - An orbit-based remote sensing geological assessment of the CanMars Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment (MSRAD) landing site situated in the Henry Mountains Basin, near Hanksville, Utah
T2  - PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mars-analogous and relevant terrestrial- and orbit-based remote sensing datasets were gathered and used for both an in and out of simulation geological assessment of a pre-selected "landing site" for the CanMars, Mars Sample Return Analogue Deployment (MSRAD), and Mars Utah Rover Field Investigation (MURFI) analogue missions. The analogue mission site is situated in the Henry Mountains Basin just outside of Hanksville, Utah. The results of a comprehensive multispectral analysis based on Landsat 8 and ASTER of the landing site, landing ellipse area, and surrounding region, were synthesized with other datasets providing information on the morphology and basic physical properties of the spectrally-defined surface units. The synthesis yielded insights into the geologic materials present, the sampling opportunities for the analogue rover available at the site and the geologic history of the site. The datasets provided to the in-simulation science team were determined to be sufficient to generally identify similar to 88% of the geologic units previous mapped in the field. The area was determined to be dominated by clastic sedimentary rocks (a high-silica/quartz- and Fe-oxide-bearing geologic materials), but also include a variety of aqueous alteration phases consistent with a complex climate, environmental, and water-rock history. Positive identification of additional phases from orbit include: Al-smectite clay-, gypsum- and carbonate-bearing rocks or deposits. An association between these components with fine-scale layered bedrock exposures and sinuous ridges, consistent with inverted channels, provide evidence of a viably Mars-analogous "landing site", which yeilds diverse samples for in-situ analysis and sampling by the CanMars and MURFI analogue missions.

TI  - Bi-organ paired exchange-Sentinel case of a liver-kidney swap
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPLANTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Organ transplantation is the optimal treatment for patients with end stage liver disease and end stage renal disease. However, due to the imbalance in the demand and supply of deceased organs, most transplant centers worldwide have consciously pursued a strategy for living donation. Paired exchanges were introduced as a means to bypass various biologic incompatibilities (blood- and tissue-typing), while expanding the living donor pool. This shift in paradigm has introduced new ethical concerns that have hitherto been unaddressed, especially with nondirected, altruistic living donors. So far, transplant communities have focused efforts on separate liver- and kidney-paired exchanges, whereas the concept of a transorgan paired exchange has been theorized and could potentially facilitate a greater number of transplants. We describe the performance of the first successful liver-kidney swap.

TI  - <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> Blooms in a Coastal Upwelling System: Remote Sensing Detection, Toxicity and Environmental Variables
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The NW coast of the Iberian Peninsula is dominated by extensive shellfish farming, which places this region as a world leader in mussel production. Harmful algal blooms in the area frequent lead to lengthy harvesting closures threatening food security. This study developed a framework for the detection of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in the Galician rias from satellite data (MERIS full-resolution images) and identified key variables that affect their abundance and toxicity. Two events of toxin-containing Pseudo-nitzschia were detected (up to 2.5 mu g L-1 pDA) in the area. This study suggests that even moderate densities of Pseudo-nitzschia in this area might indicate high toxin content. Empirical models for particulate domoic acid (pDA) were developed based on MERIS FR data. The resulting remote-sensing model, including MERIS bands centered around 510, 560, and 620 nm explain 73% of the pDA variance (R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.001). The results show that higher salinity values and lower Si(OH)(4)/N ratios favour higher Pseudo-nitzschia spp. abundances. High pDA values seem to be associated with relatively high PO43, low NO3- concentrations, and low Si(OH)(4)/N. While MERIS FR data and regionally specific algorithms can be useful for detecting Pseudo-nitzschia blooms, nutrient relationships are crucial for predicting the toxicity of these blooms.

TI  - Integration of LiDAR and multispectral images for rapid exposure and earthquake vulnerability estimation. Application in Lorca, Spain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a procedure for assessing the urban exposure and seismic vulnerability that integrates LiDAR data with aerial images from the Spanish National Plan of Aerial Orthophotography (PNOA). It comprises three phases: first, we segment the satellite image to divide the study area into different urban patterns. Second, we extract building footprints and attributes that represent the type of building of each urban pattern. Finally, we assign the seismic vulnerability to each building using different machine-learning techniques: Decision trees, SVM, logistic regression and Bayesian networks.We apply the procedure to 826 buildings in the city of Lorca (SE Spain), where we count on a vulnerability database that we use as ground truth for the validation of results. The outcomes show that the machine learning techniques have similar performance, yielding vulnerability classification results with an accuracy of 77%-80% (F1-Score).The procedure is scalable and can be replicated in different areas. This is particularly relevant in Spain, where more than seven hundred towns have to develop seismic risk studies in the years to come, according to the General Direction of Civil Protection and Emergencies. It is especially interesting as a complement to conventional data gathering approaches for disaster risk applications in cities where field surveys need to be restricted to certain areas, dates or budget.

TI  - Seasonal variability of mesoscale eddies of the Lofoten Basin using satellite and model data
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lofoten Basin in the Norwegian Sea is the area where the warm Atlantic Water exhibits the greatest loss of heat than anywhere else in the Nordic Seas. It is called a "hot spot" of the Nordic Seas because of its high intense mesoscale eddy activity. Mesoscale eddies contribute significantly to the total oceanic heat and salt transport by advective trapping, stirring and mixing, and thus play an important role in the heat and salt balance of the region. A purpose of this study is to examine seasonal variability of mesoscale eddies in the Lofoten Basin using satellite altimetry data and GLORYS reanalysis. Satellite altimetry is used to track individual eddies, and co-located vertical profiles based on GLORYS data allow to study thermohaline characteristics inside the eddy cores. We analyze numbers of cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the Lofoten Basin using an eddy identification and tracking algorithm and demonstrate that the occurrences of eddies depend strongly on the season. We analyze seasonal variability of temperature, salinity, and potential density anomalies in zonal sections across the core of the Lofoten Vortex and explore spatial variability of thermohaline characteristics of mesoscale eddies at the depth of 450 m in different seasons.

AB  - This study analyses the spatial and temporal characteristics of coastal upwelling events in the Uruguayan coast using satellite data and the output of an atmospheric reanalysis. We focus on the most intense upwelling events which occurred on synoptic time scales during the summer season. We were able to distinguish two upwelling configurations associated to different wind conditions due to the coast orientation: an upwelling mainly located in the Rio de la Plata estuary which responds to easterly winds, and an oceanic upwelling located in the eastern (oceanic) coast of Uruguay associated to northeasterly winds. Moreover, the frequency of occurrence of upwelling events on interannual time scales was found to depend on the phase of El Nino Southern Oscillation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Frequency of metastasis in sentinel lymph node and its predictors in patients with laryngeal cancer Ti<sub>1-2</sub>N<sub>0</sub>M<sub>0</sub>
T2  - PATHOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the work is to establish the frequency of metastatic lesions of the precricoid sentinel lymph node (SNL) in patients with laryngeal cancer T1-2N0M0 and to determine the predictors associated with the metastatic potential of the primary cancer tumor.Materials and methods. The study involved 61 patients with T1-2N0M0 laryngeal cancer with an average age of 57.71 +/- 0.93 years; among them 56 (91.1 %) persons were male patients. Confirmed diagnosis of laryngeal cancer without clinical signs of regional metastasis was the criterion for inclusion in the study. Specialized treatment was carried out according to the protocol, with the use of larynx resections of various extents with the tumor removal in the first stage of combination treatment. The metastasis of precricoid SNL was determined histomorphologically using surgical material. The relationship between metastasis and microcirculatory indices was established by calculating the association coefficient and Fisher's exact test with the creation of a 2 x 2 table. The relative risk of metastasis was calculated. Data are presented in the form of relative risk and confidence intervals of Cl.Results. It has been established that in 15 patients (26.2 %) tumor extension corresponded to the T1N0M0 criterion and in 46 (73.8 %) persons to T2N0M0. The pathomorphological study of removed precricoid SNLs (n = 61) verified metastatic lesions (pN1sn) in 7 (11.4 %) patients with T2N0M0.Statistical analysis of the study found that there is a relationship between metastasis and the depth of invasion (association index 0.85), the degree of tumor differentiation (association index 0.66) and the bypass index (association index 0.96). It was found that when the value of the bypass index is higher than 1.63 pF units, the relative risk of metatases increases by 54 %, RR = 2.72 [1.64; 4.52] 95 % CI, OR = 13.06 [1.39; 122.50], DI 95 %, with an invasion depth of greater than 6.28, the relative risk of metatases increases by 39 %, RR = 4.5 [1.72; 11.76], CI 95 %, OR = 8 [1.89; 33.81], CI 95 %.Conclusions. Revealed critical values of quantitative indicators of such predictors of laryngeal cancer metastasis as the extension of the process to T2N0M0, the depth of tumor invasion more than 6.28 +/- 0.18 mm, the low degree of differentiation (G3), the prevalence of shunt blood flow over the nutritive one-shunt indicator is greater than 1.84 +/- 0.05, can be used for intraoperative prediction of the presence of latent metastasis in the SNL and indicate the advisability of performing s multaneous sheath-fascial lymph node dissection of the neck on the side of the larynx lesion.

T2  - NATIVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land occupation process in the Brazilian Cerrado has severely impacted its natural landscape in the last decades. In this study, we estimated the land use and land cover changes occurred in the MATOPIBA region between 2000 and 2016 by using remotely sensed data and techniques. We also estimated the irrigated fields and deforested lands occurred within protected areas in the study region. Nine land use and land cover classes (water bodies, dense cerrado, open cerrado, riparian forest, agriculture, irrigated fields, shade, burned fields, and exposed soil) were detected by using Landsat imagery and by applying the Maximum Likelihood remote sensing technique. Based on our study results, we observed an increase of 40,9% agricultural fields and exposed soils during between 2000 and 2016 in the study region. Irrigated fields increased approximately 154% (102,000 ha) during the studied period. Although different types of anthropization were observed throughout the study area, the major increasing change was observed within the southern portion, where the most suitable agricultural lands are concentrated. The anthropization also increased within protected lands of sustainable use, where conservation activities should be prioritarily enforced in the study region, such as the creation of ecological corridors and public policies aiming sustainable use of its natural resources.

T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at assessing the feasibility of automatically producing analysis-ready radiometrically terrain-corrected (RTC) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) gamma nought backscatter data for ingestion into a data cube for use in a large spatio-temporal data environment. As such, this study investigates the analysis readiness of different openly available digital elevation models (DEMs) and the capability of the software solutions SNAP and GAMMA in terms of overall usability as well as backscatter data quality. To achieve this, the study builds on the Python library pyroSAR for providing the workflow implementation test bed and provides a Jupyter notebook for transparency and future reproducibility of performed analyses. Two test sites were selected, over the Alps and Fiji, to be able to assess regional differences and support the establishment of the Swiss and Common Sensing Open Data cubes respectively.

TI  - Transcendence and Knowability of the Unsublatable: Van Til and Hegel on the Concrete Universal
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF CHRISTIAN CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In an age dominated by modem rationalism, Immanuel Kant's critique of immediacy transformed traditional Christian understandings of divine transcendence and incomprehensibility into a doctrine of unknowability. In order to ascertain God's knowability, Hegel sought to establish a process of mediation between transcendence and immanence by reconceptualizing the Christian doctrine of the Trinity in terms of an evolutionary science of logic. Hegel's historical and logical Trinity, however, posits an ultimate identity between God's mind and human consciousness, rendering the absolute as the intrinsic essence of humanity, an essence that is still in the process of becoming. This article probes into how Cornelius Van Til recalibrates Hegel's notions of the "concrete universal" and "worldview" by incorporating them into an ontological system of classical Trinitarian orthodoxy, offering a rejoinder to Hegel by reasserting the elacsical Reformed understanding of God's transcendence and immanence, incomprehensibility and knowability, within a distinctively modern philosophical context.

TI  - Flood Monitoring in Vegetated Areas Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1 Data: Impact of Time Series Features
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is particularly suitable for large-scale mapping of inundations, as this tool allows data acquisition regardless of illumination and weather conditions. Precise information about the flood extent is an essential foundation for local relief workers, decision-makers from crisis management authorities or insurance companies. In order to capture the full extent of the flood, open water and especially temporary flooded vegetation (TFV) areas have to be considered. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellite constellation enables the continuous monitoring of the earths surface with a short revisit time. In particular, the ability of S-1 data to penetrate the vegetation provides information about water areas underneath the vegetation. Different TFV types, such as high grassland/reed and forested areas, from independent study areas were analyzed to show both the potential and limitations of a developed SAR time series classification approach using S-1 data. In particular, the time series feature that would be most suitable for the extraction of the TFV for all study areas was investigated in order to demonstrate the potential of the time series approaches for transferability and thus for operational use. It is shown that the result is strongly influenced by the TFV type and by other environmental conditions. A quantitative evaluation of the generated inundation maps for the individual study areas is carried out by optical imagery. It shows that analyzed study areas have obtained Producer's/User's accuracy values for TFV between 28% and 90%/77% and 97% for pixel-based classification and between 6% and 91%/74% and 92% for object-based classification depending on the time series feature used. The analysis of the transferability for the time series approach showed that the time series feature based on VV (vertical/vertical) polarization is particularly suitable for deriving TFV types for different study areas and based on pixel elements is recommended for operational use.

AB  - The 2017 M-w 6.5 Jiuzhaigou earthquake (JE) struck a rugged area of the Jiuzhaigou Valley in eastern Tibet that has experienced frequent seismic activity over the last few decades. We use finite-element models (FEMs) and Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar observations to characterize the earthquake source. The FEM domain accommodates a heterogeneous (HET) distribution of realistic crustal materials inferred by regional seismic tomography data. The HET-derived source configurations yield a significantly smaller misfit, at the 95% confidence level, than that estimated for a homogeneous (HOM) half-space. The former generally requires a lower degree of smoothing constraint, highlighting that the HET solutions are systematically more compatible with the surface observations than the HOM solutions. The magnitudes of induced Coulomb failure stress change (Delta CFS) estimated by the HET solution drastically differ (by >0.1 MPa) from those calculated by the HOM solution. The post-earthquake stability of near-field faults is generally overestimated by the HOM estimations, whereas some localities of negative Delta CFS(HOM )are predicted with positive Delta CFSHET. These results highlight the sensitivities of both slip and stress estimations to the complexity of the adopted elastic modeling domain, leading to more accurate aftershock hazard assessments. The HET-resolved seismic rupture reveals two major slip asperities of magnitude up to 0.83 m distributed along the fault strike, which is coherent with the aftershock distribution. Two aftershock clusters are consistently found near or below these two peak-slip zones, which are imaged by the HET model but absent in the HOM solution. The JE hypocenter and aftershocks are bounded below by a negative velocity anomaly (Delta V-P, Delta V-S down to -4%) at similar to 18 km depth. Such low-velocity layers of reduced strength may be relevant to the vertical distribution of seismicity and earthquake slip, which provide insights into assessing the seismic hazards and aftershock-prone areas of the eastern Tibetan margin.

TI  - SOMATISMS IN RECURRING RHYMES OF ANDREI BELY
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article highlights the relevance of nominations of human body' s parts and organs in Andrei Bely's creative heritage, both in quantitative and artistic respects. The study is to show that various poems of Andrei Bely, written in different years, are connected with each other by repeated rhymes (rhymed formulas), one of which is somatism. The paper displays and describes rhymes, embodied in a variety of formal variations (with rhyme homogeneous and heterogeneous, open and closed, male and female, with active and passive rhyming somatism) and containing nominations of body parts and human organs the most common in Andrei Bely' s idiolect: hand (dominant), chest, head, eye, face, leg in a position of the final rhyme, illustrative of the hierarchy of meanings in the individual linguistic worldview of Andrei Bely. The author claims that additional repetitions of one or several words, partial and even complete quotation' s coincidence of lines along with the described rhymes strengthen internal communications between the verses created by the poet through different intervals of years as fragments of the one huge poetic text. The results obtained may be interesting for literary critics studying the work of Andrei Bely and other poets of the Silver age and may be used in the practice of compiling a dictionary of the poet.

TI  - Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) Change Detection in Wami River Basin, Tanzania
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic activities have substantially changed natural landscapes, especially in regions which are extremely affected by population growth and climate change such as East African countries. Understanding the patterns of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is important for efficient environmental management, including effective water management practice. Using remote sensing techniques and geographic information systems (GIS), this study focused on changes in LULC patterns of the upstream and downstream Wami River Basin over 16 years. Multitemporal satellite imagery of the Landsat series was used to map LULC changes and was divided into three stages (2000-2006, 2006-2011, and 2011-2016). The results for the change-detection analysis and the change matrix table from 2000 to 2016 show the extent of LULC changes occurring in different LULC classes, while most of the grassland, bushland, and woodland were intensively changed to cultivated land both upstream and downstream. These changes indicate that the increase of cultivated land was the result of population growth, especially downstream, while the primary socioeconomic activity remains agriculture both upstream and downstream. In general, net gain and net loss were observed downstream, which indicate that it was more affected compared to upstream. Hence, proper management of the basin, including land use planning, is required to avoid resources-use conflict between upstream and downstream users.

TI  - The utility of PET-CT in the staging and management of advanced and recurrent malignant melanoma
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Accurate pre-operative staging and correct surgical selection of patients with malignant melanoma reduces unnecessary morbidity and mortality, improves distant control and may improve survival. F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography (F-18-FDG PET-CT) has been shown to be useful in exclusion of metastatic sites and aids in surgical planning in stage III and potentially resectable stage IV disease. The primary objective of the study was to determine whether the use of PET-CT alters the initial staging and management of patients with advanced and recurrent melanoma.Methods: Retrospective analysis of clinical records of patients with malignant melanoma referred for staging PET-CT over a three-year period at our institution was performed. Pre- and post-PET-CT stage was recorded and a descriptive analysis was done to determine whether PET-CT resulted in a change in stage grouping and whether this change effected a change in clinical management.Results: A change in stage grouping occurred in 21/39 (53.8%) of patients, 76.2% of which were up-staged and 23.8% down staged. On analysis of stage III/IV and recurrent melanoma, a change in stage occurred in 90% of stage III, 50% of stage IV and 50% of recurrent melanoma patients. This effected a change in management in 86.7% of patients with stage III, IV and recurrent melanoma collectively.Conclusion: PET-CT is a useful tool in the staging and subsequent management of melanoma. Its utility is pronounced in advanced and recurrent melanoma.

TI  - Determination of Net Radiation Balance using Satellite Imagery in Odeda Local Government Area, Ogun State, Nigeria
T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The energy received on the earth surface is responsible for driving activities on the earth and not all energy emitted by the sun reaches the earth surface; some are absorbed, reflected or scattered. There is need to determine the amount of energy that reaches the earth surface since not all the energy emitted from the sun reaches the earth. This energy is also responsible for making our general climate warm which ultimately brings us to the determination of Net radiation. This study applied remote sensing method to determine net radiation over Odeda Local Government Area. A Sentinel image from 2013 covering the study area was downloaded and computations were done using bands 5 and 7. These bands were used to compute the surface albedo, incoming short wave radiation, incoming long wave radiation and outgoing long wave radiation. The spectral signatures for each component from sentinel data were analysed, using the ArcGIS 10.6. The results showed the net radiation to be of moderate intensity with values ranging between 630.83 wm(-2) and 684.68 wm(-2). The mean value over majority of the area was 651.20 wm(-2) and the albedo of the area was low, with values ranging from 0.0028 to a value of 0.29 which is an indication of low reflectivity. This implied that more radiation was absorbed in the study area which impacted the soil temperature thereby influencing reduced soil moisture and a higher rate of evapotranspiration from plants within the study area.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Sharpening Using a Reduced-Rank Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite constellation was deployed for mapping and monitoring the Earth environment. Images acquired by the sensors mounted on the S2 platforms have three levels of spatial resolution: 10, 20, and 60 m. In many remote sensing applications, the availability of images at the highest spatial resolution (i.e., 10 m for S2) is often desirable. This can be achieved by generating a synthetic high-resolution image through data fusion. To this end, researchers have proposed techniques exploiting the spectral/spatial correlation inherent in multispectral data to sharpen the lower resolution S2 bands to 10 m. In this paper, we propose a novel method that formulates the sharpening process as a solution to an inverse problem. We develop a cyclic descent algorithm called S2Sharp and an associated tuning parameter selection algorithm based on generalized cross validation and Bayesian optimization. The tuning parameter selection method is evaluated on a simulated data set. The effectiveness of S2Sharp is assessed experimentally by comparisons to state-of-the-art methods using both simulated and real data sets.

TI  - Analysis and simulation of land cover changes and their impacts on land surface temperature in a lower Himalayan region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is changing the existing patterns of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) globally which is consequently increasing the Land Surface Temperature (LST) in many regions. Present study was focused on estimating the current and simulating the future LULC and LST trends in the alpine environment of lower Himalayan region of Pakistan. Past patterns of LULC and LST were identified through the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-spectral Landsat satellite images during 1987-2017 data period. The Cellular automata (CA) model and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) were applied to simulate future (years 2032 and 2047) LULC and LST changes, respectively, using their past patterns. CA model was validated for the simulated and the estimated LULC for the year 2017 with an overall Kappa (K) value of 0.77 using validation modules in QGIS and IDRISI software. ANN method was validated by correlating the observed and simulated LST for the year 2017 with correlation coefficient (R) and Mean Square Error (MSE) values of 0.81 and 0.51, respectively. Results indicated a change in the LULC and LST for instance the built-up area was increased by 4.43% while agricultural area and bare soil were reduced by 2.74% and 4.42%, respectively, from 1987 to 2017. The analysis of LST for different LULC classes indicated that built-up area has highest temperature followed by barren, agriculture and vegetation surfaces. Simulation of future LULC and LST showed that the built-up area will be increased by 2.27% (in 2032) and 4.13% (in 2047) which led 42% (in 2032) and 60% (in 2047) of the study area as compared to 26% area (in 2017) to experience LST greater than 27 degrees C. A strong correlation between built-up area changes and LST was thus found signifying major challenge to urban planners mitigating the consequent of Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. It is suggested that future urban planning should focus on urban plantation to counter UHI phenomena in the region of lower Himalayas.

TI  - METHODS OF CHEKHOV'S CHARACTER CONCEPTUAL STRATEGY GENERATION (BASED ON SHORT STORIES)
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the concept as a worldview category, a cognitive matrix and a genre factor which allows determining the place of the author's concept in the system of receptive expectations, the comic/dramatic dichotomy, and contributes to the analysis of Chekhov's narrative discourse, developing classification of works based on the subject motif. Hence the definition of such notions as information and interpretation fields of the concept. Concept rank is analyzed from the standpoint of greeting idioms and familiar atmosphere. Information field of the concept is explored in terms of nicknames, psychology of gesture. Field of interpretation is explored in the context of spectacular symbolism, sound symbolism, cultural allegiance. As the paper reveals the peculiarity of the field of interpretation lies in the menippea nature of the stories, provocative receptive expectations, outlining the boundary between familiar and profane. Ideological essence of the concept rank is implemented in parody and axiological connotations. Cognitive nature of the concept of rank lies in the connection of the sensory image, information content, field of interpretation. The authors consider the mask as one of the derivatives of the concept rank. Informational field is analyzed in terms of the hero's cognitive strategy, everyday speech phraseology, culture of laughter s formulaic poetics, designators. The paper shows specifics of the information and interpretation fields of the concept from the standpoint of author's remarks and their functions of caricature attributes, spectacle and sound symbolism, onomatopoeia, carnivalization, and oxymoron. The results of the analysis allowed us to establish the unity of the genre of Chekhov's story as an allegory of fancy, an anecdote and a drama of self-deprecation.

TI  - Anxiety Buffer Disruption: Worldview Threat, Death Thought Accessibility, and Worldview Defense Among Low and High Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Samples
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA-THEORY RESEARCH PRACTICE AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Decades of research suggest that people are able to function effectively in the world and maintain mental health and well-being, at least in part, by relying on effective sociocultural anxiety buffer systems to shield against the awareness of death. However, according to anxiety buffer disruption theory, posttraumatic stress reflects anxiety buffer disruption, signaling that sociocultural belief systems have been rendered unable to buffer the individual against death awareness. As such, we would not expect to see the normal responses to death awareness meant to bolster and defend those belief systems in participants with posttraumatic stress. Method: To test these hypotheses, we screened for posttraumatic stress in U.S. participants (n = 4,150) and recruited individuals with low (n = 193) and high (n = 205) posttraumatic stress symptoms. Each group was randomly assigned to a worldview-threat or -support condition, followed by a standardized measure of death-thought accessibility (DTA) and worldview defense. Results: In the nonthreat (worldview-support) condition, individuals with high (vs. low) posttraumatic stress had elevated DTA. Further, among individuals with low posttraumatic stress, worldview threat (vs. -support) increased DTA. which in turn mediated an increase in worldview defense; however, among those with high posttraumatic stress, worldview threat did not increase DTA and its effect on worldview defense was substantially reduced. Conclusion: These findings supported the present hypotheses derived from anxiety buffer disruption theory, are important for understanding the existential dimension of posttraumatic stress, and may have implications for mental health.

TI  - Fractal Study of the 1997-2017 Italian Seismic Sequences: A Joint Analysis of Seismological Data and DInSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last 20 years (1997 to 2017), four seismic sequences with M-w >= 5.5 mainshocks nucleated along the Central and Northern Apennines chain (Italy), causing casualties and damage: the 1997 Colfiorito, the 2009 L'Aquila, the 2012 Emilia, and the most recent 2016-2017 Central Italy seismic sequences. In this work, we perform a novel joint analysis of seismological and remote-sensing data to achieve new insights into the faulting process evolution during the considered seismic sequences. To this aim, we study these seismic sequences by exploiting the available seismological data and by applying fractals theory to them. In particular, we characterize the different behavior of compressional and extensional seismic sequences by examining the temporal evolution of the fractal dimension values. In addition, we compare the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) displacement maps relevant to the considered seismic events (already published in our past papers) and the performed spatial and temporal seismological analyses, in order to emphasize some significant aspects of the different faulting processes active during these Italian seismic sequences. The analysis of the fractal dimension values shows that over time extensional seismic sequences are spatially distributed within a volume, whereas compressional ones are aligned along a preferential surface. These spatio-temporal patterns are confirmed by: (1) the spatial distribution of hypocenters for the events that occurred between the mainshock and the post-seismic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisition; (2) the spatial extension of coseismic DInSAR ground-deformation patterns. The proposed seismic and ground-deformation analyses can thus typify different geodynamic contexts in Italy, providing a distinct image of articulated faulting processes.

TI  - Monitoring Coastline Dynamics of Alakol Lake in Kazakhstan Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Alakol Lake is one of the largest hydrologically closed lake located in Balkash-Alakol River Basin in southeast Kazakhstan. Having a coastline approximately at 490 km, Alakol Lake has faced multiple threats due to both natural and anthropogenic factors as a result of tectonic movements, geology, wind-wave conditions, growing tourism activities, fishing, and transport, etc. The present study aims to investigate the historical trends in coastline changes along Alakol Lake in Kazakhstan and estimate its change rate by using remote sensing data in particular scale-space images Landsat-5 TM, 7 ETM+, 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2A. Based on Landsat and Sentinel data, the modified normalized difference water index was calculated to demonstrate the coastline changes along Alakol Lake between 1990 and 2018. Moreover, the monitoring and analysis of coastline dynamics is based on the main morphometric characteristics of Alakol Lake including water surface area, coastline length, geomorphology of the coast, etc. Our results reveal that there is a continuous coastline retreat, depending on the coast types. For example, in the case of the denudation coasts, a land inundation was from 120 to 270 m between 1990 and 2018. In the case of the accumulative coast (mainly northeast, north, and northwest coasts) a land inundation was from 200 to 900 m. A vast area of agricultural land around Alakol Lake become flooded and lost. This study demonstrates the importance of monitoring coastline dynamics because it provides essential information for understanding the coastal response to contemporary nature and anthropogenic impacts.

TI  - Mathematical Integration of Remotely-Sensed Information into a Crop Modelling Process for Mapping Crop Productivity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is a useful technique to determine spatial variations in crop growth while crop modelling can reproduce temporal changes in crop growth. In this study, we formulated a hybrid system of remote sensing and crop modelling based on a random-effect model and the empirical Bayesian approach for parameter estimation. Moreover, the relationship between the reflectance and the leaf area index was incorporated into the statistical model. Plant growth and ground-based canopy reflectance data of paddy rice were measured at three study sites in South Korea. Spatiotemporal vegetation indices were processed using remotely-sensed data from the RapidEye satellite and the Communication Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS). Solar insulation data were obtained from the Meteorological Imager (MI) sensor of the COMS. Reanalysis of air temperature data was collected from the Korea Local Analysis and Prediction System (KLAPS). We report on a statistical hybrid approach of crop modelling and remote sensing and a method to project spatiotemporal crop growth information. Our study results show that the crop growth values predicted using the hybrid scheme were in statistically acceptable agreement with the corresponding measurements. Simulated yields were not significantly different from the measured yields at p = 0.883 in calibration and p = 0.839 in validation, according to two-sample t tests. In a geospatial simulation of yield, no significant difference was found between the simulated and observed mean value at p = 0.392 based on a two-sample t test as well. The fabricated approach allows us to monitor crop growth information and estimate crop-modelling processes using remote sensing data from various platforms and optical sensors with different ground resolutions.

TI  - Terror management theory and the educational situation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CURRICULUM STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - How might we teach more successfully towards better relations between and among social groups? Recognizing factors that limit rapprochement with those with divergent worldviews has been a perennial concern for education research. However, more research is needed to understand how feelings of conflict arise, and thus this paper discusses terror management theory (TMT) as a generative theoretical framework for engaging with conflicting perspectives in classrooms and beyond. An awareness of existential processes that impact teaching and learning provides an opportunity to engage with divergent worldviews in a way that mitigates hostile responses. TMT can assist our understandings of the psychological process of worldview threat with the hope that we might better metacognitively anticipate our threat and defence cycles.

TI  - The Use of Geospatial Technology for Epidemiological Chagas Analysis in Bolivia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma Cruzi and transmitted by the Vinchuca. Bolivia is the country with the highest prevalence in the South American region; for example, in 2015, there was a prevalence of 33.4%. This disease causes severe intestinal and cardiac problems in the long term, 30% of the cases register cardiac symptoms, and 10% have alterations in the esophagus or colon. This research aims to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and Chagas outbreaks in an area of Bolivia to identify the environmental conditions in which the disease is transmitted, using epidemiological, meteorological data and also environmental indexes extracted from Landsat 8 satellite images. Through a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the environmental indexes extracted from the satellite images and the meteorological information, has been found that the environmental conditions that have a correlation with the occurrence of cases are: temperature, relative humidity, visibility, Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI) and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI).

TI  - The Impact of Acquisition Date on the Prediction Performance of Topsoil Organic Carbon from Sentinel-2 for Croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major environmental challenge, notably for evaluating soil carbon stocks. Recent works have shown the capability of Sentinel-2 optical data to predict SOC content over temperate agroecosystems characterized by annual crops, using a single acquisition date. Considering a Sentinel-2 time series, this work intends to analyze the impact of acquisition date, and related weather and soil surface conditions on the prediction performance of topsoil SOC content (plough layer). A Sentinel-2 time-series was gathered, comprised of the dates corresponding to both the maximum of bare soil coverage and minimum of cloud coverage. Cross-validated partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were constructed between soil reflectance image spectra, and SOC content analyzed from 329 top soil samples collected over the study area. Cross-validation R-2 ranged from 0.005 to 0.58, root mean square error from 5.86 to 3.02 g.kg(-1) and residual prediction deviation values from 1.0 to 1.5 (without unit), according to date. The main factors influencing these differences were soil roughness, in conjunction with soil moisture, and the cloud and cloud shadow cover of the entire tile. The best performing dates were spring dates characterized by both lowest soil surface roughness and moisture content. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values below 0.35 did not influence prediction performance. This consolidates the previous results obtained during single date acquisitions and offers wider perspectives for the further use of Sentinel-2 into multidate mosaics for digital soil mapping.

TI  - Earth observation and social media: Evaluating the spatiotemporal contribution of non-native trees to cultural ecosystem services
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how non-material benefits from ecosystems, known as cultural services, are shaped by non-native biota is paramount to manage biological invasions and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite recent advances, assessments of cultural services still lack an explicit temporal dimension, which is relevant for developing monitoring systems. Here, we evaluate the spatiotemporal contributions of non-native trees to landscape aesthetics and nature recreation in a National Park in Portugal. We use a multimodel framework to understand how those cultural services (evaluated from social media photos) relate to the environmental context (physical and visual accessibility, and wilderness; derived from ancillary GIS data) and landscape visual-sensory features (colour diversity, landscape heterogeneity, and vegetation functioning). The latter were computed from satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2 MSI sensors) for the four seasons of the year: Winter, Spring, Summer and Autumn. We found that, during Autumn, contributions of non-native trees prevailed mostly in landscapes with greater colour diversity (green-band, Sentinel 2). During Spring, their contributions prevailed in landscapes with lower wilderness and heterogeneous levels. In Winter, those contributions were less evident in more remote areas. As for Summer, no significant relations were found for those cultural contributions. These results are congruent with the phenology of dominant tree species: deciduous natives occurring with coniferous non-natives and evergreen invaders, leading to higher colour diversity in Autumn, versus the dominance of blooming invaders in accessible areas during Spring. Results also seem to match the seasonal dynamics of touristic demand in the National Park: the pursuit of wilder areas for ecotourism in Winter, versus the experience of popular recreational activities in Summer. We discuss the usefulness of Earth observations in the research of cultural services and, particularly, for supporting SDG targets 15.8 (on invasive species), 8.9 (touristic revenues) and 12.8 (nature awareness).

TI  - Using Saildrones to Validate Satellite-Derived Sea Surface Salinity and Sea Surface Temperature along the California/Baja Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional ways of validating satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface salinity (SSS) products by comparing with buoy measurements, do not allow for evaluating the impact of mesoscale-to-submesoscale variability. We present the validation of remotely sensed SST and SSS data against the unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-called Saildrone-measurements from the 60 day 2018 Baja California campaign. More specifically, biases and root mean square differences (RMSDs) were calculated between USV-derived SST and SSS values, and six satellite-derived SST (MUR, OSTIA, CMC, K10, REMSS, and DMI) and three SSS (JPLSMAP, RSS40, RSS70) products. Biases between the USV SST and OSTIA/CMC/DMI were approximately zero, while MUR showed a bias of 0.3 degrees C. The OSTIA showed the smallest RMSD of 0.39 degrees C, while DMI had the largest RMSD of 0.5 degrees C. An RMSD of 0.4 degrees C between Saildrone SST and the satellite-derived products could be explained by the diurnal and sub-daily variability in USV SST, which currently cannot be resolved by remote sensing measurements. SSS showed fresh biases of 0.1 PSU for JPLSMAP and 0.2 PSU and 0.3 PSU for RMSS40 and RSS70 respectively. SST and SSS showed peaks in coherence at 100 km, most likely associated with the variability of the California Current System.

TI  - Long-term morbidity after a negative sentinel node in breast cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Morbidity after sentinel lymph node biopsy is often underestimated. The aim of this study was to inventory arm and shoulder complaints in sentinel node-negative breast cancer patients post-surgery after long-term follow-up. Methods Sentinel node-negative breast cancer patients with at least 2 years of follow-up after surgery were included in this study. Self-reported arm and shoulder morbidities were assessed using a survey. Patients (n = 126) were asked if they ever developed complaints, if these complaints were still present and whether they were ever treated for these complaints. Results After a mean follow-up of 55.5 months (range 25-86 months), the prevalence of the self-reported arm and shoulder complaints was 25.8% for pain, 12.0% for numbness, 6.4% for paraesthesias, 7.1% for lymphedema, 8.0% for axillary web syndrome, 26.2% for loss of strength and 19.5% for limitations in range of motion. About 38.1% of the patients were treated by a physical therapist concerning the experienced complaints after SLNB. Conclusion Up to 7 years post-surgery a considerable amount of sentinel node-negative patients still suffer from arm and shoulder complaints. These complaints affect the activities of daily living. Therefore, more research is needed regarding the value of early detection and treatment of these complaints.

TI  - Diagnosis and epidemiology of <i>Leishmania infantum</i> in domestic cats in an endemic area of the Amazon region, Brazil
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania infantum for which dogs are the main reservoir. In South America, presence of this disease is expanding along with increasing dispersion of its principal vector, the sand-fly Lutzomyia longipalpis. Feline leishmaniasis is an emerging disease in domestic cats, but epidemiological studies in endemic areas of the Amazon region of Brazil are scarce and the role of cats as reservoirs of L. infantum has been debated. The aim of this study was to investigate L. infantum infection in cats living in the Amazon biome region, using serological and molecular methods. A total of 105 cats were subjected to clinical examination and blood samples were taken for immunofluorescent-antibody (1FAT) serological evaluation, to determine anti-Leishmania antibody titers. Conventional PCR and Sanger's sequencing targeting L. infantum chitinase and Leishmania species ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) encoding genes were performed on conjunctival swabs from these cats. Seropositivity was detected in 32 animals (30.48%), thus confirming that contact between these cats and the parasite was occurring. PCR followed by amplicon sequencing showed that three samples (2.86%) were positive for a chitinase gene and six (5.71%) were positive for the ITS-1 gene. Parasite-positive diagnoses presented a statistically significant association with free access to the streets (p = 0.0111), cohabitation with dogs affected previously by VL (p = 0.0006) and absence of backyard cleaning and garbage collection (p = 0.00003). These results emphasize that cats should be included in epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis, especially in endemic areas, if not as the reservoir host (unproven), at least as a "sentinel host" that is useful for revealing situations of endemic circulation of L. infantum. Moreover, in these areas, feline leishmaniasis needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis among domestic cats presenting alopecia, rarefied hair, lacerations and ulcerative dermatitis.

AB  - Introduction. Previous studies on music information behaviour have focused on describing all the different activities used when interacting with music. However, a general picture of this behaviour has yet to emerge. The purpose of this research is to model the information behaviour of music fans through the perspective of social practice theory.Method. Qualitative method was employed, using in-depth interviews and the observation of participants' homes and practices. Eighteen music fans with diverse socio-demographic characteristics living in Medellin, Colombia, participated in the research.Analysis. Qualitative deductive analysis was performed using a tree of categories extracted from a conceptual framework. Categories were assigned to the data, and then compared and contrasted.Results. Information activities that comprise practices are presented as existing within continuums from active behaviour to passive behaviour. Factors that affect and influence practices are presented in four groups: personal benefits, social benefits, extrinsic conditions and worldview. A model for music information practices that integrates all these elements is presented as the main result from this study.Conclusions. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion about music information behaviour, presenting a model that describes an information practice which has the potential to describe other types of information behaviour.

TI  - Automatic Methodology to Detect the Coastline from Landsat Images with a New Water Index Assessed on Three Different Spanish Mediterranean Deltas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the importance of coastline detection in coastal studies, different methods have been developed in recent decades in accordance with the evolution of measuring techniques such as remote sensing. This work proposes an automatic methodology with new water indexes to detect the coastline from different multispectral Landsat images; the methodology is applied to three Spanish deltas in the Mediterranean Sea. The new water indexes use surface reflectance rather than top-of-atmosphere reflectance from blue and shortwave infrared (SWIR 2) Landsat bands. A total of 621 sets of images were analyzed from three different Landsat sensors with a moderate spatial resolution of 30 m. Our proposal, which was compared to the most commonly used water indexes, showed outstanding performance in automatic detection of the coastline in 96% of the data analyzed, which also reached the minimum value of bias of 0.91 m and a standard deviation ranging from +/- 4.7 and +/- 7.29min some cases in contrast to the existing values. Bicubic interpolation was evaluated for a simple sub-pixel analysis to assess its capability in improving the accuracy of coastline extraction. Our methodology represents a step forward in automatic coastline detection that can be applied to micro-tidal coastal sites with different land covers using many multi-sensor satellite images.

TI  - Earnings Management, Capital Management and Signalling Behaviour of Indian Banks
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC FINANCIAL MARKETS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aims at analysing whether the earnings are managed in the banking industry in India considering the provisioning standards issued by the RBI. The study also examines the presence of capital management and signalling practices by Indian Banks through the usage of Provision for Non-Performing Assets (PNPA). The study comprises of 84 banks in India which includes nationalised banks, private banks and foreign banks focusing on financial data from FY 2005-2016. The study uses panel data regression model for exploring the presence of earnings management, capital management and signalling. The dependent variable considered is PNPA and the independent variables are lag of dependent variable, return on assets, capital adequacy ratio, and change in operating profit. We have also included certain control variables viz. credit deposit ratio, total assets, closing gross NPA, GDP, real interest rates. The results of our study indicates income smoothing practices by Indian Banks. However, the results do not prove the presence of capital management or signalling practices by Indian Banks through the usage of provision for NPA.

TI  - Robust Band-Dependent Spatial-Detail Approaches for Panchromatic Sharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the fusion of a multispectral (MS) image with a finer spectral resolution but coarser spatial resolution than a panchromatic (PAN) image. The classical pansharpening problem can be dealt with component substitution or multiresolution analysis techniques. One of the most notable approaches in the former class is the band-dependent spatial-detail (BDSD) method. It has been shown state-of-the-art performance, in particular, when the fusion of four band data sets is addressed. However, new sensors, such as the WorldView-2/-3 ones, usually acquire MS images with more than four spectral bands to be fused with the PAN image. The BDSD method has shown limitations in performance in these cases. Thus, in this paper, several BDSD-based approaches are provided to solve this issue getting a robustness of the BDSD with respect to the spectral bands to be fused. The experimental results conducted both at reduced and at full resolutions on four real data sets acquired by the IKONOS, the QuickBird, the WorldView-2, and the WorldView-3 sensors demonstrate the validity of the proposed approaches against the benchmark.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite Soil Moisture Products in Mongolia and Their Relation to Grassland Condition
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of soil moisture dynamics provides valuable information about grassland degradation, since soil moisture directly affects vegetation cover. While the Mongolian soil moisture monitoring network is limited to the urban and protected natural areas, remote sensing data can be used to determine the soil moisture status elsewhere. In this paper, we determine whether in situ and remotely sensed data in the unaccounted areas of Southwestern Mongolia are consistent with each other, by comparing Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) first passive L-band satellite data with in situ measurements. To evaluate the soil moisture products, we calculated the temporal, seasonal, and monthly average soil moisture content. We corrected the bias of SMOS soil moisture (SM) data using the in situ measured soil moisture with both the simple ratio and gamma methods. We verified the bias-corrected SMOS data with Nash-Sutcliffe method. The comparison results suggest that bias correction (of the simple ratio and gamma methods) enhances the reliability of the SMOS data, resulting in a higher correlation coefficient. We then examined the correlation between SMOS and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) index in the various ecosystems. Analysis of the SMOS and in situ measured soil moisture data revealed that spatial soil moisture distribution matches the rainfall events in Southwestern Mongolia for the period 2010 to 2015. The results illustrate that the bias-corrected, monthly-averaged SMOS data has a high correlation with the monthly-averaged NDVI (R-2 > 0.81). Both NDVI and rainfall can be used as indicators for grassland monitoring in Mongolia. During 2015, we detected decreasing soil moisture in approximately 30% of the forest-steppe and steppe areas. We assume that the current ecosystem of land is changing rapidly from forest to steppe and also from steppe to desert. The rainfall rate is the most critical factor influencing the soil moisture storage capacity in this region. The collected SMOS data reflects in situ conditions, making it an option for grassland studies.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the water and energy balances, and the number of remote sensing-based ET products and estimation methods has increased in recent years. Various aspects of remote sensing of ET are reported in 11 papers published in this special issue. The major research topics covered by this special issue include inter-comparison and performance evaluation of widely used one- and two-source energy balance models, a new dual-source model (Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration, SPARSE), and a process-based model (ETMonitor); assessment of multi-source (e.g., remote sensing, reanalysis, and land surface model) ET products; development or improvement of data fusion frameworks to provide continuous daily ET at a high spatial resolution (field-scale or 30 m) by fusing the advanced space-borne thermal emission reflectance radiometer (ASTER), the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Landsat data; and investigating uncertainties in ET estimates using an ET ensemble composed of 36 land surface models and four diagnostic datasets. The effects of the differences among ET products on water resources and ecosystem management were also investigated. More accurate ET estimates and improved understanding of remotely sensed ET products can help maximize crop productivity while minimizing water loses and management costs.

TI  - Ephemeral sand river flow detection using satellite optical remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral sand rivers are common throughout the world's dryland regions, often providing a water source where altematives are unavailable. Alluvial aquifer recharge results from rare surface water flows. Assessment of surface flow frequency using traditional methods (rain or flow gauges) requires a high-density monitoring network, which is rarely available. This study aimed to determine if satellite optical imagery could detect infrequent surface flows to estimate recharge frequency. Well-used sensors (Landsat and MOMS) have insufficiently high spatio-temporal resolution to detect often short-lived flows in narrow sand rivers characteristic of drylands. Therefore, Sentinel-2 offering 10 m spatial resolution was used for the Shingwidzi River, Limpopo, South Africa. Based on an increase of Normalised Difference Water Index relative to the dry season reference value, detection of surface flows proved feasible with overall accuracy of 91.2% calculated against flow gauge records. The methodology was subsequently tested in the ungauged Molototsi River where flows were monitored by local observers with overall accuracy of 100%. High spatial and temporal resolution allowed for successful detection of surface water, even when flow had receded substantially and when the rivers were partially obstructed by clouds. The presented methodology can supplement monitoring networks where sparse rainfall or flow records exist.

TI  - How Much Forest Persists Through Fire? High-Resolution Mapping of Tree Cover to Characterize the Abundance and Spatial Pattern of Fire Refugia Across Mosaics of Burn Severity
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in forest ecosystems produce landscape mosaics that include relatively unaffected areas, termed fire refugia. These patches of persistent forest cover can support fire-sensitive species and the biotic legacies important for post-fire forest recovery, yet little is known about their abundance and distribution within fire perimeters. Readily accessible 30-m resolution satellite imagery and derived burn severity products are commonly employed to characterize post-fire landscapes; however, coarse image resolution, generalized burn severity thresholds, and other limitations can constrain accurate representation of fire refugia. This study quantifies the abundance and pattern of fire refugia within 10 fires occurring in ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests between 2000 and 2003. We developed high-resolution maps of post-fire landscapes using semi-automated, object-based classification of 1-m aerial imagery, conducted imagery- and field-based accuracy assessments, and contrasted these with Landsat-derived burn severity metrics. Fire refugia area within burn perimeters ranged from 20% to 57%. Refugia proportion generally decreased with increasing Landsat-derived burn severity, but still accounted for 3-12% of areas classified as high severity. Patch size ranged from 1-m(2) isolated trees to nearly 8000 ha, and median patch size was 0.01 ha-substantially smaller than a 30-m Landsat pixel. Patch size was negatively related to burn severity; distance to fire refugia from open areas was positively related to burn severity. Finally, optimized thresholds of 30-m post-fire normalized burn ratio (NBR) and relative differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) delineated fire refugia with an accuracy of 77% when validated against the 1-m resolution maps. Estimations of fire refugia abundance based on Landsat-derived burn severity metrics are unlikely to detect small, isolated fire refugia patches. Finer-resolution maps can improve understanding of the distribution of forest legacies and inform post-fire management activities including reforestation and treatments.

TI  - Modelling the Arctic taiga-tundra ecotone using ALOS PALSAR and optical earth observation data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The taiga-tundra ecotone (TTE) extends over 13.400 km around the northern hemisphere and marks the transition zone between taiga and tundra. Since this area is vulnerable to climate change, human activities and natural disturbances such as wildfires, monitoring of this region is extremely important. Dealing with the characterization of this transition zone, very few studies are available on a global scale. Existing approaches lack the thorough characterization of the ecotone as they capture just a part of the complex transition zone.The objective of this research is to develop a monitoring concept for detecting the taiga-tundra interface for a designated study area in northern Siberia. We used optical and SAR remote sensing data products from 2007 to 2010, whereby the spatial resolution of all datasets were unified to 1 km. Earth Observation data and products from ALOS PALSAR, MODIS, AMSR-E were utilized in addition to digital elevation model data and the Percent Tree Cover product. Using random forest variable importance measure, most relevant statistics were selected and used for different model setups. The final random forest model setup included statistics of land surface temperature (LST), albedo, NDVI, EVI, Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), PALSAR HV-Polarization and LAI. Snow water equivalent (SWE) statistics had to be excluded for compensating artifacts.Since sharp distinctions between forest and tundra do not occur in nature, class probability values were computed. This allowed the unique allocation per class for each grid cell. The model setup showed high performance values, which were cross validated, with accuracies of 95.6% ( +/- 1.5%). The model result was validated using high resolution Google Earth imagery, where an overall map accuracy of 93% (Kappa 0.89) was achieved. The assessment of the input data products revealed that statistics of LST, SWE and albedo were most important.Compared to existing circumpolar products the advantage of this approach is the derivation of continuous probability values for the taiga-tundra transition zone instead of sharp borders between the biogeographic classes. The model provides the basis for a monitoring effort aiming at detecting changes over time. This would help to understand the dynamics of ecosystem changes with respect to influencing factors.

TI  - Mapping Height and Aboveground Biomass of Mangrove Forests on Hainan Island Using UAV-LiDAR Sampling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hainan Island is the second-largest island in China and has the most species-diverse mangrove forests in the country. To date, the height and aboveground ground biomass (AGB) of the mangrove forests on Hainan Island are unknown, partly as a result of the challenges faced during extensive field sampling in mangrove habitats (intertidal mudflats inundated by periodic seawater). Therefore, this study used a low-cost UAV-LiDAR (light detection and ranging sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle) system as a sampling tool and Sentinel-2 imagery as auxiliary data to estimate and map the mangrove height and AGB on Hainan Island. Hainan Island has 3697.02 hectares of mangrove forests with an average patch area of approximately 1 ha. The results show that the mangroves on whole Hainan Island have an average height of 6.99 m, a total AGB of 474,199.31 Mg and an AGB density of 128.27 Mg ha(-1). The AGB hot spots are located in Qinglan Harbor and the south of Dongzhai Harbor. The proposed height model LiDAR-S2 performed well with an R-2 of 0.67 and an RMSE (root mean square error) of 1.90 m; the proposed AGB model G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 performed better (an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 50.36 Mg ha(-1)) than the traditional AGB model G similar to S2 that directly related ground plots and Sentinel-2 data. The results also indicate that the LiDAR metrics describing the canopy's thickness and its top and bottom characteristics are the most important variables for mangrove AGB estimation. For the Sentinel-2 indices, the red-edge and shortwave infrared features, especially the red-edge 1 and shortwave infrared Band 11 features, play the most important roles in estimating mangrove AGB and height. In conclusion, this paper presents the first mangrove height and AGB maps of Hainan Island and demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV-LiDAR as a sampling tool for mangrove forests.

TI  - Analysis of Land Surface Deformation in Chagan Lake Region Using TCPInSAR
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to earthquakes and large-scale exploitation of oil, gas, groundwater, and coal energy, large-scope surface deformation has occurred in Songyuan City, Jilin Province, China, and it is posing a serious threat to sustainable development, including urban development, energy utilization, environmental protection, and construction to improve saline-alkali land. In this study, we selected the Chagan Lake region, which is located in Songyuan City, as our research area. Using temporarily coherent point synthetic aperture radar interferometry (TCPInSAR), we obtained a time series of land surface deformation and the deformation rate in this area from 20 ALOS PALSAR images from 2006 to 2010. The results showed that the deformation rate in the Chagan Lake region ranged from -46.7 mm/year to 41.7 mm/year during the monitoring period. In three typical land cover areas of the Chagan Lake region, the subsidence in the wetland area was larger than that in the saline-alkali area, while the highway experienced a small uplift. In addition, surface deformation in lakeside areas with or without dykes was different; however, as this was mainly affected by soil freeze-thaw cycles and changes in groundwater level, the deformation showed a negative correlation with temperature and precipitation. By monitoring and analyzing surface deformation, we can provide a data reference and scientific basis for sustainable ecological and economic development in the Chagan Lake region and adjacent areas.

TI  - A Split Window Algorithm for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature from FY-3D MERSI-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared (TIR) data from the Medium Resolution Spectral Imager II (MERSI-2) on the Chinese meteorological satellite FY-3D have high spatiotemporal resolution. Although the MERSI-2 land surface temperature (LST) products have good application prospects, there are some deviations in the TIR band radiance from MERSI-2. To accurately retrieve LSTs from MERSI-2, a method based on a cross-calibration model and split window (SW) algorithm is proposed. The method is divided into two parts: cross-calibration and LST retrieval. First, the MODTRAN program is used to simulate the radiation transfer process to obtain MERSI-2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) simulation data, establish a cross-calibration model, and then calculate the actual brightness temperature (BT) of the MERSI-2 image. Second, according to the characteristics of the near-infrared (NIR) bands, the atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is retrieved, and the atmospheric transmittance is calculated. The land surface emissivity is estimated by the NDVI-based threshold method, which ensures that both parameters (transmittance and emissivity) can be acquired simultaneously. The validation shows the following: 1) The average accuracy of our algorithm is 0.42 K when using simulation data; 2) the relative error of our algorithm is 1.37 K when compared with the MODIS LST product (MYD11A1); 3) when compared with ground-measured data, the accuracy of our algorithm is 1.23 K. Sensitivity analysis shows that the SW algorithm is not sensitive to the two main parameters (WVC and emissivity), which also proves that the estimation of LST from MERSI-2 data is feasible. In general, our algorithm exhibits good accuracy and applicability, but it still requires further improvement.

TI  - The Spatiotemporal Variability of Evapotranspiration and Its Response to Climate Change and Land Use/Land Cover Change in the Three Gorges Reservoir
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) has undergone profound changes as a result of global climate change and anthropogenic activities. The construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) has led to changes in its land use/land cover (LUCC) and local climate, which in turn has changed ET processes in the TGR region. In this paper, the CLM4.5 land surface model is used to simulate and analyze the spatiotemporal variability of ET between 1993 and 2013. Four experiments were conducted to quantify the contribution rate of climate change and LUCC to changes in ET processes. The results show that the climate showed a warming and drying trend from 1993 to 2013, and the LUCC indicates decreasing cropland with increasing forest, grassland, water bodies and urban areas. These changes increased the mean annual ET by 13.76 mm after impoundment. Spatially, the vegetation transpiration accounts for the largest proportion in ET. The decreasing relative humidity and increasing wind speeds led to an increase in vegetation transpiration and ground evaporation, respectively, in the center of the TGR region, while the LUCC drove changes in ET in water bodies, urban areas and high-altitude regions in the TGR region.

TI  - A new slope unit extraction method for regional landslide analysis based on morphological image analysis
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In landslide analysis it is necessary to first define and extract slope units from remotely sensed data. When this is done using hydrological process analysis, there can be complications caused by apparent sudden changes in slope gradient, resulting in the assumption of homogeneity of regional slope stability not being met. This issue is addressed in this paper with the proposal of a novel slope unit extraction method, which is derived from morphological image analysis (MIA) and results in the extraction of homogeneous slope units (HSU). It is thus referred to as the MIA-HSU method. In this method, slope units are defined as small, closed and homogeneous in 3D space. The MIA method uses logical algorithms, such as expansion and erosion, to extract slope units. Jiangjia Gully, Yunnan Province, China was selected to test the MIA-HSU method. Results indicate that slope units extracted by this method overcome defects of sudden changes in slope gradient and are able to identify geographical features meaningful for further landslide analysis. The MIA-HSU method presents a more uniform slope and aspect, and is better suited to regional landslide analysis than data obtained using the hydrological process analysis method.

TI  - Optimization of the Local Split-Window Algorithm for FY-4A Land Surface Temperature Retrieval
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4A is a second generation of geostationary orbiting meteorological satellite, and the successful launch of FY-4A satellite provides a new opportunity to obtain diurnal variation of land surface temperature (LST). In this paper, different underlying surfaces-observed data were applied to evaluate the applicability of the local split-window algorithm for FY-4A, and the local split-window algorithm parameters were optimized by the artificial intelligent particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to improve the accuracy of retrieved LST. Results show that the retrieved LST can efficiently reproduce the diurnal variation characteristics of LST. However, the estimated values deviate hugely from the observed values when the local split-window algorithms are directly used to process the FY-4A satellite data, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are approximately 6K. The accuracy of the retrieved LST cannot be effectively improved by merely modifying the emissivity-estimated model or optimizing the algorithm. Based on the measured emissivity, the RMSE of LST retrieved by the optimized local split-window algorithm is reduced to 3.45 K. The local split-window algorithm is a simple and easy retrieval approach that can quickly retrieve LST on a regional scale and promote the application of FY-4A satellite data in related fields.

TI  - Hydrological Condition Constrains Vegetation Dynamics for Wintering Waterfowl in China's East Dongting Lake Wetland
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As an internationally important wintering region for waterfowls on the East Asian-Australasian Flyway, the national reserve of China's East Dongting Lake wetland is abundant in animal and plant resources during winter. The hydrological regimes, as well as vegetation dynamics, in the wetland have experienced substantial changes due to global climate change and anthropogenic disturbances, such as the construction of hydroelectric dams. However, few studies have investigated how the wetland vegetation has changed over time, particularly during the wintering season, and how this has directly affected habitat suitability for migratory waterfowl. Thus, it is necessary to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation in the protected wetland and explore the potential factors that alter it. In this study, the data set of time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2000 to 2018 was used to analyze the seasonal dynamics and interannual trends of vegetation over the wintering period from October to January. The results showed that the average NDVI exhibited an overall increasing trend, with the trend rising slowly in recent years. The largest monthly mean NDVI generally occurred in November, which is pertinent to the quantity of wintering waterfowl in the East Dongting Lake wetland. Meanwhile, the mean NDVI in the wintering season is significantly correlated to temperature and water area, with apparent lagging effects. Long-term stability analysis presented a gradually decreasing pattern from the central body of water to the surrounding area. All analyses will help the government to make appropriate management strategies to protect the habitat of wintering waterfowl in the wetland.

TI  - Urban greenery and mental wellbeing in adults: Cross-sectional mediation analyses on multiple pathways across different greenery measures
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to explain how greenery in the vicinity of peoples homes enhances their mental health and wellbeing. Mediation studies, however, focus on a limited number of mechanisms and rely on remotely sensed greenery measures, which do not accurately capture how neighborhood greenery is perceived on the ground.Objective: To examine: 1) how streetscape and remote sensing-based greenery affect peoples mental wellbeing; 2) whether and, if so, to what extent the associations are mediated by physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; and 3) whether differences in the mediation across the streetscape greenery and NDVI exposure metrics occurred.Methods: We used a population sample of 1029 adult residents of the metropolis of Guangzhou, China, from 2016. Mental wellbeing was quantified by the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Two objective greenery measures were extracted at the neighborhood level: 1) streetscape greenery from street view data via a convolutional neural network, and 2) the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 remote sensing images. Single and multiple mediation analyses with multilevel regressions were conducted. Results: Streetscape and NDVI greenery were weakly and positively, but not significantly, correlated. Our regression results revealed that streetscape greenery and NDVI were, individually and jointly, positively associated with mental wellbeing. Significant partial mediators for the streetscape greenery were physical activity, stress, air quality and noise, and social cohesion; together, they explained 62% of the association. For NDVI, only physical activity and social cohesion were significant partial mediators, accounting for 22% of the association.Conclusions: Mental health and wellbeing and both streetscape and satellite-derived greenery seem to be both directly correlated and indirectly mediated. Our findings signify that both greenery measures capture different aspects of natural environments and may contribute to peoples wellbeing by means of different mechanisms.

TI  - A NSST Pansharpening method based on directional neighborhood correlation and tree structure matching
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we propose a multispectral (MS) remote sensing image pansharpening method based on non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST). By analyzing the NSST high-frequency coefficients correlation of several datasets which are fromWorldView-2 (WV2) and Quick-Bird (QB), we verified that the high-frequency coefficients based on NSST have strong directional neighborhood correlation within the same sub-band and parent-children correlation between sub-bands in the same direction. In order to combine these two kinds of correlations, we design a type of weighted directional neighborhood templates which can be used for any number of direction sub-bands to depict the direction correlation, and use the tree structure to model the correlation between parent-children coefficients. Experiments show that the proposed method in this paper can provide a fused MS image with high spatial resolution, which can provide convenience for subsequent applications such as classification and target recognition.

M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the relationship between spatial-temporal distribution of light falling-net fishing ground and marine environments in Beibu Gulf, based on standardized catch per unit effort (CPUE) of fishery resources through generalized linear model (GLM) and multiple linear regression. The data used include light falling-net survey data and satellite remote sensing data, namely, sea surface wind (SSW), sea surface temperature (SST), Chlorophyll a concentration (Chl a). Results show the optimum SST and Chl a of light falling-net fishing ground in Beibu Gulf were 27-29 degrees C and 0.5-1.5 mg-m(3), respectively. Higher stock density appears in the first and middle 10 days of October, and distributed in the area of 18 degrees-19 degrees N and 20 degrees-21 degrees N. The spatial-temporal distribution of light falling-net fishing ground in Beibu Gulf is linked with monsoon, warm pool in 19 degrees N, Chl a, and so on.

TI  - Source Characteristics of the 28 September 2018 Mw 7.4 Palu, Indonesia, Earthquake Derived from the Advanced Land Observation Satellite 2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 28 September 2018, an Mw 7.4 earthquake, followed by a tsunami, struck central Sulawesi, Indonesia. It resulted in serious damage to central Sulawesi, especially in the Palu area. Two descending paths of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data were processed with interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and pixel tracking techniques to image the coseismic deformation produced by the earthquake. The deformation measurement was used to determine the fault geometry and the coseismic distributed slip model with a constrained least square algorithm based on the homogeneous elastic half-space model. We divided the fault into four segments (named AS, BS, CS and DS, from the north to the south) in the inversion. The BS segment was almost parallel to the DS segment, the CS segment linked the BS and DS segments, and these three fault segments formed a fault step-over system. The Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change on the causative fault was also calculated. Results show that the maximum SAR line-of-sight (LOS) and horizontal deformation were -1.8 m and 3.6 m, respectively. The earthquake ruptured a 210-km-long fault with variable strike angles. The ruptured pattern of the causative fault is mainly a sinistral slip. Almost-pure normal characteristics could be identified along the fault segment across the Palu bay, which could be one of the factors resulting in the tsunami. The main slip area was concentrated at the depths of 0-20 km, and the maximum slip was 3.9 m. The estimated geodetic moment of the earthquake was 1.4 x 10(20) Nm, equivalent to an earthquake of Mw 7.4. The CFS results demonstrate that the fault step-over of 5.3 km did not terminate the rupture propagation of the main shock to the south. Two M>6 earthquakes (the 23 January 2005 and the 18 August 2012) decreased CFS along CS segment and the middle part of DS segment of the 2018 main shock. This implies that the stress release during the previous two earthquakes may have played a vital role in controlling the coseismic slip pattern of the 2018 earthquake.

TI  - Three senses of paradigm in scenario methodology: A preliminary framework and systematic approach for using intuitive logics scenarios to change mental models and improve strategic decision-making in situations of discontinuity
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article outlines the objectives, activities, and achievements of using intuitive logics scenarios to improve strategic decision-making in situations of discontinuity. Pierre Wack's work at Royal Dutch/Shell illustrates the use of exploratory, reframing, and decision scenarios to change the mental models of decision-makers in advance of the 1973 oil crisis. Thomas S. Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions offers a promising theoretical account of paradigm shifts in science, but its application is limited by the ambiguity of the concept of paradigm. Margaret Masterman's distinction of three senses of paradigm - introduced as construct paradigm, worldview paradigm, and action paradigm - clarifies and extends these accounts to support a preliminary framework and systematic approach. Overall, this investigation expands our understanding of strategic decision-making as guided not only by analytic achievements and developmental investigations but also by discontinuous breaks that can be explored and addressed using scenario methodology.Section 1 provides an introduction and literature review. Section 2 examines the scenarios developed at Royal Dutch/Shell. Section 3 summarizes Kuhn's new image of science, clarified by Masterman's three senses of paradigm in Section 4. Section 5 presents implications for scenario methodology, followed by conclusions and areas for research in Section 6.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission represents the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) next investment in satellite ocean color and the study of Earth's ocean-atmosphere system, enabling new insights into oceanographic and atmospheric responses to Earth's changing climate. PACE objectives include extending systematic cloud, aerosol, and ocean biological and biogeochemical data records, making essential ocean color measurements to further understand marine carbon cycles, food-web processes, and ecosystem responses to a changing climate, and improving knowledge of how aerosols influence ocean ecosystems and, conversely, how ocean ecosystems and photochemical processes affect the atmosphere. PACE objectives also encompass management of fisheries, large freshwater bodies, and air and water quality and reducing uncertainties in climate and radiative forcing models of the Earth system. PACE observations will provide information on radiative properties of land surfaces and characterization of the vegetation and soils that dominate their reflectance. The primary PACE instrument is a spectrometer that spans the ultraviolet to shortwave-infrared wavelengths, with a ground sample distance of 1 km at nadir. This payload is complemented by two multiangle polarimeters with spectral ranges that span the visible to near-infrared region. Scheduled for launch in late 2022 to early 2023, the PACE observatory will enable significant advances in the study of Earth's biogeochemistry, carbon cycle, clouds, hydrosols, and aerosols in the ocean-atmosphere-land system. Here, we present an overview of the PACE mission, including its developmental history, science objectives, instrument payload, observatory characteristics, and data products.

TI  - Influence of high-resolution data on the assessment of forest fragmentation
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Remote sensing has been a foundation of landscape ecology. The spatial resolution (pixel size) of remotely sensed land cover products has improved since the introduction of landscape ecology in the United States. Because patterns depend on spatial resolution, emerging improvements in the spatial resolution of land cover may lead to new insights about the scaling of landscape patterns.Objective We compared forest fragmentation measures derived from very high resolution (1 m(2)) data with the same measures derived from the commonly used (30 mx-30 m; 900 m(2)) Landsat-based data.Methods We applied area-density scaling to binary (forest; non-forest) maps for both sources to derive source-specific estimates of dominant (density >= 60%), interior (>= 90%), and intact (100%) forest.Results Switching from low- to high-resolution data produced statistical and geographic shifts in forest spatial patterns. Forest and non-forest features that were "invisible" at low resolution but identifiable at high resolution resulted in higher estimates of dominant and interior forest but lower estimates of intact forest from the high-resolution source. Overall, the high-resolution data detected more forest that was more contagiously distributed even at larger spatial scales.Conclusion We anticipate that improvements in the spatial resolution of remotely sensed land cover products will advance landscape ecology through re-interpretations of patterns and scaling, by fostering new landscape pattern measurements, and by testing new spatial pattern-ecological process hypotheses.

TI  - Multi-sensor cloud and cloud shadow segmentation with a convolutional neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation is a crucial pre-processing step for any application that uses multi spectral satellite images. In particular, disaster related applications (e.g., flood monitoring or rapid damage mapping), which are highly time- and data-critical, require methods that produce accurate cloud and cloud shadow masks in short time while being able to adapt to large variations in the target domain (induced by atmospheric conditions, different sensors, scene properties, etc.). In this study, we propose a data-driven approach to semantic segmentation of cloud and cloud shadow in single date images based on a modified U-Net convolutional neural network that aims to fulfil these requirements. We train the network on a global database of Landsat OLI images for the segmentation of five classes ("shadow", "cloud", "water", "land" and "snow/ice"). We compare the results to state-of-the-art methods, proof the model's generalization ability across multiple satellite sensors (Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+, Landsat OLI and Sentinel-2) and show the influence of different training strategies and spectral band combinations on the performance of the segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms Fmask and a traditional Random Forest classifier on a globally distributed multi-sensor test dataset in terms of accuracy, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, Dice coefficient and inference speed. The results indicate that a reduced feature space composed solely of red, green, blue and near-infrared bands already produces good results for all tested sensors. If available, adding shortwave-infrared bands can increase the accuracy. Contrast and brightness augmentations of the training data further improve the segmentation performance. The best performing U-Net model achieves an accuracy of 0.89, Kappa of 0.82 and Dice coefficient of 0.85, while running the inference over 896 test image tiles with 44.8 s/megapixel (2.8 s/megapixel on GPU). The Random Forest classifier reaches an accuracy of 0.79, Kappa of 0.65 and Dice coefficient of 0.74 with 3.9 s/megapixel inference time (on CPU) on the same training and testing data. The rule-based Fmask method takes significantly longer (277.8 s/megapixel) and produces results with an accuracy of 0.75, Kappa of 0.60 and Dice coefficient of 0.72.

TI  - Fluorescence in fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae): using sentinel prey to investigate a possible aposematic signal
T2  - FLORIDA ENTOMOLOGIST
M3  - Article
AB  - While fireflies are most renowned for their bioluminescent signals, several species also have been shown to possess UV and blue-induced fluorescence. In a field study, we used a sentinel prey approach to investigate whether this trait might serve as an aposematic function in chemically defended fireflies. We also examined and provide the first detailed description of green and red patterns of blue light-induced fluorescence in the adults and larvae of Ellychnia corrusca (L.) (Coleoptera: Lampyridae). We placed artificial prey models with and without fluorescent markings in a forested area of Belmont, Massachusetts, USA, where they were exposed to natural predators. Clay models were styled to resemble Photinus fireflies, the most common firefly genus in this area, and a close relative of Ellychnia. The field study was conducted from Oct through May in Belmont, Massachusetts; this is the period when adults of the diurnal non-luminescent firefly E. corrusca are overwintering on trees. We observed considerable seasonal variation in attack rates, and marks on the clay models indicated they were attacked by avian, mammal, and arthropod predators. However, no difference was seen between fluorescent and non-fluorescent models in predator attack rates. This suggests that fireflies' fluorescent markings do not serve as an aposematic signal, at least for the predator guild active in New England woodlands.

TI  - Identifying eruptive sources of drifting volcanic ash clouds using back-trajectory modeling of spaceborne thermal infrared data
T2  - BULLETIN OF VOLCANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach is presented for determining the source region of disconnected volcanic ash clouds using a combination of orbital thermal infrared (TIR) image data, HYSPLIT-generated backward trajectories, and spatial geostatistics. Interpolated surfaces derived from the TIR data are created to find the most likely ash cloud travel path and the potential source volcanoes identified from that path. The ability to use backward trajectories to determine the ash cloud source region will become an important triggering tool to target high spatial resolution orbital sensors, which normally rely on thermal anomalies for new targeting. During cases where thermal anomalies are not present or masked by meteorological cloud, ash cloud detection and predicted source location become more important. Image data from several well-documented past eruptions are presented to validate and determine the overall accuracy of this technique. Because this is seen as a limited range source region validation tool, the ash clouds examined were < 1000 km from their source vent. The approach and analysis are deemed successful if 80% of the model results produce one or more trajectories that pass within 60 km of the source volcano. This methodology could be improved further with the ability to determine the cloud location more accurately using higher image data frequency, and most importantly, greater accuracy in determining the cloud height in the atmosphere.

TI  - Using Remote Sensing Based Metrics to Quantify the Hydrological Response in a City
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a remote-sensing based metric approach to evaluate the hydrological response of highly urbanized areas and apply it to the city of Brussels. The model is set-up using 2 m resolution hyperspectral data. Next, it is upscaled to the city level, using multi-spectral Sentinel-2 data with 20 m resolution. We identify the total impervious area, the vegetation cover and the leaf area index as important metrics to derive a timeseries of spatially distributed net rainfall, runoff and infiltration from rainfall data. For the estimation of the actual evapotranspiration we use the potential evapotranspiration and the available water storage based on the interception, the depression storage and the infiltration. Additionally, we route the runoff to the outlet of selected sub-catchments. An important metric for the routing is the timing to the outlet which is approximated using the total impervious area and the hydrological distance to the outlet. We compare our approach to WetSpa model simulations and reach R-2 values of 98% for net rainfall, 95% for surface runoff, 99% for infiltration and 97% for cumulative evapotranspiration. The routing in the Watermaelbeek catchment is evaluated with discharge observations and reaches NSE values of 0.89 at a 2 m resolution and 0.88 at a 20 m resolution using an hourly timestep. At the timestep of 10 min and a 20 m resolution the NSE is reduced to 0.76. For the Roodebeek catchment we reach an NSE of 0.73 at a spatial resolution of 20 m and an hourly timestep. The results presented in this paper are optimistic for using spatial and temporal metrics retrieved from remote sensing data to quantify the water balance of urban catchments.

TI  - TRUTH AS FINAL CAUSE: ESCHATOLOGY AND HOPE IN LACAN AND PRZYWARA
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Truth is a locus of guilt for the Christian, according to Jacques Lacan. The religious person, he argues, punitively defers truth eschatologically. Yet Lacan's own view dissolves eschatological deferral to the world, as the "Real' The metaphysics of Erich Przywara SJ helps highlight that this mirrors Lacan's view of the religious person. Przywara's Christian metaphysics and Lacanian psychoanalysis converge on the immanence of truth to history. But Przywaran analogy corrects Lacan's position on the religious person, which by implication calls for an adjustment to Lacan's worldview. In the final analysis, Lacan's dialectical nihilism should yield to a Christian's hopeful relation to the truth.

TI  - Accuracy of genomic-polygenic estimated breeding value for milk yield and fat yield in the Thai multibreed dairy population with five single nucleotide polymorphism sets
T2  - ASIAN-AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The objectives were to compare variance components, genetic parameters, prediction accuracies, and genomic-polygenic estimated breeding value (EBV) rankings for milk yield (MY) and fat yield (FY) in the Thai multibreed dairy population using five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sets from GeneSeek GGP80K chip.Methods: The dataset contained monthly MY and FY of 8,361 first-lactation cows from 810 farms. Variance components, genetic parameters, and EBV for five SNP sets from the GeneSeek GGP80K chip were obtained using a 2-trait single-step average-information restricted maximum likelihood procedure. The SNP sets were the complete SNP set (all available SNP; SNP100), top 75% set (SNP75), top 50% set (SNP50), top 25% set (SNP25), and top 5% set (SNP5). The 2-trait models included herd-year-season, heterozygosity and age at first calving as fixed effects, and animal additive genetic and residual as random effects.Results: The estimates of additive genetic variances for MY and FY from SNP subsets were mostly higher than those of the complete set. The SNP25 MY and FY heritability estimates (0.276 and 0.183) were higher than those from SNP75 (0.265 and 0.168), SNP50 (0.275 and 0.179), SNP5 (0.231 and 0.169), and SNP100 (0.251and 0.159). The SNP25 EBV accuracies for MY and FY (39.76% and 33.82%) were higher than for SNP75 (35.01% and 32.60%), SNP50 (39.64% and 33.38%), SNP5 (38.61% and 29.70%), and SNP100 (34.43% and 31.61%). All rank correlations between SNP100 and SNP subsets were above 0.98 for both traits, except for SNP100 and SNP5 (0.93 for MY; 0.92 for FY).Conclusion: The high SNP25 estimates of genetic variances, heritabilities, EBV accuracies, and rank correlations between SNP100 and SNP25 for MY and FY indicated that genotyping animals with SNP25 dedicated chip would be a suitable to maintain genotyping costs low while speeding up genetic progress for MY and FY in the Thai dairy population.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Drought Variability Using CWSI in the Koshi River Basin (KRB)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is one of the most frequent meteorological disasters, and has exerted significant impacts on the livelihoods and economy of the Koshi River Basin (KRB). In this study, we assessed drought patterns using the Crop Water Shortage Index (CWSI) based on the MOD16 product for the period between 2000 and 2014. The results revealed that the CWSI based on the MOD16 product can be act as an indicator to monitor the characteristics of the drought. Significant spatial heterogeneity of drought was observed in the basin, with higher CWSI values downstream and upstream than in the midstream. The midstream of the KRB was dominated by light drought, moderate drought occurred in the upstream, and the downstream was characterized by severe drought. The monthly CWSI during one year in KRB showed the higher CWSI between March to May (pre-monsoon) and October to December (post-monsoon) rather than June to September (monsoon), and the highest was observed in the month of April, suggesting that precipitation plays the most important role in the mitigation of CWSI. Additionally, the downstream and midstream showed a higher variation of drought compared to the upstream in the basin. This research indicates that the downstream suffered severe drought due to seasonal water shortages, especially during the pre-monsoon, and water-related infrastructure should be implemented to mitigate losses caused by drought.

TI  - Detection and 3D Visualization of Deformations for High-Rise Buildings in Shenzhen, China from High-Resolution TerraSAR-X Datasets
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Shenzhen, a coastal city, has changed from a small village to a supercity since the late 1980s. With the rapid development of its population and economy, ground disasters also occur frequently. These disasters bring great harm to human life and surface architecture. However, there is a lack of regular ground measurement data in this area. Permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) technology can detect millimeter deformation of urban surface. In this paper, the building height and deformation from 2008 to 2010 in the Futian District of Shenzhen are obtained by using this technique alongside high-resolution TerraSAR-X data. For a visual expression of the result, we export the permanent scatterer (PS) points on buildings to Google Earth for 3D visualization after ortho-rectification of the PS height. Based on the Google Earth 3D model, the temporal and spatial characteristics of the building deformation became obvious. The InSAR measurements show that during the study period, the deformation rates of the Futian area are between -10 and 10 mm/year, and deformation is mainly distributed in a few buildings. These unstable activities can be attributed to human activities and the natural climate, which provides a reference for the local government to carry out a survey of surface deformation, as well as the monitoring and management of urban buildings, in the future.

TI  - Mapping Tree Species Composition Using OHS-1 Hyperspectral Data and Deep Learning Algorithms in Changbai Mountains, Northeast China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate characterization of tree species distribution in forest areas can help significantly reduce uncertainties in the estimation of ecosystem parameters and forest resources. Deep learning algorithms have become a hot topic in recent years, but they have so far not been applied to tree species classification. In this study, one-dimensional convolutional neural network (Conv1D), a popular deep learning algorithm, was proposed to automatically identify tree species using OHS-1 hyperspectral images. Additionally, the random forest (RF) classifier was applied to compare to the algorithm of deep learning. Based on our experiments, we drew three main conclusions: First, the OHS-1 hyperspectral images used in this study have high spatial resolution (10 m), which reduces the influence of mixed pixel effect and greatly improves the classification accuracy. Second, limited by the amount of sample data, Conv1D-based classifier does not need too many layers to achieve high classification accuracy. In addition, the size of the convolution kernel has a great influence on the classification accuracy. Finally, the accuracy of Conv1D (85.04%) is higher than that of RF model (80.61%). Especially for broadleaf species with similar spectral characteristics, such as Manchurian walnut and aspen, the accuracy of Conv1D-based classifier is significantly higher than RF classifier (87.15% and 71.77%, respectively). Thus, the Conv1D-based deep learning framework combined with hyperspectral imagery can efficiently improve the accuracy of tree species classification and has great application prospects in the future.

TI  - Current state of the global operational aerosol multi-model ensemble: An update from the International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP)
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the first International Cooperative for Aerosol Prediction (ICAP) multi-model ensemble (MME) study, the number of ICAP global operational aerosol models has increased from five to nine. An update of the current ICAP status is provided, along with an evaluation of the performance of ICAP-MME over 2012-2017, with a focus on June 2016-May 2017. Evaluated with ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and data assimilation quality MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) retrieval products, the ICAP-MME AOD consensus remains the overall top-scoring and most consistent performer among all models in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE), bias and correlation for total, fine- and coarse-mode AODs as well as dust AOD; this is similar to the first ICAP-MME study. Further, over the years, the performance of ICAP-MME is relatively stable and reliable compared to more variability in the individual models. The extent to which the AOD forecast error of ICAP-MME can be predicted is also examined. Leading predictors are found to be the consensus mean and spread. Regression models of absolute forecast errors were built for AOD forecasts of different lengths for potential applications. ICAP-MME performance in terms of modal AOD RMSEs of the 21 regionally representative sites over 2012-2017 suggests a general tendency for model improvements in fine-mode AOD, especially over Asia. No significant improvement in coarse-mode AOD is found overall for this time period.

TI  - How Did Deciduous Rubber Plantations Expand Spatially in China's Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture During 1991-2016?
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber plantations have experienced continuous expansion in Xishuangbanna, in southwestern China, since the 1950s. However, the question of how the establishment of adventive rubber trees has spatially expanded in the margin of the Asian tropics in recent decades is not clearly understood. Here, a robust phenology-based algorithm-namely the change rate of the Landsat-derived normalized burn ratio-was modified based on tri-windows (i.e., predefoliation, defoliation, and foliation) and then used to discriminate deciduous rubber plantations from other land cover types by applying a threshold of 1.0 and combining Landsat-based forest masks every five years during 1991-2016. Deciduous rubber plantations increased more than 6.6 times, approximately 3074 km(2) in 2016, or at an annual rate of about 8% (104 km(2)/year) in Xishuangbanna over that period, showing two typical expansion trends toward both higher (over 1000 m) and lower (below 600 m) elevations and increasingly spread to borderlands with Laos and Myanmar.

TI  - Defining conservation priority areas of snow leopard habitat in the Sanjiangyuan Region
T2  - Biodiversity Science
M3  - Article
AB  - To maximize species conservation outcomes and effectively allocate limited resources, the first step in conservation planning is to define conservation priority areas and migration pathways between them. Based on field survey and high-resolution satellite data, we used species distribution models, conservation planning tools and connectivity analysis tools to define the core habitat area and potential corridors for snow leopards (Panthera uncia) in the Sanjiangyuan Region. With potential threats identified, we proposed differentiated conservation strategies for different parts of the Sanjiangyuan Region: (1) In the western region, snow leopard core habitats are mostly small and fragmented but with widespread migration pathways and no obvious bottlenecks. However, the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is a potential barrier for snow leopard populations in the western region and needs further investigation. (2) The central region contains the largest core habitat which also has highest centrality in the connectivity analysis. To maintain the function of these source populations, we recommend long-term monitoring, anti-poaching patrol and supervision on development projects for this region. (3) For the eastern region, which has the highest human density, it is important to safeguard two core habitats (Anemaqen and Nanpo Yutze) and maintain the narrow corridors in between them. The provincial highway in Gande County may be a potential barrier for snow leopard migration and deserves further monitoring. As the epicenter for snow leopard conservation in China, the habitat quality in the Sanjiangyuan Region remains good overall. The goal of snow leopard landscape conservation in Sanjiangyuan should be to maintain core source populations while keeping migration routes unblocked. Integrated space-ground monitoring approaches should be implemented in the future for assessments and early warning signs of habitat degradation for these important protected species, especially in non-protected areas in core habitat at risk for development.

TI  - Mapping irrigated cropland extent across the conterminous United States at 30 m resolution using a semi-automatic training approach on Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information on the distribution of irrigated croplands is crucial to research on agriculture, water availability, land use, and climate change. While agricultural land use has been well characterized, less attention has been paid specifically to croplands that are irrigated, in part due to the difficulty in mapping and distinguishing irrigation in satellite imagery. In this study, we developed a semi-automatic training approach to rapidly map irrigated croplands across the conterminous United States (CONUS) at 30 m resolution using Google Earth Engine. To resolve the issue of lacking nationwide training data, we generated two intermediate irrigation maps by segmenting Landsat-derived annual maximum greenness and enhanced vegetation index using county level thresholds calibrated from an existing coarse resolution irrigation map. The resulting intermediate maps were then spatially filtered to provide a training data pool for most areas except for the upper midwestern states where we visually collected samples. We then used random samples extracted from the training pool along with remote sensing-derived features and climate variables to train ecoregion-stratified random forest classifiers for pixel-level classification. For ecoregions with a large training pool, the procedure of sample extraction, classifier training, and classification was conducted 10 times to obtain stable classification results. The resulting 2012 Landsat-based irrigation dataset (LANID) identified 23.3 million hectares of irrigated croplands in CONUS. A quantitative assessment of LANID showed superior accuracy to currently available maps, with a mean Kappa value of 0.88 (0.75-0.99), overall accuracy of 94% (87.5-99%), and producer's and user's accuracy of the irrigation class of 97.3% and 90.5%, respectively, at the aquifer level. Evaluation of feature importance indicated that Landsat-derived features played the primary role in classification in relatively arid regions while climate variables were important in the more humid eastern states. This methodology has the potential to produce annual irrigation maps for CONUS and provide insights into the field-level spatial and temporal aspects of irrigation.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Lake Total Phosphorus Concentration Based on MODIS: A Case Study of Lake Hongze
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an important substance for the growth of phytoplankton and an efficient index to assess the water quality. However, estimation of the TP concentration in waters by remote sensing must be associated with optical substances such as the chlorophyll-a (Chla) and the suspended particulate matter (SPM). Based on the good correlation between the suspended inorganic matter (SPIM) and P in Lake Hongze, we used the direct and indirect derivation methods to develop algorithms for the total phosphorus (TP) estimation with the MODIS/Aqua data. Results demonstrate that the direct derivation algorithm based on 645 nm and 1240 nm of the MODIS/Aqua performs a satisfied accuracy (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 0.029mg/L, MRE = 39% for the training dataset, R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 0.033mg/L, MRE = 47% for the validate dataset), which is better than that of the indirect derivation algorithm. The 645 nm and 1240 nm of MODIS are the main characteristic band of the SPM, so that algorithm can effectively reflect the P variations in Lake Hongze. Additionally, the ratio of the TP to the SPM is positively correlated with the accuracy of the algorithm as well. The proportion of the SPIM in the SPM has a complex effect on the accuracy of the algorithm. When the SPIM accounts for 78%, the algorithm achieves the highest accuracy. Furthermore, the performance of this direct derivation algorithm was examined in two inland lakes in China (Lake Nanyi and Lake Chaohu), it derived the expected P distribution in Lake Nanyi whereas the algorithm failed in Lake Chaohu. Different water properties influence significantly the accuracy of this direct derivation algorithm, while the TP, Chla, and suspended particular inorganic matter (SPOM) of Lake Chaohu are much higher than those of the other two lakes, thus it is difficult to estimate the TP concentration by a simple band combination in Lake Chaohu. Although the algorithm depends on the dataset used in the development, it usually presents a good estimation for those waters where the SPIM dominated, especially when the SPIM accounts for 60% to 80% of the SPM. This research proposed a direct derivation algorithm for the TP estimation for the turbid lake and will provide a theoretical and practical reference for extending the optical remote sensing application and the TP empirical algorithm of Lake Hongze's help for the local government management water quality.

TI  - MODIS Reflective Solar Bands On-Orbit Calibration and Performance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The design of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument was driven by the scientific community's desire to have near-daily global coverage at moderate resolution (similar to 1 km) with comprehensive spectral coverage from visible to long-wave infrared wavelengths. Since their launches in 1999 and 2002, respectively, the Terra and Aqua MODIS instruments have made continuous global observations and generated numerous data products to help users worldwide with their studies of the Earth's system and its short- and long-term changes. The 20 reflective solar bands (RSBs) with wavelengths from 0.41 to 2.2 mu m collect data at three nadir spatial resolutions: 250 m, 500 m, and 1 km. The solar diffuser (SD) coupled with the SD stability monitor (SDSM) provides a reflectance-based calibration on-orbit. In addition, lunar observations and response trends from pseudoinvariant desert sites are used to characterize the response versus scan-angle changes on-orbit. This paper provides a brief overview of MODIS RSB calibration algorithms, as implemented in the latest Level 1B version 6.1, operational activities, on-orbit performance, remaining challenges, and potential improvements. Results from the SD and SDSM measurements show a wavelength and mirror-side-dependent degradation in RSB responses, with the largest degradation at the shortest wavelengths, particularly for Terra MODIS. Aqua MODIS has experienced far less degradation of its optics and on-board calibrators compared with Terra MODIS, resulting in an overall better performance. With the exception of Aqua band 6, there have been no new noisy or inoperable detectors in the RSB of either instrument during postlaunch operations. As the instruments age and continue to endure the space environment, the detectors and the optical systems degrade. The challenges associated with incorporating these on-orbit changes to ensure a production of high-quality calibrated L1B data products are also discussed in this paper.

TI  - Spatiotemporal influences of land use/cover changes on the heat island effect in rapid urbanization area
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban sprawl and growth led to substantial urban thermal environment changes and influenced the local climate, environment, and quality of life of residents. Taking the Chang-Zhu-Tan urban agglomeration in China as a case, this study firstly identified the spatiotemporal patterns of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) and the land use/cover changes (LUCC) based on multi-temporal Landsat TM satellite data over 21 years, and then investigated the relationship between LUCC and SUHII by methods of logistic regression model and centroid shift analysis. The results showed that green spaces (e.g., cropland, forestland) of 899.13 km(2) had been converted to built-up land during the 1994-2015 period, which caused significant urban expansion. The SUHII was the highest for built-up land, high for unused land, low for cropland and grassland, and the lowest for forestland and open water. Many areas experienced extensive rapid urbanization because of the emergence of the urban agglomeration, which resulted in the loss of green spaces and increased SUHI effects over the 21-year study period. In addition, the results of centroid shift analysis found that the growth of SUHII and the expansion of high SUHII areas are closely related to the expansion of an existing urban area in Xiangtan, while the increases of building density and height in Changsha resulted in the decrease of SUHII and spatiotemporal change of high SUHII areas. The analysis of the effects of land use/cover types on the SUHII in this study will contribute to future urban land use allocation for the mitigation of SUHI formation.

TI  - Large Scale Agricultural Plastic Mulch Detecting and Monitoring with Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plastic mulching has been widely practiced in crop cultivation worldwide due to its potential to significantly increase crop production. However, it also has a great impact on the regional climate and ecological environment. More importantly, it often leads to unexpected soil pollution due to fine plastic residuals. Therefore, accurately and timely monitoring of the temporal and spatial distribution of plastic mulch practice in large areas is of great interest to assess its impacts. However, existing plastic-mulched farmland (PMF) detecting efforts are limited to either small areas with high-resolution images or coarse resolution images of large areas. In this study, we examined the potential of cloud computing and multi-temporal, multi-sensor satellite images for detecting PMF in large areas. We first built the plastic-mulched farmland mapping algorithm (PFMA) rules through analyzing its spectral, temporal, and auxiliary features in remote sensing imagery with the classification and regression tree (CART). We then applied the PFMA in the dry region of Xinjiang, China, where a water resource is very scarce and thus plastic mulch has been intensively used and its usage is expected to increase significantly in the near future. The experimental results demonstrated that the PFMA reached an overall accuracy of 92.2% with a producer's accuracy of 97.6% and a user's accuracy of 86.7%, and the F-score was 0.914 for the PMF class. We further monitored and analyzed the dynamics of plastic mulch practiced in Xinjiang by applying the PFMA to the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The general pattern of plastic mulch usage dynamic in Xinjiang during the period from 2000 to 2015 was well captured by our multi-temporal analysis.

TI  - Dissolved oxygen responses to tropical cyclones "Wind Pump" on pre-existing cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines how dissolved oxygen (DO) responds to tropical cyclones (TCs) "Wind Pump" in a preexisting cyclonic and an anticyclonic eddy over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) based on Argo and satellite data. Both TCs induced DO temporal decreases in the subsurface waters (Deep Depression BOB 04 with a pre-existing cyclonic eddy and cyclonic storm Roanu with a pre-existing anticyclonic eddy) owing mainly to the storm-induced upwelling. The deeper oxycline caused by the pre-existing anticyclonic eddy relieved the storm-induced shallow of oxycline during Roanu. On the contrary, the pre-existing cyclonic eddy shoaled the oxycline, intensifying the storm-induced shallow of oxycline during BOB 04. Furthermore, the pre-existing cyclonic eddy induced a long time of DO decrease after BOB 04. This study suggests that the subsurface DO concentrations in the BoB are affected mainly by storm-induced physical processes, and the mesoscale eddies also play an important role.

TI  - Classification of Coral Reef Benthos around Ganquan Island Using WorldView-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs are structures formed by animals known as stony corals, which have an important impact on the physical and ecological environment of their surroundings. Presently, coral reefs are severely damaged by a variety of human activities and by global climate change. This paper is intended to explore the potential of using WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite images for coral reef bottom types classification. The research area for this study is around Ganquan Island in the South China Sea. Sunny sky and cloudless WV2 satellite imagery is selected to reduce atmospheric impact and improve the accuracy of coral reef classification. For the preprocessed imagery data, training samples were manually established, and the seafloor reef bottom types in the sea near Ganquan Island were divided into five substratum categories: coral reef, sand, reef, spray and deep sea water. These are classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM), a Neural Network and the Maximum Likelihood method. The classification results were verified by comparing the satellite image visual interpretation classification results and the field seafloor image data. Confusion matrixes was compared and the classification accuracy was evaluated. The results show that the classification based on the SVM method is the best, with a total classification accuracy of 93.33% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.89. These results prove that high-resolution images can provide detailed and accurate information for coral reef bottom types classification and thus provide a scientific basis and reliable data for the establishment of a more complete coral reef ecological monitoring system and marine ecological environmental protection system.

TI  - Reconstructing All-Weather Land Surface Temperature Using the Bayesian Maximum Entropy Method Over the Tibetan Plateau and Heihe River Basin
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter for measuring the water-heat balance on the Earth's surface. Remote sensing technology provides a unique way to monitor LSTs over large spatial areas. Thermal infrared (TIR)-derived LST has a high spatial resolution and accuracy, but missing values caused by clouds hinder applications of this method. Passive microwave radiation can penetrate clouds, but the data have a relatively lower spatial resolution and accuracy. The Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) method was used for blending the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) LST to produce a spatially complete, accurate, and high-spatial-resolution LST over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The accuracy of the BME method was validated using the adjusted soil temperature collected from the two verification regions. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are less than 3.54 and 4.89 K over the relatively flat verification region during nighttime and daytime, respectively. In another rugged terrain verification region, the RMSE is less than 3 K during nighttime and ranges from 4.2 to 8.29 K during daytime. The RMSE of the blended LST is significantly better than that of a recent study of the AMSR-E LST retrieved during nighttime, and the RMSE is comparable to the AMSR-E LST retrieved during daytime. The BME method was adopted to integrate the MODIS LST and AMSR-E LST acquired on November 30, 2010 over the TP and HRB. The spatial completeness of the blended LST reached 100%, and the blended LST spatial pattern was generally consistent with the spatial patterns of the MODIS LST and AMSR-E LST. This paper demonstrates the utility of generating all-weather regional LSTs using the BME method from TIR LST and microwave LST products.

TI  - Analysis of Changes and Potential Characteristics of Cultivated Land Productivity Based on MODIS EVI: A Case Study of Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivated land productivity is a basic guarantee of food security. This study extracted the multiple cropping index (MCI) and most active days (MAD, i.e., days when the EVI exceeded a threshold) based on crop growth EVI curves to analyse the changes and potential characteristics of cultivated land productivity in Jiangsu Province during 2001-2017. The results are as follows: (1) The MCI of 83.8% of cultivated land remained unchanged in Jiangsu, the cultivated land with changed MCI (16.2%) was mainly concentrated in the southern and eastern coastal areas of Jiangsu, and the main cropping systems were single and double seasons. (2) The changes in cultivated land productivity were significant and had an obvious spatial distribution. The areas where the productivity of single cropping system changed occupied 67.8% of the total cultivated land of single cropping system, and the decreased areas (46.5%) were concentrated in southern Jiangsu. (3) For double cropping systems, the percentages of the changed productivity areas accounting for cultivated land were 82.7% and 73.3%. The decreased areas were distributed in central Jiangsu. In addition, the productivity of the first crop showed an overall (72%) increasing trend and increased areas (40.8%) of the second crop were found in northern Jiangsu. (4) During 2001-2017, cultivated land productivity greatly improved in Jiangsu. In the areas where productivity increased, the proportions of cultivated land with productivity potential space greater than 20% in single and double cropping systems were greater than 60% and 90%, respectively. In the areas where productivity decreased, greater than 25% and 75% of cultivated land had potential space in greater than 80% of the single and double cropping systems, respectively. This result shows that productivity still has much room for development in Jiangsu. This study provides new insight for studying cultivated land productivity and provides references for guiding agricultural production.

TI  - Heterogeneous spring phenology shifts affected by climate: supportive evidence from two remotely sensed vegetation indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Northern Hemisphere spring greenup (SG) has advanced between 0-12 days per decade since early 1980s as inferred from multiple satellite time series. The wide range of SG shifts is mainly due to the fact that these studies cover different periods and regions, and using different satellite records. Assessing the spatial heterogeneity of SG trends associated with different satellites is essential for robustly interpreting phenological dynamics and their responses to climate. Weinvestigated the heterogeneity of the SG trends and their responses to climate variability with two satellite products (1) Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and (2) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over the period 2001-2013. Both MODIS and AVHRR agreed in showing the spatial distribution of mean SG, and SG advancement in northern Canada, the eastern United States, and Russia, and SG delay in western North America, parts of Baltic Europe, and East Asia. However, we identified contrasting MODIS and AVHRR SG trends in the northern high latitudes. Our analyses of correlations between SG and preseason climate drivers indicated that temperature dominated the interannual variability of SG. Preseason, the period preceding SG and highly correlated with the timing of SG has experienced much stronger warming than the spring season. MODIS and AVHRR indicated consistent temperature sensitivity of SG across biomes, even though the MODIS inferred SG is better correlated and more sensitive to temperature across biomes as compared to AVHRR. The sensitivities of SG to temperature across biomes is stable but with a slight increase over 2001-2013, in comparison with that over 1988-2000. The increased SG-temperature sensitivity is associated with increased precipitation during the spring season, which regulated the sensitivity of SG to spring temperature.

TI  - Validation of chlorophyll-a and sea surface temperature concentration and their relationship with the parameters-diffuse attenuation coefficient and photosynthetically active radiation using MODIS data: A case study of Gujarat coastal region
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ data of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature (SST) of the Gujarat region for the period, 2002-2009 were obtained from Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad. Out of nearly 100 sampling points, 22 and 67 points qualified for comparison with the satellite measurements of Chl-a and SST, respectively. Chl-a concentrations were estimated from the MODIS satellite data (4 km resolution) with the existing global ocean color algorithms, namely, OC2V4, OC4V4, and OC3M. The SST was calculated with the help of bands 31 and 32 using MODIS-Aqua sensor long wave SST algorithm and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) assimilation SST retrieval model (split window method). The satellite images were processed using global Sea WiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software v.7.3.1. Chl-a retrieved from OC3M algorithm had high coefficient of determination (R-2=0.74) and less root mean square error (RMSE=1.24) as compared to OC2V4 and OC4V4 (R-2=0.541 & 0.542 and RMSE=1.94 and 1.84, respectively) with in-situ data. The SST retrieved from MODIS-Aqua sensor long wave SST algorithm had a high coefficient of correlation as compared to ECMWF assimilation model (0.798 & 0.32 respectively) with in-situ data and RMSE were 0.80 and 2.65, respectively. SST and Chl-a showed an inverse correlation, with a coefficient of correlation (R) =0.530. Daily retrieval of Chl-a and SST value had very high degree of correlation with remote sensed eight days composite and monthly composite value (0.958 & 0.876, respectively). Retrieval of the value of diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm wavelength (Kd or Kd_490), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and vertical attenuation coefficient of PAR (Kd(PAR)) were done and found that Kd and Kd(PAR) had very high degree of positive correlation (R=0.994). In addition, it was found that PAR had a positive correlation with SST(R=0.512) and negative correlation with Chl-a (R=-0.446). The range of this parameter values supports the case-I water and fish assemblage area.

TI  - Using Object-Oriented Classification for Coastal Management in the East Central Coast of Florida: A Quantitative Comparison between UAV, Satellite, and Aerial Data
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - High resolution mapping of coastal habitats is invaluable for resource inventory, change detection, and inventory of aquaculture applications. However, coastal areas, especially the interior of mangroves, are often difficult to access. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), equipped with a multispectral sensor, affords an opportunity to improve upon satellite imagery for coastal management because of the very high spatial resolution, multispectral capability, and opportunity to collect real-time observations. Despite the recent and rapid development of UAV mapping applications, few articles have quantitatively compared how much improvement there is of UAV multispectral mapping methods compared to more conventional remote sensing data such as satellite imagery. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively demonstrate the improvements of a multispectral UAV mapping technique for higher resolution images used for advanced mapping and assessing coastal land cover. We performed multispectral UAV mapping fieldwork trials over Indian River Lagoon along the central Atlantic coast of Florida. Ground Control Points (GCPs) were collected to generate a rigorous geo-referenced dataset of UAV imagery and support comparison to geo-referenced satellite and aerial imagery. Multi-spectral satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) was also acquired to map land cover for the same region. NDVI and object-oriented classification methods were used for comparison between UAV and satellite mapping capabilities. Compared with aerial images acquired from Florida Department of Environmental Protection, the UAV multi-spectral mapping method used in this study provided advanced information of the physical conditions of the study area, an improved land feature delineation, and a significantly better mapping product than satellite imagery with coarser resolution. The study demonstrates a replicable UAV multi-spectral mapping method useful for study sites that lack high quality data.

TI  - Ground Deformation Revealed by Sentinel-1 MSBAS-InSAR Time-Series over Karamay Oilfield, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluid extraction or injection into underground reservoirs may cause ground deformation, manifested as subsidence or uplift. Excessive deformation may threaten the infrastructure of the oilfield and its surroundings and may even induce earthquakes. Therefore, the monitoring of surface deformation caused by oil production activities is important for the safe production of oilfields and safety assessments of surrounding infrastructure. Karamay oilfield is one of the major oil and gas fields in China. In this study, we take the Karamay oilfield in Xinjiang as a case study to detect surface deformation caused by subsurface fluid injection. Sentinel-1A images of 32 ascending (Path 114) and 34 descending (Path 165) tracks spanning March 2017 to August 2018, were used to derive vertical and horizontal deformation over Karamay oilfield using the MSBAS-InSAR method. The observed two-dimensional deformation exhibited significant vertical and east-west deformation in this region. The maximum uplift and horizontal velocity was approximately 160 mm/year and 65 mm/year, respectively. We also modeled one of the typical deformation zones using a dislocation model in a homogenous elastic half-space.

TI  - Satellite Bands Based Estimation of Nitrogen Concentration in Potato Plants
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) is one of the most important nutrient elements that directly affectscrop growth and yield. High-throughput ground-based remote sensing, passive or active re? ectance sensors, has the potential to provide more information for making better-informed management decisions for nitrogen fertilizer inputs at the canopy scale in real time but it is difficult to obtain data at the regional scale. For that multi-channel satellites with high spatial resolution (WorldView-2 and VEN mu S satellites with red edge bands) were tested in this study to estimating PNC on large scale at different growth stages of potato varieties. Experiments were conducted in 2014, 2015 and 2016 to remotely estimate the PNC of diverse potato varieties under different nitrogen levels in Wuchuan County of Northern Yin mountain, Inner Mongolia. The results showed that the combined spectral index NDRE/NDVI based on the red, red edge and near-infrared channels of the VEN mu S and WorldView-2 satellite is superior to other indices in estimating the PNC of potato varieties. The spectral index (NDRE/NDVI) of VEN mu S and WorldView-2 satellites had a high correlation with PNC at different growth stages, and the correlation coefficient ranged between 0.63 and 0.81. The spectral index (NDRE/NDVI) of VEN mu S had the highest correlation coefficient with PNC (r=0.81) at reproduction growth stage. The growth stages significantly affected the spectral index to estimate the PNC. The calibration models of spectral index (NDRE/NDVI) of two satellites based on the data of three years was validated to predict the PNC at reproduction growth stage. The predictive model of VEN mu S-NDRE/NDVI had the highest coefficient of determination (0.56), the lowest RMSE (0.38%) and RE (10.45%) with a slope of 0.82, as well as the predictive model of WorldView-2-NDRE/NDV had higher coefficient of determination (0.49), lower RMSE (0.41%) and RE (11.12%) with a slope of 0.78. In conclusion, the results of multi-channel satellite simulations showed that the combined spectral index based on the red edge width band can be used to monitor the PNC of potato varieties.

TI  - Nowcasting of Surface Solar Irradiance Using FengYun-4 Satellite Observations over China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of surface solar irradiance is of great significance for the generation of photovoltaic power. Surface solar irradiance is affected by many random mutation factors, which means that there are great challenges faced in short-term prediction. In Northwest China, there are abundant solar energy resources and large desert areas, which have broad prospects for the development of photovoltaic (PV) systems. For the desert areas in Northwest China, where meteorological stations are scarce, satellite remote sensing data are extremely precious exploration data. In this paper, we present a model using FY-4A satellite images to forecast (up to 15-180 min ahead) global horizontal solar irradiance (GHI), at a 15 min temporal resolution in desert areas under different sky conditions, and compare it with the persistence model (SP). The spatial resolution of the FY-4A satellite images we used was 1 km x 1 km. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to derive the cloud motion vector (CMV) field from the satellite cloud images. The accuracy of the forecast model was evaluated by the ground observed GHI data. The results showed that the normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) ranged from 18.9% to 21.6% and the normalized mean bias error (nMBE) ranged from 3.2% to 4.9% for time horizons from 15 to 180 min under all sky conditions. Compared with the SP model, the nRMSE value was reduced by about 6%, 8%, and 14% with the time horizons of 60, 120, and 180 min, respectively.

TI  - Transferred Deep Learning-Based Change Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively used in diverse tasks. Generally, training such DNNs with superior performance requires a large amount of labeled data. However, it is time-consuming and expensive to manually label the data, especially for tasks in remote sensing, e.g., change detection. The situation motivates us to resort to the existing related images with labels, from which the concept of change can be adapted to new images. However, the distributions of the related labeled images (source domain) and unlabeled new images (target domain) are similar but not identical. It impedes a change detection model learned from source domains being well applied to the target domain. In this paper, we propose a transferred deep learning-based change detection framework to solve this problem. It consists of pretraining and fine-tuning stages. In the pretraining process, we propose two tasks to be learned simultaneously, namely, change detection for the source domain with labels and reconstruction of the unlabeled target data. The auxiliary task aims to reconstruct the difference image (DI) for the target domain. DI is an effective feature, such that the auxiliary task is of much relevance to change detection. The lower layers are shared between these two tasks in the training process. It mitigates the distribution discrepancy between the source and target domains and makes the concept of change from the source domain adapt to the target domain. In addition, we evaluate three modes of the U-net architecture to merge the information for a pair of patches. To fine-tune the change detection network (CDN) for the target domain, two strategies are exploited to select the pixels that have a high possibility of being correctly classified by an unsupervised approach. The proposed method demonstrates an excellent capacity for adapting the concept of change from the source domain to the target domain. It outperforms the state-of-the-art change detection methods via experimental results on real remote sensing data sets.

TI  - Spatially Explicit Assessment of Social Vulnerability in Coastal China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Social vulnerability assessment has been recognized as a reliable and effective measure for informing coastal hazard management. Although significant advances have been made in the study of social vulnerability for over two decades, China's social vulnerability profiles are mainly based on administrative unit. Consequently, no detailed distribution is provided, and the capability to diagnose human risks is hindered. In this study, we established a social vulnerability index (SoVI) in 2000 and 2010 at a spatial resolution of 250 m for China's coastal zone by combining the potential exposure index (PEI) and social resilience index (SRI). The PEI with a 250 m resolution was obtained by fitting the census data and multisource remote sensing data in random forest model. The county-level SRI was evaluated through principal component analysis based on 33 socioeconomic variables. For identifying the spatiotemporal change, we used global and local Moran's I to map clusters of SoVI and its percent change in the decade. The results suggest the following: (1) Counties in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and eastern Guangzhou, except several small hot spots, exhibited the most vulnerability, especially in urban areas, whereas those in Hainan and southern Liaoning presented the least vulnerability. (2) Notable increases were emphasized in Tianjin, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta. The spatiotemporal variation and heterogeneity in social vulnerability obtained through this analysis will provide a scientific basis to decision-makers to focus risk mitigation effort.

TI  - Applicability analysis of MODIS tree cover product in Texas savanna
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover (MOD44B) is an annual product that depicts the fractional coverage of trees on the earth's terrestrial surface at 250m resolution. It has to be noted that the training data of this product is limited to trees above 5 m in height. However, this product has been widely applied in savanna ecosystems where many woody plant species seldom reach 5 m tall. Though the short woody plants in savanna ecosystems could have been reflected in this product due to similar spectral implication as that of tall trees, its applicability has never been rigorously tested. Given so, this study aims to fill this void. It was tested in Texas savanna, which is featured by a wide precipitation gradient and an accompanying woody plant cover gradation. Firstly, we assessed the ability of the MODIS tree cover product in reflecting woody plant cover at pixel level. A per-pixel comparison was conducted between the tree cover values and reference measurement of woody plant cover based on 1-m resolution digital orthophotos. Secondly, we assessed the ability of this tree cover product in reflecting savanna landscape pattern, particularly the potential woody cover pattern over the precipitation gradient in Texas savanna. The MODIS tree cover product based potential woody cover pattern was assessed against the reference pattern of the study area. Thirdly, we assessed the year-to-year consistency of this annual product, under the assumption that tree cover changes very little within one-year period. Reduced major axis regression was conducted between the corresponding tree cover pixels of all successive years from 2000 to 2016. Research results suggest that the MODIS tree cover product has great potential in reflecting woody plant cover at pixel level by empirical calibration. Moreover, this tree cover product demonstrates the ability of revealing the increasing trend of potential woody cover with mean annual precipitation (MAP) across Texas savanna. Furthermore, the lack of temporal consistency is revealed for this annual product. It is worth noting that the potential woody cover pattern endowed by the precipitation gradient in Texas savanna is in a three-segment shape.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of the thermal environment based on the urban expansion of natural cities using open data in Guangzhou, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The change in the urban thermal environment resulting from urban expansion is attracting increasing attention from researchers. In this research, the influence of the urban expansion process on the spatial heterogeneity of the thermal environment was analyzed, including quantitative research on urban expansion based on the natural city (NC) concept using open data and the footprint of the thermal environment (TE FP) model to reveal the influences in different time periods between 2014 and 2018 in Guangzhou, China. And the TE FP is an indication used to evaluate whether certain area is affected by the thermal environment of the NC. The results demonstrated the following. (1) The high-temperature area in Guangzhou was 2293.55 km(2) in 2014, 2330.24 km(2) in 2016, and 2609.81 km(2) in 2018 and expanded by 1.60% (2014-2016), 12.00% (2016-2018) and 13.79% (2014-2018), respectively. (2) The urban area increased from 182.10 km(2) in 2014 to 266.90 km(2) in 2018, which represented an increase by almost half, with an average annual expansion rate of 10.03%. (3) In 2014, 2016 and 2018, the area representing the TE FP consisted of the areas of five buffer zones, six buffer zones and eight buffer zones, respectively. This study provides a new approach to the study of urban expansion and a new perspective for exploring the influence of the urban expansion process on the spatial heterogeneity of the thermal environment.

TI  - Horizontal Development of Built-Up Area and Its Impacts on the Agricultural Land of Peshawar City District (1991-2014)
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peshawar City is experiencing a rapid spatial urban growth primarily as a result of high rate of urbanization along with economic development. This paper was designed to understand the impacts of urbanization on agriculture land use change by particularly focusing on land use change trajectories from the past (1991-2014). We used Landsat imageries (30 m) for 1991 and 2014. The ground truthing of the satellite data was performed by collecting information from Peshawar Development Authority, revenue department, real estate agents and interviews with the officials of city administration. The temporal satellite images were processed by applying supervised maximum likelihood classification technique in ArcGIS 9.3. The procedure resulted into five main classes of land use, i.e., built-up area, farmland, barren land, cultivable wasteland and water bodies. The analysis revealed that in Peshawar City, the built environment has been doubled from 8.1% in 1991 to over 18% in 2014 by predominantly encroaching land producing food. Furthermore, the CA-Markov model predicted that the area under impervious surfaces would continue to flourish during the next three decades. This rapid increase in built-up area is accredited to the lack of proper land use planning and management, which has caused chaotic urban sprawl with detrimental social and environmental consequences.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban development in China has transformed the cityscapes, with a dramatic increase in high-rise buildings. However, the current 2D property valuation methods neglect the vertical dimension, even though that aspect contains significant indicators that impact property value - such as types of views, scope of vision and daylight. 3D modelling of geographical data can help to change this in high-rise and highly-density areas, going beyond 2D to enable identification of complex property characteristics in the vertical dimension too. This article presents research to explore a 3D modelling approach using remote sensing data for more precise property valuation.

TI  - Estimation of Mining and Landfilling Activities with Associated Overburden through Satellite Data: Germany 2000-2010
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite ever-increasing material extraction on the global scale, very few studies have focused on the relationship between mining activities, overburden, and landfilling. This is mainly due to the lack of statistical data. Yet, large mining activities cause environmental strain to the natural environment, and are often cause of irreversible alterations to the natural landscape. To circumvent this problem, we develop a methodology that employs the digital elevation model and land cover to detect and analyze mining and landfilling site over time. We test our methodology with the case of Germany for the years 2000-2010. We then confront our results with statistically available data, to verify whether this methodology can be applied to other countries. Results from the analysis of satellite data give 15.3 Pg of extracted materials and 7.8 Pg of landfilled materials, while statistics report 29.4 Pg and 1.8 Pg, respectively. This large difference was likely due to the different frequency of recording, where satellite data was updated after 10 years, while statistics were reported yearly. The analysis of the anthropogenic disturbance with spatial information can effectively contribute to observe, analyze, and quantify mining activities, overburden, and landfills, and can thus provide policy makers with useful and practical information regarding resource usage and waste management.

AB  - High-resolution optical remote sensing data can be utilized to investigate the human behavior and the activities of artificial targets, for example ship detection on the sea. Recently, the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) in the field of deep learning is widely used in image processing, especially in target detection tasks. Therefore, a complete processing system called the broad area target search (BATS) is proposed based on DCNN in this paper, which contains data import, processing and storage steps. In this system, aiming at the problem of onshore false alarms, a method named as Mask-Faster R-CNN is proposed to differentiate the target and non-target areas by introducing a semantic segmentation sub network into the Faster R-CNN. In addition, we propose a DCNN framework named as Saliency-Faster R-CNN to deal with the problem of multi-scale ships detection, which solves the problem of missing detection caused by the inconsistency between large-scale targets and training samples. Based on these DCNN-based methods, the BATS system is tested to verify that our system can integrate different ship detection methods to effectively solve the problems that existed in the ship detection task. Furthermore, our system provides an interface for users, as a data-driven learning, to optimize the DCNN-based methods.

TI  - Integration of Land Cover Changes and Land Capability of Wadi El-Natrun Depression Using Vegetation Indices
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - THE STUDY objectives were to use vegetation indices techniques for detecting the change of vegetation cover during three periods: from 1984 to 2001, 2001 to 2018, and 1984 to 2018 and to identify the impact of land capability on land cover changes at Wadi El-Natrun Depression, Egypt. Landsat-8 satellite images dated to 1984, 2001 and 2018 were used to detect the changes in land coverin the investigated area (573.53 km(2)). Four vegetation indices,including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) were used to identify and detect vegetation changes during the last34 years. Ground truth points were collected in 2018 to testthe accuracy of classified images. Forty five soil profiles were examined to represent different geomorphic units created using a digital elevation model (DEM) and Landsat-8image. Modified Storie index was used to carry out land capability evaluation of the investigated soils. Results showed that the vegetation indices determined land cover classes with high over all accuracy (92 > %) and a kappa coefficient greater than 0.9.The soils belonged to grades 2, 3, 4 and 5, representing 0.7, 17.88, 75.15 and 2.09 % of the total area respectively.The low land capability is due to excess of soil salinity, coarse soil texture, shallow soil depth, and poor drainage conditions in addition to the results illustrated that there was a positive correlation between the land capability and extension in vegetation land cover.

TI  - Study on Distribution Characteristics of Suspended Sediment in Yellow River Estuary Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we used the MODIS L1B remote sensing images of March, June, September and December in 2006-2011 which were selected. The distribution characteristics of suspended sediment in the Yellow River estuary were analyzed by combining the cross-calibrated multi-platform wind data of the same period. From the spatial distribution, there are mainly three high concentration suspended sediment areas near the Yellow River estuary and the concentration of suspended sediment near the shore is greater than that in the deep sea. From the seasonal distribution, the content of suspended sediment in spring and winter is higher than that in summer and autumn. The region of high suspended sediment is least in summer. The suspended sediment concentration is higher in the southern area than in the northern area, and the near-shore water is higher than that in the deep sea. The results show that local wind field has a certain influence on the distribution of suspended sediment and the correlation coefficient is 0.38.

TI  - Supplement of the radiance-based method to validate satellite-derived land surface temperature products over heterogeneous land surfaces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from satellite remote sensing data has become a key parameter in research on global environmental change; therefore, the acquisition of accurate satellite-derived LST information is crucial for the diagnosis and analysis of global change. However, it is relatively difficult to obtain the true value of a pixel due to the scale mismatch between in situ measurements and satellite-based observations, especially for commonly heterogeneous and nonisothermal land areas, which greatly increases the difficulty in estimating pixel-representative LST values from in situ measurements for validation of satellite-based LST products. In this study, a supplemented radiance-based (SR-based) validation method was developed to evaluate the latest moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Level 2 daily LST/land surface emissivity (LSE) products over a heterogeneous and nonisothermal region of the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) project, West China. In the SR-based framework, pixel-representative LST values are simulated by the MODTRAN model from the corresponding in situ measurements, such as LSE and atmospheric profile measurements, to evaluate the MODIS LST products. The validation results show that the MODIS daytime LST products from the Aqua satellite (MYD11_L2) have a greater accuracy than those from the Terra satellite (MOD11_L2). Analyses of the effect factors indicate a strong correlation between the errors in the MOD11_L2 LST product and the corresponding difference in the MODIS brightness temperature between bands 31 and 32. Although the requirement of synchronous or quasisynchronous in situ measurements for the validated LST products may limit the applicability of the SR-based method, it is still an effective and simple method for validating satellite-derived LST products over mixed pixels. Our method is an indispensable supplement for the validation methods of satellite-derived LST products, and it can be applied in West China and other areas with heterogeneous land surfaces.

TI  - An Improved Conceptual Model Quantifying the Effect of Climate Change and Anthropogenic Activities on Vegetation Change in Arid Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation shows a greening trend on the global scale in the past decades, which has an important effect on the hydrological cycle, and thus quantitative interpretation of the causes for vegetation change is of great benefit to understanding changes in ecology, climate, and hydrology. Although the Donohue13 model, a simple conceptual model based on gas exchange theory, provides an effective tool to interpret the greening trend, it cannot be used to evaluate the impact from land use and land cover change (LULCC) on the regional scale, whose importance to vegetation change has been demonstrated in a large number of studies. Hence, we have improved the Donohue13 model by taking into account the change in vegetation cover ratio due to LULCC, and applied this model to the Yarkand Oasis in the arid region of northwest China. The estimated change trend in leaf area index (LAI) is 1.20%/year from 2001 to 2017, which accounts for approximately half of the observed (2.31%/year) by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). Regarding the causes for vegetation greening, the contributions of: (1) LULCC; (2) atmospheric CO2 concentration; and (3) vapor pressure deficit were: (1) 88.3%; (2) 40.0%; and (3) -28.3%, respectively, which reveals that the largest contribution was from LULCC, which is probably driven by increased total water availability in whole oasis with a constant transpiration in vegetation area. The improved Donohue13 model, a simple but physics-based model, can partially explain the impact of factors related to climate change and anthropogenic activity on vegetation change in arid regions. It can be further combined with the Budyko hypothesis to establish a framework for quantifying the changes in coupled response of vegetation and hydrological processes to environment changes.

TI  - Spatial associations between NDVI and environmental factors in the Heihe River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Heihe River Basin is located in the arid and semi-arid regions of Northwest China. Here, the terrestrial ecosystem is vulnerable, making it necessary to identify the factors that could affect the ecosystem. In this study, MODIS-NDVI data with a 250-m resolution were used as a proxy for the terrestrial ecosystem. By combining these with environmental factors, we were able to explore the spatial features of NDVI and identify the factors influencing the NDVI distribution in the Heihe River Basin during the period of 2000-2016. A geographical detector (Geodetector) was employed to examine the spatial heterogeneity of the NDVI and to explore the factors that could potentially influence the NDVI distribution. The results indicate that: (1) the NDVI in the Heihe River Basin appeared high in the southeast while being low in the north, showing spatial heterogeneity with a q-statistic of 0.38. The spatial trend of the vegetation in the three sub-basins generally increased in the growing seasons from 2000 to 2016; (2) The results obtained by the Geodetector (as denoted by the q-statistic as well as the degree of spatial association between the NDVI and environmental factors) showed spatial heterogeneity in the associations between the NDVI and the environmental factors for the overall basin as well as the sub-basins. Precipitation was the dominant factor for the overall basin. In the upper basin, elevation was found to be the dominant factor. The dominant factor in the middle basin was precipitation, closely followed by the soil type. In the lower basin, the dominant factor was soil type with a lower q-statistic of 0.13, and the dominant interaction between the elevation and soil type was nonlinearly enhanced (q-statistic = 0.22).

TI  - Polycentric urban development and urban thermal environment: A case of Hangzhou, China
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polycentric urban structure has become popular worldwide, including in China. Previous studies revealed that polycentricity can remediate certain environmental problems; however, few studies have focused on how polycentricity affects the urban thermal environment. Using remote sensing data for the nighttime light and surface temperature, this study first explored the dynamics of polycentric urban development and thermal environment in Hangzhou during 2000-2010. Then their relationship was investigated in both morphological and functional dimensions. It was observed that from 2000 to 2006, Hangzhou experienced rapid polycentric development, especially in the functional dimension; however, this trend slowed down during 2006-2010. With the expansion of hot and medium-hot landscapes, the area with higher surface temperature enlarged notably, and warming trends were more significant in the suburbs than in the urban core. Polycentric urban development in both morphological and functional dimensions was positively correlated with the deterioration of the thermal environment. The regional differences in the urban thermal environment can be attributed to the distinctive functional orientations and development patterns of (sub)centers. Further, industrial sub-urbanization could be the underlying reason for the positive correlation because of its consistent distributions with the newly-expanded hot landscape and more contiguous hot landscape caused by the single land use pattern in industrial areas. Two policy implications about polycentric planning and landscape composition and configuration in industrial areas were proposed to mitigate the effect of urban heat island. The findings in this study are conductive to cities whose polycentric urban development is also industrial-based.

TI  - ANALYSIS OF THE DYNAMICS OF COASTAL LANDFORM CHANGE BASED ON THE INTEGRATION OF REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES: IMPLICATIONS FOR TIDAL FLOODING IMPACT IN PEKALONGAN, CENTRAL JAVA, INDONESIA
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal landforms are located in the interface zone between atmosphere, ocean and land surface systems formed by the geomorphic process of erosion, depositional, and subsidence. Studying the dynamics of coastal landform change is important for tracing the relationship between coastal landform changes and tidal flooding in the coastal areas of Pekalongan, Indonesia. The method of integrating remote sensing data with geographic information system (GIS) techniques has been widely used to monitor and analyze the dynamics of morphology change in coastal landform areas. The purpose of this study is to map the dynamics of landform change in the study area from 1978 to 2017 and to analyze its implications for the impact of tidal flooding. The results of the mapping and change analysis associated with coastal landforms can be classified into four landform types: beach, beach ridge, backswamp and alluvial plain. Changes in coastal morphology and landform topography affected by land subsidence and changes in land use/land cover have contributed to the occurrence of tidal flooding in the study area. Beach ridges perform an important role as natural levees which hold back and prevent the entry of seawater at high tide in coastal areas. A limitation of this study is that, as it focuses only on the physical aspects of coastal landform characteristics for one of the factors causing tidal flooding.

TI  - Fram Strait sea ice export affected by thinning: comparing high-resolution simulations and observations
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability and trends of Fram Strait sea ice area and volume exports are examined for the period of 1990-2010. Simulations from a high-resolution version of the MPIOM model (STORM project) reproduce area and volume export well when compared with NSIDC and ICESat satellite data and in-situ ice thickness observations. The fluxes derived from ice thickness and drift satellite products vary considerably, indicating a high uncertainty in these estimates which we mostly assign to the drift observations. The model captures the observed average seasonal cycles and interannual variability of ice export. The simulated mean annual sea ice area export is 860 x 10(3) km(2) a(- 1) (1990-2010), and the correlation with the NSIDC-based area fluxes is r = 0.67. The simulated mean annual volume export is 3.3 x 10(3) km(3) a(- 1) (1990-2010), close to the ICESat/ULS values, with a correlation of r = 0.58. The simulated monthly area export has a significant positive trend of + 10% per decade, explained by wind forcing. The major contribution to the robust trend in area export between June and September. Fram Strait ice volume export variability is mainly controlled by ice drift with a dominant role of the Transpolar Drift and, to a lesser extent thickness variability. The area export increase reflects increasing ice-drift speed, but is balanced with a reduced thickness over time when it comes to volume export, giving no significant trend in volume export. The spatial variability of ice drift indicates that the export influences a large area upstream in the Trans-Polar Drift stream, and that high volume export events lead to a thinner thickness there. The central Arctic is well connected drift-wise to the Fram Strait via the Transpolar Drift while for thickness, the region north of Greenland is dominated and controlled by the Fram Strait ice export.

TI  - Predictors of extensive lymphatic dissemination and recurrences in node-positive endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. To identify predictors of extensive lymphatic dissemination and distant recurrences in node-positive endometrial cancer (EC).Methods. Clinicopathologic data were collected of patients who had fully staged EC with at least 1 positive lymph node. Permanent sections of metastatic lymph nodes were reviewed; metastases were characterized ac- cording to size (<= 2 mm and >2 mm) and location in the lymph node (intra- vs extracapsular). Risk of occurrence of multiple pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissemination was calculated by combining risk factors identified at multivariate analysis.Results. Of 96 patients, 85 had positive pelvic nodes, of whom 71 (83.5%) had high-volume metastases. In the presence of both macrometastasis in the pelvic basin (odds ratio [OR], 13.42; [95% CI, 2.44-73.83]) and uterine serosal involvement of the tumor at final pathologic evaluation (OR, 11.84 [95% CI, 1.22-115.11]), multiple pelvic node dissemination occurred in 91.7% of cases (vs 7.7% in the absence of both). Concomitant presence of pelvic macrometastasis, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and extracapsular invasion led to 85.7% occurrence of para-aortic involvement (vs 11.1% if no factors present). LVSI was independently associated with nonvaginal recurrences (hazard ratio, 2.62 [95% CI, 1.33-5.16]).Conclusions. Presence of high-volume metastases in the pelvic lymph nodes is associated with concomitant presence of multiple positive pelvic nodes, as well as para-aortic node involvement. LVSI is associated with both para-aortic node involvement and occurrence of nonvaginal relapses. In this era of sentinel lymph node mapping, these factors may help predict the extent of lymphatic dissemination in EC. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - 'Impact of Urbanization on Temporal Distribution Pattern of Storm Runoff Coefficient
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Runoff coefficient (RC) is one of the important parameters, which is often considered in surface runoff and peak flood discharge estimation methods in various projects of watershed management and flood control. However, the effect of variability of RC due to human-induced activities on hydrologic behavior of the watershed has not been adequately considered globally. Therefore, the present research was carried out using 18 hyetographs and their corresponding hydrographs during 1984 to 2012 after considering the existence of suitable Landsat 7 (ETM+ and TM) satellite images with corresponding storm events for the Amameh Watershed located in Tehran Province, Iran. The object-oriented classification method was used to derive land use maps from satellite images. Afterward, four time periods were determined based on mean and standard deviation of residential area variations. The temporal distribution pattern of RC was then derived using a ranking method. The one- and two-way analyses of variance were also used to investigate the effect of residential area and rainfall variables on RC. Relationships among residential area as well as rainfall variables as independent variables and mean RC storm-wise as dependent variable were then modeled using two and multiple linear regressions. The results showed that RCs reduced in order of third, second, fourth, and first quartiles with respective values of 42.4, 38.2, 15.8, and 3.6%. The results also showed that RCs in the second and first quartiles and in the third and fourth quartiles were non-significantly decreased and increased by increasing of residential area, respectively. So that the highest variations occurred in first quartile with slope of - 144%. The results further proved that rainfall amount, phi index, and residential area with respective standardized regression coefficients (beta) of 0.629, - 0.465, and - 0.108 had the highest controlling effects on RCs. The finding of the current research proved the temporal variability of RCs at storm scale with more determinant effectiveness of rainfall properties than urbanized interferences. It helps hydrologists and watershed mangers designate appropriate strategies leading to proper implementations of developmental projects.

TI  - Using MODIS derived aerosol optical depth to estimate ground-level PM<sub>2.5 </sub>concentrations over Turkey
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite based particulate matter (PM) pollution monitoring on a regional basis is of importance due in part to the adverse health effects of PM. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data at 3 km and 10 km resolutions from both Terra and Aqua satellites were used, in conjunction with the surface in situ data, to improve the regional distribution of ground-level PM2.5 over Turkey. Five years (2011-2015) of heating season's (15th October to 14th May) in situ PM2.5 measurements from 7 monitoring stations in Ankara and 3 years (2013-2015) of the same data from 13 monitoring stations in Marmara Region were used. Linear and non-linear regression models were used to find the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD data. To improve the correlations between PM2.5 and AOD, the data points affected by free tropospheric long-range transport were removed from the analysis via back trajectory modeling analysis since long-range transport affects AOD more readily than surface PM2.5 data. Using non-linear models with the addition of meteorological parameters such as height of planetary boundary layer, surface temperature and surface wind speed improved the correlations significantly. The best non-linear model can explain 61% (n = 37, R-2 = 0.61, p < 0.001, RMSE = 0.337 mu g/m(3)) of PM2.5 variations at the Edirne Kesan site. It was found that Terra worked better than Aqua. Furthermore, 10-km aerosol products gave better correlations with PM2.5 as compared to the 3-km products. With the aid of spatiotemporal model, PM(2.5 )distribution maps are created for the first time for Turkey.

AB  - We report an investigation of ocean-surface wind speed retrieval from C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a new channel of coright-circular polarization (RR-pol) in compact polarimetry (CP) option. The analysis of simulated RCM quad-polarized CP SAR data and collocated in situ buoy measurements suggests that the RR-pol is much less sensitive to wind directions than the other three polarizations in the CP option. A method is proposed for the RR-pol radar signal as a function of wind speed and incidence angle. We demonstrate that C-band RR-pol has the potential for ocean high wind retrieval, especially for cyclone studies.

TI  - Assessing the Remotely Sensed Evaporative Drought Index for Drought Monitoring over Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many existing satellite evapotranspiration (ET)-based drought indices have characterized regional drought condition successfully, but the relatively short time span of ET products limits their use in long-term climatological drought assessment. In this study, we assess Evaporative Drought Index (EDI) as a drought monitoring indicator over Northeast China through a retrospective comparison with drought-related indicators. After verifying its utility for detecting documented regional drought events and impacts of drought on crop production, we apply it to improve our understanding of the variation in dryness over Northeast China from 1982 to 2015. Our results illustrate that EDI is generally effective for characterizing terrestrial moisture condition and its standardized formula, namely, Standardized Evaporative Drought Index (sEDI) corresponds well with historical drought events and inter-annual grain crop yields over Northeast China. Although the calculation of sEDI does not directly incorporate precipitation and soil moisture, statistical analyses indicate sEDI can detect drought in accordance with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), with the highest correlations found in the west part of Northeast China (R < -0.7). Further analysis illustrates sEDI is more related to commonly-used drought metrics over areas with short canopy vegetation (R < -0.5) than woodland (R < -0.2), which suggests precipitation may not be a good representative of drought condition over areas with deep-rooted vegetation. Then, we find 56.5% of Northeast China shows an upward dry trend from 1982 to 2015, which mainly concentrates in the west part of the study area. Conversely, 14.4% of Northeast China shows a significant wetted trend and most of them locate at cropland areas, due to the improved water management. This study suggests that EDI is a feasible method to monitor spatially distributed drought condition and can provide unique drought information not reflected by rainfall deficits, which also can be used to evaluate traditional precipitation-based indicators.

TI  - Crop Mapping Based on Historical Samples and New Training Samples Generation in Heilongjiang Province, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, year-by-year crop distribution information is a key element in agricultural production regulation and global change governance. However, due to the high sampling costs and insufficient use of historical samples, a supervised classifying method for sampling every year is unsustainable for mapping crop types over time. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for the generation and screening of new samples for 2018 based on historical crop samples, and then it builds a crop mapping model for that current season. Pixels with the same crop type in the historical year (2013-2017) were extracted as potential samples, and their spectral features and spatial information in the current year (2018) were used to generate new samples based on clustering screening. The research result shows that when the clustering number is different, the number and structure of new generated sample also changes. The sample structure generated in Luobei County was not balanced, with the 'other crop' representing less than 3.97%, but the structure of southwest Hulin City was more balanced. Based on the newly generated samples and the ground reference data of classified year, the classification models were constructed. The average classification accuracies of Luobei County in 2018 based on new generated samples and field samples were 69.35% and 77.59%, respectively, while those of southwest Hulin City were 80.44% and 82.94%, respectively. Combined with historical samples and the spectral information of the current year, this study proposes a method to generate new samples. It can overcome the problem of crop samples only being collected in the field due to the difficulty of visual interpretation, effectively improve the use of historical data, and also provide a new idea for sustainable crop mapping in many regions lacking seasonal field samples.

TI  - Performance of POLYMER Atmospheric Correction of Ocean Color Imagery in the Presence of Absorbing Aerosols
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric correction approach currently being used operationally by NASA [termed as NASA standard atmospheric correction (NSAC) approach] to process ocean color data relies on traditional "black pixel" approach, with additional modifications to account for nonnegligible water-leaving radiance in the near-infrared (NIR) bands. The NSAC approach underestimates remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) in blue wavelengths in the presence of absorbing aerosols. Addressing this issue requires realistic absorbing-aerosol model and knowledge of the vertical distribution of aerosols, which are currently difficult to achieve. An alternative atmospheric correction approach has been evaluated in this paper for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The approach is based on a previously developed spectra-matching optimization [POLYnomial-based approach established for the atmospheric correction of MERIS data (POLYMER)], where polynomial functions are used to express atmospheric contribution to the measured radiance and where a bio-optical model is used to estimate the water contribution. Evaluation against in situ data measured over the regions frequently affected by absorbing aerosols indicates that, compared with the NSAC approach, the POLYMER approach improves the R-rs retrievals in blue wavelengths while having a slightly worse performance in other wavelengths. Evaluation using NSAC-retrieved R-rs in adjacent days free of absorbing aerosols suggests that the POLYMER approach could improve the spectral shape and increase valid spatial coverage. When applied to time-series MODIS data, the POLYMER approach could generate more temporary coherent daily and monthly R-rs patterns than the NSAC approach. These results suggest that the POLYMER approach could be an alternative approach to partly correct for absorbing aerosols in the absence of explicit information on the aerosol type and the vertical distribution.

TI  - Reinforcement learning-driven address mapping and caching for flash-based remote sensing image processing
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash memory is featured with salient advantages over conventional hard disks for massive data storage and efficient on-board data processing. A flash translation layer (FTL) is a critical component for flash-based storage devices to handle particular technical constraints of flash. It is desirable to use flash memory for the storage of massive remote sensing images and support on-board remote sensing data processing applications, which typically require high I/O performance and hence call for advanced FTL design and implementations. In this paper, we introduce our efforts in developing a reinforcement learning driven page-level mapping and caching scheme (named Q-FTL) that is adaptive and responsive to ever-changing I/O streams of on-board remote sensing image processing operations. The adaptability and responsiveness are achieved by the separation of large and small I/O requests, an integrated weighting scheme to measure access costs of cached translation pages, and a reinforcement learning driven cache replacement algorithm. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach using actual I/O traces generated from on-board remote sensing image processing applications. Experimental results show that Q-FTL improves over several current state-of-the-art FTLs by a large margin and even achieves competitive performance close to an idealized pure page mapping FTL in some cases.

TI  - The spatial downscaling of TRMM precipitation data for the middle part of the Chinese Tianshan Mountains
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data makes great contribution to complements the inadequacy of the instruments in the region, especially at the high elevation and with complex underlying surfaces. In the paper, downscaling models based on the relationships among the precipitation, elevation, and vegetation are used. The multiple linear regression models are established with Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 dataset, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at a high various spatial scales. The spatial resolution of TRMM 3B43 precipitation fields were downscaled from 0.25 degrees to 1 km during 2014-2016 in the middle part of Chinese Tianshan Mountains. The results of downscaling show better agreements with the ground measurements. The downscaling results reduce the underestimation for TRMM precipitation at Bayanbulak and Balun, and it also reduces the overestimation for TRMM at Korla. However, at Yining, the differences value between the measured data and downscaling results are increased in 2014 and 2015, whereas precision of downscaling is increasing in 2016. In general, spatial downscaling can improve the precision of TRMM precipitation data. Therefore, spatial downscaling method is a feasible approach for studying the precipitation of Chinese Tianshan Mountains; it will provide more precise precipitation data sources.

TI  - Clinical feasibility of imaging with indocyanine green combined with carbon nanoparticles for sentinel lymph node identification in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although several previous studies demonstrated the feasibility and efficacy of indocyanine green (ICG) for thyroid cancer surgery, ICG was administered through venous injection and focused on parathyroid gland protection. We thus aimed to study the feasibility of imaging using ICG combined with carbon nanoparticles (CNs) in the identification of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC).Methods: Two approaches were applied to detect lymph nodes in PTMC surgery. Patients were randomized into 2 groups. ICG and CNs were injected into the thyroid in Group A. In Group B, only CNs was injected. Black-stained or fluorescent nodes observed using near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems were defined as SLNs. SLN and central lymph node (CLN) dissection was completed in both groups. The pathological and postoperative outcomes were compared between 2 groups.Results: There were 40 patients in Group A and 60 in Group B. A total of 138 SLNs were identified; 72 and 66 SLNs were detected and dissected in Groups A and B, respectively. The number of SLNs identified (per patient) in Group A was higher than that in Group B (P=.027). The number of harvested CLNs was 161 and 192 in Groups A and B, respectively, out of which 45 and 48 lymph nodes with metastasis were confirmed by permanent pathology. The CLN metastatic rate in Group A was higher than that in Group B (P=.048).Conclusion: Imaging using ICG combined CNs is feasible and safe for SLN identification in PTMC patients. Compared with using only CNs, more SLNs can be removed and more metastatic lymph nodes can be confirmed when using the combined method. Although the combined method appears to accurately stage tumors, further research is needed.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Urban Heat Island Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study in Hangzhou, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the spatio-temporal variations of the urban heat island (UHI) in Hangzhou are analyzed using multisource remote sensing data. The annual human settlement index (HSI) was derived from the annual MODIS NDVI and DMSP-OLS datasets from 2000 through 2013. The spatio-temporal patterns of HSI as well as the longitudinal variations of land surface temperature (LST) versus HSI were analyzed. The surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was derived by fitting a linear relationship between LST and HSI and it denotes the UHI effect. The spatial variation of SUHII is consistent with the distribution of HSI. According to the district division of Hangzhou, the SUHII of northeast Hangzhou is higher than that of southwest Hangzhou, and the UHI enhancement in the most developed districts of Hangzhou city, Yuhang and Xiaoshan, is remarkable. These results suggest that Hangzhou has a strong UHI effect and that the UHI has local regional characteristics. The UHI effect enhancement is mainly due to the expansion of the urban area, urban anthropogenic activities, and heat emission of the built-up area. According to the changes in SUHII for the period from 2000 to 2013, the UHI effect is intensifying in Hangzhou and measures for reducing the SUHII needs to be taken. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the spatio-temporal variation of the UHI in Hangzhou has been quantitatively analyzed using long time series of multisource remote sensing data, which can help understand the evolution of UHI and guide urban planning and development.

TI  - One-Bit SAR Imaging Based on Single-Frequency Thresholds
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses a novel SAR imaging scheme based on 1-bit sampling assisted with a single-frequency threshold. The 1-bit sampling approach is able to considerably reduce the quantization cost. However, when the sampling technique simplifies the SAR system by reducing the word length of each sample to only 1 bit, amplitude information of the SAR echo is lost and high-order harmonics are introduced, degrading the SAR imaging quality. The strategy of single-frequency threshold is able to linearly maintain the amplitude information and shifts the spectra of the harmonics away from the imaging component caused by the intermodulation. Hence, the imaging quality using 1-bit sampled data can be guaranteed. By selecting different SAR parameter groups according to a comprehensive consideration on spectrum aliasing, filter mismatching, and radio frequency interfering, a good tradeoff can be achieved between imaging quality and system simplification. Examples of ideal scatterers and a real measured scene are provided for quantitative analysis. Real measured RADARSAT-1 data are also imaged using the proposed scheme to validate its effectiveness.

TI  - SMF-POLOPT: An Adaptive Multitemporal Pol(DIn)SAR Filtering and Phase Optimization Algorithm for PSI Applications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle noise and decorrelation can hamper the application and interpretation of PolSAR images. In this paper, a new adaptive multitemporal Pol(DIn)SAR filtering and phase optimization algorithm is proposed to address these limitations. This algorithm first categorizes and adaptively filters permanent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) pixels according to their polarimetric scattering mechanisms [i.e., the scattering-mechanism-based filtering (SMF)]. Then, two different polarimetric DInSAR (POLDInSAR) phase OPTimization methods are applied separately on the filtered PS and DS pixels (i.e., POLOPT). Finally, an inclusive pixel selection approach is used to identify high-quality pixels for ground deformation estimation. Thirty-one full-polarization Radarsat-2 SAR images over Barcelona (Spain) and 31 dual-polarization TerraSAR-X images over Murcia (Spain) have been used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The PolSAR filtering results show that the speckle of PolSAR images has been well reduced with the preservation of details by the proposed SMF. The obtained ground deformation monitoring results have shown significant improvements, about x7.2 (the full-polarization case) and x3.8 (the dual-polarization case) with respect to the classical full-resolution single-pol amplitude dispersion method, on the valid pixels' densities. The excellent PolSAR filtering and ground deformation monitoring results achieved by the adaptive Pol(DIn) SAR filtering and phase optimization algorithm (i.e., the SMF-POLOPT) have validated the effectiveness of this proposed scheme.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of Nightlight Gradients on Street Robbery and Burglary in Cincinnati of Ohio State, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has recognized the importance of edges to crime. Various scholars have explored how one specific type of edges such as physical edges or social edges affect crime, but rarely investigated the importance of the composite edge effect. To address this gap, this study introduces nightlight data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Satellite (NPP-VIIRS) to measure composite edges. This study defines edges as nightlight gradients-the maximum change of nightlight from a pixel to its neighbors. Using nightlight gradients and other control variables at the tract level, this study applies negative binomial regression models to investigate the effects of edges on the street robbery rate and the burglary rate in Cincinnati. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) of models show that nightlight gradients improve the fitness of models of street robbery and burglary. Also, nightlight gradients make a positive impact on the street robbery rate whilst a negative impact on the burglary rate, both of which are statistically significant under the alpha level of 0.05. The different impacts on these two types of crimes may be explained by the nature of crimes and the in-situ characteristics, including nightlight.

TI  - Effect of wind time on the dispersal capacity of <i>Trichogramma dendrolimi</i> Matsumura (Hymenoptera Trichogrammatidae)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASIA-PACIFIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of Trichogramma against pests basically depends on the dispersal capacity of the wasps. A release-recapture method was used in this study to evaluate the effect of relative wind speed (RWS) during the nighttime and the daytime on the dispersal capacity of postrelease population of Trichogramma dendrolimi Matsumura. Two repeated measurements were carried out, using sentinel cards with the host eggs and yellow sticky card traps on the third and the sixth day after wasp release. The results showed that: (1) both the number of recaptured wasps and parasitized eggs increased with the RWS in the daytime during the first three days. The number of parasitized eggs also increased with the RWS in the daytime over the latter three days. The distances that encompassed 98% recaptured T. dendrolimi adults (X-98) at the first three days was quadratically increased by the RWS of the daytime. (2) The number of wasps recaptured decreased with the distance from the releasing point during the first three days, but it was not influenced by the distance from the releasing point during the latter three days. (3) The average dispersal radius of the wasps during the first three days was shorter than during the latter three days. The present results will be helpful to improve release techniques based on the wind effects at different times.

TI  - Asymmetric Behavior of Vegetation Seasonal Growth and the Climatic Cause: Evidence from Long-Term NDVI Dataset in Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology is a response of vegetation to local climate and to climate change, leading to crucial impacts on plant growth rhythm and productivity. Differences in vegetation growth activities in earlier and latter parts of the growing season are tightly correlated to phenological changes and the temporal distribution of plant productivity. However, its spatiotemporal pattern and climatic constraints are poorly understood. For Northeast China (NEC), long-term remotely-sensed vegetation greenness records (NDVI) were employed to quantify seasonally asymmetrical characteristics of vegetation growth in detail, which consists of asymmetry in growing rate (AsyR), mean vegetation greenness (AsyV), and growing period length (AsyL) during vegetation green up and senescence stages (simply termed as spring and autumn). Furthermore, the impact of temperature and precipitation on these indices were examined using relative importance analysis. The results indicate these asymmetric metrics present a pronounced interannual variability profile with a potential cycle of ten years (significant in AsyV and AsyR) for the entire NEC. AsyV is changing synchronously with AsyL but asynchronously with AsyR. The geographical distribution of asymmetric indices shows a similar pattern to identified vegetation cover types, especially in distinguishing crops from natural vegetation. Spatial-averaged asymmetric indices indicate spring production is greater than autumn production (reflected by negative AsyV) across most vegetation types in NEC, yet autumn is longer than spring in all vegetation types, which is identified by positive AsyL. Negative AsyR is mainly found in forests implying there is rapid green up and slow senescence in trees. From a temporal perspective, AsyV decreases with time in forested regions but increases in cropland and grassland, which is similar to the pattern for AsyL. AsyR primarily exhibits a positive trend in forest and a negative trend in cropland and grassland. A relative importance analysis indicates that asymmetries of temperature (AsyTemp) and precipitation (AsyPrcp) play an equal role in significantly affecting vegetation asymmetries in greenness and growth rate but are insignificant to growing season length. AsyTemp mainly presents an obvious contribution to changes in AsyR and AsyV over cropland and grassland. AsyPrcp shows a more widespread controlling effect on AsyR and AsyV over the NEC, except in eastern broad-leaved forest. For the entire NEC, asymmetries of temperature and precipitation are negatively correlated with AsyR but are positively correlated with AsyV and AsyL. This finding may imply that a warmer (positive AsyTemp) autumn tends to improve the length and intensity of vegetation activity. Thus, the long-term change in vegetation growth asymmetries may provide insights for the altering functions of ecosystems and provide information to more accurately build plant growth models in the context of global climate change. Additionally, when combined with other information, asymmetric indices can serve as a supporting tool in classification of vegetation types.

TI  - Composite analysis of precipitation intensity and distribution characteristics of western track landfall typhoons over China under strong and weak monsoon conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, 34 western track typhoons making landfall over China during the period of 2006-2016 from Jun. to Oct. are taken as research objects. They are divided into strong and weak monsoon influenced categories according to the East Asian summer monsoon index. Using precipitation product that was derived from hourly precipitation observed at automatic weather stations (AWS) in China and retrievals from CMORPH (CPC (Climate Prediction Center) morphing technique] satellite data, Japanese 55-year Reanalysis products (JRA-55) and Blackbody brightness temperature (TBB) data from FengYun 2E (FY-2E) satellite, precipitation intensity and distribution characteristics of strong monsoon influenced typhoons. In addition, the weak monsoon influenced typhoons was compared through composite analysis. Furthermore, to explore the water vapor conditions, dynamic factors, thermal structure, development conditions of mesoscale convective systems, and long-term typhoon maintenance mechanisms of typhoons under both conditions. This research is attempted to obtain the regularity of influences exerted on typhoon precipitation intensity and distribution by summer monsoon, and the possible influencing mechanisms of summer monsoon on typhoon precipitation.Results show that the stronger (weaker) the monsoon flow is, the stronger (weaker) the precipitation intensity of post-landfall western typhoon. Monsoon provides a sufficient amount of water vapor through direct moisture channel. The stronger monsoon flow is, the more obvious the coupling of low-level convergence and upper-level divergence, and thus provides a stronger lifting for typhoon precipitation. A strong monsoon condition is more conducive to the genesis and development of mesoscale convection system. A strong monsoon condition is also favorable for the maintenance of post-landfall typhoon's warm core structure, thereby prolonging the precipitation through delaying the decay of typhoons. All these factors lead up to the influences on precipitation of typhoons by summer monsoon directly or indirectly.

TI  - HIGH FRAME RATE CONTRAST-ENHANCED ULTRASOUND IMAGING FOR SLOW LYMPHATIC FLOW: INFLUENCE OF ULTRASOUND PRESSURE AND FLOW RATE ON BUBBLE DISRUPTION AND IMAGE PERSISTENCE
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) utilising microbubbles shows great potential for visualising lymphatic vessels and identifying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) which are valuable for axillary staging in breast cancer patients. However, current CEUS imaging techniques have limitations that affect the accurate visualisation and tracking of lymphatic vessels and SLN. (i) Tissue artefacts and bubble disruption can reduce the image contrast. (ii) Limited spatial and temporal resolution diminishes the amount of information that can be captured by CEUS. (iii) The slow lymph flow makes Doppler-based approaches less effective. This work evaluates on a lymphatic vessel phantom the use of high frame rate (HFR) CEUS for the detection of lymphatic vessels where flow is slow. Specifically, the work particularly investigates the impact of key factors in lymphatic imaging, including ultrasound pressure and flow velocity as well as probe motion during vessel tracking, on bubble disruption and image contrast. Experiments were also conducted to apply HFR CEUS imaging on vasculature in a rabbit popliteal lymph node (LN). Our results show that (i) HFR imaging and singular value decomposition (SVD) filtering can significantly reduce tissue artefacts in the phantom at high clinical frequencies; (ii) the slow flow rate within the phantom makes image contrast and signal persistence more susceptible to changes in ultrasound amplitude or mechanical index (MI), and an MI value can be chosen to reach a compromise between images contrast and bubble disruption under slow flow condition; (iii) probe motion significantly decreases image contrast of the vessel, which can be improved by applying motion correction before SVD filtering; (iv) the optical observation of the impact of ultrasound pressure on HFR CEUS further confirms the importance of optimising ultrasound amplitude and (v) vessels inside rabbit LN with blood flow less than 3 mm/s are clearly visualised.

TI  - The impact of various HITRAN molecular spectroscopic databases on infrared radiative transfer simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-resolution transmission (HITRAN) database has been updated recently. Therefore, it is useful to analyze the effect of the updated data on radiative transfer calculations. This study identifies the impact of database updates that could affect climate models and satellite remote sensing applications. The fluxes and cooling rates of the longwave region are calculated by the line-by-line radiative transfer model based on the HITRAN08, HITRAN12 and HITRAN16 molecule spectroscopic databases under four typical atmospheric profiles. We show that the differences in cooling rates are mainly caused by the changes in the line parameters of H2O and CO2. The maximum difference in the upward fluxes at the top of the atmosphere between HITRAN08 and HITRAN16 is 0.6587 W m(-2), whereas that between HITRAN12 and HITRAN16 is only 0.0406 W m(-2), which is much smaller than the maximum difference between HITRAN08 and HITRAN16. Similar trends are also observed in the downward fluxes at the surface and cooling rates. Overall these differences are all less than the typical errors of radiative transfer schemes. On the contrary, we show that there are differences between the simulated brightness temperatures for the channels of hyperspectral measurements, such as FY-3D Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS), which are at least comparable to the noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of the corresponding channels. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the effect of using different HITRAN molecular spectroscopic databases in hyperspectral satellite remote sensing applications.

TI  - Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) Ionospheric Correction Based on Faraday Rotation: Two Case Studies
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is affected by the ionosphere, resulting in distortions of the SAR intensity, phase, and polarization. Although several methods have been proposed to mitigate the ionospheric phase delay of SAR interferometry, the application of them with full-polarimetric SAR interferometry is limited. Based on this background, Faraday rotation (FR)-based methods are used in this study to mitigate the ionospheric phase errors on full-polarimetric SAR interferometry. For a performance test of the selected method, L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) Phase Array L-band SAR (PALSAR) full-polarimetric SAR images over high-latitude and low-latitude regions are processed. The result shows that most long-wavelength ionospheric phase errors are removed from the original phase after using the FR-based method, where standard deviations of the corrected result have decreased by almost a factor of eight times for the high-latitude region and 28 times for low-latitude region, compared to those of the original phase, demonstrating the efficiency of the method. This result proves that the FR-based method not only can mitigate the ionospheric effect on SAR interferometry, but also can map the high-spatial-resolution vertical total electronic content (VTEC) distribution.

TI  - Remote Sensing-Based Analysis of Landscape Pattern Evolution in Industrial Rural Areas: A Case of Southern Jiangsu, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid economic development of industrial rural areas in Southern Jiangsu, the rural landscape and ecological environment of these industrial rural areas are getting damaged. Based on GIS and RS techniques, Landsat Satellite remote sensing images from 1981, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2018 were collected for Jiangyin, Zhangjiagang, Changshu and Kunshan, to extract landscape pattern indexes and spatial distribution data. Landscape pattern indexes of the patch-class level and landscape level from each year were calculated by FRAGSTATS. After analyzing and comparing landscape pattern variation of five years, progress, characteristics and driving forces of landscape pattern evolution were explored. At the patch-class level, construction land had continuously encroached on green and cultivated land, exhibiting trends of expansion and centralization. At the landscape level, the number of small patches and degree of landscape fragmentation generally increased. The direct cause of landscape pattern evolution in industrial rural areas of Southern Jiangsu was the encroachment and segmentation of green and cultivated land by construction land, and the dominant factors driving the changes in construction land in the industrial rural areas of Southern Jiangsu were the effects of land and population aggregation exerted by the development of township enterprises and rural industries.

TI  - Effects of data temporal resolution on phenology extractions from the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation phenology is a commonly used indicator signaling vegetation responses to global changes. Monitoring vegetation phenology at a regional and global scale needs to rely to remote sensing data, for which multiple sources of datasets and extraction methods have been developed. To be efficient, remote sensing data with coarse temporal resolution is conventionally preferred in exploring vegetation phenology patterns at the continental or global scale. As fine temporal resolution data is increasingly available, effects of their temporal resolution on our analysis are still elusive. In this study, we applied several commonly utilized vegetation phenology extraction methods on two different temporal resolution MODIS NDVI data and compared their performances on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The results showed there were certain discrepancies in the magnitude, trends and spatial patterns of extracted phenological parameters between the two datasets and among the different extraction methods. Generally, the phenological parameters derived from fine temporal resolution NDVI (MOD09A1) displayed later start of growing season (SOS), earlier end of growing season (EOS), shorter length of growing season (LOS), and were more accurate in capturing vegetation SOS compared with the coarse temporal resolution NDVI data (MOD13A2). The double logistic method can minimize the differences of extracted SOS or EOS between the two temporal resolution datasets. The findings of this study would improve accuracies of applying remote sensing data on monitoring vegetation dynamics and advance our understanding on vegetation responses to climate changes.

AB  - The free and open policy of Landsat data in 2008 completely changed the way that Landsat data was analyzed and used, particularly for applications such as time series analysis. Nine years later, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) released the first version of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for the United States, which was another milestone in Landsat history. The Landsat time series is so convenient and easy to use and has triggered science that was not possible a few decades ago. In this Editorial, we review the current status of Landsat ARD, introduce scientific studies of Landsat ARD from this special issue, and discuss global Landsat ARD.

TI  - Orogenic Gold in Transpression and Transtension Zones: Field and Remote Sensing Studies of the Barramiya-Mueilha Sector, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-sensor satellite imagery data promote fast, cost-efficient regional geological mapping that constantly forms a criterion for successful gold exploration programs in harsh and inaccessible regions. The Barramiya-Mueilha sector in the Central Eastern Desert of Egypt contains several occurrences of shear/fault-associated gold-bearing quartz veins with consistently simple mineralogy and narrow hydrothermal alteration haloes. Gold-quartz veins and zones of carbonate alteration and listvenitization are widespread along the ENE-WSW Barramiya-Um Salatit and Dungash-Mueilha shear belts. These belts are characterized by heterogeneous shear fabrics and asymmetrical or overturned folds. Sentinel-1, Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Sentinel-2 are used herein to explicate the regional structural control of gold mineralization in the Barramiya-Mueilha sector. Feature-oriented Principal Components Selection (FPCS) applied to polarized backscatter ratio images of Sentinel-1 and PALSAR datasets show appreciable capability in tracing along the strike of regional structures and identification of potential dilation loci. The principal component analysis (PCA), band combination and band ratioing techniques are applied to the multispectral ASTER and Sentinel-2 datasets for lithological and hydrothermal alteration mapping. Ophiolites, island arc rocks, and Fe-oxides/hydroxides (ferrugination) and carbonate alteration zones are discriminated by using the PCA technique. Results of the band ratioing technique showed gossan, carbonate, and hydroxyl mineral assemblages in ductile shear zones, whereas irregular ferrugination zones are locally identified in the brittle shear zones. Gold occurrences are confined to major zones of fold superimposition and transpression along flexural planes in the foliated ophiolite-island arc belts. In the granitoid-gabbroid terranes, gold-quartz veins are rather controlled by fault and brittle shear zones. The uneven distribution of gold occurrences coupled with the variable recrystallization of the auriferous quartz veins suggests multistage gold mineralization in the area. Analysis of the host structures assessed by the remote sensing results denotes vein formation spanning the time-space from early transpression to late orogen collapse during the protracted tectonic evolution of the belt.

TI  - Urban Expansion and the Loss of Prairie and Agricultural Lands: A Satellite Remote-Sensing-Based Analysis at a Sub-Watershed Scale
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prairies or grasslands together with areas designated as agricultural lands are one of the largest types of land cover and land use that exist today. While prairies provide habitat to a wide variety of animals and organisms, and agricultural lands support human populations, these lands, especially those in the immediate vicinities of large urban areas, are giving way to urbanization at alarming rates. In particular, prairies are often viewed as wastelands because their benefit to the effective functioning of the urban ecosystem is often not fully understood. On the other hand, many agricultural lands are being converted for several urban uses because of the high economic returns from their sale. In this study, we classified SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) satellite data of the study area using the supervised maximum likelihood classification approach in order to investigate the loss of prairies and agricultural lands due to urban expansion in six sub-watersheds in the Kansas City metropolitan area of the States of Kansas and Missouri in the U.S. Based on the classified maps, we computed the magnitude and rate of urban expansion, and the proportion of loss in prairies and agricultural lands that was a result of urban expansion. Results from the 22-year study revealed that in all six sub-watersheds, agricultural lands and grassland were depleted at alarming rates with no sustainable effort to conserve them. These results provide baseline information that can support a data-driven and sustainable path for urban expansion in the examined sub-watersheds.

TI  - Comparison Study of Laparoscopic Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in Endometrial Carcinoma Using Carbon Nanoparticles and Lymphatic Pathway Verification
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Objective: To evaluate the detection rate and accuracy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using cervical and fundal injections of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) in laparoscopic surgery of endometrioid endometrial cancer (EC) and to identify uterine lymphatic drainage pathways validated by mapping.Design: A prospective consecutive study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Setting: An academic research center.Patients: Consecutive patients with a pathologic diagnosis of early-stage EC scheduled for primary laparoscopic-assisted staging surgery (laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or comprehensive lymphadenectomy).Interventions: Enrolled patients underwent laparoscopic SLN mapping with a 50-mg CNP tracer injection. Fifty patients received fundal subserosal injections at 4 sites (the fundal group), whereas 65 patients received cervical submucosal injections at 2 sites (the cervical group). After SLN mapping, all patients underwent laparoscopic staging surgery.Measurements and Main Results: No allergic reactions to CNPs were observed in either group. The overall SLN detection rates were 100% and 92% in the cervical and fundal groups, and the bilateral SLN detection rates were 97% and 68% (p < .001), respectively. A total of 12 metastatic SLNs were accurately detected in 5 patients. The sensitivity of metastatic lymph node detection was 100% in the cervical group, which is higher than that in the fundal group (80%). The false-negative rates were 0% and 20%, respectively, in the cervical and fundal groups. Furthermore, we verified 3 uterine lymphatic pathways using the 2 injection methods. The upper paracervical pathway was the most common drainage pathway in both groups (91.4% in the cervical group vs 80.24% in the fundal group), whereas the infundibulopelvic pathway was observed only in the fundal group (15.11%).Conclusion: SLN mapping by CNPs in laparoscopic surgery for EC is a safe and effective alternative, with a higher detection rate and better accuracy with cervical injections than fundal injections. The upper paracervical pathway was the most common lymphatic pathway, whereas the infundibulopelvic pathway was only displayed in fundal injections. (C) 2018 AAGL. All rights reserved.

TI  - Monitoring shallow coastal environment using Landsat/altimetry data under rapid sea-level change
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caspian Sea (CS) is the largest enclosed inland body of water and eminent for its rapid sea-level change. From 1929 to 1955, rapid cyclic changes with amplitudes of 3 m led to the formation of large submerged and emerged areas. The present study seeks to incorporate multi-source sensor data such as the Landsat time-series data (i.e., MSS, TM, ETM+ and OLI) alongside radar altimetry products (i.e., TOPEX, Jason-1, OSTM, Jason-3) as a means for extracting morphological features (Gorgan Bay and Gomishan lagoon) of the southeastern shorelines of the Caspian Sea, as well as to investigate changes in the shoreline for a given period of 42 years (1975-2016). We also employ Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm as an automated method to extract shoreline change in shallow marine environments. Over the past century, the CS has experienced a lowstand in 1977 and a highstand in 1995. Despite an approximate 1.5 m drop in sea-level from 1995 to 2015, Gorgan Bay and Gomishan lagoon, with depths of 4.5 and 2.5 m, appear to have outlasted and emerged, respectively. PSO is a highly efficient method capable of defining shorelines and extracting water bodies. The surface area estimations using the PSO method are consistent with corresponding reference values, with an average error of 1.73% and a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.99). Differences between calculated and reference areas were mainly observed in muddy and swamp sectors of the study area. This study highlights the key role of satellite time-series in shoreline monitoring and management under rapid sea-level change conditions. Moreover, the study demonstrates the capabilities of the PSO algorithm as an automated and accurate method for shoreline detection.

AB  - Seasonal dynamics of snow cover is an essential area of research for hydrological modelling and water resource management. With the increased availability of remote sensing data, the timely information of the spatiotemporal distribution of snow cover is feasible at regular intervals. The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of pansharpening in the accuracy of snow cover change detection in mountainous regions using freely available Landsat-8 multispectral data. In mountainous regions at the medium resolution, the changes at the mountain ridges are seldom identified. The incorporation of pansharpening in the change detection framework facilitates an improvement in the snow cover change detection at the ridges. For pansharpening, the PanNet architecture based on convolutional neural networks was adopted. A study area around Dhundi in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India was selected for the analysis. The experiments were carried out using a subset of Landsat-8 multispectral data acquired in the autumn and the winter seasons of 2017 and 2018, respectively. An improvement of 0.184 and 0.267 in the kappa coefficient was observed for the overall changes in the snow cover and at the ridges, respectively, based on the results from the proposed approach.
