TI  - Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and HCHO over the East China Sea, using ship-based MAX-DOAS observations and comparison with OMI and OMPS satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, ship-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements were performed in the East China Sea (ECS) area in June 2017. The tropospheric slant column densities (SCDs) of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and formaldehyde (HCHO) were retrieved from the measured spectra using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) technique. Using the simple geometric approach, the SCDs of different trace gases observed at a 15 degrees elevation angle were adopted to convert into tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs). During this campaign, the averaged VCDs of NO2, SO2, and HCHO in the marine environment over the ECS area are 6.50 x 10(15), 4.28 x 10(15), and 7.39 x 10(15) molec cm(-2), respectively. In addition, the ship-based MAX-DOAS trace gas VCDs were compared with satellite observations of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS). The daily OMI NO2 VCDs agreed well with ship-based MAX-DOAS measurements showing the correlation coefficient R of 0.83. In addition, the good agreements of SO2 and HCHO VCDs between the OMPS satellite and ship-based MAX-DOAS observations were also found, with correlation coefficients R of 0.76 and 0.69. The vertical profiles of these trace gases are achieved from the measured differential slant column densities (DSCDs) at different elevation angles using the optimal estimation method. The retrieved profiles displayed the typical vertical distribution characteristics, which exhibit low concentrations of < 3, < 3, and < 2 ppbv for NO2, SO2, and HCHO in a clean area of the marine boundary layer far from coast of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) continental region. Interestingly, elevated SO2 concentrations can be observed intermittently along the ship routes, which is mainly attributed to the vicinal ship emissions in the view of the MAX-DOAS measurements. Combined with the on-board ozone lidar measurements, the ozone (O-3) formation was discussed with the vertical profile of the HCHO/NO2 ratio, which is sensitive to increases in NO2 concentration. This study provided further understanding of the main air pollutants in the marine boundary layer of the ECS area and also benefited the formulation of policies regulating the shipping emissions in such costal areas like the YRD region.

AB  - Nutrient sensing is a critical cell function that regulates survival and growth by adjusting metabolism. During nutrient shortage, autophagy enables the recycling of major cellular components to prevent cell death. Understanding the mechanisms that trigger and control autophagy is of fundamental importance, as this degradative pathway plays a pivotal role in many diseases. Gubbiotti et al. report the identification of a new player, the proteoglycan decorin, which functions as a nutrient sensor in the extracellular matrix and controls autophagy in the heart.

TI  - Assessing the dynamics of vegetation productivity in circumpolar regions with different satellite indicators of greenness and photosynthesis
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High-latitude treeless ecosystems represent spatially highly heterogeneous landscapes with small net carbon fluxes and a short growing season. Reliable observations and process understanding are critical for projections of the carbon balance of the climate-sensitive tundra. Space-borne remote sensing is the only tool to obtain spatially continuous and temporally resolved information on vegetation greenness and activity in remote circumpolar areas. However, confounding effects from persistent clouds, low sun elevation angles, numerous lakes, widespread surface inundation, and the sparseness of the vegetation render it highly challenging. Here, we conduct an extensive analysis of the timing of peak vegetation productivity as shown by satellite observations of complementary indicators of plant greenness and photosynthesis. We choose to focus on productivity during the peak of the growing season, as it importantly affects the total annual carbon uptake. The suite of indicators are as follows: (1) MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) as proxies for the fraction of incident photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) that is absorbed (fPAR), (2) VIs combined with estimates of PAR as a proxy of the total absorbed radiation (APAR), (3) sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) serving as a proxy for photosynthesis, (4) vegetation optical depth (VOD), indicative of total water content and (5) empirically upscaled modelled gross primary productivity (GPP). Averaged over the pan-Arctic we find a clear order of the annual peak as APAR <= GPP < SIF < VIs/VOD. SIF as an indicator of photosynthesis is maximised around the time of highest annual temperatures. The modelled GPP peaks at a similar time to APAR. The time lag of the annual peak between APAR and instantaneous SIF fluxes indicates that the SIF data do contain information on light-use efficiency of tundra vegetation, but further detailed studies are necessary to verify this. Delayed peak greenness compared to peak photosynthesis is consistently found across years and land-cover classes. A particularly late peak of the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in regions with very small seasonality in greenness and a high amount of lakes probably originates from artefacts. Given the very short growing season in circumpolar areas, the average time difference in maximum annual photosynthetic activity and greenness or growth of 3 to 25 days (depending on the data sets chosen) is important and needs to be considered when using satellite observations as drivers in vegetation models.

TI  - MASK 2017: ARIA digitally-enabled, integrated, person-centred care for rhinitis and asthma multimorbidity using real-world-evidence
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - mHealth, such as apps running on consumer smart devices is becoming increasingly popular and has the potential to profoundly affect healthcare and health outcomes. However, it may be disruptive and results achieved are not always reaching the goals. Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) has evolved from a guideline using the best evidence-based approach to care pathways suited to real-life using mobile technology in allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma multimorbidity. Patients largely use over-the-counter medications dispensed in pharmacies. Shared decision making centered around the patient and based on self-management should be the norm. Mobile Airways Sentinel networK (MASK), the Phase 3 ARIA initiative, is based on the freely available MASK app (the Allergy Diary, Android and iOS platforms). MASK is available in 16 languages and deployed in 23 countries. The present paper provides an overview of the methods used in MASK and the key results obtained to date. These include a novel phenotypic characterization of the patients, confirmation of the impact of allergic rhinitis on work productivity and treatment patterns in real life. Most patients appear to self-medicate, are often non-adherent and do not follow guidelines. Moreover, the Allergy Diary is able to distinguish between AR medications. The potential usefulness of MASK will be further explored by POLLAR (Impact of Air Pollution on Asthma and Rhinitis), a new Horizon 2020 project using the Allergy Diary.

TI  - Evaluation of NO<sub>2</sub> column variations over the atmosphere of Kazakhstan using satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric NO2 concentrations obtained from the measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board the NASA Aura satellite from 2005 to 2016 were studied to identify major NO(2 )emission hot spots, trends, and seasonal variations over Kazakhstan. Emission hot spots are observed over the locations of thermal power plants (Ekibastuz) and major urban and industrial regions (Almaty and Shymkent), as well as the capital city (Astana). Some decreasing trends have been observed for NO(2 )over Ekibastuz, whereas the regions of Almaty and Shymkent showed increasing trends due to industrial growth. The seasonal pattern of the NO2 concentration shows a difference between three industrial cities of Almaty, Shymkent, and Ekibastuz versus the rest of Kazakhstan. In these three cities, a NO2 maximum is found during wintertime, which we attribute to seasonality of emissions associated with electricity production and the longer chemical lifetime ofNO(2) in winter. In contrast, in Astana and the rest of Kazakhstan, the NO2 concentration reaches a maximum in the summer. (C) 2018 Society of Photo Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Yamagata Banto: An Atheist in the Tokugawa Period
T2  - SECULARISM & NONRELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper will discuss the atheistic thought of Yamagata Banto (1748-1821). The general concept of atheism will also be discussed. The term "atheism" is often used only in the Western sense; as such, existing studies of atheism in Japan only focus on modern intellectuals who were influenced by Western atheism. But the merchant-scholar Yamagata Banto, who lived in the Japanese Tokugawa period (1603-1868), can also be classified as an atheist. In his Yume no shiro, Banto denies any belief in supernatural beings by adopting a rationalistic worldview and criticizing religions from philological, historical, and rationalistic perspectives. According to Banto, gods were a "skillful means" created by humans for the purpose of guaranteeing peaceful governance. While belief in gods had become commonplace over time, Banto believed it was impossible to govern contemporary society according to such simple beliefs. He claimed that there was no further need to worship gods. However, he did not deny every form of worship, as he approved of worship that acknowledged obligations to ancestors or ancient sages. Banto, therefore, showed the way toward a moral life understood from a humanistic standpoint. Banto's "no gods" argument was influenced by Western science and Neo-Confucianism. However, because his view was considered reactionary by the Shintoist government, Banto is little known among modern intellectuals. A study of Banto will, therefore, make a useful contribution to scholarly knowledge of the universal category of "atheism" and its relevance to local differences in atheistic thought.

T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: When influenza vaccination is ineffective in preventing influenza virus infection, it may still reduce the severity of influenza-associated disease. Here, we estimate the effect of influenza vaccination in preventing severe outcomes e.g. intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, even though it did not prevent influenza virus infection and subsequent hospitalisation. Methods: An observational case-case epidemiological study was carried out in 12 sentinel hospitals in Catalonia (Spain) over six influenza seasons 2010/11-2015/16. Cases were individuals with severe laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection and aged 18 years and older. For each reported case we collected demographic, virological and clinical characteristics. Logistic regression was used to estimate the crude, adjusted odd ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Of 1,727 hospitalised patients included in the study, 799 were female (46.7%), 59 1 (34.2%) were admitted to the ICU and 223 (12.9%) died. Influenza vaccination uptake was lower in cases that required ICU admission or died (21.2% vs 29.7%, p < 0.001). The adjusted influenza vaccination effectiveness in preventing ICU admission or death was 23% (95% CI: 1 to 40). In an analysis restricted to sex, age group and antiviral treatment, influenza vaccination had a positive effect on disease severity in all age groups and categories. Conclusions: We found that influenza vaccination reduced the severity of disease even in cases where it did not prevent infection and influenza-associated hospitalisation. Therefore, increased vaccination uptake may reduce complications, ICU admission and death.

TI  - Cultural beliefs of time orientation and social self-construal: Influences on climate change adaptation
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the greatest challenges humankind faces and adaptive behaviour is an imperative response to such change. Culture and the resulting worldview are determinants of behaviour and eminent cultural beliefs are that of time orientation (TO) and social self-construal (SSC). To date, no research focuses on these beliefs from an indigenous South African perspective or the manner in which it may subsequently affect a community's adaptation towards climate change. Q-methodology was used to study perspectives and beliefs in three per!-urban communities in South Africa and to investigate the interrelation between themes such as TO, SSC, climate change awareness and climate change causality. It became apparent that the communities are aware of climate change, yet little to no efforts are currently being made to adapt to climatic change. This absence of motivation to adapt may be attributed to limited risk perception and cultural beliefs of TO and SSC. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of cultural beliefs and its impact on climate change adaptation behaviour in the South African context. It is concluded that TO and SSC from an indigenous South African perspective influence community adaptation to climate change.

TI  - Application of MODIS land surface temperature data: a systematic literature review and analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, which provides a very high temporal (four times per day) and spatial (1 km) resolution, has become one of the most important and widely used sensors for a broad range of applications. We analyze 529 articles from 159 journals in the Scopus database from 2009 to 2018 to understand the global and longitudinal trends of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data applications. The results show that the publications of papers related to MODIS LST data have been steadily rising annually. They spanned 19 subject areas from environmental, agricultural, and biological science to social science and medicine, indicating a wide range of MODIS LST data applications. Among the 159 journals, Remote Sensing of Environment, Remote Sensing, and the International Journal of Remote Sensing published the most articles. The study also showed that urban heat island (UHI), air temperature estimation/mapping (Ta estimation), soil moisture, evapotranspiration estimation, and drought monitoring/estimation were the most popular applications of MODIS LST data. Furthermore, we discuss the strengths, limitations, and future direction of research using MODIS LST data. (c) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

T2  - ORNITOLOGIA NEOTROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are habitats where water plays a fundamental role in the structuring of ecosystems and population dynamics. In the south of Mendoza (Argentina), the Llancanelo lagoon constitutes a Ramsar site of continental importance and hosts a great diversity of birds, the Chilean Flamingo (Phoenicopterus chilensis) being particularly abundant. The monitoring of species, in the long term, and its link with the hydrological variability in wetlands is essential to develop strategies for the protection and management of wildlife and its environment. Here we evaluated the relationship between abundance and breeding of the Chilean Flamingo with the variations of Llancanelo lagoon size, defined as the surface covered by water. The size of the lagoon was estimated from an index applied to Landsat images, the MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index), from 1987 to 2016. The available information allowed a 30-year analysis of data on the abundance of flamingos and breeding events. The results show that breeding colonies are established when there are large concentrations of individuals. The abundance of flamingos and the water surface area have a positive and linear relationship up to a lake size of 80 km(2). Beyond this threshold, if the area of the wetland increases, the number of individuals decreases significantly. Long-term monitoring can complement the management of water resources in the upper reaches of the basin and the conservation of Chilean Flamingos in the Llancanelo lagoon.

TI  - Large simulated radiative effects of smoke in the south-east Atlantic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A 1200 x 1200 km(2) area of the tropical South Atlantic Ocean near Ascension Island is studied with the HadGEM climate model at convection-permitting and global resolutions for a 10-day case study period in August 2016. During the simulation period, a plume of biomass burning smoke from Africa moves into the area and mixes into the clouds. At Ascension Island, this smoke episode was the strongest of the 2016 fire season. The region of interest is simulated at 4 km resolution, with no parameterised convection scheme. The simulations are driven by, and compared to, the global model. For the first time, the UK Chemistry and Aerosol model (UKCA) is included in a regional model with prognostic aerosol number concentrations advecting in from the global model at the boundaries of the region. Fire emissions increase the total aerosol burden by a factor of 3.7 and cloud droplet number concentrations by a factor of 3, which is consistent with MODIS observations. In the regional model, the inversion height is reduced by up to 200m when smoke is included. The smoke also affects precipitation, to an extent which depends on the model microphysics. The microphysical and dynamical changes lead to an increase in liquid water path of 60gm(-2) relative to a simulation without smoke aerosol, when averaged over the polluted period. This increase is uncertain, and smaller in the global model. It is mostly due to radiatively driven dynamical changes rather than precipitation suppression by aerosol. Over the 5-day polluted period, the smoke has substantial direct radiative effects of +11.4Wm(-2) in the regional model, a semi-direct effect of -30.5 Wm(-2) and an indirect effect of -10.1Wm(-2). Our results show that the radiative effects are sensitive to the structure of the model (global versus regional) and the parameterization of rain autoconversion. Furthermore, we simulate a liquid water path that is bi-ased high compared to satellite observations by 22% on average, and this leads to high estimates of the domain-averaged aerosol direct effect and the effect of the aerosol on cloud albedo. With these caveats, we simulate a large net cooling across the region, of -27.6Wm(-2).

TI  - Supervised spatial classification of multispectral LiDAR data in urban areas
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data have been initially used for land cover classification. However, there are still high classification uncertainties, especially in urban areas, where objects are often mixed and confounded. This study investigated the efficiency of combining advanced statistical methods and LiDAR metrics derived from multispectral LiDAR data for improving land cover classification accuracy in urban areas. The study area is located in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada, on the Lake Ontario shoreline. Multispectral Optech Titan LiDAR data over the study area were acquired on 3 September 2014 in a single strip of 3 km(2). Using the channels at 1,550 nm (C1), 1,064 nm (C2) and 532 nm (C3), LiDAR intensity data, normalized digital surface model (nDSM), pseudo normalized difference vegetation index (PseudoNDVI), morphological profiles (MP), and a novel hierarchical morphological profiles (HMP) were derived and used as features for the classification. A support vector machine classifier with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel was applied in the classification stage, where the optimal parameters for the classifier were selected by a grid search procedure. The combination of intensity, pseudoNDVI, nDSM and HMP resulted in the best land cover classification, with an overall accuracy of 93.28%.

TI  - A 12-year long global record of optical depth of absorbing aerosols above the clouds derived from the OMI/OMACA algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interaction continues to be one of the leading uncertain components of climate models, primarily due to the lack of adequate knowledge of the complex microphysical and radiative processes of the aerosol-cloud system. Situations when light-absorbing aerosols such as carbonaceous particles and windblown dust overlay low-level cloud decks are commonly found in several regions of the world. Contrary to the known cooling effects of these aerosols in cloud-free scenario over darker surfaces, an overlapping situation of the absorbing aerosols over the cloud can lead to a significant level of atmospheric absorption exerting a positive radiative forcing (warming) at the top of the atmosphere. We contribute to this topic by introducing a new global product of above-cloud aerosol optical depth (ACAOD) of absorbing aerosols retrieved from the near-UV observations made by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA's Aura platform. Physically based on an unambiguous "color ratio" effect in the near-UV caused by the aerosol absorption above the cloud, the OMACA (OMI above-cloud aerosols) algorithm simultaneously retrieves the optical depths of aerosols and clouds under a prescribed state of the atmosphere. The OMACA algorithm shares many similarities with the two-channel cloud-free OMAERUV algorithm, including the use of AIRS carbon monoxide for aerosol type identification, CALIOP-based aerosol layer height dataset, and an OMI-based surface albedo database. We present the algorithm architecture, inversion procedure, retrieval quality flags, initial validation results, and results from a 12-year long OMI record (2005-2016) including global climatology of the frequency of occurrence, ACAOD, and aerosol-corrected cloud optical depth. A comparative analysis of the OMACA-retrieved ACAOD, collocated with equivalent accurate measurements from the HSRL-2 lidar for the ORA-CLES Phase I operation (August-September 2016), revealed a good agreement (R = 0.77, RMSE = 0.10). The long-term OMACA record reveals several important regions of the world, where the carbonaceous aerosols from the seasonal biomass burning and mineral dust originated over the continents are found to overlie low-level cloud decks with moderate (0.3 < ACAOD < 0.5, away from the sources) to higher levels of ACAOD (> 0.8 in the proximity to the sources), including the southeastern Atlantic Ocean, southern Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, the tropical Atlantic Ocean off the coast of western Africa, and northern Arabian sea. No significant long-term trend in the frequency of occurrence of aerosols above the clouds and ACAOD is noticed when OMI observations that are free from the "row anomaly" throughout the operation are considered. If not accounted for, the effects of aerosol absorption above the clouds introduce low bias in the retrieval of cloud optical depth with a profound impact on increasing ACAOD and cloud brightness. The OMACA aerosol product from OMI presented in this paper offers a crucial missing piece of information from the aerosol loading above cloud that will help us to quantify the radiative effects of clouds when overlaid with aerosols and their resultant impact on cloud properties and climate.

TI  - Understanding the mismatch between behaviour and development in a novel host-parasitoid association
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Foraging parasitoid females should preferentially oviposit on hosts most suitable for progeny development to maximize their fitness. However, the introduction of a new host species may disrupt the link between the reliability of the cues and the expected adaptive outcome of female choice, leading to an evolutionary trap. This mismatch between behavioural acceptance and lack of development exists for North American and European egg parasitoids (Scelionidae) that encounter invasive Halyomorpha halys in areas where this exotic host has recently established. To explain this mismatch, we utilized an L9 orthogonal array design to assess and rank the influence of several critical factors characterizing host resource (host species, egg age, egg status, and surface wash) on behaviour (acceptance, patch residence and patch exploitation) and development of North American native Trissolcus euschisti egg parasitoid. Our results indicate that the host egg age is most important for behaviour, but is least influential for development of the progeny. This study suggests that the maladaptive decision to oviposit in an unsuitable host is due to a mismatch between the cues that females use, and the subsequent expected outcome of this choice. Therefore, it is the relative importance of individual factors when assessed simultaneously that influences the decision-making of female parasitoids.

TI  - Variations in the reproductive strategies of three populations of <i>Phrynocephalus helioscopus</i> in China
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Egg size and clutch size are key life history traits. During the breeding period, it is possible for females to increase their reproductive output either by increasing the number of eggs if the optimal egg size (OES) is maintained, or by increasing the allocation of energy to each egg. However, the strategies adopted are often influenced by animals' morphology and environment.Methods. Here, we examined variation in female morphological and reproductive traits, tested for trade-offs between egg size and clutch size, and evaluated the relationship between egg size and female morphology in three populations of Phrynocephalus helioscopus.Results. Female body size, egg size, and clutch size were larger in the Yi Ning (YN) and Fu Yun (FY) populations than in the Bei Tun (BT) population (the FY and YN populations laid more, and rounder eggs). Egg size was independent of female body size in two populations (BT and FY), even though both populations had an egg-size/clutch size trade-off. In the YN population, egg size and clutch size were independent, but egg size was correlated with female body size, consistent with the hypothesis of morphological constraint.Conclusions. Our study found geographical variation in body size and reproductive strategies of P. helioscopus. Egg size was correlated with morphology in the larger-bodied females of the YN population, but not in the smaller-bodied females of the BT population, illustrating that constraints on female body size and egg size are not consistent between populations.

TI  - Averaging bias correction for the future space-borne methane IPDA lidar mission MERLIN
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The CNES (French Space Agency) and DLR (German Space Agency) project MERLIN is a future integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar satellite mission that aims at measuring methane dry-air mixing ratio columns (X-CH4) in order to improve surface flux estimates of this key greenhouse gas. To reach a 1% relative random error on X-CH4 measurements, MERLIN signal processing performs an averaging of data over 50 km along the satellite trajectory. This article discusses how to process this horizontal averaging in order to avoid the bias caused by the non-linearity of the measurement equation and measurements affected by random noise and horizontal geophysical variability. Three averaging schemes are presented: averaging of columns of X-CH4, averaging of columns of differential absorption optical depth (DAOD) and averaging of signals. The three schemes are affected both by statistical and geophysical biases that are discussed and compared, and correction algorithms are developed for the three schemes. These algorithms are tested and their biases are compared on modelled scenes from real satellite data. To achieve the accuracy requirements that are limited to 0.2% relative systematic error (for a reference value of 1780 ppb), we recommend performing the averaging of signals corrected from the statistical bias due to the measurement noise and from the geophysical bias mainly due to variations of methane optical depth and surface reflectivity along the averaging track. The proposed method is compliant with the mission relative systematic error requirements dedicated to averaging algorithms of 0.06% (+/- 1 ppb for X-CH4 = 1780ppb) for all tested scenes and all tested ground reflectivity values.

TI  - Remote sensing classification method of vegetation dynamics based on time series Landsat image: a case of opencast mining area in China
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series remote sensing image is an important resource for dynamic monitoring of resources and environment, and its abundant time spectrum information can be used to characterize the dynamic change of vegetation coverage. This paper proposes a comprehensive clustering and pixel classification method for extracting the vegetation dynamics based on time series Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This method uses the time-division algorithm for fitting time-series NDVI firstly. And the Markov random field optimized (MRF) semi-supervised dynamic time warping (DTW) kernel fuzzy c-means clustering was constructed. Then the MRF-optimized semi-supervised DTW-kernel fuzzy c-means clustering was combined with the 1-nearest neighbor (1NN) DTW pixel classification to realize the extraction of vegetation dynamics. Shengli Opencast Coal Mine in The Xilin Gol Grassland was taken as the study area to analyze the applicability of the different classification methods. The results showed the fusion algorithm of the MRF-Semi-GDTW-FCM and 1NN-DTW generates accurate classification results with the overall accuracy of 93.8806% and Kappa coefficient of 0.9267, which were 1.7219, 0.0182, and 20.4080% and 0.2916 higher than the clustering and pixel classification, respectively. Experiments proof that the method proposed in this paper is not only simple but also accurate and effective.

TI  - Using insects to detect, monitor and predict the distribution of <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>: a case study in Corsica
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We sampled ca 2500 specimens of Philaenus spumarius (Hemiptera: Aphrophoridae) throughout Corsica without a priori knowledge on the presence of symptoms on plants. We screened 448 specimens for the presence of Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) using qPCR and a custom nested PCR. qPCR appeared versatile and under-estimated the prevalence of Xf. Nested PCR showed that Xf was present in all populations. Molecular results were validated by prediction on the distribution of Xf made from tests conducted on plants, which shows the pertinence of using vectors in risk assessment studies. Xf was detected in tenerals and adults. Thus, P. spumarius could acquire Xf from its host plant, mostly Cistus monspeliensis in Corsica, which may act as reservoir for the next season. This contrasts with other observations and suggests that management strategies may have to be adapted on a case-by-case basis. At least two genetic entities and several variants of Xf not yet identified on plants were present in the insects, which suggests ancient introductions of Xf and a probable underestimation of the current diversity of the strains present in Corsica. Interestingly 6% of the specimens carried two subspecies of Xf. Studies are required to better characterize the strains present in Corsica and to determine how the disease was introduced, spread and why no sign of a potential epidemic was detected earlier. This study shows that, when sensitive enough methods are implemented, spittlebugs (and more specifically P. spumarius for which species distribution modelling shows it could be a good sentinel for Europe) can be used to predict and better assess the exact distribution of Xf. Furthermore, Xf multiply only in their foregut and does not become circulative, which facilitates its detection.

TI  - The FengYun-3C radio occultation sounder GNOS: a review of the mission and its early results and science applications
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Occultation Sounder (GNOS) is one of the new-generation payloads on board the Chinese FengYun 3 (FY-3) series of operational meteorological satellites for sounding the Earth's neutral atmosphere and ionosphere. FY-3C GNOS, on board the FY-3 series C satellite launched in September 2013, was designed to acquire setting and rising radio occultation (RO) data by using GNSS signals from both the Chinese BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) and the US Global Positioning System (GPS). So far, the GNOS measurements and atmospheric and ionospheric data products have been validated and evaluated and then been used for atmosphere-and ionosphere-related scientific applications.This paper reviews the FY-3C GNOS instrument, RO data processing, data quality evaluation, and preliminary research applications according to the state-of-the-art status of the FY-3C GNOS mission and related publications. The reviewed data validation and application results demonstrate that the FY-3C GNOS mission can provide accurate and precise atmospheric and ionospheric GNSS (i.e., GPS and BDS) RO profiles for numerical weather prediction (NWP), global climate monitoring (GCM), and space weather research (SWR). The performance of the FY-3C GNOS product quality evaluation and scientific applications establishes confidence that the GNOS data from the series of FY-3 satellites will provide important contributions to NWP, GCM, and SWR scientific communities.

TI  - Projections of the future disappearance of the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Central Andes
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the future state of Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC), the world's largest tropical ice cap with a summit elevation of 5680 m a.s.l., which, in terms of its elevation range (similar to 5300-5680 m a.s.l.), is representative of many low-elevation glacierized sites in the tropical Andes. CMIP5 model projections of air temperature (Ta) at QIC indicate a warming of about 2.4 degrees C and 5.4 degrees C (respectively) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios by the end of the 21st century, resulting in a pronounced increase in freezing level height (FLH). The impact of this warming on the QIC was quantified using equilibrium-line altitude (ELA) projections. The change in the ELA was quantified based on an empirical ELA-FLH relationship, and calibrated with observations of the highest annual snowline altitude (SLA) derived from LANDSAT data. Results show that from the mid-2050s onwards, the ELA will be located above the QIC summit in the RCP8.5 scenario. At that time, surface mass balance at QIC and most tropical glaciers at similar elevations will become increasingly negative, leading to their eventual complete disappearance. Our analysis further corroborates that elevation-dependent warming (EDW) contributes significantly to the enhanced warming over the QIC, and that EDW at Quelccaya depends on the rate of anthropogenic forcing.

TI  - Association between a vegetarian diet and emotional symptoms: a cross-sectional study among adolescents in four developing countries.
T2  - International journal of adolescent medicine and health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the association between vegetarianism and mental health have found divergent results. Evidence from adolescents in developing countries is scarce.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between a vegetarian diet and emotional symptoms in 15-year-old adolescents from Ethiopia, India, Peru and Vietnam.METHODS: A cross-sectional, secondary analysis of the Young Lives cohort study was used. The exposure variable was the self-report of being a vegetarian (yes or no). The outcome was the level of emotional symptoms, numerically evaluated using the score obtained in the subscale "Emotional Symptoms" of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). We calculated crude and adjusted coefficients (beta) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), using generalized linear models of the Gaussian family, considering each sentinel site as a cluster. The analysis was stratified by country. Additionally, we made a global analysis including the four countries.RESULTS: A total of 3484 adolescents were analyzed. The overall prevalence of vegetarianism was 4.4%, but it varied between countries (from 0.4% in Vietnam to 11.5% in India). The average emotional symptoms score was 3.5 [standard deviation (SD) 2.3] points. The scores were not statistically different between vegetarians and non-vegetarians (p > 0.05). In the adjusted analysis, in Vietnam, vegetarians had lower emotional symptoms scores on average than non-vegetarians [beta: -1.79; 95% CI: -3.05 to -0.55]. No differences were found neither in the other countries nor in the overall sample.CONCLUSION: There was no association between a vegetarian diet and emotional symptoms in the analyzed adolescents of four developing countries.

TI  - Strong downdrafts preceding rapid tropopause ascent and their potential to identify cross-tropopause stratospheric intrusions
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The capability of measuring three-dimensional wind and tropopause structure with relatively high time and vertical resolution makes very-high-frequency (VHF) radars a potentially important tool for studying various processes of the atmosphere. However, at present several unanswered questions remain regarding the use of VHF radars to identify possible stratospheric intrusions. Here the potential detection of stratospheric intrusion events is discussed using the Beijing MST (mesosphere-stratosphere- troposphere) radar located at Xianghe (39.75 degrees N, 116.96 degrees E). During the passage of a cutoff low in late November 2014, a deep V-shaped tropopause structure and strong downdrafts (> 0.8 m s(-1)) immediately preceding the rapid tropopause ascent (> 0.2 km h(-1)) were observed. Within the height region of the downdrafts, the stability of the radar tropopause seems to be weakened. Analysis results from global reanalysis and the satellite data, as well as the trajectory model, have shown clear evidence of downward stratospheric intrusions (dry ozone-rich and depleted methane air) associated with the strong downdrafts. A total of 20 typical cases of such strong downdrafts, occurring during various synoptic processes in different seasons, have been presented, and 15 of them are exactly associated with some form of stratospheric intrusions. Four years (2012-2015) of such downdrafts are further discussed. The observations reveal that the strong downdrafts preceding the rapid tropopause ascent can be a valuable diagnostic for monitoring intrusion events, which helps us to gain a better understanding of stratospheric intrusions in VHF radar observations.

TI  - Generalized IHS-BT framework for the pansharpening of high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion is an important technique for enhancing the spatial resolution of multispectral imagery by merging with a corresponding high-resolution panchromatic image. Many algorithms have been developed to obtain a better trade-off between spectral fidelity and spatial resolution enhancement. The recently developed techniques use sophisticated algorithms; however, three issues are often ignored. The first involves the progressively increasing amount of high-resolution satellite image data. Second, the designed method needs to be versatile to process a variety of complex terrain and surface features. The third is that the proposed method must satisfy the requirements of both visual inspection and classification. Based on the previous studies, this work proposes a generalized intensity-hue-saturation and Brovey transform framework (GF) to tackle these three problems. Eight modules are integrated into this GF: four modules are designed for classification with a new intensity matching technique to improve the spectral quality; the other four modules are the spatial-enhancement version for visual inspection by adding more native spatial details. To verify the proposed technique, the experiments are conducted for QuickBird and WorldView-2 images. The results show that the GF modules can offer the maximal spatial information content while preserving good spectral information quality.

TI  - Estimation of Horizontal Eddy Heat Flux in Upper Mixed-Layer in the South China Sea by Using Satellite Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the horizontal eddy heat flux in the upper mixed-layer in the South China Sea (SCS) is derived from satellite-derived observational data of sea surface height anomalies and optimally interpolated sea surface temperature, as well as a reanalysis dataset of mixed-layer depth. The long-term heat flux shows a northward transport on the west side of the SCS, comparable with that in the Kuroshio extension with strong eddy activities. The eddy flux in the SCS has a prominent semi-annual cycle and becomes the strongest in winter and summer with the inflow flux in the south and the outflow in the northwest into the East China Sea through the Taiwan Strait. The semi-annual cycle is related to the strong semi-annul variabilities of the velocity and the temperature in areas southeast of Vietnam and in the northern SCS, respectively. In some areas of the SCS, the eddy heat flux can reach more than similar to 60% of the mean flow heat flux. The convergence of the eddy flux indicates that heat accumulates southeast of Vietnam, which may result in heat storage increases in the upper mixed-layer.

We quantified this considerable variability and analyzed whether recent disturbance episodes around the globe were consistently driven by climate, and if human influence modulates patterns of forest disturbance. We combined remote sensing data on recent (2001-2014) disturbances with in-depth local information for 50 protected landscapes and their surroundings across the temperate biome. Disturbance patterns are highly variable, and shaped by variation in disturbance agents and traits of prevailing tree species. However, high disturbance activity is consistently linked to warmer and drier than average conditions across the globe. Disturbances in protected areas are smaller and more complex in shape compared to their surroundings affected by human land use. This signal disappears in areas with high recent natural disturbance activity, underlining the potential of climate-mediated disturbance to transform forest landscapes.

TI  - The biomass-density relationship in seagrasses and its use as an ecological indicator
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundBiomass-density relations have been at the centre of a search for an index which describes the health of seagrass meadows. However, this search has been complicated by the intricacy of seagrass demographics and their complex biomass-density relations, a consequence mainly of their modular growth and clonality. Concomitantly, biomass-density upper boundaries have been determined for terrestrial plants and algae, reflecting their asymptotic maximum efficiencies of space occupation. Each stand's distance to its respective biomass-density upper boundary reflects its effective efficiency in packing biomass, which has proved a reliable ecological indicator in order to discriminate between taxonomic groups, functional groups and clonal vs. non-clonal growth.ResultsWe gathered data from 32 studies on 10 seagrass species distributed worldwide and demonstrated that seagrasses are limited by their own boundary line, placed below the boundaries previously determined for algae and terrestrial plants. Then, we applied a new metricd(grass): each stand's perpendicular distance to the seagrass boundaryand used this parameter to review fundamental aspects such as clonal growth patterns, depth distribution, seasonality, interspecific competition, and the effects of light, temperature and nutrients.ConclusionsSeagrasses occupy space less efficiently than algae and terrestrial plants. Using only their biomass and density data we established a new and efficient tool to describe space occupation by seagrasses. This was used with success to evaluate their meadows as an ecological indicator for the health of coastal ecosystems.

TI  - The impact of protected area governance and management capacity on ecosystem function in Central America
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) are a prominent approach to maintaining and enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. A critical question for safeguarding these resources is how PA governance processes and management structures influence their effectiveness. We conduct an impact evaluation of 12 PAs in three Central American countries to assess how processes in management restrictions, management capacity, and decentralization affect the annual change in the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI varies with greenness that relates to plant production, biomass, and important ecosystem functions related to biodiversity and ecosystem services such as water quality and carbon storage. Any loss of vegetation cover in the form of deforestation or degradation would show up as a decrease in NDVI values over time and gains in vegetation cover and regeneration as an increase in NDVI values. Management restriction categories are based on international classifications of strict versus multiple-use PAs, and capacity and decentralization categories are based on key informant interviews of PA managers. We use matching to create a counterfactual of non-protected observations and a matching estimator and regression to estimate treatment effects of each sub-sample. On average, strict and multiple-use PAs have a significant and positive effect on NDVI compared to non-protected land uses. Both high and low decentralized PAs also positively affect NDVI. High capacity PAs have a positive and significant effect on NDVI, while low capacity PAs have a negative effect on NDVI. Our findings advance knowledge on how governance and management influence PA effectiveness and suggest that capacity may be more important than governance type or management restrictions in maintaining and enhancing NDVI. This paper also provides a guide for future studies to incorporate measures of PA governance and management into impact evaluations.

TI  - Estimating fire severity and carbon emissions over Australian tropical savannahs based on passive microwave satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the use of a recently developed satellite-based vegetation optical depth (VOD) data set to estimate fire severity and carbon emission over Australian tropical savannahs. VOD is sensitive to the dynamics of all aboveground vegetation and available nearly every two days. For areas burned during 2003-2010, we calculated the VOD change (Delta VOD) pre- and post-fire and the associated loss in the above ground biomass carbon. Delta VOD agreed well with the Normalized Burn Ratio change (Delta NBR) which is the metric used to estimate fire severity and carbon loss compared well with modelled emissions from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED). We found that the Delta VOD and Delta NBR are generally linearly related. The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between VOD- and GFED-based fire carbon emissions for monthly and annual total estimates are very high, 0.92 and 0.96, respectively. A key feature of fire carbon emissions is the strong inter-annual variation, ranging from 21.1 Mt in 2010 to 84.3 Mt in 2004. This study demonstrates that a reasonable estimate of fire severity and carbon emissions can be achieved in a timely manner based on multiple satellite observations over Australian tropical savannahs, which can be complementary to the currently used approaches.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of snow cover on Tibet, China using MODIS remote-sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an important component of the cryosphere, and the study on spatial and temporal variations of snow cover is essential for understanding the consequences and impacts of climate change and water resources management. In this study, the temporal variation of snow-covered area (SCA) and spatial variability of snow-cover frequency (SCF) on Tibet is analysed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra snow cover product (MOD10A2) from 2000 to 2015, and relationships with main climate variables are investigated. Results are as follows: (1) there is a very weak decreasing trend in annual mean SCA, and a slight increasing trend in autumn and winter and a slight decreasing trend in spring and more robust decreasing trend in summer for SCA are found. (2) The temporal variation of SCA is negatively correlated with temperature, whereas it is little correlated with corresponding precipitation. (3) The general trend of spatial SCF variation on Tibet, predominated by snow-cover variations in spring and autumn, tends to decrease in spring while it tends to increase in autumn. (4) The spatial variability of SCF is attributed to snow-cover variations in autumn and spring, which is more obvious in higher latitudes in autumn while it is more noticeable in lower-latitude southeastern plateau in spring. (5) The regions with higher variability of snow cover are main pastoral land and more prone to snow-related disaster in Tibet, becoming key zone of snow-cover monitoring and disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Life cycle of bamboo in the southwestern Amazon and its relation to fire events
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo-dominated forests comprise 1 % of the world's forests and 3 % of the Amazon forests. The Guadua spp. bamboos that dominate the southwest Amazon are semelparous; thus flowering and fruiting occur once in a lifetime before death. These events occur in massive spatially organized patches every 28 years and produce huge quantities of necromass. The bamboo-fire hypothesis argues that increased dry fuel after die-off enhances fire probability, creating opportunities that favor bamboo growth. In this study, our aim is to map the bamboo-dominated forests and test the bamboo-fire hypothesis using satellite imagery. Specifically, we developed and validated a method to map the bamboo die-off and its spatial distribution using satellite-derived reflectance time series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and explored the bamboo-fire hypothesis by evaluating the relationship between bamboo die-off and fires detected by the MODIS thermal anomalies product in the southwest Amazon. Our findings show that the near-infrared (NIR) is the most sensitive spectral interval to characterize bamboo growth and cohort age. Automatic detection of historical bamboo die-off achieved an accuracy above 79 %. We mapped and estimated 15.5 million ha of bamboo-dominated forests in the region. The bamboo-fire hypothesis was not supported because only a small fraction of bamboo areas burned during the analysis timescale, and, in general, bamboo did not show higher fire probability after the die-off. Nonetheless, fire occurrence was 45 % higher in dead than live bamboo in drought years, associated with ignition sources from land use, suggesting a bamboo-human-fire association. Although our findings show that the observed fire was not sufficient to drive bamboo dominance, the increased fire occurrence in dead bamboo in drought years may contribute to the maintenance of bamboo and potential expansion into adjacent bamboo-free forests. Fire can even bring deadly consequences to these adjacent forests under climate change effects.

TI  - A comparative evaluation of arid inflow-dependent vegetation maps derived from LANDSAT top-of-atmosphere and surface reflectances
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, it is commonly accepted that land remote-sensing satellite (LANDSAT) top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance is less accurate than atmospheric correction (AC) reflectance, as the former is not calibrated for possible modifications in the electromagnetic radiation signals due to atmospheric scattering and absorption. This article investigates whether LANDSAT data calibrated for TOA reflectance are an appropriate information source for delineating inflow-dependent vegetation (IDV) in regions with an arid and desert climate, such as the Pilbara region in Western Australia. Knowledge of where IDVs are in the landscape underpins planning their protection and define the baseline for their monitoring when water resource management options are considered. The appropriateness of TOA calibration for the delineation of IDV in the Pilbara was assessed through its comparison with IDV maps derived from AC reflectance. Both radiometric calibration methods (TOA and AC) were applied to a multi-date LANDSAT 5 TM (Thematic Mapper) dataset of 10 images acquired in 2009 and 2010. Two methods based on the application of remote-sensing techniques to identify the extent of temporally invariant vegetation were applied for IDV delineation in the study area. The first method, groundwater-dependent ecosystems mapping (GEM), employs a two-date normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset for identifying 'no-change' clusters of land cover and detecting those related to IDV. The second method applies principal component analysis (PCA) to a multi-date NDVI dataset. The first principal component (PC1) typically contains features that remain unchanged over time. This includes vegetation with continuous or frequent access to surface and/or groundwater, such as IDV. To delineate the extent of IDV, a thresholding technique was further employed. Spatial similarity between IDV maps produced from TOA and AC reflectance was quantitatively evaluated by the Kappa coefficient. The results showed that TOA and AC IDV maps are in 'almost perfect' agreement with the Kappa values above 0.83. This suggests that TOA reflectance is equally appropriate to AC reflectance for mapping in arid and desert climate such as in Pilbara. When the GEM- and PCA-based methods are applied in other study areas with arid or desert climate, the accuracy of the delineated IDV extent may vary. Therefore, the results need to be validated using ground-truth information about known IDV occurrences in the area of interest.

TI  - A sensitivity analysis of dual-polarization features to damage due to the 2016 Central-Italy earthquake
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the sensitivity of dual-polarization features extracted from dual-polarimetric coherent synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery to urban damage due to the earthquake occurred in Central -Italy in 2016 is addressed. First, a conventional single-polarization feature, based on the coherence between pre- and post-event co-polarized imagery, is analysed using SAR scenes collected by the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission over the area of Amatrice, an Italian city significantly damaged by the 2016 earthquake that affected Central Italy. Then, the same analysis is undertaken using the cross-polarized channel to point out that the joint use of co- and cross-polarized channels can help in better observing the damaged area. Finally, a coherent dual-polarimetric feature, based on the inter-channel coherence, is proposed. This feature results in a sensitivity to damaged areas comparable to the one provided by conventional single-polarization features. However, the interchannel coherence has the benefit to be based only on two SAR acquisitions, i.e. before and after the earthquake and it is less affected by false alarms.

TI  - Characterizing the spatiotemporal evolution of soil salinization in Hetao Irrigation District (China) using a remote sensing approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a major problem of land degradation in arid and semiarid irrigation districts. This study aims to characterize the spatiotemporal evolution of soil salinization in Hetao Irrigation District (HID) in Inner Mongolia, China, using Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus/Operational Land Imager datasets. Salty barren land and farmland are extracted using supervised classification. Then, we develop four integrated soil salinity models (ISSMs) to quantify the intensity of saline farmland. ISSMs are generated through deriving the parameters (E(VI-SI)s), which integrate enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and Salinity Index-1 (SI1), EVI and Salinity Index-3 (SI3), Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (MSAVI) and SI1, and MSAVI and SI3, respectively, from the scatter plots of farmland soils with different salinity in four spectral feature spaces (SFSs). Exponential regression analyses reveal that the EVI-SI from MSAVI-SI3 SFS has the best fit with in situ soil electrical conductivity measurements (R-2 = 0.74, root mean square error = 0.31 dS m(-1)). Salty barren land clustered in the central and northeast of HID, while the area of salty barren land decreased during 1986-2016. After employing water-saving irrigation since 2000, saline farmland decreased and then remained relatively stable. This study indicates that the SFS integrating MSAVI and SI3 contains effective information for quantifying the saline farmland. Employing water-saving irrigation had a positive effect on controlling salinization.

TI  - Assessment of the indirect impact of wildfire (severity) on actual evapotranspiration in eucalyptus forest based on the surface energy balance estimated from remote-sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have a strong impact on the environment, changing its structure, soil properties, and microclimate and subsequently its water cycle with implications on the surface energy fluxes. Persisting droughts and catastrophic forest fires initiated this case study of pure eucalyptus stands in north-central Portugal. Although many studies have investigated changes in actual evapotranspiration (ETa), surface energy flux patterns, and the related physical parameters, only a few concentrated on the fire-driven changes in pure eucalyptus stands in the Mediterranean climate. This study aims to understand the consequences of wildfires on the water cycle, namely the ETa, and the surface energy heat fluxes by applying a simplified two-source energy balance model in combination with medium-resolution imagery (Landsat 8). A total of 21 different burnt locations were evaluated, which burned between 2011 and 2013. Estimated surface energy fluxes and daily ETa were compared to nearby control sites (unburnt) during satellite overpass for the time after the fire (2013-2015). The fire scars were classified into their burn severity, using the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio. The absolute difference of ETa ( ETa) between unburnt and burnt locations was used to identify fire-driven changes in magnitude and its evolution over time. Our results show that for the unburnt stands, the contributions to the total latent heat flux were around 80% from the canopy and 20% from the soil, while for the burnt site the contributions were around 30% (canopy) and 70% (soil) shortly after the fire. Inter-annually, the difference in ETa increased during the rainy season, which was related to the epicormic shooting, the fast regrowth rate of foliage, and the abundance of water. Generally, smaller differences in ETa were related to the severity classification and stand properties (i.e. tree species and soil characteristics). Two to three years after the fire events, ETa became non-significant for all severity classes, leading to an impact on the total water cycle smaller in comparison to other post-fire studies.

TI  - Cloud detection for high-resolution remote-sensing images of urban areas using colour and edge features based on dual-colour models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, the colour and edge features of clouds are proposed based on the analysis of a large number of cloudy high-resolution remote-sensing images of urban area. Using the cloud features, a cloud detection method based on dual-colour space is proposed. First, two candidate cloud regions maps are built based on hue-saturation-intensity model and blue, green, red model, respectively. According to the superposition analysis of the two maps, fine cloud regions map are obtained. After removing the fine cloud regions from the image, the image is linearly stretched to enhance the intensity of thin clouds around the fine cloud regions. In the stretched image, the thin cloud regions map is built with the threshold technique. Finally, the fine cloud regions map and the thin cloud regions map are combined to form the complete cloud regions map. The results of experiments and comparisons indicate that our algorithm has good accuracy and efficiency.

TI  - A two-stage algorithm for ground filtering of airborne laser scanning data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A two-stage algorithm is proposed in this article for ground filtering of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Input ALS data are initially preprocessed for outliers removal. The first stage removes the non-ground objects from preprocessed ALS data based on the geometrical reasoning, which is applied over piecewise local neighbourhoods around selected points. The second stage retrieved the ground points falsely recognized as non-ground in the first stage using geometrical similarity of ground points in their surroundings. The proposed algorithm was tested and validated comprehensively using complex and heterogeneous landscapes of selected 10 ALS data sets and additional 15 International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing data samples. The ground points were filtered out in these data sets and data samples at average total error and kappa coefficient of 3.66% and 89.15%, respectively. The proposed algorithm performs satisfactorily in the complex terrain cases such as mixed vegetation and houses on sloping terrain, low vegetation, complex objects, low and small objects, scene border, and discontinuity. The proposed algorithm is straightforward and, consequently, computationally efficient. Thus, it has potential for wider use in industry.

TI  - Establishment of the South Korean national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, Kor-GLASS, in 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surveillance plays a pivotal role in overcoming antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in bacterial pathogens, and a variety of surveillance systems have been set up and employed in many countries. In 2015, the World Health Organization launched the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS) as a part of the global action plan to enhance national and global surveillance and research. The aims of GLASS are to foster development of national surveillance systems and to enable collection, analysis and sharing of standardised, comparable and validated data on AMR between different countries. The South Korean AMR surveillance system, Kor-GLASS, is compatible with the GLASS platform and was established in 2016 and based on the principles of representativeness, specialisation, harmonisation and localisation. In this report, we summarise principles and processes in order to share our experiences with other countries planning to establish a national AMR surveillance system. The pilot operation of Kor-GLASS allowed us to understand the national burden of specific infectious diseases and the status of bacterial AMR. Issues pertaining to high costs and labour-intensive operation were raised during the pilot, and improvements are being made.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of major clinical pathogens in South Korea, May 2016 to April 2017: first one-year report from Kor-GLASS
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Korean government established an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance system, compatible with the Global AMR Surveillance System (GLASS): Kor-GLASS. We describe results from the first year of operation of the Kor-GLASS from May 2016 to April 2017, comprising all non-duplicated clinical isolates of major pathogens from blood,urine, faeces and urethral and cervical swabs from six sentinel hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were carried out by disk diffusion, Etest, broth microditution and agar dilution methods. Among 67,803 blood cultures, 3,523 target pathogens were recovered. The predominant bacterial species were Escherichia coil (n = 1,536), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 597) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 584). From 57,477 urine cultures, 6,394 E. coil and 1,097 K. pneumoniae were recovered. Bloodstream infections in inpatients per 10,000 patient-days (10TPD) were highest for cefotaxime-resistant E. coil with 2.1, followed by 1.6 for meticillin-resistant Sta. aureus, 1.1 for imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.8 for cefotaxime-resistant K. pneumoniae and 0.4 for vancomycin-.resistant Enterococcus faecium. Urinary tract infections in inpatients were 7.7 and 2.1 per 10TPD for cefotaxime-resistant E. coil and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Kor-GLASS generated welt-curated surveillance data devoid of collection bias or isolate duplication. A bacterial bank and a database for the collections are under development.

TI  - Non-photosynthetic vegetation biomass estimation in semiarid Canadian mixed grasslands using ground hyperspectral data, Landsat 8 OLI, and Sentinel-2 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on quantifying non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) with optical remote-sensing approaches has been focusing on optically distinguishing NPV from green vegetation and bare soil. With a very similar spectral response curve to NPV, dry moss is a significant component in semiarid mixed grasslands and plays a large role in NPV estimation. However, limited attention has been paid to this role. We investigated the potential of optical remote sensing to distinguish NPV biomass in semiarid grasslands characterized by NPV, biological soil crust dominated by moss and lichen, and bare soil. First, hyperspectral spectral indices were examined to determine the most useful spectral wavelength regions for NPV biomass estimation. Second, multispectral red-edge indices and shortwave infrared (SWIR) indices were simulated based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument band reflectance, respectively, to determine the most suitable multispectral indices for NPV estimation. The potential multispectral indices were then applied to Landsat 8 OLI images and Sentinel-2A images acquired in early, middle, peak, and early senescence growing seasons to investigate the potential of satellite images for quantifying NPV biomass. Our results indicated that hyperspectral red-edge indices, modified simple ratio, modified red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (mNDVI(705)), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI705) are better than the SWIR hyperspectral indices, including cellulose absorption index for quantifying NPV biomass. The simulated multispectral red-edge spectral indices (NDVIred-edge and mNDVI(red-edge)) demonstrate good and comparable performance on quantifying NPV biomass with SWIR multispectral indices (normalized difference index [NDI5 and NDI7] and soil-adjusted corn residue index). Nevertheless, the multispectral indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 images have limited potential for NPV biomass estimation.

TI  - Comparison of country-level cropland areas between ESA-CCI land cover maps and FAOSTAT data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term time series of spatially explicit cropland maps are essential for global crop modelling and climate change studies. The spatial resolution and temporal continuity of global cropland maps have been improving and several global data sets are released recently. Here, we calculated country-level cropland areas from the annual land-cover (LC) maps produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) project and from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations statistical data (FAOSTAT) from 1992 to 2014. Because these two data sets used different approaches for generating the cropland data, we further quantified the consistency/difference in cropland areas and temporal changes between both products. Using log-transformed the time-averaged country-level cropland areas, a good linear relationship was found between these two products across different countries. However, only 8% of countries (mostly Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries) showed cropland area difference smaller than 1% between ESA-CCI and FAOSTAT. The cropland areas (without mosaic cropland types) from ESA-CCI are lower than the areas from FAOSTAT in 26% of countries but higher in 66% of countries. The magnitude of the latter difference (i.e. higher estimates of ESA-CCI than FAOSTAT) would be further amplified if crop intensity was taken into account. In addition, opposite temporal trends of cropland areas were found between these two data sets in 41% of countries. Although there are uncertainties in ESA-CCI LC maps, resulting from remote-sensing techniques such as mixed pixels, spectral similar objects, and same subject with different spectrum, the long time series and relatively high resolution of this product help us to understand the differences between satellite-based and inventory-based data sets and thus identify the possible strategies to improve the accuracy of satellite-based LC products.

TI  - MODIS Collection 6 MAIAC algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the latest version of the algorithm MAIAC used for processing the MODIS Collection 6 data record. Since initial publication in 2011-2012, MAIAC has changed considerably to adapt to global processing and improve cloud/snow detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction of MODIS data. The main changes include (1) transition from a 25 to 1 km scale for retrieval of the spectral regression coefficient (SRC) which helped to remove occasional blockiness at 25 km scale in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and in the surface reflectance, (2) continuous improvements of cloud detection, (3) introduction of smoke and dust tests to discriminate absorbing fine- and coarse-mode aerosols, (4) adding over-water processing, (5) general optimization of the LUT-based radiative transfer for the global processing, and others. MAIAC provides an interdisciplinary suite of atmospheric and land products, including cloud mask (CM), column water vapor (CWV), AOD at 0.47 and 0.55 mu m, aerosol type (background, smoke or dust) and fine-mode fraction over water; spectral bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF), parameters of Ross-thick Li-sparse (RTLS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model and instantaneous albedo. For snow-covered surfaces, we provide subpixel snow fraction and snow grain size. All products come in standard HDF4 format at 1 km resolution, except for BRF, which is also provided at 500 m resolution on a sinusoidal grid adopted by the MODIS Land team. All products are provided on per-observation basis in daily files except for the BRDF/Albedo product, which is reported every 8 days. Because MAIAC uses a time series approach, BRDF/Albedo is naturally gap-filled over land where missing values are filled-in with results from the previous retrieval. While the BRDF model is reported for MODIS Land bands 1-7 and ocean band 8, BRF is reported for both land and ocean bands 1-12. This paper focuses on MAIAC cloud detection, aerosol retrievals and atmospheric correction and describes MCD19 data products and quality assurance (QA) flags.

TI  - Corresponding regions for shadow restoration in satellite high-resolution images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution images available by satellites such as Ikonos, Quickbird, and WorldView-2 provide more information for remote sensing applications, such as object detection, classification, change detection, and object mapping. The presence of shadow reduces the amount of information that can be extracted and consequently makes these applications more difficult or even impossible. In this article, a shadow restoration approach for high-resolution satellite images is proposed. The approach detects the shadow area and segments the image into regions according to the land surface type. Then, shadow restoration is carried out for each region based on the degree of correspondence between shadow and neighbouring non-shadow regions. The proposed approach is applied to study areas from Ikonos and WorldView-2 satellite images. A comparison to the standard approaches for shadow restoration is performed, and an accuracy assessment is carried out by visual inspection and land-cover classification. The results show that the enhanced shadow regions using the proposed approach have better appearances and are highly compatible with their surrounding non-shadow regions. In addition, the overall accuracy is higher than those of the standard approaches.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of Solitary Lymphnode Metastasis and Micrometastasis in Gastric Cancer
T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Gastric cancer (GC) used to be one of the most common malignancies in the world and still is the second leading cause of malignancy-related death in the Far East. The most significant factors that were found to be associated with the clinical outcome in patients with non-metastatic (M-0) gastric cancer is tumor's depth of invasion, the presence and the extend of lymphnode involvement, as well as the histological type according to Lauren (intestinal or diffuse). Although it is generally accepted that D2 gastrectomy is the procedure of choice to achieve adequate oncologic excision, there are quite many concerns for its use in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC), where N-0 or N-1 specimens are frequently reported. The last two decades, with the evolvement of cancer cell detection techniques, the attend of the medical community is focused on GC patients with solitary lymphnode metastasis (SLN) or micrometastasis (mM). There is a discussion whether SLN should be attributed as the "real" sentinel node (SN) and its projection on patients' survival. The aim of this study is to review the recent literature and attempt to clarify the clinical significance of SLN in gastric cancer.

TI  - Global DEMs to tackle RPC biases and the overfitting phenomenon in high-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overfitting phenomenon and rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs) biases are two crucial issues that degrade the accuracy of geospatial products derived from high-resolution satellite images. The overfitting phenomenon is caused by both a large number of RPCs and strong correlations among them. The RPC biases arise from uncertainties in the global positioning system receivers and inertial measurement units. In this article, an innovative framework based on the genetic algorithm (GA) and the least squares (LS) algorithm, called GALS, is proposed to overcome these problems simultaneously. In this method, the GA is applied to select the optimum RPCs, while the LS algorithm is used to estimate the values of the optimally selected RPCs. The GALS method requires various sets of well-distributed ground control points (GCPs). To tackle the problem of GCP collection, we generated a large number of digital elevation model (DEM)-derived GCPs (DEMGCPs), using a global DEM (GDEM) and vendor-provided RPCs, refined by only one GCP. To evaluate the performance of this framework, four IRS-P5 data sets were used. The GALS is compared to two competing methods, L1-norm-regularized LS and ridge estimation by considering two scenarios using 50 GCPs and the DEMGCPs. The results demonstrate the superiority of GALS in both scenarios. Furthermore, GALS using DEMGCPs led to far more accurate and stable results when compared to GALS using GCPs. Compared to the vendor-provided RPCs, the results of the GALS using DEMGCPs also indicate a major improvement, single-pixel or subpixel accuracy with around 15 RPCs, and only 1 GCP, in both accuracy and reliability of georeferencing for all IRS-P5 data sets.

TI  - Remote sensing techniques to predict salinity intrusion: application for a data-poor area of the coastal Mekong Delta, Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinity intrusion is a complex issue in coastal and estuarine areas. Currently, remote sensing techniques have been widely used to monitor water quality changes, ranging from inland river networks to deep oceans. The Vietnamese Mekong Delta is an important rice-growing area, and intrusion of saline water into irrigated freshwater-based agriculture areas is one of the most crucial constraints for agriculture development. This study aimed at building a numerical model to realize the salinity intrusion through the relationship between reflectance from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager images and salinity levels measured in situ. A total of 103 observed samples were divided into 50% training and 50% test. Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest (RF) approaches were applied in the study. The result showed that the RF approach was the best model to estimate salinity along the coastal river network in the study area. However, the large samples size needed was a significant challenge to circumscribe predicting ability of the RF model. The reflectance has a good correlation with salinity when locations (latitude-longitude) of salinity measured stations were added as a parameter of the Step-wise model with R-square 77.48% in training and 74.16% in test while Root Mean Square Error was smaller than 3.

TI  - An improved coupled framework for Glacier classification: an integration of optical and thermal infrared remote-sensing bands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the applicability of optical and thermal infrared (TIR) bands by the applications of two different satellite sensors for characterizing debris covers of Zemu glacier situated in the North Sikkim Himalayas India. Differentiating supraglacial debris (SGD), clean ice, and ice-covered glaciers from periglacial debris (PGD) cover is a challenging task due to similarities between their spectra. Previous studies suggest that the difference between thermal and optical properties can be used in the separation of SGD (part of the glacier boundary) and PGD (outside the glacier boundary) accurately. Thus a novel multi-criteria approach has been constructed to characterize the glacier cover utilizing Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) and hybrid classification (HC) methods. Based on the integration of optical and TIR bands from two satellite systems such as Landsat and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite Linear Imaging Spectral Scanner 3, total six different image combinations were prepared to explore glacier features under various mathematical and image processing operations. Each image band combination represents a distinctive characterization of the debris cover of Zemu glacier. The spatial-spectral profiles of glacial features (spectral signatures) were drawn to distinguish SGD and PGD. The accuracy assessment was performed to test the correctness of classified maps resulted from MLC and HC methods. The HC maps show a larger efficiency (near to 90%) than MLC maps (near to 85%). The outcomes offered better understandings in the classification of SGD and PGD by using the combined products of optical and TIR remote-sensing sensors. The ground-based observations such as GPS points, field photographs of the Zemu glacier topography, and high-resolution Google Earth images helped to reduce the misclassification and improved the classification accuracy. Furthermore, a cloud removal method was applied for TIR bands to improve the accuracy of the glacier classification. The glacier features and their area statistics have been compared to temporal time scales, illustrating annual fluctuations in glacial characteristics.

TI  - Urban heat island intensity during winter over metropolitan cities of India using remote-sensing techniques: impact of urbanization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to quantify spatial relationship of land-use and land-cover (LULC) changes and land surface temperature (LST) using remote-sensing and geographical information system techniques over 10 major metropolitan cities of India. For this purpose, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus images of these cities during winter period from 2001 to 2013 are used. Statistical analysis of the LULC classification has shown overall accuracy ranging between 85% and 88%. The LULC classification and estimated LST using the satellite imageries reveals the presence of multiple urban heat islands (UHIs) and their increase in number in all cities. Significant increase in built-up/urban areas are noticed at the expense of vegetated lands and barren lands over Lucknow, Nagpur, and Jaipur, whereas in Hyderabad and Bengaluru the built-up area and the dry/barren lands are observed to be increasing, at the expense of crop/grass lands. Higher UHI intensities in the range of 8.9-10.3 degrees C are noticed over Mumbai, Nagpur, and Hyderabad compared to the other cities. Higher temperature zones (hotspots) are found to be increasing in the built-up area as well as in barren lands. Varying increase in UHI intensity among the cities is noticed which may have implications in the regional climate over the cities.

TI  - A spatiotemporal satellite image fusion model with autoregressive error correction (AREC)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To overcome the trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite sensors, various spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been developed to generate synthetic imagery with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. While such methods have achieved different levels of success, they have not considered spatiotemporal autocorrelation in the fusion process. Herein, we propose a novel spatiotemporal model incorporating autoregressive error correction (AREC) for fusing Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images. This AREC model minimizes autoregressive errors when fitting a relationship between coarse- and fine-resolution pixels in an existing MODIS-Landsat image pair (on a base date ). The derived relationship is then applied to the corresponding pixel in the prediction pair (on a prediction date ). This method enables the relationship to be optimized and the phenological and land-cover changes to be treated in a unified manner. The AREC model was tested using a simulated data set and two actual data sets from Shenzhen, China, and Saskatchewan, Canada. The model was compared with the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method in terms of changed and unchanged regions, and whole data sets, using visual analysis and quantitative indices. The results show that the AREC model can effectively predict phenological and land-cover changes with higher accuracies than other algorithms as a result of AREC.

TI  - Land-cover classification using multi-temporal GF-1 wide field view data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is an important land-cover type and its growth characteristics have potential for improving land-cover classification accuracy using remote-sensing data. However, due to lack of suitable remote-sensing data, temporal features are difficult to acquire for high spatial resolution land-cover classification. Several studies have extracted temporal features by fusing time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and Landsat data. Nevertheless, this method needs assumption of no land-cover change occurring during the period of blended data and the fusion results also present certain errors influencing temporal features extraction. Therefore, time-series high spatial resolution data from a single sensor are ideal for land-cover classification using temporal features. The Chinese GF-1 satellite wide field view (WFV) sensor has realized the ability of acquiring multispectral data with decametric spatial resolution, high temporal resolution and wide coverage, which contain abundant temporal information for improving land-cover classification accuracy. Therefore, it is of important significance to investigate the performance of GF-1 WFV data on land-cover classification. Time-series GF-1 WFV data covering the vegetation growth period were collected and temporal features reflecting the dynamic change characteristics of ground-objects were extracted. Then, Support Vector Machine classifier was used to land-cover classification based on the spectral features and their combination with temporal features. The validation results indicated that temporal features could effectively reflect the growth characteristics of different vegetation and finally improved classification accuracy of approximately 7%, reaching 92.89% with vegetation type identification accuracy greatly improved. The study confirmed that GF-1 WFV data had good performances on land-cover classification, which could provide reliable high spatial resolution land-cover data for related applications.

TI  - Extinction and optical depth retrievals for CALIPSO's Version 4 data release
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite has been making near-global height-resolved measurements of cloud and aerosol layers since mid-June 2006. Version 4.10 (V4) of the CALIOP data products, released in November 2016, introduces extensive upgrades to the algorithms used to retrieve the spatial and optical properties of these layers, and thus there are both obvious and subtle differences between V4 and previous data releases. This paper describes the improvements made to the extinction retrieval algorithms and illustrates the impacts of these changes on the extinction and optical depth estimates reported in the CALIPSO lidar level 2 data products. The lidar ratios for both aerosols and ice clouds are generally higher than in previous data releases, resulting in generally higher extinction coefficients and optical depths in V4. A newly implemented algorithm for retrieving extinction coefficients in opaque layers is described and its impact examined. Precise lidar ratio estimates are also retrieved in these opaque layers. For semi-transparent cirrus clouds, comparisons between CALIOP V4 optical depths and the optical depths reported by MODIS collection 6 show substantial improvements relative to earlier comparisons between CALIOP version 3 and MODIS collection 5.

TI  - An assessment of air-quality monitoring station locations based on satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimization of the locations of air quality monitoring stations has great importance in providing high-quality data for regional air pollution monitoring. To assess the representativeness of the locations of the current air quality monitoring stations, we propose a new method based on satellite observations by applying the stratified sampling approach. Unlike the traditional method, which relies on the simulated spatial distribution of air pollutants from dispersion models, we obtained the sampling population through observations from remote sensing. As a first step, the spatial distribution of aggregated air quality was obtained based on ground concentrations of particulate matter (aerodynamic diameters of less than 10 mu m, PM10), fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameters of less than 2.5 mu m, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) derived from satellite observations. Second, the representativeness of locations of air quality monitoring stations was assessed using the stratified sampling method. The results demonstrated that air quality monitoring stations in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei were clustered in areas with heavily polluted air, whereas the number of air quality monitoring stations was insufficient in areas with higher air quality. After optimization, the minimum relative error was only 6.77%. It is indicated that combing remote-sensing data with the stratified sampling approach has great potential in assessing the spatial representativeness of air quality monitoring stations.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of artemisinin-based combination therapy, and molecular markers for artemisinin and piperaquine resistance in Mainland Tanzania
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundArtemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is the first-line anti-malarial treatment of uncomplicated malaria in most malaria endemic countries, including Tanzania. Unfortunately, there have been reports of artemisinin resistance and ACT failure from South East Asia highlighting the need to monitor therapeutic efficacy of ACT in these countries as recommended by World Health Organization.MethodsOpen-label single arm studies in mainland Tanzania were conducted in nine sentinel sites in 2011, 2012 and 2015 to assess the efficacy and safety of artemether/lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate/amodiaquine (ASAQ) using 28days follow-up and dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine (DHAPQ) using 42days follow-up. Mutations in the propeller domain of the Plasmodium falciparum kelch 13 (k13) gene and amplification of the P. falciparum plasmepsin 2 (pm2) gene, associated with artemisinin and piperaquine (PQ) resistance, were also investigated.ResultsOf the 428 patients enrolled, 328 patients provided study endpoint. For AL, the PCR corrected per-protocol analysis showed adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) of 90.3% (n=28; 95% CI 74.2-98.0) in Kyela 2012, 95.7% (n=22; 95% CI 78.1-99.0) in Chamwino, 100% in Muheza (n=29; 95% CI 88.1-100), 100% in Nagaga (n=39; 95% CI 91.0-100) and Kyela 2015 (n=60; 95% CI 94.0-100). For ASAQ, PCR corrected ACPR of 98% (n=49; 95% CI 89.4-99.9) and 100% (n=25; 95% CI 86.3-100) were observed in 2011 in Ujiji and Kibaha, respectively. For DHAPQ, the ACPR was 100% (n=71; 95% CI 94.9-100). Of the 235 samples with genetic interpretable results, only 7 (3%) had non-synonymous k13 mutations. None of these are candidate or validated markers of artemisinin resistance and all patients carrying these alleles cleared the parasites on day 3. Of the DHAPQ group, 10% (3/29) of the samples with interpretable results had pm2 multiple copies and none of them was associated with treatment failure.ConclusionAll the tested ACT in mainland Tanzania were highly efficacious and none of validated k13 mutants associated with artemisinin resistance was observed. However, three isolates with multiple copy numbers of pm2 gene associated with PQ resistance among the limited samples tested successfully calls for further investigation.Trial registration Number ACTRN12615000159550.

TI  - Estimation of black carbon emissions from Siberian fires using satellite observations of absorption and extinction optical depths
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC) emissions from open biomass burning (BB) are known to have a considerable impact on the radiative budget of the atmosphere at both global and regional scales; however, these emissions are poorly constrained in models by atmospheric observations, especially in remote regions. Here, we investigate the feasibility of constraining BC emissions from BB using satellite observations of the aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) and the aerosol extinction optical depth (AOD) retrieved from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) measurements, respectively. We consider the case of Siberian BB BC emissions, which have the strong potential to impact the Arctic climate system. Using aerosol remote sensing data collected at Siberian sites of the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) along with the results of the fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-4), we establish an empirical parameterization relating the ratio of the elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) contents in BB aerosol to the ratio of AAOD and AOD at the wavelengths of the satellite observations. Applying this parameterization to the BC and OC column amounts simulated using the CHIMERE chemistry transport model, we optimize the parameters of the BB emission model based on MODIS measurements of the fire radiative power (FRP); we then obtain top-down optimized estimates of the total monthly BB BC amounts emitted from intense Siberian fires that occurred from May to September 2012. The top-down estimates are compared to the corresponding values obtained using the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4) and the Fire Emission Inventory-northern Eurasia (FEI-NE). Our simulations using the optimized BB aerosol emissions are verified against AAOD and AOD data that were withheld from the estimation procedure. The simulations are further evaluated against in situ EC and OC measurements at the Zotino Tall Tower Observatory (ZOTTO) and also against aircraft aerosol measurement data collected in the framework of the Airborne Extensive Regional Observations in SIBeria (YAK-AEROSIB) experiments. We conclude that our BC and OC emission estimates, considered with their confidence intervals, are consistent with the ensemble of the measurement data analyzed in this study. Siberian fires are found to emit 0.41 +/- 0.14 Tg of BC over the whole 5-month period considered; this estimate is a factor of 2 larger and a factor of 1.5 smaller than the corresponding estimates based on the GFED4 (0.20 Tg) and FEI-NE (0.61 Tg) data, respectively. Our estimates of monthly BC emissions are also found to be larger than the BC amounts calculated using the GFED4 data and smaller than those calculated using the FEI-NE data for any of the 5 months. Particularly large positive differences of our monthly BC emission estimates with respect to the GFED4 data are found in May and September. This finding indicates that the GFED4 database is likely to strongly underestimate BC emissions from agricultural burns and grass fires in Siberia. All of these differences have important implications for climate change in the Arctic, as it is found that about a quarter of the huge BB BC mass emitted in Siberia during the fire season of 2012 was transported across the polar circle into the Arctic. Overall, the results of our analysis indicate that a combination of the available satellite observations of AAOD and AOD can provide the necessary constraints on BB BC emissions.

TI  - The provision of urban green space and its accessibility: Spatial data effects in Brussels
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) has many environmental and social benefits. UGS provision and access are increasingly considered in urban policies and must rely on data and indicators that can capture variations in the distribution of UGS within cities. There is no consensus about how UGS, and their provision and access, must be defined from different land use data types. Here we identify four spatial dimensions of UGS and critically examine how different data sources affect these dimensions and our understanding of their variation within a city region (Brussels). We compare UGS indicators measured from an imagery source (NDVI from Landsat), an official cadastre-based map, and the voluntary geographical information provided by OpenStreetMap (OSM). We compare aggregate values of provision and access to UGS as well as their spatial distribution along a centrality gradient and at neighbourhood scale. We find that there are strong differences in the value of indicators when using the different datasets, especially due to their ability to capture private and public green space. However we find that the interpretation of intra-urban spatial variations is not affected by changes in data source. Centrality in particular is a strong determinant of the relative values of UGS availability, fragmentation and accessibility, irrespective of datasets.

TI  - NDVI-derived forest area change and its driving factors in China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - China harbors diversified forest types, from tropical rainforest to boreal coniferous forest, and has implemented large-scale reforestation/afforestation programs over the past several decades. However, little information is available on changes in China's forest area and the causes. In this study, we used the classified forest distribution thematic map derived from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets and a revised IPAT model to examine China's forest area change and the possible driving factors from 1982 to 2006. Overall, NDVI-derived forest areas were numerically consistent with those reported in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th National Forest Inventories, respectively. Over the past 25 years, China's forest area was estimated to have an average of 169.18 million hectares with an annual increase of 0.15 million hectares (c.a. a total net increment of 3.60 million hectares), which is equivalent to 0.089% of the relative annual change rate. However, a large difference in the changing rate and direction of forest area at the province level was found; for instance, forest area has declined in 10 provinces, mainly in Northeastern and Southern China, while 21 provinces showed an increase. The changes were most likely attributed to the policy regarding the import and export of timber and affluence (per capita gross domestic product), and both contributed more than 80% of the total contribution of the six factors of the revised IPAT model.

TI  - Auroville as an intentional spiritual community and the practice of Integral yoga
T2  - COGENT ARTS & HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper discusses Auroville as an intentional spiritual community in South India and the way facets of Integral yoga are manifested. The existential thinking, aspirations, existential anxieties, daily spiritual experiences and worldview of the residents also called Aurovilians, were studied through a 10-year period. Aurovilians' scores on measures of existential thinking, aspirations, and spiritual experiences were higher and existential anxieties scores were lower than their phase 1 scores. At phase 2, scores on the integrative worldview were higher. In-depth discussions showed an evolution of existential thinking and spiritual inclinations as well as integrative worldview of residents of Auroville as an intentional spiritual commune. Theistic existentialism of Aurovilians is, drawing from Sri Aurobindo's Integral yoga, a phenomenological quest for the Absolute. The study is a demonstration of the practical applications of Integral yoga as a world affirming philosophy to qualify the divine quest of humanity, through an intentional community's experiment.

TI  - A Comparison of Cloud Microphysical Properties Derived From MODIS and CALIPSO With In Situ Measurements Over the Wintertime Southern Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In situ observations of cloud effective radius (r(eff)), droplet number concentration (N-d), and thermodynamic phase from 11 wintertime flights over the Southern Ocean (43-45 degrees S, 145-148 degrees E) are compared to products from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization. The in situ observations were in close alignment with A-train overpasses for a 30-min window. For open mesoscale cellular convection, which was predominantly observed, clouds were commonly found to be intermittently drizzling, patchy, and mixed phase. Compared to the in situ observations of the cloud thermodynamic phase, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and MODIS cloud phase optical property products consistently underestimated the occurrence of mixed-phase clouds, whereas the MODIS infrared-based phase product showed a better qualitative agreement despite a frequent classification of uncertainty. The MODIS r(eff_2.1) overestimated the in situ r(eff) for nondrizzling clouds (by similar to 13 mu m on average) and, to a lesser extent, for lightly drizzling cases. Conversely, MODIS r(eff_2.1) underestimated the in situ r(eff) for heavily drizzling cases by similar to 10 mu m on average. The overestimation of r(eff) is much greater than that for the stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific shown in other studies. An examination on subpixel heterogeneity, droplet size variability, a bimodal distribution, and solar zenith angle suggests that all of these factors have measurable impacts on the MODIS r(eff) bias. The MODIS N-d is largely consistent with the in situ observations. However, the N-d of the two high N-d cases (closed mesoscale cellular convection) are highly underestimated. An error analysis suggests that the N-d biases are likely a result of a compensating error effect.

TI  - Gas Transfer by Breaking Waves
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The transfer of gases at the ocean-atmosphere interface impacts weather and climate from local to global scales, with carbon dioxide (CO2) key to marine life and ecosystems, and dimethyl sulfide affecting aerosols and atmospheric processes. However, the bubble-mediated gas transfer, associated with breaking waves has remained poorly constrained. We present a spectral framework for bubble-mediated gas transfer, computed from a mechanistic model for air bubble entrainment at the breaking wave scale combined with a chemical model. Gas transfer is upscaled to the ocean scale by evaluating air entrainment at all wave scales using wave and wave breaking statistics. The obtained CO2 gas transfer velocity reproduces the variability of historical parameterizations and recent field measurements, with very good accuracy. We propose a wind-wave parameterization that collapses all available data, which can be directly implemented in ocean-wave models or used with remote sensing of the ocean surface to infer gas transfer.Plain Language Summary The transfer of gases at the ocean-atmosphere interface impacts weather and climate from local to global scales. The exchanges of carbon dioxide and oxygen are key to marine life and ecosystems, while transfer of dimethyl sulfide has a strong effect on aerosol composition, affecting atmospheric processes. Yet the bubble-mediated gas transfer, associated with breaking waves has remained poorly constrained. We present a general framework for gas transfer in the open ocean, where air entrainment and the associated bubble-mediated gas transfer are evaluated at all scales. We combine a mechanistic model for air entrainment and bubble statistics at the breaking wave scale with a chemical model for gas transfer by the entrained air bubbles and then upscale the gas exchange using the wave and wave breaking statistics. The obtained gas transfer velocity for CO2 reproduces the variability of historical parameterizations and recent field measurements, with very good accuracy, and we propose a wind-wave parameterization that collapse all available data. The proposed model for gas transfer can be directly implemented in coupled ocean-wave models, or used with remote sensing data of the ocean surface to infer gas transfer, strongly improving predictions of gas exchange at the ocean-atmosphere interface.

TI  - Cirrus Horizontal Heterogeneity and 3-D Radiative Effects on Cloud Optical Property Retrievals From MODIS Near to Thermal Infrared Channels as a Function of Spatial Resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - To retrieve cloud optical properties, current satellite operational imager algorithms simplify the forward radiative transfer problem by assuming that cloudy pixels are horizontally homogeneous and radiatively independent. This study investigates the effects of cirrus horizontal heterogeneity and 3-D radiative effects on cloud optical thickness (COT) and ice crystal effective radius (CER) retrievals obtained using simulated nadir near-infrared/shortwave-infrared (NIR/SWIR) reflectances at 0.86 and 2.13 mu m and thermal infrared (TIR) radiances at 8.5, 11.0, and 12.0 mu m, first separately and next using the five wavelengths together. Synthetic cirrus radiation fields are generated using a cirrus 3-D cloud generator and a 3-D radiative transfer code. When both cloud 3-D and heterogeneity effects are considered, the solar reflectance-based retrievals have the largest errors (up to 10% for COT and 80% for CER, depending on solar angles) for spatial resolutions less than 500-1,000 m, while the TIR-based retrievals have the largest errors (up to 30% for COT and 50% for CER) above this resolution due to parallel homogeneous approximation bias. Therefore, TIR radiance-based retrievals are preferable for spatial resolutions equal or higher than similar to 500 m to 1 km, while NIR/SWIR reflectance-based retrievals are preferable for coarser spatial resolutions. The combination of NIR/SWIR and TIR measurements performed better together than individually for CER retrieval only for resolutions coarser than 2.5 km because 3-D effects are negligible at this scale. Thus, the spectral dependence of subpixel cloud horizontal heterogeneity and 3-D radiative effects has strong consequences when simultaneously using different channels for retrieving cirrus properties.

TI  - Uncertainties in MODIS-Based Cloud Liquid Water Path Retrievals at High Latitudes Due to Mixed-Phase Clouds and Cloud Top Height Inhomogeneity
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined A-train remote sensing measurements from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), CloudSat, and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) are used to study MODIS liquid water path (LWP) uncertainties at high latitudes. The focus is on quantifying uncertainties due to mixed-phase clouds and solar zenith angle-dependent bias, both of which disproportionately affect the MODIS data set in the polar regions. Multisensor LWP retrievals in stratiform mixed-phase clouds show that treating mixed-phase clouds as liquid clouds result in LWP bias that is related to the ice water path (IWP) on average and reaches close to 15% at IWP of 150 g/m(2) and can reach 40% or higher when IWP is greater than 400 g/m(2). Moreover, A-train measurements and radiative transfer modeling are used to further understand the well-known yet unresolved solar zenith angle-dependent high bias in MODIS LWP. It is shown that the cloud top height variation is one of the main factors that contribute to this bias due to three-dimensional radiative interactions with cloud top inhomogeneity. Excluding only 0.5% of data points that show significant three-dimensional errors reduces the bias by 25 g/m(2) at solar zenith angle of 80 degrees and improves agreement with the AMSR-E LWP trends. Three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations confirm that cloud top inhomogeneity is primarily responsible for the solar zenith angle-dependent LWP bias as observed by the MODIS measurements. This study provides a framework to guide future improvements of MODIS LWP data set, which is a key data source to constrain climate models.

TI  - Global Retrievals of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence With TROPOMI: First Results and Intersensor Comparison to OCO-2
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from spaceborne spectrometers has been extensively used as a proxy for terrestrial photosynthesis at relatively sparse temporal and spatial scales. The near-infrared band of the recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) features the required spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio to retrieve SIF in a spectral range devoid of atmospheric absorption features. We find that initial TROPOMI spectra meet high expectations for a substantially improved spatiotemporal resolution (up to 7-km x 3.5-km pixels with daily revisit), representing a step change in SIF remote sensing capabilities. However, interpretation requires caution, as the broad range of viewing-illumination geometries covered by TROPOMI's 2,600-km-wide swath needs to be taken into account. A first intersensor comparison with OCO-2 (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2) SIF shows excellent agreement, underscoring the high quality of TROPOMI's SIF retrievals and the notable radiometric performance of the instrument.Plain Language Summary Photosynthesis is the most essential process for life on Earth, but gradually changing environmental conditions such as increasing concentrations of atmospheric trace gases, rising temperatures, or reduced water availability could adversely affect the photosynthetic productivity. The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument is designed to monitor atmospheric trace gases and air pollutants with an unprecedented resolution in space and time, while its radiometric performance also permits us to see a weak electromagnetic signal emitted by photosynthetically active vegetation-solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). Mounting evidence suggests that SIF observations from satellite instruments augment our abilities to track the photosynthetic performance and carbon uptake of terrestrial vegetation. In this study, we present the first TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument SIF retrievals, largely outperforming previous and existing capabilities for a spatial continuous monitoring of SIF from space.

TI  - Examining Intrinsic Aerosol-Cloud Interactions in South Asia Through Multiple Satellite Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in anthropogenic aerosol loading affect cloud albedo and the Earth's radiative balance with a low level of scientific understanding. Aerosol-cloud interaction and its effects on climate are mainly evaluated using passive observations in a global scale. Here this study estimated the intrinsic response of clouds to aerosols by combining active and passive satellite observations from July 2006 to February 2011 in South Asia. We evaluate the average radiative forcing by the intrinsic aerosol-cloud interaction for warm liquid clouds as 0.63 +/- 0.19, -0.34 +/- 0.40, and 1.11 +/- 0.08 W/m(2) during the annual, monsoon, and nonmonsoon periods in South Asia, respectively. Relationships derived among liquid water path, cloud droplet number concentration, and consequent cloud albedo are assessed as a function of aerosol concentration. The intensity of the aerosol-cloud interaction gradually weakens with increasing cloud base height above ground level in South Asia, is associated with aerosol vertical distribution and vertical atmospheric upward motion. Moreover, distinct regional and seasonal variations in the aerosol-cloud interaction are observed for liquid water path, cloud droplet number concentration, and the resulting cloud albedo in South Asia. These variations are associated with water vapor and aerosol absorption levels. Results contribute to the understanding and modeling of aerosol-cloud interactions and determining their effects on radiative forcing and climate in South Asia.

TI  - MODIS Retrievals of Cloud Effective Radius in Marine Stratocumulus Exhibit No Significant Bias
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of cloud effective radius re are frequently validated using aircraft in situ measurements. Past intercomparisons have found a significant bias toward larger remotely sensed re. Explanations for this bias have focused on retrieval algorithms and large-scale heterogeneity, with in situ measurement uncertainty regarded as a minor factor. We compare Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer re with in situ observations of marine stratocumulus clouds from three aircraft campaigns using a phase Doppler interferometer probe. Retrieved and in situ re typically agree within uncertainty in both nonprecipitating and drizzling conditions with no apparent systematic bias (mean bias of -0.22 mu m, mean relative bias 3%). Agreement depends on the choice of in situ probe as well as microphysical context. We demonstrate that probes must adequately characterize the width of the drop size distribution to avoid systematic underestimation of r(e).Plain Language Summary Satellite measurements provide the only global-scale picture of cloud properties and are widely used in the research community. Since the first comparisons of satellite and aircraft measurements of characteristic cloud drop size, significant disagreement between the two has been found. Past studies assumed that disagreement is because of faults in how the satellite observations are handled as opposed to issues with the aircraft measurements. In this study we show that which aircraft instrument is chosen for comparison with satellite measurements can affect whether satellite and aircraft measurements agree and that an appropriate choice of aircraft instrument leads to robust agreement between satellite and aircraft measurements. Using a database of over 200,000 aircraft measurements in cloud, we show why some aircraft instruments are unable to accurately measure cloud properties in certain meteorological settings.

TI  - Surface Creep Rate of the Southern San Andreas Fault Modulated by Stress Perturbations From Nearby Large Events
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major challenge for understanding the physics of shallow fault creep has been to observe and model the long-term effect of stress changes on creep rate. Here we investigate the surface creep along the southern San Andreas fault (SSAF) using data from interferometric synthetic aperture radar spanning over 25 years (ERS 1992-1999, ENVISAT 2003-2010, and Sentinel-1 2014-present). The main result of this analysis is that the average surface creep rate increased after the Landers event and then decreased by a factor of 2-7 over the past few decades. We consider quasi-static and dynamic Coulomb stress changes on the SSAF due to these three major events. From our analysis, the elevated creep rates after the Landers can only be explained by static stress changes, indicating that even in the presence of dynamically triggered creep, static stress changes may have a long-lasting effect on SSAF creep rates.Plain Language Summary There are two significant conclusions from this study. First, we analyzed 25 years of InSAR measurements over the Southern San Andreas Fault system to document a major increase in the average creep rate following the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers Earthquake which is then followed by creep rate reductions after the 1999 Mw 7.1 Hector Mine Earthquake and the 2010 Mw 7.2 El Major Cucapah Earthquake. Second, we attribute all these creep rate changes to the Coulomb stress variations from these three major Earthquakes. The dynamic Coulomb stress changes are similar for all three events, contributing to triggered creep on the SSAF. In contrast, the static Coulomb stress changes on the SSAF are positive after the Landers and negative after the Hector Mine and El Major Cucapah, coinciding with the higher average creep rate after the Landers and lower rates after the other two events. An implication of this study is that small but steady Coulomb stress changes have a larger impact on shallow creep than the larger dynamic stress changes associated with passing seismic waves. These results illuminate the significance of time scale-dependent complexity of shallow fault creep and how these behaviors are communicated by stress perturbations from regional earthquakes.

TI  - A comparative assessment of SWAT-model-based evapotranspiration against regional-scale estimates
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - We attempted to assess the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates estimated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in an arid region by comparing other regional-based ETa estimates: the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) products, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration product (MOD16), and the Generalized Complementary Relationship (GCR) model. The results by the SWAT model clearly showed that ETa rates in the SWAT model are limited by soil water availability. From the comparison of the annual ETa estimates, the GCR model among those ETa estimation methods simulated slightly higher values than the water-balance derived ETa rates (i.e., the difference between annual precipitation and annual stream flow rates). The annual ETa rates of the SSEBop products showed the closest slope of the regression line to 1.0, while the highest R-2 (coefficient of determination) value was found from the annual ETa estimates by the SWAT model. The monthly ETa by the GCR model had the highest linear relationship with those of the SSEBop products. However, the SWAT model did not have a strong linear relationship with the monthly ETa of the SSEBop products unlike the comparison against the MOD16 products. This study recommends a further study on more reliable ETa estimates in arid or semi-arid regions by the SWAT model.

TI  - The Heart Sentinel™ app for detection and automatic alerting in cardiac arrest during outdoor sports: Field tests and ventricular fibrillation simulation results
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Heart Sentinel (TM) app (HS-app) is conceived to detect cardiac arrest during outdoor sports, automatically alerting contacts via SMS with GPS position data. It automatically starts the chain of survival in case no bystander has witnessed the event, using commercially-available chest strap heart monitor and a smartphone. The heart rate analysis arm of the algorithm is extremely sensitive, with specificity being addressed by motion analysis through smartphone sensors, since only unexpected prolonged absence of motion would confirm true cardiac arrest and start an alert code. We assessed the accuracy of such HS-app with simulated exercise-associated ventricular fibrillation (VF), and possible false positives in real-world athletes.Methods: The occurrence of false positive alerts was tested in the outdoor field, through athletes regularly running and cycling, and with ECG simulators. The occurrence of false negatives for VF detection was assessed with 3 different ECG simulators, using VF simulation protocols.Results: The false positive initiation of an alert countdown was recorded twice during 829 h of outdoor sports. Both athletes were able to stop such false positive 15-second countdown before the alert SMS was dispatched. No false positive SMS was dispatched. False negatives were not recorded under any simulation protocol.Conclusion: A simple smartphone app, using commercially-available heart rate monitors, is promising to detect cardiac arrest caused by VF during sports, triggering automatic dispatch of emergency SMS with GPS position. During outdoor exercise, HS-app would be helpful for cases of exercise-associated cardiac arrest. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Contributions of landscape heterogeneity within the footprint of eddy-covariance towers to flux measurements
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Flux measurements based on aerodynamic principles (e.g., eddy covariance method, or EC) assume the vegetation and landform within the footprint must be flat, large, and homogeneous, although very rarely do flux tower sites meet such requirements. Here, using two long term EC tower sites in Mongolian grasslands, we test a hypothesis that the magnitude and variation of EC flux measurements are partially dependent of landscape heterogeneity. We define landscape heterogeneity as the spatial composition and distribution of components within the footprint of a flux tower, which was quantified using high resolution WorldView-2 images to extract vegetation texture features (Contrast, Dissimilarity and Entropy). Bayesian analysis was performed to model the linkage of landscape heterogeneity with EC fluxes of CO2 in 8 intercardinal directions by dissecting it into 5 distances. We found that higher levels of landscape heterogeneity have an impact on flux measurements, especially under stable conditions. Specifically, a total of 24 Bayesian models based on the EVI-derived texture features passed the Gelman and Rubin convergence diagnostic statistic test. A positive relationship is shown between the percentage of footprint cover (Footprint%(sector)) and landscape texture features (Contrast and Dissimilarity), with the footprint cover acting as a function of heterogeneity under stable conditions. Negative effects were found when modeling CO2 flux (Fc(sector)) with Contrast under stable and unstable conditions, and with Dissimilarity and Entropy under stable conditions. With increases in high resolution remote sensing images and UAV technology (e.g., LiDAR), the results and approaches outlined in this study highlight new frontiers and opportunities for the FLUXNET community to integrate flux measurements and high-resolution remote sensing data, promoting a new generation of footprint models, and exploring the cohesive connections between flux measurements and the underlying processes (e.g., soil, physiological, ecosystem processes).

TI  - Statistical modelling of crop yield in Central Europe using climate data and remote sensing vegetation indices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, multiple linear regression models were constructed to simulate the yield of winter wheat, rapeseed, maize and sunflower in Hungary for the 2000-2016 time period. We used meteorological data and soil water content from meteorological reanalysis as predictors of the models in monthly resolution. We included annual fertilizer amount in the analysis to remove trend from the census data. We also used remote sensing based vegetation index to extend the approach for early crop yield forecast purposes and to study the added value of proxy data on the predictive power of the statistical models. Using a stepwise linear regression-like method the most appropriate models were selected based on the statistical evaluation of the model fitting. We provided simple equations with well interpretable coefficients that can estimate crop yield with high accuracy. Cross-validated explained variance were 67% for winter wheat, 76% for rapeseed, 81% for maize and 68.5% for sunflower. The modelling exercise showed that positive anomaly of minimum temperature in May has a substantial negative effect on the final crop yield for all four crops. For winter wheat increasing maximum temperature in May has a beneficial effect, while higher-than-usual vapour pressure deficit in May decreases yield. For maize soil water content in July and August is crucial in terms of the final yield. Incorporation of the vegetation index improved the predictive power of the models at country scale, with 10%, 2% and 4% for winter wheat, rapeseed and maize, respectively. At the county level, remote sensing data improved the overall predictive power of the models only for winter wheat. The results provide simple yet robust models for spatially explicit yield forecast as well as yield projection for the near future.

TI  - Adult gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis prevalence, incidence, treatment and syndromic case reporting in South Africa: Estimates using the Spectrum-STI model, 1990-2017
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo estimate trends in prevalence and incidence of syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia in adult men and women in South Africa.MethodsThe Spectrum-STI tool estimated trends in prevalence and incidence of active syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia, fitting South African prevalence data. Results were used, alongside programmatic surveillance data, to estimate trends in incident gonorrhea cases resistant to first-line treatment, and the reporting gap of symptomatic male gonorrhea and chlamydia cases treated but not reported as cases of urethritis syndrome.ResultsIn 2017 adult (15-49 years) the estimated female and male prevalences for syphilis were 0.50% (95% CI: 0.32-0.80%) and 0.97% (0.19-2.28%), for gonorrhea 6.6% (3.8-10.8%) and 3.5% (1.7-6.1%), and for chlamydia 14.7% (9.9-21%) and 6.0% (3.8-10.4%), respectively. Between 1990 and 2017 the estimated prevalence of syphilis declined steadily in women and men, probably in part reflecting improved treatment coverage. For gonorrhea and chlamydia, estimated prevalence and incidence showed no consistent time trend in either women or men. Despite growing annual numbers of gonorrhea cases - reflecting population growth - the estimated number of first line treatment-resistant gonorrhea cases did not increase between 2008 and 2017, owing to changes in first-line antimicrobial treatment regimens for gonorrhea in 2008 and 2014/5. Case reporting completeness among treated male urethritis syndrome episodes was estimated at 10-28% in 2017.ConclusionSouth Africa continues to suffer a high STI burden. Improvements in access and quality of maternal, STI and HIV health care services likely contributed to the decline in syphilis prevalence. The lack of any decline in gonorrhea and chlamydia prevalence highlights the need to enhance STI services beyond clinic-based syndromic case management, to reinvigorate primary STI and HIV prevention and, especially for women, to screen for asymptomatic infections.

T2  - CARBOHYDRATE POLYMERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases whose increasing concentration in the atmosphere can cause severe problems to both human health and wildlife. A simple ecofriendly procedure was developed to prepare zeolite-chitosan (ZY-CS) composite using solvent exchange followed by calcination for adsorption and chemical fixation of CO2. The as synthesized ZY-CS composite along with zeolite and chitosan were characterized by attenuated total reflection infrared, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms studies. The ZY-CS composite showed enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity compared with pure zeolite and chitosan. The composites also exhibited significant catalytic activity in the chemical fixation of CO2 into cyclic carbonates. This work is foreshadowing the prospect of ZY-CS composite in enhanced capture and catalytic activity in chemical fixation of CO2 for environmental applications.

TI  - An improved gridded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission inventory for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Delta region from 2001 to 2015 using satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - An improved gridded polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission inventory for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region from 2001 to 2015 was developed using satellite data. Despite rapid increases in energy consumption, the annual total emissions of the 16 PAHs showed overall decreasing trends, from a maximum of 5445 tin 2001 to a minimum of 2619 t in 2015, with the largest decline (84.6%) observed in the residential sector. Different spatial allocation methods used in gridded PAH emission inventories have substantial influences on the distributions of PAHs; therefore, we improved the accuracy of the spatial allocation of industrial and open biomass burning PAH emissions using various satellite data. The gridded secondary and tertiary industrial GDP (GDP(23)) calculated using corrected nighttime light data was the best spatial proxy for the spatial allocation of industrial PAH emissions in the YRD region. We generated a gridded burned area for 2001-2015 by coupling the MCD64A1 and MCD14ML fire products, which was used to allocate PAH emissions from open biomass burning. Finally, we found that changes in the spatial distribution of PAH emissions were mainly driven by energy consumption and degree of technological advancement in different regions during 2001-2015.

TI  - Generalized FPAR estimation methods from various satellite sensors and validation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) is a key parameter in ecosystem productivity and carbon balance estimation. FPAR can be estimated from various satellite images but its product might have significant differences due to the usage of various algorithms. This work proposes a generalized FPAR retrieval method for Landsat 5/ Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +), Landsat 8/ Operational Land Imager (OLI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS), Advanced Spacebome Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), SPOT/VEGETATION, and HJ-1/CCD in the form of two linear models, namely, the BOA (bottom of atmosphere) model and the TOA (top of atmosphere) model, to reduce FPAR discrepancy among sensors. The BOA model estimates canopy FPAR from land surface multiband reflectance after atmospheric correction, whereas the TOA model estimates FPAR from apparent multiband reflectance at the TOA. Analysis results found that the FPAR errors from the BOA and TOA models were approximately 0.03 and 0.06, respectively, and the difference among FPAR estimated from different sensors was turned out to be less than 0.015 in theory. In addition, the FPAR difference between the two models was generally small, especially under low aerosol optical depth (AOD) and densely vegetated conditions. Ground validation using the datasets from the Hi WATER and Validation of Land European Remote Sensing Instruments (VALERO programs showed that the FPAR errors were 0.16 and 0.18 for the BOA and TOA models, respectively, which might be affected by the time interval of ground and satellite observation, spatial scale effect, and atmospheric correction errors. Moreover, this paper applied the new methods to estimate FPAR in different dates at the Heihe River basin and conduct a cross-comparison of FPAR from various sensors, and consequently obtained acceptable results.

TI  - Spatial-temporal consistency between gross primary productivity and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence of vegetation in China during 2007-2014
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating spatial-temporal patterns of gross primary production (GPP) is important for the global carbon cycle. Satellite-based light use efficiency (LUE) models are regarded as an efficient tool in simulating spatial-temporal dynamics of GPP. However, the accuracy assessment of GPP simulations from LUE models at both spatial and temporal scales remains a challenge. In this study, we simulated GPP of vegetation in China during 2007-2014 using a LUE model (Vegetation Photosynthesis Model, VPM) based on MODIS (moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer) images with 8-day temporal and 500-m spatial resolutions and NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) climate data. Global Ozone Monitoring Instrument 2 (GOME-2) solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data were used to compare with VPM simulated GPP (GPP(VPM)) temporally and spatially using linear correlation analysis. Significant positive linear correlations exist between monthly GPP(VPM) and SIF data over a single year (2010) and multiple years (2007-2014) inmost areas of China. GPP(VPM) is also significantly positive correlated with GOME-2 SIF (R-2 > 0.43) spatially for seasonal scales. However, poor consistency was detected between GPP(VPM) and SIF data at yearly scale. GPP dynamic trends have high spatial-temporal variation in China during 2007-2014. Temperature, leaf area index (LAI), and precipitation are the most important factors influence GPP(VPM) in the regions of East Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Loss Plateau, and Southwestern China, respectively. The results of this study indicate that GPP(VPM) is temporally and spatially in line with GOME-2 SIF data, and space-borne SIF data have great potential for evaluating LUE-based GPP models.

TI  - DePhine - The Deimos and Phobos Interior Explorer
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - DePhine - Deimos and Phobos Interior Explorer - is a mission proposed in the context of ESA's Cosmic Vision program, for launch in 2030. The mission will explore the origin and the evolution of the two Martian satellites, by focusing on their interior structures and diversity, by addressing the following open questions: Are Phobos and Deimos true siblings, originating from the same source and sharing the same formation scenario? Are the satellites rubble piles or solid bodies? Do they possess hidden deposits of water ice in their interiors? The DePhine spacecraft will be inserted into Mars transfer and will initially enter a Deimos quasi-satellite orbit to carry out a comprehensive global mapping. The goal is to obtain physical parameters and remote sensing data for Deimos comparable to data expected to be available for Phobos at the time of the DePhine mission for comparative studies. As a highlight of the mission, close flybys will be performed at low velocities, which will increase data integration times, enhance the signal strength and data resolution. 10-20 flyby sequences, including polar passes, will result in a dense global grid of observation tracks. The spacecraft orbit will then be changed into a Phobos resonance orbit to carry out multiple close flybys and to perform similar remote sensing as for Deimos. The spacecraft will carry a suite of remote sensing instruments, including a camera system, a radio science experiment, a high-frequency radar, a magnetometer, and a Gamma Ray/Neutron Detector. A steerable antenna will allow simultaneous radio tracking and remote sensing observations (which is technically not possible for Mars Express). Additional instrumentation, e.g. a dust detector and a solar wind sensor, will address further science goals of the mission. If Ariane 6-2 and higher lift performance are available for launch (the baseline mission assumes a launch on a Soyuz Fregat), we expect to have greater spacecraft mobility and possibly added payloads.

A simple sol-gel method was used to synthesize the orthorhombic crystalline phase of bismuth titanate perovskite, i.e., Bi4Ti3O12 (BiTO). A single FY-PNG device generated a maximum peak-to-peak open-circuit voltage (VOC(P-P)), short-circuit current (ISC(P-P)), and instantaneous area power density of 60 V, 400 nA, and 18.5 mW/m(2), respectively, upon application of a 1 N periodic mechanical load. The switching polarity of the FY-PNG demonstrated good phase shifting between the output signals and confirmed that the output derived from the device and not from any external sources. The working mechanism, electrical poling effect, force analysis, repeatability, stability, charging, energy storage analysis, and sensitivity to biomechanical force of the FY-PNG was thoroughly investigated. The FY-PNG device output was used to power five commercial green light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and a display system. Additionally, a non-invasive self-powered breathing sensor (SPBS) was developed to monitor human inhalation/exhalation. The repeatability and reproducibility of SPBS evaluated using different devices and test subjects demonstrated a good variation in output (i.e., 0.2-0.4 V) for inhalation/exhalation; the SPBS was also evaluated under slow/fast and constant breathing conditions. The proposed brush-coating technique for FY-PNGs is an efficient, cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easily scalable technique that can pave the way to the design of novel-shaped PNG devices for applications such as implantable self-powered biosensors and automotive electronic systems.

TI  - Improved kernel-driven semi-empirical bidirectional reflectance factor models for characterizing the reflection of vegetation covers: Considering a specular kernel
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The kernel-driven semi-empirical BRF (bidirectional reflectance factor) model has been one of the most effective methods for characterizing the distribution of reflection from vegetation covers and it has been used in applications at the regional and global scale. However, our measured BRFs of vegetation cover exhibit a strong forward scattering peak in visible wavelengths and cannot match the model results well. Subsequently, a specular kernel is proposed for inclusion in current BRF models. The advantage of BRF models with a specular kernel is that they can model the reflection peak in the forward scattering, which leads to a notably increased match between modeled BRFs and measured BRFs of vegetation covers at visible wavelengths, and it does not influence the hot spot results of vegetation covers in the backward scattering direction. Moreover, its disadvantage is that the improved BRF models become non-linear models and have two additional free parameters. This relatively simple improvement for BRF models presented here may provide a useful method for describing the reflection of vegetation covers dominated by specular reflection and for characterizing the reflection of vegetation covers with a backward scattering feature.

TI  - Comparative orchestrating response of four oilseed rape (<i>Brassica napus</i>) cultivars against the selenium stress as revealed by physio-chemical, ultrastructural and molecular profiling
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Selenium (Se) is an essential micro-element for human and animals. In higher plants, Se essentiality or phytotoxicity is less explored. Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of Se (0, 25, 50, and 100 mu M) as sodium selenite on the physio-chemical, cell ultra-structural and genomic alterations in hydroponically grown seedlings of four cultivars of B. napus (cvs. Zheda 619, Zheda 622, ZS 758, and ZY 50). Results showed that excessive (100 mu M) Se (IV) exhibited significant reduction in plant growth parameters, declined pigment contents, lower water-soluble protein levels, and overproduction of H2O2 and MDA contents. A significant increase in antioxidant enzyme activities and transcript levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and glutathione reductase (GR), except catalase (CAT) were noticed in the leaves and roots. Non-enzymatic antioxidants including glutathione (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG), except GSSG in roots were enhanced under higher Se (IV) levels. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed the ultrastructural damages in leaf mesophyll and root tip cells induced by excessive Se (IV). Less-significant phytotoxic effects were observed in above-mentioned parameters at 50 mu M Se (IV). Overall, Se (IV) supplementation at 25 mu M displayed marginal beneficial effect by enhancing plant growth, pigment contents, protein levels and restrict H(2)O(2 )and MDA overproduction. A marginal increase/decrease in ROS-detoxifying enzymes (except CAT activity) and elevated GSH and GSSG levels were noticed. The accumulation of Se (IV) was much higher in roots as compared to leaves. This accumulation was maximum in Zheda 622 and minimum in ZS 758, followed by Zheda 619 and ZY 50. Overall findings showed that Zheda 622 was the most sensitive and ZS 758 as most tolerant to Se (IV) phyto-toxicity. In addition, Se (IV) was found beneficial until 25 mu M Se (IV) but phytotoxic at higher Se levels especially at 100 mu M Se (IV).

TI  - Coastal warming and wind-driven upwelling: A global analysis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term sea surface temperature (SST) warming trends are far from being homogeneous, especially when coastal and ocean locations are compared. Using data from NOAA's AVHRR OISST, we have analyzed sea surface temperature trends over the period 1982-2015 at around 3500worldwide coastal points and their oceanic counterparts with a spatial resolution of 0.25 arc-degrees. Significant warming was observed at most locations although with important differences between oceanic and coastal points. This is especially patent for upwelling regions, where 92% of the coastal locations showed lower warming trends than at neighboring ocean locations. This result strongly suggests that upwelling has the potential to buffer the effects of global warming nearshore, with wide oceanographic, climatic, and biogeographic implications.

TI  - Approach for recognizing and tracking beacon in inter-satellite optical communication based on optical flow method
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In inter-satellite laser communication systems, accurate positioning of the beacon is essential for establishing a steady laser communication link. For inter-satellite optical communication, the main factor affecting the acquisition and tracking of the beacon is the background noise, such as stellar background light. In this study, we considered the effect of the background noise on a beacon in inter-satellite optical communication and proposed a new recognition algorithm for the beacon, which uses the optical flow vector obtained from the image data. We verified the feasibility of this method by performing simulation analysis and experiments. Both simulation and experiments showed that the new algorithm could accurately obtain the position of the centroid of the beacon under the effect of the background light. Furthermore, considering the identification probability of a light spot through the background light, the locating accuracy of the new algorithm was higher than that of the conventional gray centroid algorithm. Therefore, this new approach would be beneficial for the design of satellite-to-ground optical communication systems.

TI  - Impacts of coastal reclamation on wetlands: Loss, resilience, and sustainable management
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands are some of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth because they provide many ecological services for coastal security. However, these wetlands are seriously threatened by accelerated climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities. To understand the impacts of land reclamation on landscape change of coastal wetlands and the long-term effects of disturbances of coastal wetlands on their sustainable management, we used time-series Landsat imagery with an object-oriented classification and Digital Shoreline Analysis System to map wetland changes within a reclaimed area in the Pudong District (PD), in Shanghai, China. Our analysis indicated that from 1989 to 2013, 19,793.4 ha of coastal wetlands have been changed to inland wetlands enclosed by a seawall and dike since 1989, thereby cutting off the exchange of sediment and water flux between the wetlands and the coastal ocean. Subsequently, under the increasing threats of anthropogenic activities, the wetland ecosystem collapsed sharply, in a transformation chain of inland wetland (fresh swamp), artificial wetland (agriculture and aquaculture wetland), and non-wetland (urban land). Under this explosive utilization following coastal reclamation, only 8.9% of natural wetlands remain in the reclaimed area, which has experienced an average annual wetland loss rate of 3.8% over the past 24 years. More than 80% of the wetlands have been developed for agricultural, industrial, and urban land uses, leading to an enormous loss of associated ecological services benefits arising from the ecological functions provided by wetland ecosystems, thereby undermining the coastal protection these wetlands provided. Nevertheless, considerable regeneration of wetlands occurred because of their inherent resilience. This paper addresses the importance of maintaining a balance between economic growth and coastal ecological protection for sustainable management. It proposes a strategy for how ecosystem-based land planning and ecological engineering should be applied to ensure the effective and sustainable management of living shorelines so that the benefits of healthy ecological functions accrue to coastal ecosystems.

TI  - Detection of hydrological variations and their impacts on vegetation from multiple satellite observations in the Three-River Source Region of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Source Region (TRSR) of the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is regarded as the "Chinese water tower". Climate warming and the associated degradation of permafrost might change the water cycle and affect the alpine vegetation growth in the TRSR. However, the quantitative changes in the water budget and their impacts on the vegetation in the TRSR are poorly understood. In this study, the spatial-temporal changes in the hydrological variables and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) during 2003-2014 were investigated using multiple satellite data and a remote sensing energy balance model. The results indicated that precipitation showed an increasing trend at a rate of 14.0 mm 10 a(-1), and evapotranspiration (ET) showed a slight decreasing trend. The GRACE-derived total water storage (TWS) change presented a significant increasing trend at a rate of 35.1 mm a(-1). The change in groundwater (GW) which showed an increasing trend at a rate of 18.5 mm a(-1), was estimated by water budget. The time lag of the GRACE-TWS that was influenced by precipitation was more obviously than was the GLDAS-SM(Soil Moisture) change. The vegetation in the TRSR was greening during the study period, and the accumulation of the NDVI increased rapidly after 2008. The effect of total TWS and GLDAS-SM on vegetation was considerably more than that the effects of other factors in this region. It was concluded that the hydrological cycle had obviously changed and that more soil water was transferred into the GW since the aquiclude changed due to climate warming. The increasing area and number of lakes and the thickening of the active layer in the permafrost area led to the greater infiltration of surface water into the groundwater, which resulted in increased water storage.

TI  - Cloud fraction determined by thermal infrared and visible all-sky cameras
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal infrared cloud camera (IRCCAM) is a prototype instrument that determines cloud fraction continuously during daytime and night-time using measurements of the absolute thermal sky radiance distributions in the 8-14 mu m wavelength range in conjunction with clear-sky radiative transfer modelling. Over a time period of 2 years, the fractional cloud coverage obtained by the IRCCAM is compared with two commercial cameras (Mobotix Q24M and Schreder VIS -J1006) sensitive in the visible spectrum, as well as with the automated partial cloud amount detection algorithm (APCADA) using pyrgeometer data. Over the 2-year period, the cloud fractions determined by the IRCCAM and the visible all-sky cameras are consistent to within 2 oktas (0.25 cloud fraction) for 90 % of the data set during the day, while for day- and night-time data the comparison with the APCADA algorithm yields an agreement of 80 %. These results are independent of cloud types with the exception of thin cirrus clouds, which are not detected as consistently by the current cloud algorithm of the IRCCAM. The measured absolute sky radiance distributions also provide the potential for future applications by being combined with ancillary meteorological data from radiosondes and ceilometers.

TI  - Predictive performance of regression models to estimate Chlorophyll-a concentration based on Landsat imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration is a key parameter to describe water quality in marine and freshwater environments. Nowadays, several products with Chl-a have derived from satellite imagery, but they are not available or reliable sometimes for coastal and/or small water bodies. Thus, in the last decade several methods have been described to estimate Chl-a with high-resolution (30 m) satellite imagery, such as Landsat, but a standardized method to estimate Chl-a from Landsat imagery has not been accepted yet. Therefore, this study evaluated the predictive performance of regression models (Simple Linear Regression [SLR], Multiple Linear Regression [MLR] and Generalized Additive Models [GAMs]) to estimate Chl-a based on Landsat imagery, using in situ Chl-a data collected (synchronized with the overpass of Landsat 8 satellite) and spectral reflectance in the visible light portion (bands 1-4) and near infrared (band 5). These bands were selected because of Chl-a absorbance/ reflectance properties in these wavelengths. According to goodness of fit, GAM outperformed SLR and MLR. However, the model validation showed that MLR performed better in predicting log-transformed Chl-a. Thus, MLR, constructed by using four spectral bands (1, 2, 3, and 5), was considered the best method to predict Chl-a. The coefficients of this model suggested that log-transformed Chl-a concentration had a positive linear relationship with bands 1 (coastal/aerosol), 3 (green), and 5 (NIR). On the other hand, band 2 (blue) suggested a negative relationship, which implied high coherence with Chl-a absorbance/ reflectance properties measured in the laboratory, indicating that Landsat 8 images could be applied effectively to estimate Chl-a concentrations in coastal environments.

TI  - Beliefs about people with albinism in Uganda: A qualitative study using the Common-Sense Model
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Albinism includes a group of inherited conditions that result in reduced melanin production. It has been documented across the world, with a high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa. There is very little published research about the lives of people with albinism, but available evidence shows that myths abound regarding their condition. They are feared, viewed with suspicion and believed to have supernatural powers. In this study we explored the links between beliefs, myths, traditions and positive/negative attitudes that surround people with albinism in Uganda. The study was located philosophically within Ubuntu-an-Afrocentric worldview-and theoretically within the Common-Sense Model of self-regulation of health and illness that originates from the work of Leventhal in 2003. This qualitative study took place in eight districts of Busoga sub-region, Uganda between 2015 and 2017. Data collection comprised eight group discussions and 17 individual interviews with a range of informants, capturing the viewpoints of 73 participants. Findings lend support to previous research, highlighting the lifetime discrimination and disadvantage experienced by many people with albinism. It shows that there is still much to be done to address the pervasive and potentially harmful beliefs and misconceptions about people with albinism.

TI  - Tropical climate-vegetation-fire relationships: multivariate evaluation of the land surface model JSBACH
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The interactions between climate, vegetation and fire can strongly influence the future trajectories of vegetation in Earth system models. We evaluate the relationships between tropical climate, vegetation and fire in the global vegetation model JSBACH, using a simple fire scheme and the complex fire model SPITFIRE with the aim to identify potential for model improvement. We use two remote-sensing products (based on MODIS and Landsat) in different resolutions to assess the robustness of the obtained observed relationships. We evaluate the model using a multivariate comparison that allows us to focus on the interactions between climate, vegetation and fire and test the influence of land use change on the modelled patterns. Climate-vegetation-fire relationships are known to differ between continents; we therefore perform the analysis for each continent separately.The observed relationships are similar in the two satellite data sets, but maximum tree cover is reached at higher precipitation values for coarser resolution. This shows that the spatial scale of models and data needs to be consistent for meaningful comparisons. The model captures the broad spatial patterns with regional differences, which are partly due to the climate forcing derived from an Earth system model. Compared to the simple fire scheme, SPITFIRE strongly improves the spatial pattern of burned area and the distribution of burned area along increasing precipitation. The correlation between precipitation and tree cover is higher in the observations than in the largely climate-driven vegetation model, with both fire models. The multivariate comparison identifies excessive tree cover in low-precipitation areas and a too-strong relationship between high fire occurrence and low tree cover for the complex fire model. We therefore suggest that drought effects on tree cover and the impact of burned area on tree cover or the adaptation of trees to fire can be improved.The observed variation in the relationship between precipitation and maximum tree cover between continents is higher than the simulated one. Land use contributes to the intercontinental differences in fire regimes with SPITFIRE and strongly overprints the modelled multimodality of tree cover with SPITFIRE.The multivariate model-data comparison used here has several advantages: it improves the attribution of model-data mismatches to model processes, it reduces the impact of biases in the meteorological forcing on the evaluation and it allows us to evaluate not only a specific target variable but also the interactions.

TI  - Identifying key bird species and geographical hotspots of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In China since the first human infection of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus was identified in 2013, it has caused serious public health concerns due to its wide spread and high mortality rate. Evidence shows that bird migration plays an essential role in global spread of avian influenza viruses. Accordingly, in this paper, we aim to identify key bird species and geographical hotspots that are relevant to the transmission of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China.Methods: We first conducted phylogenetic analysis on 626 viral sequences of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus isolated in chicken, which were collected from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), to reveal geographical spread and molecular evolution of the virus in China. Then, we adopted the cross correlation function (CCF) to explore the relationship between the identified influenza A (H7N9) cases and the spatiotemporal distribution of migratory birds. Here, the spatiotemporal distribution of bird species was generated based on bird observation data collected from China Bird Reports, which consists of 157272 observation records about 1145 bird species. Finally, we employed a kernel density estimator to identify geographical hotspots of bird habitat/stopover that are relevant to the influenza A (H7N9) infections.Results: Phylogenetic analysis reveals the evolutionary and geographical patterns of influenza A (H7N9) infections, where cases in the same or nearby municipality/provinces are clustered together with small evolutionary differences. Moreover, three epidemic waves in chicken along the East Asian-Australasian flyway in China are distinguished from the phylogenetic tree. The CCF analysis identifies possible migratory bird species that are relevant to the influenza A(H7N9) infections in Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Guangdong in China, where the six municipality/provinces account for 91.2% of the total number of isolated H7N9 cases in chicken in GISAID. Based on the spatial distribution of identified bird species, geographical hotspots are further estimated and illustrated within these typical municipality/provinces.Conclusions: In this paper, we have identified key bird species and geographical hotspots that are relevant to the spread of influenza A (H7N9) virus. The results and findings could provide sentinel signal and evidence for active surveillance, as well as strategic control of influenza A (H7N9) transmission in China.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of urban surface evapotranspiration based on a modified Penman-Monteith model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, remote sensing-based algorithms for inferring urban surface evapotranspiration (ET) remain little studied. Based on the modifications of the remote sensing Penman-Monteith (RS-PM) model, we propose an urban RS-PM model for estimating urban surface ET. Compared with the traditional RS-PM model, our urban RS-PM model is specifically developed for urban areas and is characterized by the following improvements: (1) excluding the interference of impervious surface components in urban areas by replacing the vegetation cover fraction index with land surface component fraction parameters inversed through linear spectral mixture analysis for calculating the area proportions of vegetation and soil; (2) considering the effect of the component fractions of vegetation or soil on all energy components of the surface energy balance by applying the modified multisource parallel model for estimating the component latent heat flux; and (3) optimizing the calculation of the component net radiation flux by considering the component surface characteristics. This urban RS-PM model was tested on an urban area of Xuzhou in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu. Landsat 8 operational land imager and thermal infrared sensor satellite images acquired between 2014 and 2016, together with their corresponding meteorological data and flux observation data, were used for estimating the ET of the study area for eight dates with the model. The results were validated by the latent heat flux data observed by an open path eddy covariance system. Validation shows the goodness of fit (R-2), the root-mean-square error, the mean relative error, and the correlation coefficient (r) between estimated ET and observed ET for the eight dates were 0.8965, 24.14 W.m(-2), 18.5%, and 0.9546, respectively. The results prove that the urban RS-PM model is effective in estimating ET of urban areas with an acceptable accuracy. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Dissolved organic carbon in glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau: Insights into concentrations and possible sources
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) released from glaciers has an important role in the biogeochemistry of glacial ecosystems. This study focuses on DOC from glaciers of the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, where glaciers are experiencing rapid shrinkage. We found that concentrations of DOC in snowpits (0.16 +/- 0.054 mu g g(-1)), aged snow (0.16 +/- 0.048 mu g g(-1)), and bare ice (0.18 +/- 0.082 mu g g(-1)) were similar across the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, but were slightly lower than those in other glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Vertical variations of DOC, particulate organic carbon, black carbon, and total nitrate in snowpit showed no systematic variations in the studied glaciers, with high values of DOC occurring in the ice or dusty layers. We estimated the export of DOC and particulate organic carbon from glaciers to be 1.96 +/- 0.66 Gg yr(-1) and 5.88 +/- 2.15 Gg yr(-1) in this region, respectively, indicating that organic carbon released from glacier meltwater may be affecting downstream ecosystems. Potential sources of the air masses arriving at the southeastern Tibetan glaciers include South Asia, Central Asia, Middle East, and northwest China. Emissions from biomass burning of South Asia played an important role in the deposition of DOC to the glacier, which can be evidenced by backward trajectories and fire spot distributions from MODIS and CALIPSO images. Our findings suggest that anthropogenic aerosols contribute abundant DOC to glaciers on the southeastern Tibetan Plateau. The pronounced rate of glacial melting in the region may be delivering increased quantities of relic DOC to downstream rivers.

TI  - Correction of the Adjacency Effect for GF-1 Image in Coastal Waters of Taihu Lake
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - For coastal waters, the radiation signal received by a sensor is affected by the high reflectance of the terrestrial land, which can result in a reduced image contrast and significant adjacency effect. Eliminating atmospheric attenuation and the adjacency effect and obtaining accurate water surface reflectance arc important prerequisites for quantitative water color remote sensing. Based on the in situ spectral data of the coastal waters of Taihu Lake on April 29, 2016 and a synchronous Gaofcn-1 wide field of view (GF-1/WFV) image, the 6S model was used to eliminate atmospheric attenuation, and a nuclear function is used to express the atmospheric point spread function to correct the adjacency effect. The experimental results show that the image after correcting the adjacency effect is clearer with an increased contrast and more abundant information regarding the water body. Compared with the correction results of the 6S model, the average relative errors of the three in situ synchronous samples after correcting the adjacency effect arc reduced by 10.8%, 5.24%, and 10.39%, respectively. Correcting the adjacency effect improves the accuracy of radiation detection of the remote sensing reflectance above water surface.

TI  - Pseudoinvariant feature selection for cross-sensor optical satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Processing of multitemporal satellite images generally suffers from uncertainties caused by differences in illumination and observation angles, as well as variation in atmospheric conditions. Moreover, satellite images acquired from different sensors contain not only the uncertainties but also disparate relative spectral response. Given that radiometric calibration and correction of satellite images are difficult without ground measurements during data acquisition, this study addresses pseudoinvariant feature selection for relative radiometric normalization (RRN) that minimizes the radiometric differences among images caused by atmospheric and spectral band inconsistencies during data acquisition. The key to a successful RRN is the selection of pseudoinvariant features (PIFs) among bitemporal images. To select PIFs, multivariate alteration detection (MAD) algorithm is adopted with kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) instead of canonical correlation analysis (CCA). KCCA, which assumes that the relation between at-sensor radiance is spatially nonlinear, can obtain more appropriate PIFs for cross-sensor images than that of CCA, which assumes that the relation between the at-sensor radiances of bitemporal image is spatially linear. In addition, a regularization term is added to the optimization of KCCA to avoid trivial solutions and overfitting. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on bitemporal images acquired by Landsat-7 enhanced thematic mapper plus and Landsat-8 operational and imager sensors were conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed KCCA-based MAD to the CCA-based MAD in terms of PIF selection, particularly for images containing significant cloud covers.

TI  - Analysis of WorldView-2 band importance in tree species classification based on recursive feature elimination
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In tree species classifications, different spectral bands feature different importance, and the manner of determining the importance of one band is a problem that needs to be solved. In this study, eight bands of the WorldView-2 fusion data were used as information sources, and a recursive feature elimination based on maximum likelihood (MLC-RFE) was used to sort the importance of these bands. According to the results, the importance of the eight bands was sorted as follows (from important to unimportant): near-infrared 2 > red edge > yellow > red > near-infrared 1 > coastal blue > green > blue. The poorest band combination yielded the lowest overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient (40.9153%; 0.3080), whereas the optimal band combination presented the highest OA and Kappa coefficient (74.5479%; 0.7029), indicating the large difference in accuracies between the optimal and poorest band combinations. Therefore, selecting important bands bears significance in tree species classifications. The MLC-RFE method significantly solved the band selection problem. Thus, this method should be extended to more complex feature selections.

TI  - Identification of weather events from INSAT-3D RGB scheme using RAPID tool
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time analysis of products and information dissemination (RAPID), a web-based quick visualization and analysis tool for INSAT satellite data has been presented for identification of weather events. The combination of channels using red-green-blue (RGB) composites of INSAT-3D satellite and its physical significant value content is presented. The solar reflectance and brightness temperatures are the major components of this scheme. The shortwave thermal infrared (1.6 mu m), visible (0.5 mu m) and thermal IR channels (10.8 mu m) representing cloud microstructure is known as Day Microphysics (DMP) and the brightness temperature (BT) differences between 10.8, 12.0 and 3.9 mu m is referred to as Night Microphysics (NMP). The thresholds technique have been developed separately for both the RGB products of two years (2015-17 of December to February) of data for the identification of fog, snow and low clouds. The validation of these thresholds has been carried out against in situ visibility data from IMD observatories. The RGBs, i.e. DMP and NMP have a reasonable good agreement with ground-based observations and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. This threshold technique yields a very good probability of fog detection more than 94% and 85% with acceptable false alarm conditions less than 8% and 10% for DMP and NMP respectively. The technique has significantly minimized the misclassification between low clouds, snow, and fog and found useful for day-to-day weather forecast.

TI  - Assessment of cross-sensor vegetation index compatibility between VIIRS and MODIS using near-coincident observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-sensor compatibility of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) between Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) was investigated using their near-coincident observation pairs obtained along overlapped orbital tracks across the globe for the year 2015. The "top-of-atmosphere (TOA)" and "top-of-canopy (TOC)" normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs), TOC-enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and TOC two-band EVI (EVI2) were investigated. For all four VIs, VIIRS and MODIS VIs were subject to systematic differences in which VIIRS VIs were higher than their MODIS counterparts. The overall systematic differences and uncertainties (measured as mean differences and root mean square differences, respectively) were small (0.010 to 0.020 VI units and 0.015 to 0.022 VI units, respectively). TOA NDVI cross-sensor differences were neither seasonally nor view zenith angle dependent, whereas TOC NDVI cross-sensor differences slightly varied seasonally, but were not view zenith angle dependent. TOC EVI and TOC EVI2 cross-sensor differences were view zenith angle dependent, where systematic differences increased with increasing view zenith angle and, for large view zenith angles, they were higher during the summer seasons. These results support the normalization of view zenith angles as a required step to extend the MODIS VI record with VIIRS data. (C) The Authors.

TI  - A consistent glacier inventory for Karakoram and Pamir derived from Landsat data: distribution of debris cover and mapping challenges
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge about the coverage and characteristics of glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) is still incomplete and heterogeneous. However, several applications, such as modelling of past or future glacier development, run-off, or glacier volume, rely on the existence and accessibility of complete datasets. In particular, precise outlines of glacier extent are required to spatially constrain glacier-specific calculations such as length, area, and volume changes or flow velocities. As a contribution to the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) and the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) glacier database, we have produced a homogeneous inventory of the Pamir and the Karakoram mountain ranges using 28 Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes acquired around the year 2000. We applied a standardized method of automated digital glacier mapping and manual correction using coherence images from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite 1 (ALOS-1) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 1 (PALSAR-1) as an additional source of information; we then (i) separated the glacier complexes into individual glaciers using drainage divides derived by watershed analysis from the ASTER global digital elevation model version 2 (GDEM2) and (ii) separately delineated all debris-covered areas. Assessment of uncertainties was performed for debris-covered and clean-ice glacier parts using the buffer method and independent multiple digitizing of three glaciers representing key challenges such as shadows and debris cover. Indeed, along with seasonal snow at high elevations, shadow and debris cover represent the largest uncertainties in our final dataset. In total, we mapped more than 27 800 glaciers > 0.02 km(2) covering an area of 35 520 +/- 1948 km(2) and an elevation range from 2260 to 8600 m. Regional median glacier elevations vary from 4150 m (Pamir Alai) to almost 5400 m (Karakoram), which is largely due to differences in temperature and precipitation. Supraglacial debris covers an area of 3587 +/- 662 km(2), i.e. 10 % of the total glacierized area. Larger glaciers have a higher share in debris-covered area (up to > 20 %), making it an important factor to be considered in subsequent applications.

TI  - Estimation of molecular column density of methane (<i>X</i>CH<sub>4</sub>) using AVIRIS-NG data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An attempt has been made to retrieve columnar density of methane (XCH4) over a suburban area of the Shadnagar in India from the high spatial and moderate spectral resolution (5 nm +/- 0.5 nm) airborne visible/infrared imaging spectrometer next generation (AVIRIS-NG) data. The data collected were part of the joint airborne campaign by National Aeronautics Space Administration/Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Indian Space Research Organisation over several Indian sites during December 2015 to January 2016. The XCH4 was retrieved following the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) water vapor retrieval algorithm and was compared with the ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) observations. FTIR measured CH4 transmittance was fitted against Fast Atmospheric Signature Code3 (FASCODE3) simulated transmittance, and found their residual lies within +/- 1%, which shows a very good retrieval sensitivity of FTIR. Hence FTIR observations are used for the validation of AVIRIS-NG derived XCH4 and found in good agreement. In the present study, we utilized airborne imaging radiance data in the CH4 absorbing channel at 2.365 +/- 0.006 mu m and nonabsorbing channels at 2.325 +/- 0.006 mu m and 2.365 +/- 0.006 mu m to compute atmospheric transmittance spectrum. Using a line-by-line radiative transfer algorithm, the XCH4 was estimated from AVIRIS-NG transmittance data. Prior to the application of the MODIS water vapor algorithm on AVIRIS-NG transmittance, it was also compared with the FASCODE3 simulated transmittance and found comparable. Study revealed that within the Shadnagar region, retrieved XCH4 varies little to moderate with an average of 9 x 10(27) molecules cm(-2) with the highest value of 12 x 10(27) molecules cm(-2) near the source region of the agriculture field. The study demonstrates the capability of AVIRIS-NG to quantify the column density of atmospheric species such as CH4 over a region. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Effects of solar radiation and correction of surface temperature by net radiation estimates in northern Pantanal
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net radiation (Rn) is a critical variable in estimating energy balance and evapotranspiration by remote sensing techniques on a regional scale. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of estimated and measured instantaneous solar radiation (Rg) and the atmospheric correction of surface temperature by Landsat 8 images on the estimated surface Rn in northern Pantanal. Rn and meteorological factors were measured on a floodplain and on two nonflooded areas in northern Pantanal. Rg was estimated by models proposed by Zillman et al. (Rg(Zillman)) and Allen et al. (Rg(Allen)). Surface temperature was corrected by atmospheric and emissivity effects. Annual and seasonal averages of solar radiation were not different among the experimental sites. The floodplain area featured higher net radiation than both nonflooded areas. Instantaneous Rn-inst estimated by measured Rg and with Rg(Allen) were not different from measured Rn-inst. Rn-inst estimated by surface temperature was, on average, 5.7% higher, with a 22% error lower than Rn-inst estimated with brightness temperature. The current study highlights the possibility of estimating Rn-inst by Rg(Allen) and the need for correcting the effect of the atmosphere and surface emissivity to estimate surface temperature and Rn-inst.

TI  - Mapping invasion potential using ensemble modelling. A case study on <i>Yushania maling</i> in the Darjeeling Himalayas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasion is considered the subsequent most important threat to biodiversity after habitat destruction and is documented as a main cause of global biodiversity loss and species extinction. Species distribution models can be used to identify areas that are at risk for invasions by harmful invasive alien species (IAS) if IAS have not yet spread to all suitable habitats. We tested the potential of combining two or more independent but complementary modelling methods to enhance the accuracy of spatial predictions. We used the modelling tools Maxent, GARP and BIOCLIM with presence-only data of the IAS Yushania maling (Maling bamboo), from Darjeeling, Himalaya to develop distribution maps. Modelling tools were chosen based on their performance with presence-only data (Area under curve (AUC) > 0.7) as well as their differences in underlying modelling concept and statistics. The models combine occurrence records with topographic, climatic, and vegetative predictors derived from satellite data. By combining the 3 selected models in an ensemble approach we were able to minimize the spatial uncertainty related to suitable habitat prediction for Yushania maling. While both GARP and BIOCLIM consistently performed at an AUC > 0.7, both our ensemble model and Maxent performed better with an AUC of 0.95 and 0.94 respectively. Moderately and highly suitable habitats for Yushania maling predicted by models correlated well with survey records except for GARP, where we found the model to over-predict suitability outside of the species' known ecological niche. Our findings identify the best modelling approach enhancing overall explanatory power of habitat suitability models. Our findings show that an ensemble approach should be used to ensure appropriate mitigation measures are applied in the appropriate places, enhancing overall effectiveness both ecologically as well as economically. It was shown that Yushania maling is indeed a threat to the ecosystems in the region, and while the species' potential habitat may decrease in some areas with climate change, other areas will become more suitable for it.

TI  - Improvement of Universal Dynamic Threshold Cloud Detection Algorithm and Its Application in High Resolution Satellite
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - With the support of a pre-calculated land surface reflectance database, the universal dynamic threshold cloud detection algorithm (UDTCDA) can significantly improve the cloud detection accuracy of satellite data. To further improve its precision in the application of cloud detection for high spatial -resolution satellite data with relatively few bands, we improve the spatial matching method between the prior surface reflectance and the satellite observed reflectance. Different with the directly resample method in the UDTCDA, the pixel -by-pixel registration method is adopted to realize the matching between the satellite image and surface reflectance image. This approach preserves the spatial resolution advantage of high resolution images, and effectively reduces the loss of pixel information caused by spatial resampling. Four high -resolution satellite data, namely ZY-3, GF-1, GF-2 and GF-4, are used in cloud detection experiments. The cloud detection results of the improved UDTCDA are verified by the visual interpretation cloud results, and compared with the original UDTCDA cloud results. Results show that the improved algorithm can accurately identify different kinds of clouds in different high-resolution satellite images with an average accuracy of 93. 920 0. Especially for the broken and thin clouds, the accuracy is significantly improved with overall low omission and commission errors less than 10.40 (Yo and 9. 57 (Yo, respectively.

TI  - Mapping carbon monoxide pollution from space down to city scales with daily global coverage
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 13 October 2017, the European Space Agency (ESA) successfully launched the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite with the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) as its single payload. TROPOMI is the first of ESA's atmospheric composition Sentinel missions, which will provide complete long-term records of atmospheric trace gases for the coming 30 years as a contribution to the European Union's Earth Observing program Copernicus. One of TROPOMI's primary products is atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO). It is observed with daily global coverage and a high spatial resolution of 7 x 7 km(2). The moderate atmospheric resistance time and the low background concentration leads to localized pollution hotspots of CO and allows the tracking of the atmospheric transport of pollution on regional to global scales. In this contribution, we demonstrate the groundbreaking performance of the TROPOMI CO product, sensing CO enhancements above cities and industrial areas and tracking, with daily coverage, the atmospheric transport of pollution from biomass burning regions. The CO data product is validated with two months of Fourier-transform spectroscopy (FTS) measurements at nine ground-based stations operated by the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). We found a good agreement between both datasets with a mean bias of 6 ppb (average of individual station biases) for both clear-sky and cloudy TROPOMI CO retrievals. Together with the corresponding standard deviation of the individual station biases of 3.8 ppb for clear-sky and 4.0 ppb for cloudy sky, it indicates that the CO data product is already well within the mission requirement.

TI  - Siglec-7 engagement by GBS β-protein suppresses pyroptotic cell death of natural killer cells
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune lymphocytes that recognize and destroy abnormal host cells, such as tumor cells or those infected by viral pathogens. To safely accomplish these functions, NK cells display activating receptors that detect stress molecules or viral ligands displayed at the cell surface, balanced by inhibitory receptors that bind to self-molecules. To date, such activating and inhibitory receptors on NK cells are not known to recognize bacterial determinants. Moreover, NK cell responses to direct interactions with extracellular bacteria are poorly explored. In this study, we observed the human neonatal pathogen group B Streptococcus (GBS) can directly engage human NK cells. The interaction was mediated through the B6N segment of streptococcal beta-protein, binding to the inhibitory receptor Siglec-7 via its amino-terminal V-set domain. Unlike classical Siglec binding, the interaction is also independent of its sialic acid recognition property. In contrast to WT GBS, mutants lacking beta-protein induced efficient pyroptosis of NK cells through the NLRP3 inflammasome, with production and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta and dissemination of the cytotoxic molecule granzyme B. We postulate that GBS evolved beta-protein engagement of inhibitory human Siglec-7 to suppress the pyroptotic response of NK cells and thereby block recruitment of a broader innate immune response, i.e., by "silencing the sentinel."

TI  - African cassava whitefly, <i>Bemisia tabaci</i>, cassava colonization preferences and control implications
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cassava is a staple food for people across sub-Saharan Africa. Over the last 20 years, there has been an increased frequency of outbreaks and crop damage in this region caused by the cassava-adapted Bemisia tabaci putative species. Little is known about when and why B. tabaci adults move and colonize new cassava crops, especially in farming systems that contain a mixture of cultivar types and plant ages. Here, we assessed experimentally whether the age and variety of cassava affected the density of B. tabaci. We also tested whether the age and variety of the source cassava field affected the variety preference of B. tabaci when they colonized new cassava plants. We placed uninfested potted "sentinel" plants of three cassava varieties (Nam 130, Nase 14, and Njule Red) in source fields containing one of two varieties (Nam 130 or Nase 14) and one of three age classes (young, medium, or old). After two weeks, the numbers of nymphs on the sentinel plants were used as a measure of colonization. Molecular identification revealed that the B. tabaci species was sub-Saharan Africa 1 (SSA1). We found a positive correlation between the density of nymphs on sentinel plants and the density of adults in the source field. The density of nymphs on the sentinels was not significantly related to the age of the source field. Bemisia tabaci adults did not preferentially colonize the sentinel plant of the same variety as the source field. There was a significant interactive effect, however, between the source and sentinel variety that may indicate variability in colonization. We conclude that managing cassava source fields to reduce B. tabaci abundance will be more effective than manipulating nearby varieties. We also suggest that planting a "whitefly sink" variety is unlikely to reduce B. tabaci SSA1 populations unless fields are managed to reduce B. tabaci densities using other integrative approaches.

TI  - Field evaluation of the BG-Malaria trap for monitoring malaria vectors in rural Tanzanian villages
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BG-Malaria (BGM) trap is a simple adaptation of the widely-used BG-Sentinel trap (BGS). It is proven to be highly effective for trapping the Brazilian malaria vector, Anopheles darlingi, in field conditions, and the African vector, Anopheles arabiensis, under controlled semi-field environments, but has not been field-tested in Africa. Here, we validated the BGM for field sampling of malaria vectors in south-eastern Tanzania. Using a series of Latin-Square experiments conducted nightly (6pm-7am) in rural villages, we compared mosquito catches between BGM, BGS and human landing catches (HLC). We also compared BGMs baited with different attractants (Ifakara-blend, Mbita-blend, BG-Lure and CO2). Lastly, we tested BGMs baited with Ifakara-blend from three odour-dispensing methods (BG-Cartridge, BG-Sachet and Nylon strips). One-tenth of the field-collected female Anopheles gambiae s.l. and Anopheles funestus were dissected to assess parity. BGM captured more An. gambiae s.l. than BGS (p < 0.001), but HLC caught more than either trap (p < 0.001). However, BGM captured more An. funestus than HLC. Proportions of parous An. gambiae s.l. and An. funestus consistently exceeded 50%, with no significant difference between methods. While the dominant species caught by HLC was An. gambiae s.l. (56.0%), followed by Culex spp. (33.1%) and Mansonia spp. (6.0%), the BGM caught mostly Culex (81.6%), followed by An. gambiae s.l. (10.6%) and Mansonia (5.8%). The attractant-baited BGMs were all significantly superior to un-baited controls (p < 0.001), although no difference was found between the specific attractants. The BG-Sachet was the most efficient dispenser for capturing An. gambiae s.l. (14.5(2.75-42.50) mosquitoes/trap/night), followed by BG-Cartridge (7.5(1.75-26.25)). The BGM caught more mosquitoes than BGS in field-settings, but sampled similar species diversity and physiological states as BGS. The physiological states of malaria vectors caught in BGM and BGS were similar to those naturally attempting to bite humans (HLC). The BGM was most efficient when baited with Ifakara blend, dispensed from BG-Sachet. We conclude that though BGM traps have potential for field-sampling of host-seeking African malaria vectors with representative physiological states, both BGM and BGS predominantly caught more culicines than Anopheles, compared to HLC, which caught mostly An. gambiae s.l.

TI  - Impact of the 2013 Floods on the Incidence of Malaria in Almanagil Locality, Gezira State, Sudan.
T2  - PLoS currents
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heavy rain hit Sudan in August 2013 with subsequent flash floods in different parts of the country. This study investigated the impact of the flooding on incidence of malaria in Almanagil Locality in central Sudan.METHODS: This observational retrospective study compared malaria data sets during rainfall seasons in the Almanagil Locality in the year of flooding (2013) with those of corresponding rainfall seasons of previous two non-flood years (2011 and 2012).RESULTS: A marked increase of new malaria cases and incidence rate was observed in the 13 sentinel malaria notification sites in the locality (IR increased from 6.09 per 100,000 person-days in 2011 [95 % CI: 5.93-6.26] and 6.48 in 2012 [95 % CI: 6.31-6.65] to 8.24 in 2013 [95 % CI: 8.05-8.43] ; P< 0.0001), with a peaking of the incidence rate in the under-5-years age group (IR for this age group jumped from 9.80 per 100,000 person-days in 2011 [95 % CI: 9.29-10.32] and 10.00 in 2012 [95 % CI: 9.52-10.49] to 15.02 in 2013 [95 % CI: 14.41-15.64]). A noticeable increase in the slide positivity rate (P< 0.0001) was observed in the 12-week period of 2013 (SPR = 20.86% [95 % CI: 20.40 -21.32%]) compared with the same periods in 2011 (SPR = 8.72% [95 % CI: 8.36 -9.08%]) and 2012 (SPR = 12.62% [95 % CI: 12.24 -13.01%]), with a more marked rise of the SPR in the under-5-year age group. Hospital data showed increase in both the inpatient and outpatient incidence proportions in the study period of 2013 compared to those of the years 2011 and 2012. Hospital OPD incidence proportion in 2013 was 19.7% (95% CI: 19.24-20.18%) compared to 12.85% (95% CI: 12.48-13.23%) in 2011, and 12.16% (95% CI: 11.82-12.51%) in 2012. The < 5 year old groups were responsible for the overall rise in the proportion of malaria cases in 2013 , particularly the < 1 year old group which more than doubled in the 2013 period compared to both 2011 and 2012 periods (Age-specific proportion of the outpatient malaria cases of the < 1 year old group in 2013 was19.5% [95% CI: 18.5-20.6%] compared to 7.7% [95% CI: 6.9-8.6%] in 2011 and 8.1% [95% CI: 7.3-8.9%] in 2012. Incidence proportion of severe malaria cases (inpatients) increased to 22.5 % (95 % CI: 21.5 to 23.6 %) in the study period of 2013 compared to 19.8 % (95 % CI: 18.6 to 21.0 %) in 2011 and 18.4 % (95 % CI: 17.4 to 19.5) in 2012. The increase in the proportion of severe malaria cases was mainly due to a higher proportion of children < 5 years of age and especially to a higher proportion of children < 1 year of age.CONCLUSION: The study revealed a significant increase in the incidence rate of malaria in Almanagil Locality following the flash flood of August 2013. The flooding had the highest impact on the malaria incidence of the under-5-years age group, and particularly of the under-1-year age group.

AB  - Two recent randomised studies found no survival difference in patients, who had melanoma with metastasis to the sentinel node (SN) and underwent immediate complete lymph node dissection (CLND), compared with patients, who were followed closely with ultrasound scans and only underwent CLND if metastases developed. From 2018, the Danish guidelines concur: SN-positive patients will no longer undergo routine CLND, which has high morbidity, but will be followed with ultrasound scans of the SN-positive region(s) at their follow-up visits every third month for two years, then every six month for three years, except if PET-CT is performed.

TI  - <i>Onchocerca volvulus</i> as a risk factor for developing epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic regions in the Democratic Republic of Congo: a case control study
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A high prevalence of epilepsy has been observed in onchocerciasis endemic areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). With this study we aimed to investigate whether Onchocerca volvulus infection is a risk factor for developing epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic regions in the DRC.Methods: Between October and December 2015, a multi-centre case control study was performed in onchocerciasis endemic health zones (HZ) in the DRC: one study site was situated in Tshopo Province in the HZ of Wanierukula (village of Salambongo) where there had been 13 annual community distributions of treatment with ivermectin (CDTI), a second was situated in Ituri Province in the HZ of Logo (village of Draju) where ivermectin had never been distributed and in the HZ of Rethy (village of Rassia) where there had been THREE CDTI annual campaigns before the study. Individuals with unprovoked convulsive epilepsy of unknown etiology were enrolled as cases (n = 175). Randomly selected healthy members of families without epilepsy cases from the same village and age-groups and were recruited as controls (n = 170).Results: Onchocerciasis associated symptoms (e.g., itching and abnormal skin) were more often present in cases compared to controls (respectively, OR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.63-4.23, P<0.0001 and OR = 3.23, 95% CI: 1.48-7.09, P = 0.0034). A higher number of cases was found to present with microfilariae in skin snips and with O. volvulus IgG4 antibodies in the blood compared to controls. Moreover, the microfilariae load in skin snips was 3-10 times higher in cases than controls.Conclusions: This case control study confirms that O. volvulus is a risk factor for developing epilepsy in onchocerciasis endemic regions in the DRC.

TI  - Seasonal modulation of deep slow-slip and earthquakes on the Main Himalayan Thrust
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between seasonally-induced non-tectonic and tectonic deformation along the Himalayan plate boundary remains debated. Here, we propose that tectonic deformation along this plate boundary can be significantly influenced by the deformation induced by the non-tectonic hydrological loading cycles. We explore seasonal mass oscillations by continental water storage in Southeast Asia and Himalayan arc region using continuous Global Positioning System measurements and satellite data from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment. We suggest that the substantially higher transient displacements above the base of the seismogenic zone indicate a role of changes in aseismic slip rate on the deep megathrust that may be controlled by seasonal hydrological loading. We invoke modulation of aseismic slip on the megathrust down-dip of the seismogenic zone due to a fault resonance process induced by the seasonal stress changes. This process modulates mid-crustal ramp associated micro-seismicity and influences the timing of Central Himalayan earthquakes.

TI  - Evaluation of VIIRS dust detection algorithms over land
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper compares three dust detection algorithms over land that were developed for operational, near-real-time processing using the Suomi National Polar Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite instrument. The three algorithm approaches use different spectral bands, namely deep blue bands, infrared (IR)-visible bands, and IR bands, and are applied for dust observed over dark as well as bright surfaces. The evaluations are performed both using case studies and AERONET matchup data over western CONUS-Mexico region and North Africa-Arabian Peninsula region. The deep blue-based algorithm is found to have the most false detections and its detection performance depends on the Sun-satellite geometries. Simulation analysis shows that there are three causes of this problem: surface reflectance, air mass factors, and phase functions in different geometries. The algorithm based on IR-visible bands has much less false detection than the deep blue bands-based algorithm and has better true positive detection than the IR-based algorithm. The IR bands-based algorithm performs well in the case studies over CONUS-Mexico region, but it fails to detect most of the dust cases over North Africa-Arabian Peninsula region. The results suggest that the IR-visible algorithm is the most suitable for the dust detection of the three algorithms with a small modification. Because the IR-visible algorithm is not able to detect all the dust pixels, detections from the deep blue algorithm only and those from the IR-visible algorithm with relaxed criteria are also provided but are distinguished with a lower quality.

TI  - Fluorescent and photoacoustic bifunctional probe for the detection of ascorbic acid in biological fluids, living cells and <i>in vivo</i>
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a promising clinical technology, thanks to its high-resolution in deep tissues. However, the lack of specificity towards analytes limits further application of the PA probe in molecular imaging. To this end, we herein report a PA and fluorescence (FL) dual-modal probe for the selective detection of ascorbic acid (AA). To realize this design, cobalt oxyhydroxide (CoOOH) was adopted as a multifunctional platform (PA contrast agent, FL quencher and specific oxidant to AA) and hybridized with red-emissive carbon dots (RCDs). In the presence of AA, CoOOH is reduced to Co2+ and meanwhile releases RCDs, resulting in the decrease of PA and recovery of FL signals. We demonstrated the AA detection capabilities of the probe in complicated biological fluids (human serum and urine), living cells, and dual-modal FL/PA imaging in vivo. This work revealed the PAI capacity of CoOOH for the first time, which may inspire researchers to design other CoOOH-based PA probes and further employ RCDs in biology and the clinic.

TI  - First fully diurnal fog and low cloud satellite detection reveals life cycle in the Namib
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog and low clouds (FLCs) are a typical feature along the southwestern African coast, especially in the central Namib, where fog constitutes a valuable resource of water for many ecosystems. In this study, a novel algorithm is presented to detect FLCs over land from geostationary satellite data using only infrared observations. The algorithm is the first of its kind as it is stationary in time and thus able to reveal a detailed view of the diurnal and spatial patterns of FLCs in the Namib region. A validation against net radiation measurements from a station network in the central Namib reveals a high overall accuracy with a probability of detection of 94 %, a false-alarm rate of 12 % and an overall correctness of classification of 97 %. The average timing and persistence of FLCs seem to depend on the distance to the coast, suggesting that the region is dominated by advection-driven FLCs. While the algorithm is applied to study Namib-region fog and low clouds, it is designed to be transferable to other regions and can be used to retrieve long-term data sets.

TI  - Changes in the West African forest-savanna mosaic, insights from central Togo
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The West African forest-savanna mosaic, an important habitat for biodiversity and humans, is severely degraded, fragmented and modified by human activities. However, few studies have quantified the land cover changes observed over time and/or analysed the drivers of change. This study focused on Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, the largest in Togo, uses a combination of remote sensing, ground surveys and questionnaires to: (i) quantify vegetation changes, (ii) determine the drivers of change, (iii) compare results with findings elsewhere in the region and (iv) suggest management interventions. The images used were Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM and Sentinel-2. Different vegetation indices were computed including: number of fragments, index of dominance, mean area of a vegetation type and mean annual expansion rate. In total, 300 people (including park staff and local populations) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results indicate that between 1987 and 2015 closed-canopy forest and tree-savanna became severely degraded and fragmented, following trends in other parts of the West African forest-savanna mosaic. The main drivers of change were agricultural expansion, bush fires and timber extraction. Observed changes and drivers altered with time: e.g. agricultural expansion was greatest during 1987-2001 (linked with political instability) while illegal timber extraction augmented during 2001-2015 (following increased timber value). Park staff and local populations' perceptions on drivers of change did not differ. Our study highlights that action is urgently needed if we are to preserve this important habitat, the biodiversity it hosts and the services it provides to humans. We suggest several management interventions, learning from successful interventions elsewhere in the region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial data on vegetation dynamics are sparse for the Djerid oases of Tunisia, but such data are urgently needed by policy makers for natural resource management purposes. These data can be collected by remote sensing and analyzed using Geographic Information System software. We analyzed the changing dynamics of the Tozeur oases in southwestern Tunisia using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) index data that were generated from SPOT-5 (Take5) satellite imagery taken from April to September, 2015. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) to produce a dendrogram that segmented the area into similar NDVI classes, then analyzed these clusters with reference to ground-truth data collected by field surveys. The unsupervised classification map produced by AHC represents a spatial model of the NDVI distribution in the oases. The results revealed seven different clusters with very high spatial heterogeneity that were linked to biophysical parameters in the field.

TI  - Drought indices based on MODIS data compared over a maize-growing season in Songliao Plain, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many indices based on MODIS data are used to monitor the process of agricultural drought, such as apparent thermal inertia (ATI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). Notable differences in performance and geographic predictions exist among these indices. We statistically evaluated the performance of different drought indices for a known drought process in 2014 in the typical rainfed maize region of Songliao Plain, China, using a linear regression model based on the relationships between indices and soil moisture data. Our results show that during the growth season of May to September, the indices performed independently with changing curves, particularly in different phenological periods. By contrast, correlations tended to be higher for ATI than for other indices in the early vegetative growth stage, whereas small differences were detected among the other indices in the late vegetative to late reproductive growth stages. Our results confirm that the TVDI can be the best choice to detect agricultural drought in the study area. (c) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Determining fuel moisture thresholds to assess wildfire hazard: A contribution to an operational early warning system
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel moisture content (FMC) is an important fuel property for assessing wildfire hazard, since it influences fuel flammability and fire behavior. The relationship between FMC and fire activity differs among land covers and seems to be a property of each ecosystem. Our objectives were to analyze pre-fire FMC among different land covers and to propose a wildfire hazard classification for the Sierras Chicas in the Chaco Serrano subregion (Argentina), by analyzing pre-fire FMC distributions observed for grasslands, shrublands and forests and using percentiles to establish thresholds. For this purpose, we used a fire database derived from Landsat imagery (30 m) and derived FMC maps every 8 days from 2002 to 2016 using MODIS reflectance products and empirical equations of FMC. Our results indicated that higher FMC constrains the extent of wildfires, whereas at lower FMC there are other factors affecting their size. Extreme and high fire hazard thresholds for grasslands were established at FMC of 55% and 67% respectively, at 72% and 105% for forests and at 106% and 121% for shrublands. Our FMC thresholds were sensitive to detect extreme fire hazard conditions during years with high fire activity in comparison to average conditions. The differences in the distributions of pre-fire FMC among land covers and between ecosystems highlighted the need to locally determine land cover-specific FMC thresholds to assess wildfire hazard. Our wildfire hazard classification applied to FMC maps in an operational framework will contribute to improving early warning systems in the Sierras Chicas. However, moisture alone is not sufficient to represent true fire hazard in Chaco forests and the combination with other variables would provide better hazard assessments. These operational wildfire hazard maps will help to better allocation of fire protective resources to minimize negative impact on people, property and ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing pre-fire FMC over several fire seasons in a non-Mediterranean ecosystem, aiming at assessing wildfire hazard.

TI  - Surface deformation and source modeling of Ayaz-Akhtarma mud volcano, Azerbaijan, as detected by ALOS/ALOS-2 InSAR
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Azerbaijan, located on the western edge of the Caspian Sea in Central Asia, has one of the highest populations of mud volcanoes in the world. We used satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images derived from two L-band SAR satellites, ALOS/PALSAR along an ascending track from 2006 to 2011, and its successor ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 along both ascending and descending tracks from 2014 to 2017. First, we applied interferometric SAR (InSAR) technique to detect surface displacements at the Ayaz-Akhtarma mud volcano in Azerbaijan. The 35 derived interferograms indicate that the deformation of the mud volcano is largely characterized by horizontal displacement. Besides the InSAR technique, we also used multiple-aperture interferometry (MAI) to derive the surface displacements parallel to the satellite flight direction to complement the InSAR data. Using the InSAR and MAI data, we obtained 3D displacements, which indicate that the horizontal displacement is dominant relative to subsidence and possible uplift. To explain the displacements, we performed source modeling, based on the assumption of elastic dislocation theory in a half space. The derived model consists of a convex surface on which normal-fault-type slips are semi-radially distributed, causing the significant horizontal displacements with minor subsidence. The convex source surface suggests that a steady overpressure system would be maintained by constantly intruding mud and gas.

TI  - Surveillance on speed: Being aware of infectious diseases in migrants mass accommodations - an easy and flexible toolkit for field application of syndromic surveillance, Germany, 2016 to 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Europe received an increased number of migrants in 2015. Housing in inadequate mass accommodations (MA) made migrants prone to infectious disease outbreaks. In order to enhance awareness for infectious diseases (ID) and to detect clusters early, we developed and evaluated a syndromic surveillance system in three MA with medical centres in Berlin, Germany. Healthcare workers transferred daily data on 14 syndromes to the German public health institute (Robert Koch-Institute). Clusters of ID syndromes and single cases of outbreak-prone diseases produced a signal according to a simple aberration-detection algorithm that computes a statistical threshold above which a case count is considered unusually high. Between May 2016-April 2017, 9,364 syndromes were reported; 2,717 (29%) were ID, of those 2,017 (74%) were respiratory infections, 262 (10%) skin parasites, 181 (7%) gastrointestinal infections. The system produced 204 signals, no major outbreak was detected. The surveillance reinforced awareness for public health aspects of ID. It provided real-time data on migrants' health and stressed the burden of non-communicable diseases. The tool is available online and was evaluated as being feasible and flexible. It complements traditional notification systems. We recommend its usage especially when laboratory testing is not available and real-time data are needed.

TI  - From ERS 1/2 to Sentinel-1: Subsidence Monitoring in Italy in the Last Two Decades
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The use of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) products has greatly increased in the last years because of the technological advances in terms of both acquisition sensors and processing algorithms. The development of multi-interferogram techniques and the availability of free SAR analysis tools has significantly increased the number of worldwide applications of satellite measurements for mapping and monitoring geohazards. InSAR techniques excel in determining ground deformation in urban areas, where the coherence of the radar images is high, and the obtainable results are particularly reliable. Thus, measuring urban subsidence has always been one of the main targets of the InSAR analysis. In this paper, we present a brief review on the applications, in the last decades, of both single and multi-interferogram techniques to monitor ground lowering in urban areas along the Italian Peninsula. Because of its geological context, Italy is prone to slow natural subsidence phenomena sometimes aggravated and accelerated, especially along the coasts and in urbanized areas, by anthropogenic factors (i.e., groundwater overexploitation, consolidation in recent urban expansion, geothermal activities). The review will show how the interferometric data allowed the scientific community to increase the knowledge of the phenomena, map their spatial distribution, and reconstruct their temporal evolution. The final goal of the review is to demonstrate the added value of InSAR data in supporting groundwater management and urban development in Italy.

TI  - Modeling the two- and three-dimensional displacement field in Lorca, Spain, subsidence and the global implications
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence associated with overexploitation of aquifers is a hazard that commonly affects large areas worldwide. The Lorca area, located in southeast Spain, has undergone one of the highest subsidence rates in Europe as a direct consequence of long-term aquifer exploitation. Previous studies carried out on the region assumed that the ground deformation retrieved from satellite radar interferometry corresponds only to vertical displacement. Here we report, for the first time, the two-and three-dimensional displacement field over the study area using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1A images and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations. By modeling this displacement, we provide new insights on the spatial and temporal evolution of the subsidence processes and on the main governing mechanisms. Additionally, we also demonstrate the importance of knowing both the vertical and horizontal components of the displacement to properly characterize similar hazards. Based on these results, we propose some general guidelines for the sustainable management and monitoring of land subsidence related to anthropogenic activities.

TI  - Augmenting GPS IWV estimations using spatio-temporal cloud distribution extracted from satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor (WV) is the most variable greenhouse gas in the troposphere, therefore investigation of its spatio-temporal distribution and motion is of great importance in meteorology and climatology studies. Here, we suggest a new strategy for augmenting integrated water vapor (IWV) estimations using both remote sensing satellites and global positioning system (GPS) tropospheric path delays. The strategy is based first on the ability to estimate METEOSAT-10 7.3 mu m WV pixel values by extracting the mathematical dependency between the IWV amount calculated from GPS zenith wet delays (ZWD) and the METEOSAT-10 data. We then use the surface temperature differences between ground station measurements and METEOSAT-10 10.8 mu m infra-red (IR) channel to identify spatio-temporal cloud distribution structures. As a last stage, the identified cloud features are mapped into the GPS-IWV distribution map when preforming the interpolation between adjusted GPS station inside the network. The suggested approach improves the accuracy of estimated regional IWV maps, in comparison with radiosonde data, thus enables to obtain the total water amount at the atmosphere, both in the form of clouds and vapor. Mean and root mean square (RMS) difference between the GPS-IWV estimations, using the spatio-temporal clouds distribution, and radiosonde data are reduced from 1.77 and 2.81 kg/m(2) to 0.74 and 2.04 kg/m(2), respectively. Furthermore, by improving the accuracy of the estimated regional IWV maps distribution it is possible to increase the accuracy of regional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) platforms.

TI  - Monitoring tropical peat related settlement using ISBAS InSAR, Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid population growth in South-East Asia has placed immense pressure upon lowland regions both to supply food and employment and space for residential, commercial and infrastructure development. This pressure has led to sites on tropical peatland previously considered unsuitable for development to be revisited. One such site, the KLIA2 terminal and runway, Kuala Lumpur International Airport which opened in May 2014 at a cost of 3.6 billion MYR has been beset by well documented subsidence problems. Coverage of the tropics by the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation presents an opportunity to monitor the ongoing subsidence at KLIA 2, identify potential knowledge gaps and help inform more sustainable infrastructure development in tropical peatland regions. Our results show that the ISBAS InSAR method produces reproducible ground deformation maps which can clearly identify the patterns of deformation across both urban infrastructure and adjacent rural plantations and tropical peat swamp. This is particularly well defined around the terminal building at KLIA-2 where different ground preparation and foundation design have resulted in stable terminal buildings and subsidence of surrounding pavement. Deformation is greatest in the runway area where alternate bands of uplift and subsidence presumably accompany the greatest loads associated with landing aircraft. In contrast, areas where peat replacement was the primary form of ground preparation, ground motion is stable, however this comes at high economic and environmental cost.

TI  - Comparison of the performance of latent heat flux products over southern hemisphere forest ecosystems: estimating latent heat flux error structure using <i>in situ</i> measurements and the triple collocation method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we compared different remote-sensing (RS)-based land surface models (LSM) and reanalysis latent heat flux (LE) products over different forest ecosystems. We analysed the performance of three RS products, the MOD16A2, the Breathing Earth System Simulator (BESS) model, and a combined optical-microwave model (COM) in their ability to replicate eddy covariance (EC) flux observations of LE at eight southern hemisphere forest ecosystems and compared their results to simulated LE from the offline LSM (GLDAS/NOAH) and a reanalysis LE dataset (MERRA). To determine spatial uncertainties, we used the triple collocation (TC) method, which does not require a priori knowledge of the true LE value, at selected Australian EC locations and over an area without in situ measurement (the Dry Chaco Forest (DCF), Argentina). The spatial pattern of the TC results was commensurable with uncertainties calculated using EC observations, indicating that the TC method is a robust technique to estimate spatial uncertainties. As global products have been validated with EC measurement from Ozflux stations, we hypothesized and found, using the TC model, that LE products achieve a better performance over areas with EC from networks than over sites without ground-based measurements and may reflect over-calibration of models or a need for a more diverse representation of ecosystems at flux tower networks.

TI  - Change detection using remote sensing in a reef environment of the UAE during the extreme event of El Nino 2015-2016
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reefs of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are living in the world's hottest sea. Recently, corals harbouring Symbiodinium thermophilum, a thermotolerant microalgae, were found to be prevalent among UAE reefs and were reported to endure extreme sea-surface temperatures. Late 2015-early 2016 was marked with the strongest El Nino on record worldwide, which caused massive coral bleaching (loss of symbiotic microalgae from reef-building corals). In September 2015, the waters flanking UAE coasts were identified to be among the areas facing a thermal stress reaching its highest level liable to cause massive coral bleaching. However, the effect of this thermal stress on UAE corals remained largely unknown. Here, multi-temporal DubaiSat-2 satellite images were used to show that changes in the reef environment of Dalma Island, UAE, between 2014 and 2016, occurred in macroalgae-dominant habitats, whereas live corals remained unaltered. Furthermore, extending the study to a larger area helped in discovering a continuum of live and pristine corals, which was not reported or studied before. While sea-surface temperature anomalies of 1 degrees C were reported to significantly damage coral reefs around the world, the live coral habitat was observed to exhibit no-change despite four consecutive months of +2 degrees C to 3 degrees C anomalies reported during the study period. These findings point to the tolerance of UAE live corals faced with extreme climate conditions.

TI  - Macropinocytosis: New Insights Into Its Underappreciated Role in Innate Immune Cell Surveillance
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Macropinocytosis has received increasing attention in recent years for its various roles in nutrient acquisition, immune surveillance, and virus and cancer pathologies. In most cases macropinocytosis is initiated by the sudden increase in an external stimulus such as a growth factor. This "induced" form of macropinocytosis has been the subject of much of the work addressing its mechanism and function over the years. An alternative, "constitutive" form of macropinocytosis restricted to primary innate immune cells also exists, although its mechanism has remained severely understudied. This mini-review focuses on the very recent advances that have shed new light on the initiation, formation and functional relevance of constitutive macropinocytosis in primary innate immune cells. An emphasis is placed on how this new understanding of constitutive macropinocytosis is helping to define the sentinel function of innate immune cells including polarized macrophages and dendritic cells.

TI  - Enhancing estimation accuracy of daily maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature using spatio-temporal ground-based and remote-sensing data in southern Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, a model was proposed for improving the estimation of air temperature (T-a), which enhanced computation accuracy by combining remote sensing, station data, and spatio-temporal interpolation methods. Stepwise linear regression model was used to find the relationship between daily mean, maximum, and minimum air temperature (T-mean, T-max, and T-min, respectively) with daytime and night-time land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor, elevation, geometric temperature (T-geom, as a function of the day of the year and latitude), and solar radiation (R-s). Measured T-a from 75 stations in the Fars province in southern Iran were used during 2003-2012. The results of stepwise linear regression showed that among the considered variables daytime and night-time LST, NDVI, T-geom, R-s, and elevation were significant in the final model. For increasing the accuracy of estimation, four interpolation methods were considered and analysed for the residual errors of multiple linear regression model consisting regression kriging, spatio-temporal regression kriging (STRK), regression inverse distance weighting, and spatio-temporal regression inverse distance weighting (STRIDW). The result showed that the STRIDW method had the best accuracy among the considered methods and a significant improvement in the accuracy was achieved with this method comparing to the others. The accuracy of estimations was less than 2 degrees C for T-max, T-min, and T-mean (root mean square error = 1.6 degrees C, 1.84 degrees C, and 1.43 degrees C, respectively) for the validation year (2012). Finally, using the proposed models, it was possible to estimate daily air temperatures in the Fars province with 1 km resolution, which is higher than methods that used purely station-based or purely remote-sensing data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article verified the error between inversed land surface temperature (LST) and measured LST and developed the modified model based on Landsat 8 remote-sensing data. First, a single-channel algorithm was used to invert the surface temperature using four Landsat 8 remote-sensing images and the LST of the 98 measured points were obtained meantime. Then, the modified model between inversed LST and measured LST was developed based on LST for the 74 measured points. Finally, the developed models were used to modify the inversion temperatures at other 24 measured points, and the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) between the measured temperature and the inversed temperature before and after the modification were compared to verify the validity of the model. The results showed that the MAE and the MSE of temperature for the 24 measured points used for verification reduced by 0.26 and 0.20 K, respectively, after modification. The development of the modified model can provide an important reference for using Landsat 8 remote-sensing image to invert surface temperature in other regions.

TI  - The role of remote sensing on studying mangrove forest extent change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Given the ability of effectively observing vegetation at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, remote sensing has been widely used to monitor and understand the change of mangrove forest extent. Yet, a systematic cognition of the unique contribution of remote sensing on studying mangrove forest extent dynamic is lacking, which prevents us from clearly identifying and further overcoming current deficiencies of studying the change of mangrove forest extent with remote sensing. Therefore, in this review, we summarized remotely sensed extraction methods and data related to mangrove forest extent change monitoring and all discoveries from mangrove forest extent change observation and driver analysis. We found that mangrove forest in most of the study areas has declined over the past decades, and the loss rate is accelerating. We also found that remote sensing plays an important role in revealing how the extent of mangrove forest responds to climate change and human impacts. In addition, we identified several recurring limitations from previous studies. This review highlights the role of remote sensing on studying mangrove forest extent change, and is helpful to make better use of remotely sensed data in this field.

TI  - Crop-type mapping from a sequence of Sentinel 1 images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High food demand has led stakeholders to regularly monitor agricultural production to ensure food security and a balanced ecosystem. Agricultural areas undergo rapid changes throughout a growing season due to phenology. Crop mapping initiatives therefore require efficient and effective information gathering techniques. Remote sensing, specifically radar, offers an effective land-cover mapping platform compared to ground surveying methods. Radar is sensitive to crop physical structure and biomass/vegetation water content, i.e. dielectric property. We adopt and test the potential of the recent Sentinel 1 images for multitemporal crop classification due to its short revisit period and sufficient spatial resolution. The temporal resolution guarantees the highest temporal density of images that captures crop dynamics. However, this presents dimensionality problems in classification algorithms. Therefore, we chose dynamic conditional random fields (DCRFs) and tested their robustness in high-dimensional images constrained to few training data. DCRFs are designed to incorporate spatio-temporal phenological information inherent in images during crop classification. We compare the approach to single epoch classification. Our findings indicate that DCRFs improved crop mapping accuracy in all epochs. Nonetheless, most stakeholders require seasonal crop-type statistics. Hence, we use an ensemble classifier to produce an optimal map from posterior class probabilities estimated from the sequence of images. The ensemble outperforms the conventional approach of merging multitemporal images as composite bands for classification using Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC-stack) and mono-temporal conditional random fields. It still retains high accuracy compared to MLC-stack when subjected to high-dimensional images with fewer training data.

TI  - Miniaturized multi-sensor loggers provide new insight into year-round flight behaviour of small trans-Sahara avian migrants
T2  - MOVEMENT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Over the past decade, the miniaturisation of animal borne tags such as geolocators and GPS-transmitters has revolutionized our knowledge of the whereabouts of migratory species. Novel light-weight multi-sensor loggers (1.4 g), which harbour sensors for measuring ambient light intensity, atmospheric pressure, temperature and acceleration, were fixed to two long-distance migrant bird species -eurasian hoopoe (Upupa epops) and great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Using acceleration and atmospheric pressure data recorded every 5 and 30 min, respectively, we aimed at reconstructing individual diurnal and seasonal patterns of flight activity and flight altitude and thereby, at describing basic, yet hitherto unknown characteristics of migratory flight behaviour. Furthermore, we wanted to characterise the variability in these migration characteristics between individuals, species and migration periods.Results: The flight duration from breeding to sub-Saharan African non-breeding sites and back was more variable within than between the species. Great reed warblers were airborne for a total of 252 flight hours and thus, only slightly longer than eurasian hoopoes with 232 h. With a few exceptions, both species migrated predominantly nocturnally - departure around dusk and landing before dawn. Mean flight altitudes were higher during pre-than during post-breeding migration (median 1100 to 1600 m a.s.l.) and flight above 3000 m occurred regularly with a few great reed warblers exceeding 6000 m a.s.l. (max. 6458 m a.s.l.). Individuals changed flight altitudes repeatedly during a flight bout, indicating a continuous search for (more) favourable flight conditions.Conclusions: We found high variation between individuals in the flight behaviour parameters measured - a variation that surprisingly even exceeded the variation between the species. More importantly, our results have shown that multi-sensor loggers have the potential to provide detailed insights into many fundamental aspects of individual behaviour in small aerial migrants. Combining the data recorded on the multiple sensors with, e.g., remote sensing data like weather and habitat quality on the spatial and temporal scale will be a great step forward to explore individual decisions during migration and their consequences.

TI  - Object-based satellite image analysis applied for crop residue estimating using Landsat OLI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to apply an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach to satellite image processing and determining crop residue cover (CRC) and tillage intensity. To achieve this goal, we collected ground truth data using line-transect method from 35 plots of farmlands with an area of 528 ha. Accordingly, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite image together with global positioning system (GPS)-based survey data set were considered for applying the OBIA methods and deriving CRC. To process the data, object-based image processing steps including segmentation and classification were applied to develop intelligent objects and establish classification using spectral and spatial characteristics of CRC. We developed three categories of rule sets including mean indices, tillage indices, and grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features using the OBIA algorithms and assign class method. Results were validated against of ground control data set and were collected by GPS in field survey. Results of this study indicated that the brightness, normalised difference tillage index, and GLCM texture feature mean performed out as effective techniques. Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient (kappa) were computed to be about 0.91 and 0.86; 0.93 and 0.90; 0.60 and 0.35, respectively, for the above-mentioned indices. The foregoing discussion has attempted to demonstrate that the remotely sensed data can be effective approach and substitute for ground methods, especially in large areas.

TI  - A novel algorithm of cloud detection for water quality studies using 250 m downscaled MODIS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is part of a project aimed at developing an automated algorithm for algal bloom detection and quantification in inland water bodies using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. An important step is to adequately detect and exclude clouds and haze because their presence affects chlorophyll-a (chl-a) estimations. Currently available cloud masking products appear to be ineffective in turbid coastal waters. The purpose of this study is to develop a cloud masking algorithm based on a probabilistic algorithm (Linear Discriminant Analysis) and designed for water bodies by using MODIS images downscaled at a 250 m spatial resolution (MODIS-D-250). Confusion matrix shows that the new cloud mask algorithm yields very satisfactory results, enabling water classification for heavy turbid conditions with a mean kappa coefficient (kappa) of 0.993 and a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.990 to 0.997. The model also shows a very low commission error (sensitive to the presence of haze), which is essential for accurate water quality monitoring, knowing that the presence of clouds/haze/aerosols leads to major issues in the estimation of water quality parameters. The cloud mask model applied on MODIS-D-250 images improves the sensitivity to haze and the classification of turbid waters located at the edge of urban areas better than the operational MODIS products, and it clearly shows an improvement of the spatial resolution (250 m spatial resolution) compared to other cloud mask algorithms (500 m or 1 km spatial resolution), leading to an increase in exploitable data for water quality studies.

TI  - Comparing different smoothing methods to detect double-cropping rice phenology based on LAI products - a case study in the Hunan province of China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have demonstrated the remarkable potential of assimilating remotely sensing leaf area index (LAI) products into crop models in estimating regional crop yield. To ensure the temporal consistency between crop models and remote-sensing system, it is prerequisite to derive the crop phenology information from the LAI products. However, previous studies mainly detected the phenology through the vegetation index (VI). Although some pieces of research applied LAI in phenology monitoring for trees and shrubs, fewer focused on crops, especially those with two or three growing seasons annually. Thus, which smoothing algorithm methods are suitable to obtain phenology of double-cropping rice and their difference in smoothing for crops are still unknown. Based on the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS)LAI products, we applied four favourite smoothing algorithms (Asymmetric Gaussian fitting, Double Logistic fitting, Savitzky-Golay filter, and Wavelet-based Filter method) to reduce noise and reconstruct the LAI profile and then detected the phenological information of double-cropping rice in Hunan Province. Compared with ground actual observations, we found that two fitting methods are not suitable to smooth double-cropping rice LAI, while the wavelet method performed the best. Based on the wavelet method, we estimated the phenological information of double-cropping rice at different regional scales as well and the results reflected that the accuracy of regional estimation is also acceptable. This study implied that the wavelet method is rather suitable to detect phenological information of crops from LAI products, which provides narrow gaps between two growing season. Our contribution can benefit researchers who focus on agriculture or remote sensing, especially those who would like to assimilate remotely sensed information into crop growth models.

TI  - Enhanced edge detection for polarimetric SAR images using a directional span-driven adaptive window
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic edge detection for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images plays a fundamental role in various PolSAR applications. The classic methods apply the fixed-shape windows to detect the edges, whereas their performance is limited in heterogeneous areas. This article presents an enhanced edge detection method for PolSAR data based on the directional span-driven adaptive (DSDA) window. The DSDA window has variable sizes and flexible shapes, and is constructed by adaptively selecting samples that follow the same statistical distribution. Therefore, it can overcome the limitation of classic fixed-shape windows. To obtain refined and reliable edge detection results in heterogeneous urban areas, we adopt the spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) product model since the complex Wishart distribution is often not met. In addition, a span ratio is combined with the SIRV distance to highlight the dissimilarity measure and to improve the robustness of the proposed method. The simulated PolSAR data and three real data sets from experimental synthetic aperture radar, electromagnetics institute synthetic aperture radar, and Radarsat-2 systems are used to validate the performance of the enhanced edge detector. Both quantitative evaluation and visual presentation of the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over the classic edge detectors.

TI  - A global spatially contiguous solar-induced fluorescence (CSIF) dataset using neural networks
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-retrieved solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has shown great potential to monitor the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial ecosystems. However, several issues, including low spatial and temporal resolution of the gridded datasets and high uncertainty of the individual retrievals, limit the applications of SIF. In addition, inconsistency in measurement footprints also hinders the direct comparison between gross primary production (GPP) from eddy covariance (EC) flux towers and satellite-retrieved SIF. In this study, by training a neural network (NN) with surface reflectance from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SIF from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), we generated two global spatially contiguous SIF (CSIF) datasets at moderate spatiotemporal (0.05 degrees 4-day) resolutions during the MODIS era, one for clear-sky conditions (2000-2017) and the other one in all-sky conditions (2000-2016). The clear-sky instantaneous CSIF (CSIFclear-inst) shows high accuracy against the clear-sky OCO-2 SIF and little bias across biome types. The allsky daily average CSIF (CSIFall-daily) dataset exhibits strong spatial, seasonal and interannual dynamics that are consistent with daily SIF from OCO-2 and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). An increasing trend (0.39 %) of annual average CSIFall-daily is also found, confirming the greening of Earth in most regions. Since the difference between satellite-observed SIF and CSIF is mostly caused by the environmental down-regulation on SIFyieid, the ratio between OCE-2 SIF and CSIFclear-inst can be an effective indicator of drought stress that is more sensitive than the normalized difference vegetation index and enhanced vegetation index. By comparing CSLFall-daily with GPP estimates from 40 EC flux towers across the globe, we find a large cross-site variation (c.v. = 0.36) of the GPP-SIF relationship with the highest regression slopes for evergreen needle-leaf forest. However, the cross-biome variation is relatively limited (c.v. = 0.15). These two contiguous SIF datasets and the derived GPP-SIF relationship enable a better understanding of the spatial and temporal variations of the GPP across biomes and climate.

TI  - DEM generation using Ziyuan-3 mapping satellite imagery without ground control points
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a digital elevation model (DEM) generation approach using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM as the elevation constraint without ground control points. First, during the process of image block adjustment, we took advantage of the relatively high vertical accuracy of the SRTM-DEM in flat terrain regions and applied effective constraints on the object-space elevation-corrected value of tie points using the SRTM-DEM, achieving improved vertical accuracy for large-scale block adjustments. Subsequently, for the DEM matching process, multiple two-linear array stereo image pairs were obtained from along-track and across-track images with different look angles over the same region after the block adjustment. Then, the matching result of each stereo image pair underwent weighted fusion, before being used to generate the final DEM product. This approach can effectively enhance the matching quality and grid density of the final DEM product. The DEM generation experiment, using Ziyuan-3 images covering 186,000 km(2) of Hubei Province, China, showed that the matching quality of the 10 m grid DEM was excellent. The vertical root mean square errors were 1.5 m in the flat regions and 2.96 m in the mountainous regions, thus achieving China's 1:25,000 scale specification requirement for DEM products.

TI  - Delineation of groundwater potential (GWP) in the northern United Arab Emirates and Oman using geospatial technologies in conjunction with Simple Additive Weight (SAW), Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Probabilistic Frequency Ratio (PFR) techniques
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Oman, an arid climate coupled with rising populations have placed increased demand on scarce water resources. This study performs groundwater prospecting in the northern UAE and Oman by delineating Groundwater Potential (GWP), the relative likelihood of a location to accumulate groundwater, by modelling the influence of physiographic variables affecting groundwater accumulation. Remote sensing data from ASTER, Landsat-8, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were used to map relevant physiographic variables including elevation, slope, curvature, drainage density, Topographic Wetness Index, lithology/land cover, lineament density, rainfall, and groundwater-induced cool thermal anomaly frequency (GW CTA). Three different techniques were used for the GWP model including Simple Additive Weight (SAW), Probabilistic Frequency Ratios (PFR), and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The three derived GWP maps were assessed through validation by comparing the locations of 645 water wells, 49 natural springs, and field observations of groundwater features to GWP zones. The SAW and AHP maps were deemed valid with agreement to moderate or greater potential zones for wells at 98% and 92% and springs at 63% and 86% respectively, and all field observation locations for both maps. Based on the SAW and AHP maps, the highest GWP is located in the Dubai/Sharjah emirates due to optimal runoff accumulation, infiltration conditions, and subsurface storage capacity. Findings of this study demonstrate integration of remote sensing data with the adopted geospatial techniques is a practical method of groundwater prospecting in similarly data scarce, arid environments.

TI  - Enhancing Forest and Shrubland Mapping in a Managed Forest Landscape with Landsat-LiDAR Data Fusion
T2  - NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary losses of early-successional young forest and shrubland habitat have resulted in range-wide population declines of numerous wildlife species. establishing shrubland conservation as a high priority in the eastern United States. However, the extent and spatial distribution of shrubland habitat is lacking for many locations. The Landsat program is an important resource for quantifying vegetation and land cover, but recent applications indicate that divergent structural characteristics between certain feature classes, such as vegetation height, are not readily captured by spectral response alone. The fusion of Landsat imagery with light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data at the pixel level into existing supervised classification schemes may offset this discrepancy. We used multispectral images from Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) to compare Landsat OLI and Landsat OLI-LiDAR fusion data in the classification of 10 vegetation and land cover types across a similar to 5000 km(2) area in southeastern Ohio at the native 30-m Landsat resolution. Fusion data produced a 12% increase in overall classification accuracy from the Landsat OLI model and met minimum mapping accuracy standards in remote sensing. Importantly, LiDAR textural bands in the fusion model improved discrimination of forest and shrubland classes with the most dramatic difference manifesting as a 75% increase in shrubland user's accuracy. We demonstrate that Landsat OLI-LiDAR fusions are valuable for accurate shrubland mapping in forestlands. Additionally, we show that vegetation and land cover modeling can be easily integrated into existing wildlife monitoring programs by simultaneously sampling vegetation classes and wildlife communities from similar locations.

TI  - Large-scale assessment of mercury in sentinel estuarine fishes of the Florida Everglades and adjacent coastal ecosystems
T2  - BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Florida, USA, mercury can bioaccumulate in aquatic food webs to levels that are harmful to human and ecosystem health. Proposed efforts to restore hydrological flow in the Florida Everglades, which encompasses projects throughout central and south Florida, may alter the spatial distribution and temporal trends in mercury bioaccumulation in Florida fish populations. Monitoring of mercury in sentinel fish species permits assessment of changing conditions and can identify natural or anthropogenic impacts on upstream watersheds and predict regional influences on human and wildlife consumers of these fish species. From 2006 through 2008, we assessed total mercury in muscle of 545 gray snapper, Lutjanus griseus (Linnaeus, 1758), and 381 crevalle jack, Caranx hippos (Linnaeus, 1766), from 13 broad estuarine regions in central and south Florida, downstream of proposed Everglades restoration projects. For comparison, we assessed an additional 134 gray snapper collected from adjacent offshore waters in the Gulf of Mexico in 2007-2008 and 2014-2015. Collectively, these results indicate that Florida Bay and Card and Barnes sounds are mercury hot spots for both fish species in Florida estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Mean mercury concentrations in these species from Florida Bay were 1.7-2.5 times those measured in Atlantic coast estuaries (i.e., Loxahatchee estuary, St. Lucie estuary, and Indian River Lagoon). Mercury in snapper from offshore gulf waters did not reveal spatial differences from adjacent coastal estuaries, but did suggest concentrations in offshore snapper have remained stable in recent years. These results provide comprehensive baseline data that can be used to identify mercury hot spots in south Florida and for monitoring temporal and spatial changes in estuarine and coastal mercury concentrations as Everglades restoration plans are implemented.

AB  - Candida auris is an emerging yeast that causes healthcare-associated infections. It can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to antifungal medications. We describe an outbreak of C. auris infections in healthcare facilities in New York City, New York, USA. The investigation included laboratory surveillance, record reviews, site visits, contact tracing with cultures, and environmental sampling. We identified 51 clinical case-patients and 61 screening case-patients. Epidemiologic links indicated a large, inter-connected web of affected healthcare facilities throughout New York City. Of the 51 clinical case-patients, 23 (45%) died within 90 days and isolates were resistant to fluconazole for 50 (98%). Of screening cultures performed for 572 persons (1,136 total cultures), results were C. auris positive for 61 (11%) persons. Environmental cultures were positive for samples from 15 of 20 facilities. Colonization was frequently identified during contact investigations; environmental contamination was also common.

TI  - Comparison of GIS-based landslide susceptibility models using frequency ratio, logistic regression, and artificial neural network in a tertiary region of Ambon, Indonesia
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate landslide causative factors in landslide susceptibility assessments and to compare landslide susceptibility models based on the bivariate frequency ratio (FR), multivariate logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN). The majority of landslide occurrences in Ambon, Indonesia is induced by heavy rainfall events where slope failures occur mostly on steep slopes thereby endangering municipality areas at the base of the hills. Eight landslide causative factors were considered in the landslide susceptibility assessments. The causative factors were elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, proximity to stream network, lithology, density of geological boundaries, proximity to faults, and proximity to the road network. The output susceptibility maps were reclassified into five classes ranging from very low to very high susceptibility using Jenks natural breaks method. Twenty percent of all mapped landslides were used as the validation of the susceptibility models. The validity and the accuracy of each model were tested by calculating areas under receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs), and the areas under the curve (AUC) for the success rate curves of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.688, 0.687, and 0.734, respectively. The AUC for the prediction rate curve of FR, LR, and ANN were 0.668, 0.667, and 0.717, respectively. All findings of the models show good results with the accuracy of all models being higher than 66%. The ANN method proved to be superior in explaining the relationship of landslide with each factor studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validating a continental European charcoal calibration dataset
T2  - HOLOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale training sets enabling quantitative reconstructions of past fire parameters are needed to better assess potential effects of increased fire hazard under global warming conditions. The aim of this article is to validate recently developed continental regression equations for the reconstruction of fire number, intensity and size. These transfer functions were built by linking satellite data and charcoal collected in annually sampled sediment traps. We apply these European regression equations to four annually layered lakes located on a North-South gradient in Europe. Down-core annual microscopic charcoal (MIC) and macroscopic charcoal (MAC) influx values were compared with satellite-derived time series of fire number, fire intensity and area burned. Results show that the match between predicted and observed values improves when the overall mean and median of sampled years (12 and 9 years) are considered. Especially, the comparisons of median values show a very good agreement between charcoal-inferred and satellite-observed fire-regime parameters. MIC-based predictions underestimate the variability of the observed fire parameters and MAC-based predictions overestimate it. Our results imply that median values of the fire parameters can be reconstructed well by using MIC and MAC, while it is more difficult to infer the variability of fire-regime parameters. However, when MIC- and MAC-based predictions are pooled together, the fit between observed and predicted values increases for both medians and variability. This finding suggests that MIC and MAC are complementary proxies, thus best sedimentary fire reconstructions may be achieved when they are used together. We conclude that sediment traps can be used for the construction of continental-scale training sets and that their results can be applied to Holocene sedimentary charcoal sequences.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Digital Elevation Model Generated by SAR Stereoscopic Technique Using COSMO-Skymed Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radargrammetry technique using the stereoscopic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is used for the generation of a digital elevation model (DEM) of a region requires only the amplitude images. SAR stereoscopic technique is analogous to the stereo-photogrammetric technique where the optical stereoscopic images are used for DEM generation. While the advantages of the SAR images are their indifference to atmospheric transparency and solar illumination conditions, the side-looking geometry of the SAR increases the complexity in the SAR stereo analysis. The availability of high spatial and temporal resolution SAR data in recent years has facilitated generation of high-resolution DEM with greater vertical accuracy using radargrammetric technique. In the present study, attempt has been made to generate the DEM of Dehra Dun region, India, from the COSMO-Skymed X-band SAR data-pair acquired at 8 days interval through the radargrammetry technique. Here, radargrammetric orientation approach has been adopted to generate the DEM and various issues and processing steps with the radargrammetry technique have been discussed. The DEM was validated with ground measured elevation values using a differential global positioning system and the root-mean-square error of the DEM was found as 7.3 m. The DEM was compared with the reference DEM of the study area generated from the Cartosat-1 stereo data with a model accuracy of 4 m.

TI  - Geospatial application for agroforestry suitability mapping based on FAO guideline: case study of Lohardaga, Jharkhand State of India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of climate change scenario, the increasing population, higher food demand and deteriorating land productivity are the key issues which need to be addressed in present time frame because it will be more critical in the future. The scientific evaluation of land for agroforestry is a step towards sustainability for achieving the socio-economic and environmental goal of the community. The objective of the present study was to investigate the suitability of land use/land cover of Lohardaga district of state of Jharkhand, India for agroforestry use based on FAO land suitability criteria utilizing Landsat-8 images (NDVI/wetness), ASTER DEM (elevation/slope/drainage and watershed), ancillary data source (rainfall/organic carbon/pH and nutrient status). The analysis of our study for agroforestry suitability reveals that 50.5% area as highly suitable (S1), 28.2% area as moderately suitable (S2), 20% area as marginally suitable (S3) and 1.3% area as not suitable (NS). Only 2.9% of the total land area is dominated by two season crop which is a matter of serious concern. The statistical analysis of the results reveals that the lands have huge potentiality for harnessing agroforestry crops if utilized scientifically. Such results will greatly help to the state level policymakers for achieving the national agroforestry policy goal for extending it to the new areas in the districts of Jharkhand.

TI  - Yield Forecasting of Spring Maize Using Remote Sensing and Crop Modeling in Faisalabad-Punjab Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers' field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35-6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255 kg ha(-1), while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397 kg ha(-1). Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R-2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.

TI  - Erosion induced channel migration and its impact on dwellers in the lower Gumti River, Tripura, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel migration due to erosion has emerged as a serious environmental issue. The present study is an attempt to assess the pattern of channel migration in lower reach of the Gumti River and its impact on local inhabitants. For this study Survey of India topographical sheets and Landsat 8 imagery were used to derive the vector layers of the river channel of 1932 and 2016 respectively. Different sections were drawn over the superimposed vector layers of these 2 years to measure the extent of migration. Survey was carried out on the local people to assess the vulnerability of river channel migration. The whole study reveals that large scale migration of the Gumti River has taken place during the period 1932-2016 with maximum extent of 533.42m in Kushamara Village owing mainly to the sandy and sandy loam nature of bank soil. Channel migration has created detrimental socio-economic problems as victims were bound to shift their houses partially (73.53%) and permanently (26.17%). Moreover, Gumti channel migration has led to loss of productive agricultural lands when around 27.78% of the surveyed victims have already lost their double cropped lands amounting to more than four acres each.

TI  - Comparison of visible and multi-satellite global inundation datasets at high-spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Several new satellite-derived and long-term surface water datasets at high-spatial resolution have recently become available at the global scale, showing different characteristics and abilities. They are either based on visible imagery from Landsat - the Global 3-second Water Body Map (G3WBM) and the Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) - or on the merging of passive/active microwave and visible observations - Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellite (GIEMS-D3) - that has been downscaled from a native resolution of 25 km x 25 km to the 90 m x 90 m resolution. The objective of this paper is to perform a thorough comparison of the different water surface estimates in order to identify the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches and propose a strategy for future developments of high-resolution surface water databases. Results show that due to their very high spatial resolution (30 m) the Landsat-based datasets are well suited to retrieve open water surfaces, even at very small size. GIEMS-D3 has a better ability to detect water under vegetation and during the cloudy season, and it shows larger seasonal dynamics. However, its current version overestimates surface water extent on water-saturated soils, and due to its low original (i.e. before downscaling) spatial resolution, it is under-performing at detecting small water bodies. The permanent waters for G3WBM, GSWE, GIEMS-D3 and GLWD represent respectively: 2.76, 2.05, 3.28, and 3.04 million km(2). The transitory waters shows larger discrepancies: 0.48, 3.72, 10.39 and 8.81 million km(2).Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data (from ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Sentinel and soon the Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT)) would be a good complementary information because they have a high nominal spatial resolution and are less sensitive to clouds than visible measurements. However, global SAR datasets are still not available due to difficulties in developing a retrieval scheme adequate at the global scale. In order to improve our estimates of global wetland extents at high resolution and over long-term records, three interim lines of action are proposed: (1) extend the temporal record of GIEMS-D3 to exploit the full time series of microwave observations (from 1978 to present), (2) develop an approach to fuse the GSWE and GIEMS-D3 datasets leveraging the strengths of both, and (3) prepare for the release of SAR global datasets.

TI  - Designing a sustainable rangeland information system for Turkey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify the deficiencies of the rangeland information system currently used in Turkey and, as an alternative, design a sustainable rangeland information system. In the study, both the extent of changes that occurred over time in the rangelands and the factors that caused such changes were identified, and solutions were suggested to eliminate those factors. The rangelands located in the Akcaabat district of Trabzon province were selected as the study area. Land use maps were produced by using the object-based classification method. According to the results of change analyses made with this information system, it was found out that, from 1973 to 2012, a surface area of 159.8 hectares had been degraded, demonstrating that the current information system had not been successful enough in the management of rangelands. For that reason, a sustainable rangeland information system free from all deficiencies was designed.

TI  - Characterization of aerosol type based on aerosol optical properties over Baghdad, Iraq
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), and ozone monitoring instrument aerosols index (OMI-AI) data, derived from MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and OMI sensor on board NASA's Aqua satellite and NASA-Aura satellite platforms, have been analyzed and classified over Baghdad, Iraq, for an 8-year period (2008-2015). In order to give an obvious understanding of temporal inconsistency in the characteristics and classification of aerosols during each season separately. PREDE POM-02 sky radiometer measurements of AOD, carried out during a 2-year period (2014-2015), were compared with MODIS-Aqua AODs. On seasonal bases, MODIS-Aqua AODs corroborate well with ground-based measurements, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.74 and 0.8 and RMSE ranging from 0.097 to 0.062 during spring and autumn seasons respectively. The overall satellite- and ground-based measurement comparisons showed a good agreement with correlation coefficients of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.066. These results suggest that MODIS-Aqua gives a good estimate of AOD. Analysis of MODIS-Aqua data for the 8-year period showed that the overall mean AOD, AE, and OMI-AI over Baghdad were 0.44 +/- 0.16, 0.77 +/- 0.29, and 1.34 +/- 0.33 respectively. AOD records presented a unique peak which was extended from mid-spring (April) to mid-summer (July) while the AE annual variability indicated a more complicated behavior with minimum values during the period from late spring (May) to early autumn (September). The maximum AOD and OMI-AI values occurred during summer while their minimum values occurred during winter. The AE showed an opposite behavior to that of AOD such that the highest AE values occurred during autumn and winter and the lowest values happened during spring and summer. This behavior may be attributed to the domination of coarse aerosol particles during autumn and winter seasons and fine aerosol particles during spring and summer seasons. A Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model was utilized to determine the source of air mass transport and to recognize the variability of aerosol origin regions. Finally, AOD, AE, and OMI-AI values have been employed to identify several aerosol types and to present seasonal heterogeneity in their contribution based on their origins.

TI  - Retrospective Simulation of an Extreme Flood on the Oka River at the City of Ryazan and Impact Assessment of Urban and Transport Infrastructure
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerical modeling of flow dynamics of rivers with comprehensive channel patterns and wide floodplains during high water stage is considered to be one of the most effective methods for implementing both research and civil-engineering projects. However, realistic results of simulations can be obtained only if the model has been calibrated and validated against field observations and remote sensing data. This approach is realized for a 2D hydrodynamic model of the Oka River at the city of Ryazan (central European Russia). The Oka has a meandering channel and a wide floodplain with a complicated distributary network. The feasibility of allocating new residential quarters and infrastructure facilities on artificial "islands" on the floodplain was studied using STREAM_ 2D software package. Because of a significant decrease in the maximum runoff of the Oka in the recent decades, the simulations were made for the extreme spring snowmelt flood of 1970 for various scenarios of floodplain development in the past, present, and future.

TI  - Assessment of Land Surface Subsidence Due to Underground Metal Mining Using Integrated Spaceborne Repeat-Pass Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) Technique and Ground Based Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is a novel remote sensing technique to measure earth surface deformation. It is capable of obtaining dense information related to the deformation of a large area efficiently, economically and effectively. Therefore, DInSAR is a promising technology for monitoring the earth surface deformation related to some natural hazardous events, such as earthquake, volcano eruption, land subsidence, landslide. In present study, Conventional DInSAR technique have been applied to a mineral rich zone, coming under the Khetri copper belt, a part of Northern Aravali range of hillocks in India, predominant with mining activities since late 1960's to address the possibility of deformation phenomena due to hard rock underground metal mining. Four interferometric SAR data sets of Radarsat-2 was used for the study area to address the subsidence/uplift phenomena. Further, results obtained from conventional DInSAR technique using Radarsat-2 data sets compared with results obtained from ground based observation technique for its validity. In both the techniques, deformation results obtained in terms of average subsidence rate in mm (quarterly basis) of points under study within mining zone of Mine-A has well agreed to each other. Further, it has been observed that average subsidence rate in mm (quarterly basis) obtained from space based observation and ground based observation are 5.6 and 6.67, respectively over the points under study in mining zone of Mine-A.

TI  - Using Satellite Remote Sensing to Study the Impact of Climate and Anthropogenic Changes in the Mesopotamian Marshlands, Iraq
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Iraqi Marshes in Southern Iraq are considered one of the most important wetlands in the world. From 1982 to the present, their area has varied between 10,500 km(2) and 20,000 km(2). The marshes support a variety of plants, such as reeds and papyrus, and are home to many species of birds. These marshes are Al-Hammar, Central or Al-Amarah, and Al-Huwaiza. Freshwater supplies to the marshes come from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Iraq and from the Karkha River from Iran. For this analysis, we used the Land Long-Term Data Record Version 5 (LTDR V5) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor dataset. This dataset was recently released at a 0.05 x 0.05 degrees spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation along with other hydrological variables such as land surface temperature, precipitation, and evapotranspiration. In our analysis, we considered three time periods: 1982-1992; 1993-2003; and 2004-2017 due to anthropogenic activities and climate changes. Furthermore, we examined the relationships between various water cycle variables through the investigation of vegetation and water coverage changes, and studied the impacts of climate change and anthropogenic activities on the Iraqi Marshes and considered additional ground observations along with the satellite datasets. Statistical analyses over the last 36 years show significant deterioration in the vegetation: 68.78%, 98.73, and 83.71% of the green biomass has declined for Al-Hammar, The Central marshes, and Al-Huwaiza, respectively. The AVHRR and Landsat images illustrate a decrease in water and vegetation coverage, which in turn has led to an increase in barren lands. Unfortunately, statistical analyses show that marshland degradation is mainly induced by human actions. The shrinkage in water supplies taken by Iraq's local neighbors (i.e., Turkey, Syria, and Iran) has had a sharp impact on water levels. The annual discharge of the Tigris declined from 2500-3000 m(3)/s to 500 m(3)/s, and the annual discharge of the Euphrates River declined from 1500 m(3)/s to less than 500 m(3)/s.

TI  - The Concept of Onomatopoeia as an Element of The Linguistic Worldview in The Russian and Kumyk Linguistic Cultures
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The issues addressed in the article are of particular relevance due to the necessity of linguo-cultural studies into the concept of onomatopoeia in languages of different systemic structures (Russian and Kumyk). The aim of the article is to conduct a comparative study of the Russian and Kumyk linguistic worldviews expressed through onomatopoeias and to identify common and ethno-specific aspects of their conceptual features. The used research methods - comparative, linguo-cultural and componential analysis - allow revealing common and ethno-specific components of the concept of onomatopoeia in the compared languages. The linguistic worldviews of the Russian and the Kumyk languages are reflected in different linguistic phenomena: lexemes, proverbs and phraseological units. The nation-specific concept of onomatopoeia, including linguistic, cognitive and cultural components, is part of the Russian and Kumyk linguistic conceptual systems. The linguistic worldview is a macrosystem, which presupposes the existence of microsystems. One of such microsystems is the lexico-semantic field of onomatopoeias. The lexico-semantic field is, in its turn, a macroparadigm for microparadigms - lexico-semantic groups. The description of similar lexico-semantic groups of onomatopoeic verbs in tin languages of different systemic structures helped to compare the fragments of the Russian and Kumyk linguistic worldviews. An important role in the process of linguistic objectification of the concept of onomatopoeia is played by phraseological units and proverbs. Thus, the concept of onomatopoeia is universal, but it has different prototypes and national cultural images in each of the analysed languages. The national, culture-specific features of onomatopoeias are demonstrated in semantic and functional dissimilarities, the reasons for which lie in differences in worldview and perception of reality by the Russian and Kumyk peoples. The materials analysed in the article can be used for compiling bilingual and linguistic-cultural dictionaries, as well as for studies on translation theory.

TI  - Multilevel Split Regression Wavelet Analysis for Lossless Compression of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral redundancy is a key element to be exploited in compression of remote sensing data. Combined with an entropy encoder, it can achieve competitive lossless coding performance. One of the latest techniques to decorrelate the spectral signal is the regression wavelet analysis (RWA). RWA applies a wavelet transform in the spectral domain and estimates the detail coefficients through the approximation coefficients using linear regression. RWA was originally coupled with JPEG 2000. This letter introduces a novel coding approach, where RWA is coupled with the predictor of CCSDS-123.0-B-1 standard and a lightweight contextual arithmetic coder. In addition, we also propose a smart strategy to select the number of RWA decomposition levels that maximize the coding performance. Experimental results indicate that, on average, the obtained coding gains vary between 0.1 and 1.35 bits-per-pixel-per-component compared with the other state-of-the-art coding techniques.

TI  - Spectral analysis of wetlands using multi-source optical satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The separability of wetland types using different spectral bands is an important subject, which has not yet been well studied in most countries. This is particularly of interest in Canada because it contains approximately one-fourth of the total global wetlands. In this study, the spectral separability of five wetland classes, namely Bog, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, and Shallow Water, was investigated in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada, using field data and multi-source optical Remote Sensing (RS) images. The objective was to select the most useful spectral bands for wetland studies from four commonly used optical satellites: RapidEye, Sentinel 2A, ASTER, and Landsat 8. However, because the ultimate objective was the classification of wetlands in the province, the separability of wetland classes was also evaluated using several other features, including various spectral indices, as well as textural and ratio features to obtain a high level of classification accuracy. For this purpose, two separability measures were used: The T-statistics, calculated from the parametric t-test method, and the U-statistics, derived from the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. The results indicated that the Near Infrared (NIR) band was the best followed by the Red Edge (RE) band for the discrimination of wetland class pairs. The red band was also the third most useful band for separation of wetland classes, especially for the delineation of the Bog class from the other types. Although the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) and green bands demonstrated poor separability, they were comparatively more informative than the Thermal Infrared (TIR) and blue bands. This study also demonstrated that ratio features and some spectral indices had high potential to differentiate the wetland species. Finally, wetlands in five study areas in NL were classified by inserting the best spectral bands and features into an object-based Random Forest (RF) classifier. By doing so, the mean Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient in the study areas were 86% and 0.82, respectively.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in high-income countries. Although the overall prognosis is relatively good, high-grade endometrial cancers have a tendency to recur. Recurrence needs to be prevented since the prognosis for recurrent endometrial cancer is dismal. Treatment tailored to tumor biology is the optimal strategy to balance treatment efficacy against toxicity. Standard treatment consists of hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Lymphadenectomy (with ongoing studies of sentinel node biopsy) enables identification of lymph node positive patients who need adjuvant treatment, including radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy is used for Stage I-II patients with high-risk factors and Stage III lymph node negative patients. In advanced disease, a combination of surgery to no residual disease and chemotherapy results in the best outcome. Surgery for recurrent disease is only advocated in patients with a good performance status with a relatively long disease-free interval.

TI  - Determining of different inundated land use in Salyan plain during 2010 the Kura River flood through GIS and remote sensing tools
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - People are struggling with floods, which are types of natural disasters. Floods are in the first place among natural disasters in terms of damage to the community and the number of victims. Acquisition data from reliable sources is one of the central issues in the assessment of the condition in areas with high probability of flooding and operative decision making in extreme situations. As the source of this kind of data Remote Sensing data is widely used which is interpreted by Geographical Information Systems technologies in a short time. In addition, accurate geographical linking is possible through modern satellite navigation technology, which makes it possible to spread information quickly and deliver obtained results to customers. Since the Kura River is the source of fresh water in Azerbaijan, most important and strategic importance, there are many settlements, industrial and economic facilities along the riverbed. That is why, as a result of the floods in the downstream of the Kura River, the environment, economic infrastructure, individual spatial areas and the population living in these areas are damaged. As an example of flood damage assesment, the recent flood in 2010 was analyzed. Different archival, field survey and digital materials were used. Maps of flooded areas and the potential infrastructure in flooded areas were determined through ArcGis 10.2.1 software. Among all flooded areas, settlements and pastures had the highest share. The study proved that integration of various spatial data could greatly support flood damage assessment.

TI  - Blood feeding pattern and seasonal distribution of dengue mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae) in Southern Benin.
T2  - International Journal of Biosciences
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the seasonal distribution of Ae. aegypti and its blood feeding pattern in Cotonou, southern Benin, a cross seasonal entomological study on adults of Ae. aegypti was carried out from May 2013 to April 2014 in southern Benin. Ae. aegypti were collected by Human Landing Catches (HLC), Indoor Pyrethrum Spray Catches (PSC), Biogents (BG) sentinel trap and Gravid traps (GT) in order to evaluate the seasonal distribution of Ae. Aegypti in southern Benin. Moreover, blood-meal sources were searched from mosquitoes collected using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). During the year of study, a total number of 18,658 mosquitoes were collected. 15,204 were sampled by HLC; 303 with BG trap, 3,038 with PSC, 48 with the GT. From 13,834 females, 1,380 were blood-fed. Adult's collection was high during the two rainy seasons (June to July and October to November) but declined in the two dry seasons (December to March and August to September). The average of Human Biting Rates (HBR) obtained during the rainy seasons (79.6 bites/person/night) was significantly higher than those obtained during the dry seasons (58.62 bites/p/n) (p < 0.05). Identification of blood-meal sources indicated humans as the primary host. These findings showed the presence of Ae. aegypti year round at Cotonou in southern Benin. Data on blood feeding patterns of Ae. aegypti collected during this study showed that the most important host are humans. These results provide valuable information about potential dengue virus transmission cycles and will help to get a greater understanding about DENV ecology in Benin.

TI  - ETHICAL CONSCIOUSNESS IN UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATIONS: A STUDY FROM PRAXIS AS CONTINUOUS TRAINING
T2  - REVISTA INCLUSIONES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is a study about the experiences of one of the perspectives reached as part of a previous and extensive research work carried out at the Rafael Belloso Chacin University (URBE), Maracaibo, Venezuela. Its purpose is to analyze the ethical conscience that in an organizational sense is presented in said University as a continuous construction process. The result of the work is that the university generates self-knowledge based on praxis as it is lived by the subjects per se from a determined, existent and dynamic educational organizational reality. Through the application of instruments and techniques of phenomenological qualitative research, a dialogical design around the experiences reached with the participants of the study, together with the application interpretation strategies of the Heidegger. s phenomenological hermeneutics, it is concluded that the formation of the ethical conscience is a constant construction. In the phenomenological scope of the analyzed organizational experience, it is observed that this consciousness as such manifests as a reality proper to the subject that from his dialogical experience shows his worldview of being in the world conceiving himself as another. This finally leads to the realization of a community of concrete dialogue. In phenomenological terms, each subject projects their own being as another, in the horizon of an educational praxis as a conscientizing praxis.

TI  - The Role of Climate and Land Use in the Changes in Surface Albedo Prior to Snow Melt and the Timing of Melt Season of Seasonal Snow in Northern Land Areas of 40°N-80°N during 1982-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid warming of the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes and the observed changes in boreal forest areas affect the global surface albedo and climate. This study looks at the trends in the timing of the snow melt season as well as the albedo levels before and after the melt season in Northern Hemisphere land areas between 40 degrees N and 80 degrees N over the years 1982 to 2015. The analysis is based on optical satellite data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). The results show that the changes in surface albedo already begin before the start of the melt season. These albedo changes are significant (the mean of absolute change is 4.4 albedo percentage units per 34 years). The largest absolute changes in pre-melt-season albedo are concentrated in areas of the boreal forest, while the pre-melt albedo of tundra remains unchanged. Trends in melt season timing are consistent over large areas. The mean of absolute change of start date of melt season is 11.2 days per 34 years, 10.6 days for end date of melt season and 14.8 days for length of melt season. The changes result in longer and shorter melt seasons, as well as changed timing of the melt, depending on the area. The albedo levels preceding the onset of melt and start of the melt season correlate with climatic parameters (air temperature, precipitation, wind speed). The changes in albedo are more closely linked to changes in vegetation, whereas the changes in melt season timing are linked to changes in climate.

TI  - Dialectical GAN for SAR Image Translation: From Sentinel-1 to TerraSAR-X
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With more and more SAR applications, the demand for enhanced high-quality SAR images has increased considerably. However, high-quality SAR images entail high costs, due to the limitations of current SAR devices and their image processing resources. To improve the quality of SAR images and to reduce the costs of their generation, we propose a Dialectical Generative Adversarial Network (Dialectical GAN) to generate high-quality SAR images. This method is based on the analysis of hierarchical SAR information and the dialectical structure of GAN frameworks. As a demonstration, a typical example will be shown, where a low-resolution SAR image (e.g., a Sentinel-1 image) with large ground coverage is translated into a high-resolution SAR image (e.g., a TerraSAR-X image). A new algorithm is proposed based on a network framework by combining conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein Generative Adversarial NetworkGradient Penalty) loss functions and Spatial Gram matrices under the rule of dialectics. Experimental results show that the SAR image translation works very well when we compare the results of our proposed method with the selected traditional methods.

TI  - Remote sensing of water constituent concentrations using time series of in-situ hyperspectral measurements in the Wadden Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the capability of the two-stream radiative transfer model 2SeaColor for the simultaneous retrieval of Chlorophyll-a (Chla), Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) and Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) concentrations from remote sensing measurements under various conditions (i.e., solar zenith angle values (SZAs) and water turbidity levels). For this evaluation, a time series of diurnal in-situ hyperspectral measurements of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) concurrent with in-situ measured Chla and SPM concentrations between 2008 and 2010 by the NIOZ jetty station (the NJS), located in the Dutch part of the Wadden Sea, was used. Validation of the model retrievals against in-situ measurements showed an acceptable accuracy (Chla: R-2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 2.98 [mg m(-3)]; SPM: R-2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 2.53 [g m(-3)]) with good agreement between the temporal trends of measured and retrieved concentration values over multiple years. However, the model inversion results yielded less good estimates at SZA > 60 degrees during winter. Furthermore, the effect of the tide on the variation of daily time series of Chla and SPM concentrations was analyzed. At the particular NJS location, the tidal effects on the concentrations of SPM and Chla were found to be small. The capability of the 2SeaColor model to retrieve reliable estimates, and the favorable location of the NJS, which is little influenced by tidal phase variations, contribute to a better understanding of the long-term variability of Chla and SPM concentrations. The results of this study may support the ongoing efforts on Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) calibration and validation at the Dutch Wadden Sea.

TI  - Influence of summer conditions on surface water properties and phytoplankton productivity in embayments of the South Shetland Islands
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Phytoplankton productivity in glaciomarine embayments of the West Antarctic Peninsula is constrained because of extensive thermohaline variability, which is due to seasonal sea-ice and glacial melting. To determine whether or not this affects the biology of the water column, we explored the influence of surface water properties on phytoplankton productivity in four embayments of the South Shetland Islands (SSI) during late summer of 2013. We analyzed hydrographic, climatic, and primary productivity satellite data (wind velocity, sea-ice cover, and chlorophyll-a), in situ CTD measurements of physical and chemical characteristics, new estimates of net primary production (NPP), and surface water samples for chlorophyll-a, nutrients, biogenic silica, and plankton composition. Sea-ice cover at the SSI was similar to 20% during February. Long-term satellite wind data (2010-2015) showed that during February 2013 the average wind velocity was similar to 2ms(-1) higher than the long-term mean with two low sea surface temperature events occurring simultaneously at all sites. The CTD profiles did not show vertical salinity changes, although salinity was highly correlated with the percentage of integrated nanoplankton Chl-a, which represented>50% of the total integrated Chl-a in all the embayments. Phytoplankton was the major contributor to the integrated carbon biomass of the upper water column, where centric diatoms predominated. The contribution of microzooplankton and bacterioplankton at the different sites explained NPP values and the trophic mode at each site. Specifically, NPP at Fildes Bay exhibited an autotrophic productivity mode in contrast to Collins Bay, where both heterotrophic and autotrophic modes alternated, mainly due to weekly changes in community respiration rates.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-2A Data to Model Surface and Canopy Fuel Characteristics in Relation to Crown Fire Hazard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Crown fires are often intense and fast spreading and hence can have serious impacts on soil, vegetation, and wildlife habitats. Fire managers try to prevent the initiation and spread of crown fires in forested landscapes through fuel management. The minimum fuel conditions necessary to initiate and propagate crown fires are known to be strongly influenced by four stand structural variables: surface fuel load (SFL), fuel strata gap (FSG), canopy base height (CBH), and canopy bulk density (CBD). However, there is often a lack of quantitative data about these variables, especially at the landscape scale. Methods: In this study, data from 123 sample plots established in pure, even-aged, Pinus radiata and Pinus pinaster stands in northwest Spain were analyzed. In each plot, an intensive field inventory was used to characterize surface and canopy fuels load and structure, and to estimate SFL, FSG, CBH, and CBD. Equations relating these variables to Sentinel-2A (S-2A) bands and vegetation indices were obtained using two non-parametric techniques: Random Forest (RF) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Results: According to the goodness-of-fit statistics, RF models provided the most accurate estimates, explaining more than 12%, 37%, 47%, and 31% of the observed variability in SFL, FSG, CBH, and CBD, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the four equations considered, the observed and estimated values of the four fuel variables were used separately to predict the potential type of wildfire (surface fire, passive crown fire, or active crown fire) for each plot, considering three different burning conditions (low, moderate, and extreme). The results of the confusion matrix indicated that 79.8% of the surface fires and 93.1% of the active crown fires were correctly classified; meanwhile, the highest rate of misclassification was observed for passive crown fire, with 75.6% of the samples correctly classified. Conclusions: The results highlight that the combination of medium resolution imagery and machine learning techniques may add valuable information about surface and canopy fuel variables at large scales, whereby crown fire potential and the potential type of wildfire can be classified.

TI  - Evaluation of phenospectral dynamics with Sentinel-2A using a bottom-up approach in a northern ombrotrophic peatland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands cover very large extents in northern regions and play a significant role in the global carbon cycle by functioning as a carbon sink. Large-scale satellite based monitoring systems, such as the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI), are necessary to improve our understanding of how these ecosystems respond to climate change by providing verifiable land products. For instance, satellite-based land product validation approaches can benefit from airborne hyperspectral imagery and in-situ data, which provide higher spatial and spectral resolution baselines, ideal for measuring vegetation changes (e.g. phenology, LAI) at local scales. Here, we assessed the short-term phenospectral dynamics (spectral changes indicated by specific spectral features as a function of phenology) of five ombrotrophic peatland vegetation physiognomies over four dates at the Mer Bleue bog in Canada. We took advantage of a unique remote sensing data acquisition campaign aiming to validate Sentinel-2A land products, and analyzed three spatially and spectrally distinctive datasets (i.e. field spectra, VISNIR airborne hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and Sentinel-2A imagery) over the first half of the 2016 growing season. By implementing a bottom-up approach, first we assessed the airborne HSI's capability to detect phenological changes as compared to in-situ acquired field spectroscopy measurements in a 10 ha area at Mer Bleue and evaluated the spectral features characteristic of these phenological changes. Second, over the entire Mer Bleue area (28,000 ha), we compared a series of four Sentinel-2A images to four airborne HSI mosaics (spatially and spectrally resampled to Sentinel-2A) to assess the utility of Sentinel-2A for detecting small spectral variations due to phenological changes (i.e. greening). In addition, for this second comparison, three spectral vegetation indices were derived from the Sentinel-2A images and the airborne HSI mosaics. The spectral comparisons between the airborne HSI and the field spectroscopy data revealed clear phenological changes from the airborne HSI. For instance, a closer agreement between reflectance measured by the field spectrometer and the airborne HSI spectral response was found in the visible region (450-680 nm). A greater difference however, was consistently seen in the near-infrared region (681-866 nm) across the four dates. Narrow spectral features in three regions of the visible range (global minima, red absorption, green peak), indicating changes in vegetation colour, were consistent for both datasets and with expected phenological patterns at Mer Bleue. At the landscape level, Sentinel-2A mirrored the spectral changes depicted by the resampled HSI data. However, band level, pair-wise comparisons showed significant differences (p < 0.001) in reflectance for each band, with Sentinel-2A exhibiting higher reflectance values than the HSI for the first three dates. Only for the last date (June 23rd) did the airborne HSI have higher reflectance values or no significant difference with the Sentinel-2A data. Overall, our three datasets captured the short-term phenological changes at Mer Bleue and have provided promising results in terms of using the Sentinel-2A MSI sensor to monitor these changes at the landscape level.

TI  - INTUITION OF IMMORTALITY IN VLADIMIR NABOKOV'S "ULTIMA THULE"
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to find the points of contact between Bergson's philosophy and Nabokov's worldview, to determine the extent and depth of Bergson's influence on Nabokov, and due to this to more accurately describe the metaphysical views of the writer. It seems possible to read the story "Ultima Thule" in the light of the metaphysics of Bergson, the only author whose influence the writer himself acknowledged, and to make sure that Nabokov not only borrows some of the principles of the teachings of the thinker close to him, but, as the original creator, transforming them, creates his own philosophy of life. The protagonist of the story, the artist Sineusov, who lost his wife, tries to unravel the mystery of death and immortality. And some Adam Falter should help him in this. He used to be the main character's tutor, later became a businessman, and eventually turned into a "madman", accidentally discovering "the essence of all things". An attempt to understand what Falter's discovery consists in constitutes the content of the article. It is known that in Bergson's theory, Nabokov was primarily attracted by the concept of the temporary existence of the world and man realized in such categories as memory and intuition. These themes permeate the entire work of the writer. They also appear in "Ultima Thule". Besides this, Nabokov shared the views of the French philosopher on the problem of reason. Both of them say that it is impossible to know the mystery of the world only with the help of conceptual thinking. Accordingly, there must be a different path, a different method of cognition. In Bergson's philosophy, intuition becomes this method. In the course of the study, it is shown how the main principles of Bergson's philosophy are realized in Nabokov's text. Based on the comparative and contrastive analysis, the article draws the following conclusion. Both Bergson and Nabokov perceive life not as a secondary system in relation to eternity, or otherworldliness, but as the very essence of the world, its primary principle. Accordingly, true knowledge can be approached only by studying life, perceiving it not indirectly, like using various gnosiological methods, but directly. Rejecting the positivist view of the world, Bergson introduces time, duration into the very foundation of the world, and the world becomes alive - creative, dynamic and continuously developing. In accordance with the new understanding of the world as a creative substance, a new understanding of man also comes. Man is first of all a creator. And for Nabokov, whose main character is always a creator, the comprehension of the mystery of the otherworldness is possible not only by immersion in the very fabric of life, but more through art. The answers to the main questions of "Ultima Thule" - life, death, immortality - by definition cannot be straightforward and unambiguous. But, as it seems, reading the story in the light of Henri Bergson's ideas clears up a lot.

TI  - MagIO: Magnetic Field Strength Based Indoor- Outdoor Detection with a Commercial Smartphone
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - A wide range of localization techniques has been proposed recently that leverage smartphone sensors. Context awareness serves as the backbone of these localization techniques, which helps them to shift the localization technologies to improve efficiency and energy utilization. Indoor-outdoor (IO) context sensing plays a vital role for such systems, which serve both indoor and outdoor localization. IO systems work with collaborative technologies including the Global Positioning System (GPS), cellular tower signals, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a variety of smartphone sensors. GPS- and Wi-Fi-based systems are power hungry, and their accuracy is severed by limiting factors like multipath, shadowing, etc. On the other hand, various built-in smartphone sensors can be deployed for environmental sensing. Although these sensors can play a crucial role, yet they are very less studied. This research aims at investigating the use of ambient magnetic field data alone from a smartphone for IO detection. The research first investigates the feasibility of utilizing magnetic field data alone for IO detection and then extracts different features suitable for IO detection to be used in machine learning-based classifiers to discriminate between indoor and outdoor environments. The experiments are performed at three different places including a subway station, a shopping mall and Yeungnam University (YU), Korea. The training data are collected from one spot of the campus, and testing is performed with data from various locations of the above-mentioned places. The experiment involves Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 and Samsung Galaxy Round smartphones. The results show that the magnetic data from smartphone magnetic sensor embody enough information and can discriminate the indoor environment from the outdoor environment. Naive Bayes (NB) outperforms with a classification accuracy of 83.26%, as against Support vector machines (SVM), random induction (RI), gradient boosting machines (GBM), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and decision trees (DT), whose accuracies are 67.21%, 73.38%, 73.40%, 78.59%, 69.53% and 68.60%, respectively. kNN, SVM and DT do not perform well when noisy data are used for classification. Additionally, other dynamic scenarios affect the attitude of magnetic data and degrade the performance of SVM, RI and GBM. NB and RF prove to be more noise tolerant and environment adaptable and perform very well in dynamic scenarios. Keeping in view the performance of these classifiers, an ensemble-based stacking scheme is presented, which utilizes DT and RI as the base learners and naive Bayes as the ensemble classifier. This approach is able to achieve an accuracy of 85.30% using the magnetic data of the smartphone magnetic sensor. Moreover, with an increase in training data, the accuracy of the stacking scheme can be elevated by 0.83%. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with GPS-, Wi-Fi- and light sensor-based IO detection.

TI  - Band Ratios Matrix Transformation (BRMT): A Sedimentary Lithology Mapping Approach Using ASTER Satellite Sensor
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing imagery has become an operative and applicable tool for the preparation of geological maps by reducing the costs and increasing the precision. In this study, ASTER satellite remote sensing data were used to extract lithological information of Deh-Molla sedimentary succession, which is located in the southwest of Shahrood city, Semnan Province, North Iran. A robust and effective approach named Band Ratio Matrix Transformation (BRMT) was developed to characterize and discriminate the boundary of sedimentary rock formations in Deh-Molla region. The analysis was based on the forward and continuous division of the visible-near infrared (VNIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of ASTER with subsequent application of principal component analysis (PCA) for producing new transform datasets. The approach was implemented to ASTER spectral band ratios for mapping dominated mineral assemblages in the study area. Quartz, carbonate, and Al, Fe, Mg -OH bearing-altered minerals such as kaolinite, alunite, chlorite and mica were appropriately mapped using the BRMT approach. The results match well with geology map of the study area, fieldwork data and laboratory analysis. Accuracy assessment of the mapping result represents a reasonable kappa coefficient (0.70%) and appropriate overall accuracy (74.64%), which verified the robustness of the BRMT approach. This approach has great potential and capability for mapping sedimentary succession with diverse local-geological-physical characteristics around the world.

TI  - Using Landsat imagery to map understory shrub expansion relative to landscape position in a mid-Appalachian watershed
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, shrub expansion is an important driver of ecological change. However, most studies of shrub expansion have focused on dryland ecosystems (e.g., savannas, rangelands, grasslands), or in tundra regions (e.g., arctic, alpine). However, shrubs play a key role in other systems, such as the understory of temperate forests. In the Appalachian forests of the eastern United States, rhododendron (Rhododendron maximum) is the most prevalent species constituent of the understory evergreen shrub community and can affect forest diversity and structure by altering light and moisture regimes, and changing soil chemical and physical properties. We examine the spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of the evergreen shrub layer within a mid-Appalachian forest over the period from 1986 to 2011 using Landsat TM data to explore how shrub expansion is related to landscape position (e.g., elevation, aspect, and distance-to-stream). We use a combination of remotely sensed vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, tasseled cap indices) derived from snow-free, leaf-off Landsat 5 surface reflectance data from 1986 to 2011 paired with a Random Forest classification model to examine shrub dynamics in the Weimer Run watershed near Canaan Valley, West Virginia, a first-order, high-altitude watershed. We show extensive increases in winter greenness we attribute to expansion of the evergreen shrub community. From 1986 to 2011, there is a 0.14 increase in winter NDVI, with a 52% relative increase in shrub coverage over 25 yr. Shrub expansion is most notable at lower elevations, along streams, and on southerly oriented slopes. We argue that changes in shrub abundance are due to decreased moisture limitations driven by changing climate. There is an increased effort to reintroduce native conifers to this region, but changes in the shrub community jeopardize this effort, as rhododendron inhibits the growth and dispersal of these conifers (e.g., red spruce). Our results show that rhododendron shrubs are expanding into areas of the forest from which they have previously been restricted. Use of these remote sensing methods may allow better habitat suitability mapping, leading to better targeted restoration efforts and more-informed ecosystem forecasts.

TI  - Monitoring land use and land cover changes due to extensive gold mining, urban expansion, and agriculture in the Pra River Basin of Ghana, 1986-2025
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used the double cumulative curve and visual image interpretation methods for the selection of spatiotemporal Landsat data to evaluate the land degradation by anthropogenic activities in the Pra River Basin (PRB) of Ghana. Unsupervised and supervised classification procedures were used to map the land use and land cover (LULC) distribution from 1986 to 2016. Assessment of LULC showed that the PRB has been subjected to six different rates of land degradation in the years 1986, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2013, and 2016. This is due to increase in settlement, cropland, and mining activities to about 130%, 198%, and 304%, respectively. The Markov chain and cellular automation integrated model was successful in predicting LULC distribution in 2016 and the outcomes were comparable to the actual LULC for 2016. The projected LULC for 2025 showed that land degradation is significant in the western and the eastern parts where cropland and forest are, respectively, converted to mining activity. The northern, southern, and middle parts of PRB are expected to experience high settlement expansion, sedimentation in the rivers, and cropland expansion, respectively. The results will aid natural resources management, planning, and sustainable development at PRB. In addition, the research method serves as guideline for other related studies in an attempt to investigate, quantify, and project LULC change in forest ecological areas.

TI  - An Effective Data-Driven Method for 3-D Building Roof Reconstruction and Robust Change Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of building roofs can be an essential prerequisite for 3-D building change detection, which is important for detection of informal buildings or extensions and for update of 3-D map database. However, automatic 3-D roof reconstruction from the remote sensing data is still in its development stage for a number of reasons. For instance, there are difficulties in determining the neighbourhood relationships among the planes on a complex building roof, locating the step edges from point cloud data often requires additional information or may impose constraints, and missing roof planes attract human interaction and often produces high reconstruction errors. This research introduces a new 3-D roof reconstruction technique that constructs an adjacency matrix to define the topological relationships among the roof planes. It identifies any missing planes through an analysis using the 3-D plane intersection lines between adjacent planes. Then, it generates new planes to fill gaps of missing planes. Finally, it obtains complete building models through insertion of approximate wall planes and building floor. The reported research in this paper then uses the generated building models to detect 3-D changes in buildings. Plane connections between neighbouring planes are first defined to establish relationships between neighbouring planes. Then, each building in the reference and test model sets is represented using a graph data structure. Finally, the height intensity images, and if required the graph representations, of the reference and test models are directly compared to find and categorise 3-D changes into five groups: new, unchanged, demolished, modified and partially-modified planes. Experimental results on two Australian datasets show high object- and pixel-based accuracy in terms of completeness, correctness, and quality for both 3-D roof reconstruction and change detection techniques. The proposed change detection technique is robust to various changes including addition of a new veranda to or removal of an existing veranda from a building and increase of the height of a building.

AB  - This study, based on archival, literary, and field data collected by the author, discusses the role of the snake, the frog, and the mouse in the Buryat mythology, folklore, and ritual. Using the respective lexemes, categories of these animals in the folk ethno-zoological classification are described and are shown to be overlapping. The meaning of the principal zoonyms-mogoy, khorkhoy, bakha, and khulgana-is assessed. In traditional beliefs, "reptiles", "amphibians", and "murines" have a mostly negative connotation. The snake, however, is ambivalent but mostly positive. Chthonic animals in general are ambivalent, like the elements such as water and earth. Their symbolism is related to the ideas of vital energy, fertility, wealth, but also to illness and death.

TI  - Fusion of TanDEM-X and Cartosat-1 elevation data supported by neural network-predicted weight maps
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the bistatic SAR interferometry mission TanDEM-X provided a global terrain map with unprecedented accuracy. However, visual inspection and empirical assessment of TanDEM-X elevation data against high-resolution ground truth illustrates that the quality of the DEM decreases in urban areas because of SAR-inherent imaging properties. One possible solution for an enhancement of the TanDEM-X DEM quality is to fuse it with other elevation data derived from high-resolution optical stereoscopic imagery, such as that provided by the Cartosat-1 mission. This is usually done by Weighted Averaging (WA) of previously aligned DEM cells. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a method to efficiently predict weight maps in order to achieve optimized fusion results. The prediction is modeled using a fully connected Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The idea of this ANN is to extract suitable features from DEMs that relate to height residuals in training areas and then to automatically learn the pattern of the relationship between height errors and features. The results show the DEM fusion based on the ANN-predicted weights improves the qualities of the study DEMs. Apart from increasing the absolute accuracy of Cartosat-1 DEM by DEM fusion, the relative accuracy (respective to reference LiDAR data) of DEMs is improved by up to 50% in urban areas and 22% in non-urban areas while the improvement by the HEM-based method does not exceed 20% and 10% in urban and non-urban areas respectively.

Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) utilizes remote sensing data in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer that would be converted into what is so called the C-Factor of the equation. The spatial resolution of the remote sensing data plays an important role in deriving the NVDI layer. Therefore, two different remote sensing data will be used to derive two different NDVI layers with 30 and 10 m spatial resolution. The results of the utilizing the different remote sensing data were crossed checked against ground truth data collected from 37 points randomly distributed within the designated study area.

TI  - The Performance of Multiple Model-Simulated Soil Moisture Datasets Relative to ECV Satellite Data in China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliability and accuracy of soil moisture datasets are essential for understanding changes in regional climate such as precipitation and temperature. Soil moisture datasets from the Essential Climate Variable (ECV), the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and reanalysis products are widely used. These datasets generated by different techniques are compared in a common framework over China in this study. The comparison focuses on four aspects: spatial pattern, temporal correlation, long-term trend, and the relationships with precipitation and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results indicate that all soil moisture datasets reach a good agreement on the spatial patterns of wet and dry soil. These patterns are also consistent with that of precipitation. However, there are considerable discrepancies in the absolute values of soil moisture among these datasets. In terms of unbiased Root-Mean-Square Difference (unRMSE, i.e., removing the differences in absolute values), all modeled datasets obtain performances comparable with ECV observations. Our results also suggest that a multi-model ensemble of soil moisture datasets can improve the representation of soil moisture conditions. The optimal dataset from which the wetting/drying trends in soil moisture have the highest consistency in terms of changes in precipitation and NDVI varies by season. Specifically, in spring, CMIP5 in northwest China shows that the trends in soil moisture are consistent with the changes in precipitation and NDVI. In summer, ECV presents the most identical performance compared to the changes in precipitation and NDVI. In autumn, GLDAS and Reanalysis have better performance in south China and parts of north China. In winter, GLDAS performs the best in the east of south China, followed by the Reanalysis dataset. These discrepancies among the datasets present various changes in different regions, which should be well noted and discussed before use.

TI  - Towards Operational Satellite-Based Damage-Mapping Using U-Net Convolutional Network: A Case Study of 2011 Tohoku Earthquake-Tsunami
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite remote-sensing-based damage-mapping technique has played an indispensable role in rapid disaster response practice, whereas the current disaster response practice remains subject to the low damage assessment accuracy and lag in timeliness, which dramatically reduces the significance and feasibility of extending the present method to practical operational applications. Therefore, a highly efficient and intelligent remote-sensing image-processing framework is urgently required to mitigate these challenges. In this article, a deep learning algorithm for the semantic segmentation of high-resolution remote-sensing images using the U-net convolutional network was proposed to map the damage rapidly. The algorithm was implemented within a Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit framework in the GeoAI platform provided by Microsoft. The study takes the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake-Tsunami as a case study, for which the pre- and post-disaster high-resolution WorldView-2 image is used. The performance of the proposed U-net model is compared with that of deep residual U-net. The comparison highlights the superiority U-net for tsunami damage mapping in this work. Our proposed method achieves the overall accuracy of 70.9% in classifying the damage into washed away, collapsed, and survived at the pixel level. In future disaster scenarios, our proposed model can generate the damage map in approximately 2-15 min when the preprocessed remote-sensing datasets are available. Our proposed damage-mapping framework has significantly improved the application value in operational disaster response practice by substantially reducing the manual operation steps required in the actual disaster response. Besides, the proposed framework is highly flexible to extend to other scenarios and various disaster types, which can accelerate operational disaster response practice.

TI  - Photochemical model evaluation of 2013 California wild fire air quality impacts using surface, aircraft, and satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Rim Fire was one of the largest wildfires in California history, burning over 250,000 acres during August and September 2013 affecting air quality locally and regionally in the western U.S. Routine surface monitors, remotely sensed data, and aircraft based measurements were used to assess how well the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) photochemical grid model applied at 4 and 12 km resolution represented regional plume transport and chemical evolution during this extreme wildland fire episode. Impacts were generally similar at both grid resolutions although notable differences were seen in some secondary pollutants (e.g., formaldehyde and peroxyacyl nitrate) near the Rim fire. The modeling system does well at capturing near-fire to regional scale smoke plume transport compared to remotely sensed aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aircraft transect measurements. Plume rise for the Rim fire was well characterized as the modeled plume top was consistent with remotely sensed data and the altitude of aircraft measurements, which were typically made at the top edge of the plume. Aircraft-based lidar suggests O-3 downwind in the Rim fire plume was vertically stratified and tended to be higher at the plume top, while CMAQ estimated a more uniformly mixed column of O-3. Predicted wildfire ozone (O-3) was overestimated both at the plume top and at nearby rural and urban surface monitors. Photolysis rates were well characterized by the model compared with aircraft measurements meaning aerosol attenuation was reasonably estimated and unlikely contributing to O-3 overestimates at the top of the plume. Organic carbon was underestimated close to the Rim fire compared to aircraft data, but was consistent with nearby surface measurements. Periods of elevated surface PM2.5 at rural monitors near the Rim fire were not usually coincident with elevated O-3. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Antibiotics prescription and complementary tests based on frequency of use and loyalty in Primary Care
T2  - ANALES DE PEDIATRIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess whether there is a relationship between the prescription of antibiotics and the performance of complementary tests with frequency of use and loyalty in Primary Care.Methods: Analytical descriptive study performed through a network of Primary Care sentinel paediatricians (PAPenRed). Each paediatrician reviewed the spontaneous visits (in Primary Care and in Emergency Departments) of 15 patients for 12 months, randomly chosen from their quota. The prescription of antibiotics and the complementary tests performed on these patients were also collected.Results: A total of 212 paediatricians took part and reviewed 2,726 patients. It was found that 8.3% were moderate over-users (mean + 1-2 standard deviations) and 5.2% extreme over-users (mean + 2 standard deviations). Almost half (49.6%) were high-loyalty patients (more than 75% of visits with their doctor).The incidence ratio of antibiotic prescriptions for moderate over-users was 2.13 (1.74-2.62) and 3.25 (2.55-4.13) for extreme over-users, compared to non-over-user children. The incidence ratio for the diagnostic tests were 2.25 (1.86-2.73) and 3.48 (2.78-4.35), respectively.The incidence ratios for antibiotic prescription were 1.34 (1.16-1.55) in patients with medium-high loyalty, 1.45 (1.15- 1.83) for medium-low loyalty, and 1.08 (0.81-1.44) for those with low loyalty, compared to patients with high loyalty. The incidence ratios to perform diagnostic tests were 1.46 (1.27-1.67); 1.60 (1.28 - 2.00), and 0.84 (0.63-1.12), respectively.Conclusions: Antibiotics prescription and complementary tests were significantly related to medical overuse. They were also related to loyalty, but less significantly. (C) 2017 Asociacion Espanola de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Evaluating automated approaches to anaphylaxis case classification using unstructured data from the FDA Sentinel System
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn May 2008, the Food and Drug Administration launched the Sentinel Initiative, a multi-year program for the establishment of a national electronic monitoring system for medical product safety that led, in 2016, to the launch of the full Sentinel System. Under the Mini-Sentinel pilot, several algorithms for identifying health outcomes of interest, including one for anaphylaxis, were developed and evaluated using data available from the Sentinel common data model.PurposeMethodsTo evaluate whether features extracted from unstructured narrative data using natural language processing (NLP) could be used to classify anaphylaxis cases.Using previously developed methods, we extracted features from unstructured narrative data using NLP and applied rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to identify anaphylaxis among 62 potential cases previously classified by human experts as anaphylaxis (N=33), not anaphylaxis (N=27), and unknown (N=2).ResultsConclusionsThe rule-based and similarity-based approaches demonstrated almost equal performance (recall 100% vs 100%, precision 60.3% vs 57.4%, F-measure: 0.753 vs 0.729). Reasons for misclassification included the inability of the algorithms to make the same clinical judgments as human experts about the timing, severity, or presence of alternative explanations; and the identification of terms consistent with anaphylaxis but present in conditions other than anaphylaxis.Although precision needs to be improved before these algorithms could be used without human review, we demonstrated that applying rule-based and similarity-based algorithms to unstructured narrative information from clinical records can be used for classification of anaphylaxis in the Sentinel System. Further development and assessment of these methods in the Sentinel System are warranted.

TI  - Surface soil moisture retrievals over partially vegetated areas from the synergy of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 data using a modified water-cloud model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, is presented a new methodology for retrieving surface soil moisture (SSM) under conditions of partial vegetation cover based on the synergy between Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Landsat Operational Land Image (OLI) data. To remove the effect of vegetation on SSM retrieval, the Landsat OLI spectral index is applied to build a model for the vegetation water content estimation. The model is substituted into the original water-cloud model, and thus a modified water-cloud model with a spectral index is built. Additionally, an SSM estimation model is developed based on the modified water-cloud model. The technique was tested at two experimental sites in the UK and Spain on which reference data of SSM are acquired operationally by ground observational networks. In overall, the key findings of our study were: (1) For a vegetation-covered surface, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) obtained from the 1.57-1.65 pm band reflectance data was the most suitable for removing the effects of vegetation cover on soil water content estimation; (2) Compared to the Sentinel-1 VH polarization, the backscattering coefficient at VV polarization was more suitable for soil moisture retrieval and obtained a higher accuracy; (3) The developed model could be used to retrieve SSM under vegetation cover with a high accuracy that indicates the correlation coefficient (R) between the estimated and measured soil moisture was 0.911 and that the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.053 cm3/cm3; (4) The model can be used to retrieve regional SSM with a high spatial and temporal resolution. Our methodology for deriving SSM offers a number of advantages for many practical applications and research alike and its use by the wider community remains to be seen.

TI  - Shoreline Change Analysis at Chilika Lagoon Coast, India Using Digital Shoreline Analysis System
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline is the dynamic interfaces of both terrestrial and marine environment, which constantly affected by natural coastal processes includes wave, tide, littoral drift and cyclonic storms as well as coastal development. Wave induced littoral drift and fluvial discharge causing the gradual inlet migration and has the concurrent impact on shoreline of Chilika lagoon. This study is to determine the long-term shoreline changes along the coast of Chilika lagoon. Historical satellite images were used to analyse the shoreline erosion and accretion based on statistical approach. The satellite data from 1975 to 2015 were processed by using ERDAS Imagine and the shorelines are extracted. The shoreline oscillation was analysed at an interval of 100 m along the coast of Chilika lagoon using DSAS software. Most commonly used statistical methods such as end point rate and linear regression rate are used. The shoreline change analysis for entire coast of the lagoon since 40 years (1975-2015) indicates that 62% is of accretion, 25% is under stable coast and erosion is 13%. The result reveals that the lagoon coast shows high accretion of 9.12 m/year at updrift side of the lagoon inlet whereas the downdrift side shows high erosion of - 10.73 m/year due to the wave induced northeasterly longshore sediment transport round the year and riverine discharge. This study would provide the potential erosion and accretion area at Chilika lagoon coast and would help in adaptive shoreline management plan.

TI  - Assimilation of ground and satellite magnetic measurements: inference of core surface magnetic and velocity field changes
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We jointly invert for magnetic and velocity fields at the core surface over the period 1997-2017, directly using ground-based observatory time-series and measurements from the CHAMP and Swarm satellites. Satellite data are reduced to the form of virtual observatory time-series distributed on a regular grid in space. Such a sequential storage helps incorporate voluminous modern magnetic data into a stochastic Kalman filter, whereby spatial constraints are incorporated based on a norm derived from statistics of a numerical geodynamo model. Our algorithm produces consistent solutions both in terms of the misfit to the data and the estimated posterior model uncertainties. We retrieve core flow features previously documented from the analysis of spherical harmonic field models, such as the eccentric anticyclonic gyre. We find enhanced diffusion patterns under both Indonesia and Africa. In contrast to a steady flow that is strong under the Atlantic hemisphere but very weak below the Pacific, interannual motions appear evenly distributed over the two hemispheres. Recovered interannual to decadal flow changes are predominantly symmetrical with respect to the equator outside the tangent cylinder. In contrast, under the Northern Pacific we find an intensification of a high latitude jet, but see no evidence for a corresponding feature in the Southern hemisphere. The largest flow accelerations that we isolate over the studied era are associated with meanders, attached to the equatorward meridional branch of the planetary gyre in the Eastern hemisphere, that are linked to the appearance of an eastward equatorial jet below the Western Pacific.

TI  - Predicting Non-sentinel Lymph Node Metastases in Patients with a Positive Sentinel Lymph Node After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The standard of care for breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) who have a positive sentinel lymph node (+SLN) after NAC is completion axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). This study aimed to develop a nomogram to predict additional nodal disease in patients with +SLN after NAC.The study reviewed patients 18 years of age or older who had invasive breast cancer treated with NAC followed by SLN surgery with +SLN and ALND between 2006 and 2017 at the authors' institution. Factors predictive of positive non-SLNs were analyzed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression.The study identified 120 patients with +SLN after NAC and ALND. Of these patients, 30.8% were clinically node-negative (cN-), and 69.2% were clinically node-positive (cN+) before NAC. Tumor biology was human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+) for 20%, hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2- for 66.7%, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) for 13.3% of the patients. Additional nodal disease was found on ALND for 63.3% of the patients. In the univariate analysis, the factors predictive of positive non-SLNs were biologic subtype (TNBC and HR+/HER2- vs HER2+; p < 0.001), higher grade (p = 0.047), higher pT category (p = 0.02), SLN extranodal extension (p = 0.03), larger SLN metastasis size (p < 0.001), and higher number of +SLNs (p = 0.02). The factors significant in the multivariable analysis included number of +SLNs, grade 3 vs grade 1 or 2, HER2+ versus HER2-, cN+ versus cN-, and larger SLN metastasis size. The resulting model showed excellent discrimination (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.90) and good calibration (p = 0.54, Hosmer-Lemeshow).A clinical prediction model incorporating biologic subtype, grade, clinical node status, size of the largest SLN metastasis, and number of +SLNs can help physicians and patients estimate the likelihood of additional nodal disease and may be useful for guiding decision making regarding axillary management.

TI  - Mapping continuous fields of tree and shrub cover across the Gran Chaco using Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests and savannas provide important ecosystem services and harbor high biodiversity, yet are globally under pressure from land-use change. Mapping changes in the condition of dry forests and savannas is therefore critical. This can be challenging given that these ecosystems are characterized by continuous gradients of tree and shrub cover, resulting in considerable structural complexity. We developed a novel approach to map, separately, continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover across the South American Gran Chaco (1,100,000 km(2)), making full use of the Landsat-8 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image archives. We gathered a large training dataset digitized from very-high resolution imagery and used a gradient-boosting framework to model continuous fields of tree cover and shrub cover at 30-m resolution. Our regression models had high to moderate predictive power (85.5% for tree cover, and 68.5% for shrub cover) and resulted in reliable tree and shrub cover maps (mean squared error of 4.4% and 6.4% for tree- and shrub cover respectively). Models jointly using optical and SAR imagery performed substantially better than models using single-sensor imagery, and model predictors differed strongly in some regions, especially in areas of dense vegetation cover. Mapping tree and shrub cover separately allowed identifying distinct vegetation formations, with shrub-dominated systems mainly in the very dry Chaco, woodlands with large trees mainly in the dry Chaco, and tree-dominated savannas in the wet Chaco. Our tree and shrub cover layers also revealed considerable edge effects in terms of woody cover away from agricultural fields (edge effects extending about 2 km), smallholder ranches (about 1.2 km), and roads and railways (about 1.4 and 0.9 km, respectively). Our analyses highlight both the substantial footprint of land-use on remaining natural vegetation in the Chaco, and the potential of multi-sensoral approaches to monitor forest degradation. More broadly, our approach shows that mapping canopy structure and distinct layers of woody vegetation in dry forest and savannas is possible across large areas, and highlights the value of the growing Landsat and Sentinel archives for doing so.

TI  - Prior Season Crop Type Masks for Winter Wheat Yield Forecasting: A US Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and forecasting crop yields is a critical component of understanding and better addressing global food security challenges. Detailed spatial information on crop-type distribution is fundamental for in-season crop condition monitoring and yields forecasting over large agricultural areas, as it enables the extraction of crop-specific signals. Yet, the availability of such data within the growing season is often limited. Within this context, this study seeks to develop a practical approach to extract a crop-specific signal for yield forecasting in cases where crop rotations are prevalent, and detailed in-season information on crop type distribution is not available. We investigated the possibility of accurately forecasting winter wheat yields by using a counter-intuitive approach, which coarsens the spatial resolution of out-of-date detailed winter wheat masks and uses them in combination with easily accessibly coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed time series data. The main idea is to explore an optimal spatial resolution at which crop type changes will be negligible due to crop rotation (so a previous seasons' mask, which is more readily available can be used) and an informative signal can be extracted, so it can be correlated to crop yields. The study was carried out in the United States of America (USA) and utilized multiple years of NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) detailed wheat masks, and a regression-based winter wheat yield model. The results indicate that, in places where crop rotations were prevalent, coarsening the spatial scale of a crop type mask from the previous season resulted in a constant per-pixel wheat proportion over multiple seasons. This enables the consistent extraction of a crop-specific vegetation index time series that can be used for in-season monitoring and yield estimation over multiple years using a single mask. In the case of the USA, using a moderate resolution crop type mask from a previous season aggregated to 5 km resolution, resulted in a 0.7% tradeoff in accuracy relative to the control case where annually-updated detailed crop-type masks were available. These findings suggest that when detailed in-season data is not available, winter wheat yield can be accurately forecasted (within 10%) prior to harvest using a single, prior season crop mask and coarse resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data.

AB  - All human beings seek to avoid shame, guilt, and fear, responses that sociologists have paired, respectively, with honor, innocence, and power. Examination of cultures has shown that the shame/honor, guilt/innocence, and fear/power affective domain pairs are prioritized differently in different cultures. Western missiologists have seen the connection between guilt and innocence and the Gospel but have also shown interest in the other pairs, and some have linked pair prioritization with particular religious contexts. My research found that, rather than religion per se, the prioritizations emerge from deeply embedded worldview assumptions pertaining to relationship structures, which are culturally or socially determined.

TI  - Bio-optical trends of seas around Turkey: An assessment of the spatial and temporal variability
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Until present, bio-optical characteristics and their variations in the eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea have rarely been studied. In order to characterize the basic features of bio-optical variables found in the seas surrounding Turkey, remotely sensed data sets covering the period between September 1997 and March 2017 were studied for the purpose of this research. Chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL), absorption coefficient by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and particulate backscattering coefficient (BBP) were both evaluated to describe their recent linear and non-linear inter-annual patterns in the sub regions of the northern Levantine Sea (LS), the eastern Aegean Sea (AS), the Marmara Sea (MS) and the southern Black Sea (BS). The results determined a highly significant and decreasing trend of CHL in the Black Sea, whilst most other regions from the seas around Turkey displayed non-significant trends. The analysis indicated that the seas around Turkey can be clustered into two regions based on their bio-optical properties; one being the Black Sea and Marmara Sea, and the second cluster being the Aegean Sea and Levantine Sea.

TI  - Daily estimates of Landsat fractional snow cover driven by MODIS and dynamic time-warping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding seasonal snow cover dynamics is critical for management of hydrological regimes, habitat availability for wildlife species, forest fire risk assessment and recreational demands. Although data products provided at 500 m spatial resolution by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor provide important and readily available information on snow cover, capturing snow dynamics at finer spatial resolutions remains problematic due to the lack of high temporal and spatial resolution data, which limits the number of available observations each year. In this paper we present a new approach to create a daily time-series of 30-m snow observations (called SNOWARP), derived from daily MODIS Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) snow cover data to capture the temporal dynamics of snow cover and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to re-order historical Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM + ), and Operational Land Imager (OLI) observations to account for inter-annual variability. The SNOWARP product was produced for 2000-2018 for an area of Western Alberta (approximately 30,000 km(2)) and was calibrated against a network of time-lapse cameras and snow pillows. Results indicate the RMSE of the SNOWARP fractional product ranges from 31.3%-68.3%, while F score of the SNOWARP binary product ranges from 87.7% - 98.6% when compared to ground truth data. Capturing fractional snow cover at a fine spatial and temporal scale is important due to the spatial heterogeneity of snow cover, particularly in mountainous regions with implications for biodiversity assessment and monitoring. SNOWARP demonstrates a novel method to increasing the temporal resolution of Landsat-derived snow cover data, providing valuable insights on regional snow cover dynamics for use in a range of applications.

TI  - Estimating Soil Respiration in a Subalpine Landscape Using Point, Terrain, Climate, and Greenness Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape carbon (C) flux estimates help assess the ability of terrestrial ecosystems to buffer further increases in anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Advances in remote sensing have led to coarse-scale estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP; e.g., MODIS 17), yet efforts to develop spatial respiration products are lacking. Here we demonstrate a method to predict growing season soil respiration at a regional scale in a mixed subalpine ecosystem. We related field measurements (n=396) of growing season soil respiration mostly from subalpine forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains ecoregion to a suite of biophysical predictors using a Random Forest model (30-m pixel size). We found that Landsat Enhanced Vegetation Index, growing season aridity index, temperature, precipitation, elevation, and slope aspect explained spatiotemporal variability in soil respiration. Our model had a psuedo-r(2) of 0.45 and root-mean-square error of roughly one quarter of the mean value of respiration. Predicted growing season soil respiration across the region was remarkably consistent across 2004, 2005, and 2006 (150-day sums of 542.8, 544.3, and 536.5g C/m(2), respectively). Yet we observed substantial variability in spatial patterns of soil respiration predictions that varied among years, suggesting that our method is sensitive to changes in respiration drivers. Mean predicted growing season soil respiration was 73% of MODIS GPP, while predicted soil respiration was generally within 20% of nocturnal net ecosystem exchange from nearby eddy covariance towers. Thus, geospatial and remotely sensed data sets can be used to estimate soil respiration at landscape scales.Soil respiration returns carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere and is an important part of the carbon cycle, but estimates of soil respiration across large landscapes are difficult to come by. Soil respiration is sensitive to changes in climate and vegetation, which are available as mapped data products, thanks to remote sensing and geospatial technology. We developed a statistical model that mapped soil respiration across three forests and an entire region based on climate and vegetation spatial data. While this work was limited to subalpine forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains, our method can be used in other ecosystems to better understand how ecosystems interact with atmospheric carbon dioxide.

TI  - Operational Analysis of Signalized Street Segments Using Multi-gene Genetic Programming and Functional Network Techniques
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the operational analysis of urban signalized segments, the most fundamental entity of road networks, operating under heterogeneous traffic conditions. Geometric, traffic, and built-environmental data were collected from midblock sections and downstream intersections of 45 well-diversified segments. Besides, the socio-demographic details, travel characteristics, and perceived satisfaction scores (varying from 1 = excellent to 6 = worst) were collected from 9000 on-street automobile drivers. Subsequently, the variables having significant (p < 0.001) influences on the perceived satisfaction scores were identified by Spearman's correlation analysis. As observed, the array of significant variables included six quantitative road attributes and the age group of motorists. By incorporating these variables, highly reliable but less complex automobile level of service (ALOS) models were developed with the help of two novel artificial intelligence techniques namely, multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP) and functional network (FN). Both models exhibited excellent prediction efficiencies in the present context and produced high coefficient of determination (R-2) values of above 0.86 under the prevailing site conditions. The model comparison showed that the MGGP model is more reliable and easier for field implementations as compared to the FN model. The sensitivity analyses of modeled attributes revealed that traffic volume, travel speed, and automobile stop rate have by far the most significant influences on the ALOS of urban streets. The crucial outcomes of this study would largely help the transportation planners and engineers in quantifying the operational efficiencies of urban roadways and in taking efficient decisions for the better management of automobile traffic.

AB  - Since the publication of the last FIGO Cancer Report there have been giant strides in the global effort to reduce the burden of cervical cancer, with WHO announcing a call for elimination. In over 80 countries, including LMICs, HPV vaccination is now included in the national program. Screening has also seen major advances with implementation of HPV testing on a larger scale. However, these interventions will take a few years to show their impact. Meanwhile, over half a million new cases are added each year. Recent developments in imaging and increased use of minimally invasive surgery have changed the paradigm for management of these cases. The FIGO Gynecologic Oncology Committee has revised the staging system based on these advances. This chapter discusses the management of cervical cancer based on the stage of disease, including attention to palliation and quality of life issues.

TI  - HAND (height above nearest drainage) tool and satellite-based geospatial analysis of Hyderabad (India) urban floods, September 2016
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban flooding needs to be understood holistically and addressed geospatially by all stakeholders. In the present study, an attempt is made to understand the problem of urban flooding in part of Hyderabad city (Zone-12) geospatially considering the satellite-based changes in land use/land cover between 1989 and 2016, identifying low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding using HAND (height above nearest drainage) model in conjunction with the analysis of high-resolution satellite images and ground based validation of affected locations during rains of September 2016. The study shows that Zone-12 has undergone significant increase in impervious cover by 42% between 1989 and 2016. The impact of urbanization has obliterated the footprints of stream network, significantly changing the hydrological landscape due to burial of channels and concretization of lake beds. The interconnected channel network and lake system acting as sinks to absorb high runoff during monsoons have been encroached upon aggravating the urban flooding problem. The study shows that HAND model can be an effective tool under data scarce environments, limited cloud-free high-resolution satellite data availability during floods to have first cut baseline information on flood vulnerable areas.

TI  - A self-adaptive approach for producing clear-sky composites from VIIRS surface reflectance datasets
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the launch of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)/Soumi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite in October 2011, the need for the operational monitoring of terrestrial processes at the regional and global scales led to the expansion of terrestrial remote sensing products (e.g., the clear-sky composited surface reflectance products) generated from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into the JPSS/S-NPP mission using the new Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data. Seamless cloud composites are usually generated using a single criterion without an explicit consideration of phenological variations among different surface types. However, because the spectral signals of many surface types change dramatically due to seasonal variations, the single-criterion compositing methods are only effective for specific surface cover conditions. This study proposed a new self-adaptive compositing approach (SA-Comp) to produce global terrestrial clear-sky VIIRS surface reflectance composites. The proposed approach employs contextual spectral and temporal information to determine the surface cover conditions within a pre-defined temporal window, and adaptively selects the most suitable criterion. A comprehensive evaluation of the SA-Comp approach was conducted by comparing it with the maximum NDVI (MaxNDVI), minimum Red (MinRed) and maximum ratio (MaxRatio) compositing schemes, and with the MODIS and VIIRS composited surface reflectance products. The results, including visual representations and temporal profiles, revealed that the SA-Comp approach outperformed all of the other methods. The results also highlighted that the SA-Comp approach is more feasible and effective at compositing global VIIRS data and has great potential for regional, national and even global terrestrial monitoring.

TI  - Feasibility and oncological safety of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients with a local recurrence
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To investigate the role and feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients with a local recurrence and no clinically positive axillary lymph nodes.Materials and Methods: A total of 71 patients underwent SLNB for breast cancer recurrence. At first surgery, they had received SLNB (46.5%), axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (36.6%) or no axillary surgery (16.9%).Results: Lymphatic migration was successful in 53 out of 71 patients (74.6%) and was significantly higher in patients with previous SLNB or no axillary surgery than in those with previous ALND (87.9% vs. 53.8%; p = 0.009). Aberrant lymphatic migration pathways were observed in 7 patients (13.2%). The surgical SLNB was successfully performed in 51 patients (71.8%). In 46 patients (90.2%) the SLN was histologically negative, in 3 patients (5.9%) micrometastastatic and in 2 patients (3.9%) macrometastatic. The 2 patients with a macrometastates in SLN underwent ALND, In 4 out of the 18 patients with failure of tracer migration ALND, performed as surgeon's choice, did not find any metastatic node. After a median follow-up period of 39 months (range: 2-182 months), no axillary recurrence has been diagnosed.Conclusion: A SLNB in patients with locally recurrent breast cancer, no previous ALND and negative axillary lymph nodes is technically feasible and impacts on the ALND rate. In patients who at primary surgery received ALND, migration rate is significantly lower, aberrant migration is frequent and no clinically useful information has been obtained. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Improved Fukunaga-Koontz Transform with Compositional Kernel Combination for Hyperspectral Target Detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a novel supervised target detection approach on hyperspectral images based on Fukunaga-Koontz Transform (FKT) with compositional kernel combination. The Fukunaga-Koontz Transform is one of the most effective techniques for solving problems that involve two-pattern characteristics. To capture nonlinear properties of data, researchers have extended FKT to kernel FKT (KFKT) by means of kernel machines. However, the performance of KFKT depends on choosing convenient kernel functions and/or selection of the proper parameter(s). In this work, instead of selecting a single kernel for nonlinear version of FKT, we have applied a compositional kernel combination approach to capture the underlying local distributions of hyperspectral remote sensing data. Optimal parameter selection for each kernel function is achieved applying an evolutionary technique called differential evolution algorithm. The proposed new nonlinear target detection algorithm is tested for hyperspectral images. The experimental results verify that the proposed target detection algorithm has effective and promising performance compared to the conventional version for supervised target detection applications.

TI  - ASBRS Great Debate: Sentinel Node Biopsy in Patients Over 70 Years of Age
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Controversy over the need for sentinel node biopsy (SNB) continues to exist for the optimal treatment of breast cancer in patients >= 70 years of age, especially in those with lower-risk disease. Clinicians must balance competing risks to give the best individualized care.The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBrS) conducted a debate discussing the pros and cons of routinely performing SNB in this age group. Small, randomized studies have been conducted that show no overall survival benefit to axillary intervention (either axillary dissection or SNB) in patients with clinically T1N0 estrogen receptor (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, HER2/neu-negative tumors. There may be a small local recurrence benefit to axillary staging in patients who do not undergo radiation. Alternatively, axillary ultrasound, which carries a low false-negative rate for heavy disease burden, can be used to select patients who can avoid SNB.Surgeons must continue to individualize care of breast cancer patients over 70 years of age in whom competing comorbidities may dictate care. No randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have found a survival benefit to axillary staging in this low-risk population. However, in healthy patients, axillary staging may improve local control, provide prognostic information, and help guide decisions regarding adjuvant therapy such as chemotherapy and radiation. Ongoing RCTs are evaluating the benefit of SNB in patients with a negative axillary ultrasound. Until those results are available, clinicians and patients must balance the risk and benefits to determine if SNB adds significant value to their overall care.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Water Quality Parameters over Lake Balaton by Using Sentinel-3 OLCI
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) onboard Sentinel 3A satellite was launched in February 2016. Level 2 (L2) products have been available for the public since July 2017. OLCI provides the possibility to monitor aquatic environments on 300 m spatial resolution on 9 spectral bands, which allows to retrieve detailed information about the water quality of various type of waters. It has only been a short time since L2 data became accessible, therefore validation of these products from different aquatic environments are required. In this work we study the possibility to use S3 OLCI L2 products to monitor an optically highly complex shallow lake. We test S3 OLCI-derived Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) for complex waters against in situ measurements over Lake Balaton in 2017. In addition, we tested the machine learning Gaussian process regression model, trained locally as a potential candidate to retrieve water quality parameters. We applied the automatic model selection algorithm to select the combination and number of spectral bands for the given water quality parameter to train the Gaussian Process Regression model. Lake Balaton represents different types of aquatic environments (eutrophic, mesotrophic and oligotrophic), hence being able to establish a model to monitor water quality by using S3 OLCI products might allow the generalization of the methodology.

M3  - Review
AB  - Penile cancer (PC) is a relatively rare malignancy in the United States (US) but a greater concern in developing nations. Lymph node imaging remains critical to the staging and treatment of this disease as metastases develop in a predictable, anatomic fashion. Early surgical intervention remains a mainstay in treatment and imaging often aids in decision making. This review highlights the indications for imaging in both low-stage and advanced disease. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and limitations of currently available imaging for staging of inguinal and pelvic lymph nodes in PC and novel modalities in development.

TI  - Development of a Multispectral Albedometer and Deployment on an Unmanned Aircraft for Evaluating Satellite Retrieved Surface Reflectance over Nevada's Black Rock Desert
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bright surfaces across the western U.S. lead to uncertainties in satellite derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) where AOD is typically overestimated. With this in mind, a compact and portable instrument was developed to measure surface albedo on an unmanned aircraft system (UAS). This spectral albedometer uses two Hamamatsu micro-spectrometers (range: 340-780 nm) for measuring incident and reflected solar radiation at the surface. The instrument was deployed on 5 October 2017 in Nevada's Black Rock Desert (BRD) to investigate a region of known high surface reflectance for comparison with albedo products from satellites. It was found that satellite retrievals underestimate surface reflectance compared to the UAS mounted albedometer. To highlight the importance of surface reflectance on the AOD from satellite retrieval algorithms, a 1-D radiative transfer model was used. The simple model was used to determine the sensitivity of AOD with respect to the change in albedo and indicates a large sensitivity of AOD retrievals to surface reflectance for certain combinations of surface albedo and aerosol optical properties. This demonstrates the need to increase the number of surface albedo measurements and an intensive evaluation of albedo satellite retrievals to improve satellite-derived AOD. The portable instrument is suitable for other applications as well.

TI  - Exploiting Feature Extraction Techniques for Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE LATIN AMERICA TRANSACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral image classification derived from satellite sensors is a topic of graet interest for the scientific community. The great interest is to automatically identify different areas including coffee production. The coffee stands out for being an important source of income and jobs, as well as being one of the most important products of the economy of Brazil. However, automatically map this culture has been a challenge so much for object-oriented analysis how much to methods based on "pixel to pixel" techniques. This work exploits different feature extraction techniques aiming at identifying the most discriminative features for remote image classification. The satellite image used in this study refers to the Tres Pontas region, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which has a great agricultural production, especially coffee. It has been used the seven spectral image bands of Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager). It was considered 5 land use classes: Coffee, Wood, Water, Urban Area, Other Uses (Grassland, Soil, Weathered, Other Cultures, Eucalyptus). Various spectral and textural characteristics were extracted as features and combined for the classification. Higher-order statistics-based features were also extracted and combined with those commonly used in the literature for remote sensing image classification. Two feature selection methods for dimention redution was used: the Fisher's Discriminant Ratio (FDR) and the linear correlation. As classifier, a multilayer perceptron has been used. The best Kappa indices obtained was 73.13% for the model that considered all extracted features (a total of 43) as input.

TI  - Assessing the potential of integrating Landsat sensors for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in a reservoir
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat satellites, 5 and 7, have significant potential for estimating several water quality parameters, but to our knowledge, there are few investigations which integrate these earlier sensors with the newest and improved mission of Landsat 8 satellite. Thus, the comparability of water quality assessing across different Landsat sensors needs to be evaluated. The main objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of integrating Landsat sensors to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) in Rio Tercero reservoir (Argentina). A general model to retrieve Chl-a was developed (R-2 = 0.88). Using observed versus predicted Chl-a values the model was validated (R-2 = 0.89) and applied to Landsat imagery obtaining spatial representations of Chl-a in the reservoir. Results showed that Landsat 8 can be combined with Landsat 5 and 7 to construct an empirical model to estimate water quality characteristics, such as Chl-a in a reservoir. As the number of available and upcoming sensors with open access will increase with time, we expect that this trend will certainly further promote remote sensing applications and serve as a valuable basis for a wide range of water quality assessments.

TI  - Beam-Switch Wide-Swath Mode for Interferometrically Compatible Single-Pol and Quad-Pol SAR Products
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Future spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems are expected to deliver enormous quantity of data. Accordingly, the observation plan becomes crucial for a proper allocation of the mission resources. A central challenge is to reduce the number of acquisitions by making the same image available for more applications. Here, a relevant restriction is the interferometric incompatibility between fully polarimetric (QP) and single polarimetric (SP) SAR images, which typically occurs when the acquisitions are performed in burst mode, as in case of SAR products with wide coverage acquired by means of ScanSAR or terrain observation by progressive scanning (TOPS) technique. In order to overcome this limitation, a new operational mode, denoted as beam-switch wide-swath (BSWS), was conceived. The BSWS mode exploits the operational flexibility of future SAR systems to generate SP images, interferometrically compatible with the QP ones, keeping the wide coverage characteristic of the SP products. This letter presents in detail the BSWS mode, analyzing its functional principle, and imaging performance, based on a realistic future SAR system, the high-resolution wideswath (HRWS) SAR, considered for the next generation of the Sentinel-1 mission.

TI  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of fine aerosols (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) during an intensive biomass burning over Southeast Asia: Influence of SOA and aging
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study reports on total carbon (TC) and nitrogen (TN) and their isotope ratios in PM2.5 (particulate matter <= 2.5 pm in aerodynamic diameter) collected at Dai Ang hang (DAK; 19.93 degrees N, 99.05 degrees E; 1518 m above sea level), Thailand, during March 1 to April 13, 2015, when biomass-burning (BB) was intense in Southeast Asia (SEA), particularly in Myanmar. Concentrations of TC and TN varied from 1.4 to 80 mu gC m(-3) (mean: 33.8 +/- 21.7 mu gC m(-3)) and 0.7 to 8.6 mu gN m(-3) (3.0 +/- 1.6 mu gN m(-3)), respectively. Temporal variations of TC and TN largely increased from the start of the campaign to March 21 and decreased during March 22-28 and then slightly increased during the period of March 28-April 13. This temporal pattern was consistent with variations of levoglucosan (LG, specific tracer of biomass burning) and MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)-derived fire spots in SEA, suggesting that BB emissions are major sources of PM2.5 aerosols at DAK. This inference was further supported by higher TC/TN ratios (range: 6-19, mean: 12.7 +/- 3.3) and significantly strong positive correlations among TC, TN, and LG during the campaign period. On the other hand, stable isotope ratios of total carbon (delta C-13(TC)) and nitrogen (delta(15)NrN) in PM2.5 ranged during the sampling period from -23.8 to -29.8%o (- 26.0 +/- 1.2 parts per thousand) and from +15.8 to +25.1 parts per thousand (19.4 +/- 2.1 parts per thousand), respectively. The estimated contribution from the burning of C-3 plants to TC ranged between 60 and 96% (average, 74 +/- 7%) in SEA, indicating the predominance of BB from forest fires. Interestingly, lower delta C-13(TC) values were associated with higher contribution of C-3 plants, suggesting that primary aerosols derived from the burning of C-3 plants caused a depletion of C-13(TC), whereas photochemical aging of organic aerosols may have enhanced delta C-13(TC), particularly in the second half of the campaign. In addition, changes in meteorological conditions and MODIS fire events may also have caused the changes in delta C-13(TC) during the campaign period. The delta C-13(TC) values reported in this study represent the typical BB aerosols. Our findings improve the fundamental understanding of the sources and transformation processes of atmospheric aerosols in SEA and its outflow regions.

TI  - Thermal Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging for Mineralogy Mapping of a Mine Face
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing systems are largely used in geology for regional mapping of mineralogy and lithology mainly from airborne or spaceborne platforms. Earth observers such as Landsat, ASTER or SPOT are equipped with multispectral sensors, but suffer from relatively poor spectral resolution. By comparison, the existing airborne and spaceborne hyperspectral systems are capable of acquiring imagery from relatively narrow spectral bands, beneficial for detailed analysis of geological remote sensing data. However, for vertical exposures, those platforms are inadequate options since their poor spatial resolutions (metres to tens of metres) and NADIR viewing perspective are unsuitable for detailed field studies. Here, we have demonstrated that field-based approaches that incorporate thermal infrared hyperspectral technology with about a 40-nm bandwidth spectral resolution and tens of centimetres of spatial resolution allow for efficient mapping of the mineralogy and lithology of vertical cliff sections. We used the Telops lightweight and compact passive thermal infrared hyperspectral research instrument for field measurements in the Jura Cement carbonate quarry, Switzerland. The obtained hyperspectral data were analysed using temperature emissivity separation algorithms to isolate the different contributions of self-emission and reflection associated with different carbonate minerals. The mineralogical maps derived from measurements were found to be consistent with the expected carbonate results of the quarry mineralogy. Our proposed approach highlights the benefits of this type of field-based lightweight hyperspectral instruments for routine field applications such as in mining, engineering, forestry or archaeology.

TI  - Community Global Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) Package (CGOP): Assessment and Validation of the OSSE System Using an OSSE-OSE Intercomparison of Summary Assessment Metrics
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are used to simulate and assess the impacts of new observing systems planned for the future or the impacts of adopting new techniques for exploiting data or for forecasting. This study focuses on the impacts of satellite data on global numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. Since OSSEs are based on simulations of nature and observations, reliable results require that the OSSE system be validated. This validation involves cycles of assessment and calibration of the individual system components, as well as the complete system, with the end goal of reproducing the behavior of real-data observing system experiments (OSEs). This study investigates the accuracy of the calibration of an OSSE systemhere, the Community Global OSSE Package (CGOP) systembefore any explicit tuning has been performed by performing an intercomparison of the OSSE summary assessment metrics (SAMs) with those obtained from parallel real-data OSEs. The main conclusion reached in this study is that, based on the SAMs, the CGOP is able to reproduce aspects of the analysis and forecast performance of parallel OSEs despite the simplifications employed in the OSSEs. This conclusion holds even when the SAMs are stratified by various subsets (the tropics only, temperature only, etc.).

TI  - Ground Reflectance Retrieval on Horizontal and Inclined Terrains Using the Software Package REFLECT
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the software package REFLECT for the retrieval of ground reflectance from high and very-high resolution multispectral satellite images. The computation of atmospheric parameters is based on the 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) routines. Aerosol optical properties are calculated using the OPAC (Optical Properties of Aerosols and Clouds) model, while aerosol optical depth is estimated using the dark target method. A new approach is proposed for adjacency effect correction. Topographic effects were also taken into account, and a new model was developed for forest canopies. Validation has shown that ground reflectance estimation with REFLECT is performed with an accuracy of approximately +/- 0.01 in reflectance units (for the visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared spectral bands), even for surfaces with varying topography. The validation of the software was performed through many tests. These tests involve the correction of the effects that are associated with sensor calibration, irradiance, and viewing conditions, atmospheric conditions (aerosol optical depth AOD and water vapour), adjacency, and topographic conditions.

TI  - Sustainable intensification of dairy production can reduce forest disturbance in Kenyan montane forests
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demand for food and the shortage of arable land call for sustainable intensification of farming, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa where food insecurity is still a major concern. Kenya needs to intensify its dairy production to meet the increasing demand for milk. At the same time, the country has set national climate mitigation targets and has to implement land use practices that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from both agriculture and forests. This study analysed for the first time the drivers of forest disturbance and their relationship with dairy intensification across the largest montane forest of Kenya. To achieve this, a forest disturbance detection approach was applied by using Landsat time series and empirical data from forest disturbance surveys. Farm indicators and farm types derived from a household survey were used to test the effects of dairy intensification on forest disturbance for different farm neighbourhood sizes (r = 2-5 km). About 18% of the forest area was disturbed over the period 2010-2016. Livestock grazing and firewood extraction were the dominant drivers of forest disturbance at 75% of the forest disturbance spots sampled. Higher on-farm cattle stocking rates and firewood collection were associated with 1-10% increased risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. In contrast, higher milk yields, increased supplementation with concentrated feeds and more farm area allocated to fodder production were associated with 1-7 % reduced risk of forest disturbance across farm neighbourhood sizes. More intensified farms had a significantly lower impact on forest disturbance than small and resource-poor farms, and large and inefficient farms. Our results show that intensification of smallholder dairy farming leads to both farm efficiency gains and reduced forest disturbance. These results can inform agriculture and forest mitigation policies which target options to reduce GHG emission intensities and the risk of carbon leakage.

TI  - Radar Path Delay Effects in Volcanic Gas Plumes: The Case of Lascar Volcano, Northern Chile
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern volcano monitoring commonly involves Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements to identify ground motions caused by volcanic activity. However, InSAR is largely affected by changes in atmospheric refractivity, in particular by changes which can be attributed to the distribution of water (H2O) vapor in the atmospheric column. Gas emissions from continuously degassing volcanoes contain abundant water vapor and thus produce variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above and downwind of the volcano, which are notably well captured by short-wavelength X-band SAR systems. These variations may in turn cause differential phase errors in volcano deformation estimates due to excess radar path delay effects within the volcanic gas plume. Inversely, if these radar path delay effects are better understood, they may be even used for monitoring degassing activity, by means of the precipitable water vapor (PWV) content in the plume at the time of SAR acquisitions, which may provide essential information on gas plume dispersion and the state of volcanic and hydrothermal activity. In this work we investigate the radar path delays that were generated by water vapor contained in the volcanic gas plume of the persistently degassing Lascar volcano, which is located in the dry Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. We estimate water vapor contents based on sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission measurements from a scanning UV spectrometer (Mini-DOAS) station installed at Lascar volcano, which were scaled by H2O/SO2 molar mixing ratios obtained during a multi-component Gas Analyzer System (Multi-GAS) survey on the crater rim of the volcano. To calculate the water vapor content in the downwind portion of the plume, where an increase of water vapor is expected, we further applied a correction involving estimation of potential evaporation rates of water droplets governed by turbulent mixing of the condensed volcanic plume with the dry atmosphere. Based on these estimates we obtain daily average PWV contents inside the volcanic gas plume of 0.2-2.5 mm equivalent water column, which translates to a slant wet delay (SWD) in DInSAR data of 1.6-20 mm. We used these estimates in combination with our high resolution TerraSAR-X DInSAR observations at Lascar volcano, in order to demonstrate the occurrence of repeated atmospheric delay patterns that were generated by volcanic gas emissions. We show that gas plume related refractivity changes are significant and detectable in DInSAR measurements. Implications are two-fold: X-band satellite radar observations also contain information on the degassing state of a volcano, while deformation signals need to be interpreted with care, which has relevance for volcano observations at Lascar and for other sites worldwide.

CP  - 3rd International Symposium on Recent Observations and Simulations of the Sun-Earth System (ISROSES)
CL  - Golden Sands, BULGARIA
AB  - The first results of a coupled MHD/particle tracing method to evaluate particle fluxes in the inner magnetosphere are presented. This setup is capable of capturing the earthward particle acceleration process resulting from dipolarization events in the tail region of the magnetosphere. On the period of study, the MHD code was able to capture a dipolarization event and the particle tracing algorithm was able to capture the results of these disturbances and calculate proton fluxes in the night side geosynchronous orbit region. The simulation captured dispersionless injections as well as the energy dispersion signatures that are frequently observed by satellites at geosynchronous orbit. Currently, ring current models rely on Maxwellian-type distributions based on either empirical flux values or sparse satellite data for their boundary conditions close to geosynchronous orbit. Despite some differences in intensity and timing, the setup presented here is able to capture substorm injections, which represents an improvement regarding a reverse way of coupling these ring current models with MHD codes through the use of boundary conditions.

TI  - Using Window Regression to Gap-Fill Landsat ETM plus Post SLC-Off Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continued development of algorithms using multitemporal Landsat data creates opportunities to develop and adapt imputation algorithms to improve the quality of that data as part of preprocessing. One example is de-striping Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+, Landsat 7) images acquired after the Scan Line Corrector failure in 2003. In this study, we apply window regression, an algorithm that was originally designed to impute low-quality Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, to Landsat Analysis Ready Data from 2014-2016. We mask Operational Land Imager (OLI; Landsat 8) image stacks from five study areas with corresponding ETM+ missing data layers, using these modified OLI stacks as inputs. We explored the algorithm's parameter space, particularly window size in the spatial and temporal dimensions. Window regression yielded the best accuracy (and moderately long computation time) with a large spatial radius (a 7 x 7 pixel window) and a moderate temporal radius (here, five layers). In this case, root mean square error for deviations from the observed reflectance ranged from 3.7-7.6% over all study areas, depending on the band. Second-order response surface analysis suggested that a 15 x 15 pixel window, in conjunction with a 9-layer temporal window, may produce the best accuracy. Compared to the neighborhood similar pixel interpolator gap-filling algorithm, window regression yielded slightly better accuracy on average. Because it relies on no ancillary data, window regression may be used to conveniently preprocess stacks for other data-intensive algorithms.

TI  - Acute aerobic exercise induces a preferential mobilisation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the peripheral blood in man
T2  - PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) are important sentinel cells of the immune system responsible for presenting antigen to T cells. Exercise is known to cause an acute and transient increase in the frequency of DCs in the bloodstream in humans, yet there are contradictory findings in the literature regarding the phenotypic composition of DCs mobilised during exercise, which may have implications for immune regulation and health. Accordingly, we sought to investigate the composition of DC sub-populations mobilised in response to acute aerobic exercise. Nine healthy males (age, 21.9 +/- 3.6 years; height, 177.8 +/- 5.4 cm; body mass, 78.9 +/- 10.8 kg; body mass index, 24.9 +/- 3.3 kg.m(2); VO2 (MAX), 41.5 +/- 5.1 mL.kg.min(-1)) cycled for 20 min at 80% VO2 (MAX). Blood was sampled at baseline, during the final minute of exercise and 30 min later. Using flow cytometry, total DCs were defined as Lineage - (CD3, CD19, CD20, CD14, CD56) HLA-DR+ and subsequently identified as plasmacytoid DCs (CD303+) and myeloid DCs (CD303-). Myeloid DCs were analysed for expression of CD1c and CD141 to yield four sub-populations; CD1c-CD141+; CD1c+CD141+; CD1c+CD141- and CD1c-CD141-. Expression of CD205 was also analysed on all DC sub-populations to identify DCs capable of recognising apoptotic and necrotic cells. Total DCs increased by 150% during exercise (F-(1,F-10) = 60; p < 0.05, eta(2) = 0.9). Plasmacytoid DCs mobilised to a greater magnitude than myeloid DCs (195 +/- 131% vs. 131 +/- 100%; p < 0.05). Among myeloid DCs, CD1c-CD141- cells showed the largest exercise-induced mobilisation (167 +/- 122%), with a stepwise pattern observed among the remaining sub-populations: CD1c+CD141- (79 +/- 50%), followed by CD1c+CD141+ (44 +/- 41%), with the smallest response shown by CD1c-CD141+ cells (23 +/- 54%) (p < 0.05). Among myeloid DCs, CD205- cells were the most exercise responsive. All DC subsets returned to resting levels within 30 min of exercise cessation. These results show that there is a preferential mobilisation of plasmacytoid DCs during exercise. Given the functional repertoire of plasmacytoid DCs, which includes the production of interferon against viral and bacterial pathogens, these findings indicate that exercise may augment immune-surveillance by preferentially mobilising effector cells; these findings have general implications for the promotion of exercise for health, and specifically for the optimisation of DC harvest for cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - The impact of the type of nodal assessment on prognosis in patients with high-intermediate and high-risk ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO group endometrial cancer. A multicenter Italian study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The majority of endometrial cancers (EC) are discovered while the disease is confined to the uterine body. The presence of lymph nodes metastases impairs the prognosis. In this study, we evaluated the possible impact on survival of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping algorithm and selective lymphadenectomy (LD) in early stage EC, according to the ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO risk subgroup classification.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the database from two collaborative institutions including women with high-intermediate (HI) and high-risk (HR) ESMO/ESGO/ESTRO groups that underwent surgical staging with either SLN mapping, or selective LD.Results: Two-hundred and sixty-six women were overall identified, 121 in HI and 145 in HR group, respectively. LD was performed in 139 patients (52.5%), whereas SLN mapping algorithm in 61 patients (23%). Sixty-six patients in Rome center were not staged (24.8%). Aortic dissection was performed in 29 women (10.9%). The 3-year comparison did not show a significant difference between strategy adopted for nodal staging (SLN mapping, LD, and SLN LD) on both disease-free survival [HR: 0.82; 95% CI 0.53 1.28; p = 0.390], and overall survival [HR: 0.78; 95% CI 0.47-1.31; p = 0.355].Conclusions: In this study focused on women in the HI and HR groups we did not find difference in the 3 years DFS and OS when comparing the SLN strategy with selective lymphadenectomy, or the SLN algorithm. The SLN strategy did not seem to not compromise the prognosis of high risk patients. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd, BASO- The Association for Cancer Surgery, and the European Society of Surgical Oncology.

TI  - The Global Mangrove WatchA New 2010 Global Baseline of Mangrove Extent
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new global baseline of mangrove extent for 2010 and has been released as the first output of the Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) initiative. This is the first study to apply a globally consistent and automated method for mapping mangroves, identifying a global extent of 137,600 km2. The overall accuracy for mangrove extent was 94.0% with a 99% likelihood that the true value is between 93.6-94.5%, using 53,878 accuracy points across 20 sites distributed globally. Using the geographic regions of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Asia has the highest proportion of mangroves with 38.7% of the global total, while Latin America and the Caribbean have 20.3%, Africa has 20.0%, Oceania has 11.9%, North America has 8.4% and the European Overseas Territories have 0.7%. The methodology developed is primarily based on the classification of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data, where a habitat mask was first generated, within which the classification of mangrove was undertaken using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier. This new globally consistent baseline will also form the basis of a mangrove monitoring system using JAXA JERS-1 SAR, ALOS PALSAR and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar data to assess mangrove change from 1996 to the present. However, when using the product, users should note that a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha is recommended and that the error increases in regions of disturbance and where narrow strips or smaller fragmented areas of mangroves are present. Artefacts due to cloud cover and the Landsat-7 SLC-off error are also present in some areas, particularly regions of West Africa due to the lack of Landsat-5 data and persistence cloud cover. In the future, consideration will be given to the production of a new global baseline based on 10 m Sentinel-2 composites.

The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between serum PFASs and thyroid function in a remote population of Alaska Natives.Serum samples were collected from 85 individuals from St. Lawrence Island, Alaska. The concentrations of 13 PFASs, as well as free and total thyroxine (T-4), free and total triiodothyronine (T-3), and thyrotropin (TSH) were quantified in serum samples. The relationships between circulating concentrations of PFASs and thyroid hormones were assessed using multiple linear regression fit with generalized estimating equations.Several PFASs, including perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), were positively associated with TSH concentrations when modeled individually. PFOS and PFNA were significantly associated with free T-3 and PFNA was significantly associated with total T-3 in models with PFAS*sex interactive terms; these associations suggested negative associations in men and positive associations in women. PFASs were not significantly associated with concentrations of free or total T-4.Serum PFASs are associated with circulating thyroid hormone concentrations in a remote population of Alaska Natives. The effects of PFAS exposure on thyroid hormone homeostasis may differ between sexes.

TI  - Improved False-Negative Rates with Intraoperative Identification of Clipped Nodes in Patients Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and resection of a clipped node was shown to decrease the false-negative rate (FNR) of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for patients presenting with initially node-positive breast cancer.Between March 2014 and March 2016, a prospective trial analyzed 98 patients with axilla-positive locally advanced breast cancer (T1-4, N1-3) to assess the feasibility and efficacy of placing clips into most suspicious biopsy-proven node. The study considered blue, radioisotope active, and suspiciously palpable nodes as sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs).The SLN identification rate was 87.8%. The median age of the patients with an SLNB (n = 86) was 44 years (range 28-66 years). Of these patients, 77 (88.4%) had cT1-3 disease, and 10 (11.6%) had cT4 disease. The majority of the patients (n = 66, 76.7%) had cN1, whereas 21 patients (23.3%) had cN2 and cN3. A combined method was used for 37 patients (43%), whereas blue dye alone was used for the remaining patients (57%). The clipped node was the SLN in 70 patients (81.4%). For the patients with cN1 before NAC, the FNR was found to be 4.2% (1/24) when the clipped node was identified as an SLN. However, the FNR was estimated to be as high as 16.7% (1/6) for the patients with cN1 before NAC when the clipped node was found to be a non-SLN.The study results also suggest that axillary dissection could be omitted for patients presenting initially with N1 disease and with a negative clipped node as the SLN after NAC due to the low FNR.

TI  - Applying the eco-hydrological equilibrium hypothesis to model root distribution in water-limited forests
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a key driver of vegetation dynamics, but plant water-uptake patterns and consequent plant responses to drought are poorly understood at large spatial scales. The capacity of vegetation to use soil water depends on its root distribution (RD). However, RD is extremely variable in space and difficult to measure in the field, which hinders accurate predictions of water fluxes and vegetation dynamics. We propose a new method to estimate RD within water balance models, assuming that vegetation is at eco-hydrological equilibrium (EHE). EHE conditions imply that vegetation optimizes RD such that transpiration is maximized within the limits of bearable drought stress, characterized here by species-specific hydraulic thresholds. Optimized RD estimates were validated against RD estimates obtained by model calibration from sap flow or soil moisture from 38 forest plots in Catalonia (NE Spain). In water-limited plots, optimized RD was similar to calibrated RD, but estimates diverged with higher water availability, suggesting that the EHE may not be assumed when water is not limiting. Thereafter, we applied the optimization procedure at the regional scale, to estimate RD for the water-limited forests of Catalonia. Regional variations of optimum RD reproduced many expected patterns in response to climate, soil physical properties, forest structure, and species hydraulic traits. We conclude that RD optimization, based on the EHE hypothesis and a simple description of plant hydraulics, produces realistic estimates of RD that can be used for model parameterization and shows promise to improve our ability to forecast vegetation dynamics under increased drought.

TI  - Managing agricultural drought in Sweden using a novel spatially-explicit model from the perspective of water-food-energy nexus
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a multi-disciplinary approach, this paper integrated spatial analysis with agricultural and energy system modelling to assess the impacts of drought on crop water demand, water availability, crop yield, and electricity requirements for irrigation. This was done by a novel spatially-explicit and integrated water-food-energy nexus model, using the spatial climatic data generated by the mesoscale MESAN and STRANG models. In this study, the model was applied to quantify the effects of drought on the Swedish irrigation sector in 2013, a typical drought year, for a specific crop. The results show that drought can severely affect the crop yield if irrigation is not applied, with a peak yield reduction of 18 t/ha, about 50 % loss as compared to the potential yield in irrigated conditions. Accordingly, the water and energy requirements for irrigation to halt the negative drought effects and maintain high yields are significant, with the peaks up to 350 mm and 700 kWh per hectare. The developed model can be used to provide near real-time guidelines for a comprehensive drought management system. The model also has significant potentials for applications in precision agriculture, especially using high-resolution satellite data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating the age and population structure of encroaching shrubs in arid/semiarid grasslands using high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many arid and semiarid grasslands around the world are suffering from shrub encroachment to a great extent. However, the process of shrub encroachment is still poorly understood. Particularly, there has been limited historical datasets and inadequate field samples about the encroachment species. Shrub age can serve as an important indicator of the shrub encroachment history; and the population structure based on the shrub age distribution can reflect the population dynamics of an encroachment species. Using a high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing data, this paper estimates the age and population structure of a typical shrub, the Caragana genus (hereafter shrubs) in the temperate arid and semiarid grasslands of Inner Mongolia, China. The primary methods include: (1) building a shrub age estimation model considering different shrub crown growth rates affected by different precipitation regimes in the Inner Mongolian grassland; (2) identifying shrub individuals from multiple HSR remote sensing images and estimating the age of shrub individuals using the developed shrub age estimation model; (3) establishing a shrub age histogram, fitting the population structure, and calculating the survival rate and regeneration count using a negative exponential function. The results indicate that this shrub age estimation model performs better than a simple statistical regression using only the shrub crown area. Further, employing the negative exponential function for research on shrub encroachment provides supporting evidence of its effective role in capturing the population structure. Result also identifies that the survival rate increases with precipitation.

TI  - Analysis of Lighting Changes in the Tourist City Edogawa Using Nighttime Light Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When assessing remote sensing data, nighttime light data have shortcomings that can be attributed to sensor limitations and the influence of the natural environment. Signal leakage errors in nighttime light data were identified in this study. A regression model was created to reduce signal leakage error by selecting sampling points in coastal area. Lighting variations in Edogawa between 2008 and 2013 were compared based on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's nighttime light data. The lighting variation characteristics in Edogawa from 1992 to 2012 at 5-year intervals were also analyzed. The results show that the 2002 FIFA World Cup held in Japan led Edogawa's light digital number values to peak in 2002. The annual Edogawa lighting changes from 2007 to 2013 were also explored. The 2008 global financial crisis led to the lowest compounded night light index and average digital number in Edogawa during these 7 years.

TI  - Ecosystem Services in a Protected Mountain Range of Portugal: Satellite-Based Products for State and Trend Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountains are facing strong environmental pressures, which may jeopardize the supply of various ecosystem services. For sustainable land management, ecosystem services and their supporting functions should thus be evaluated and monitored. Satellite products have been receiving growing attention for monitoring ecosystem functioning, mainly due to their increasing temporal and spatial resolutions. Here, we aim to illustrate the high potential of satellite products, combined with ancillary in situ and statistical data, to monitor the current state and trend of ecosystem services in the Peneda-Geres National Park, a protected mountain range in Portugal located in a transition climatic zone (Atlantic to Mediterranean). We focused on three ecosystem services belonging to three broad categories: provisioning (reared animals), regulating (of water flows), and cultural (conservation of an endemic and iconic species). These services were evaluated using a set of different satellite products, namely grassland cover, soil moisture, and ecosystem functional attributes. In situ and statistical data were also used to compute final indicators of ecosystem services. We found a decline in the provision of reared animals since year 2000, although the area of grasslands had remained stable. The regulation of water flows had been maintained, and a strong relationship with interannual precipitation pattern was noted. In the same period, conservation of the focal iconic species might have been affected by interannual fluctuations of suitable habitat areas, with a possible influence of wildfires and precipitation. We conclude that satellite products can efficiently provide information about the current state and trend in the supply of various categories of ecosystem services, especially when combined with in situ or statistical data in robust modeling frameworks.

TI  - Habitat identity crisis caused by the riparian wetland squeeze in Tangon River Basin, Barind Region, India
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper intends to delineate flood plain wetland in Tangon river basin (1988-2016) from Landsat images and to investigate the nature and causes behind squeezing wetland and losses. From the analysis it is found that the total recognized average wetland area in pre monsoon season and post monsoon season are respectively 13.37 and 67.05km(2) in post dam period whereas in pre dam period it was 12.75 and 77.78km(2) respectively. Flow reduction due to damming over Tangon in 1989 is one of the major causes behind squeezing wetland area. Agriculture extension replacing shallow and seasonal wetland, disconnection of discharge contributing Karatoya river form Tangon river, gradual disconnection with ground water column are the crucial reasons for growing wetland habitat quality. Inconsistent water supply, frequent drying up of wetland fringe area withstand against health of the wetland habitat. Considering the causes of habitat crisis, immediately agricultural extension reclaiming wetland should be stopped, ecological flow should be allowed from dam. These steps could minimize the growing habitat crisis in the study region.

AB  - This article presents Carlos Lacerda's rhetorical strategies and main political ideas. The argument is based on the role of liberalism in the thinking and political practices of the author, who is seen before as a "liberal critic of politics", to use Carl Schmitt's celebrated concept, rather than as a carrier of a systematic political theory. Throughout the text, one tries to delineate how Lacerda interpreted actors and themes of the period between 1946 and 1964 through the analysis of its main themes and political developments. To this end, parliamentary discourses, journalistic articles and programmatic texts are examine with the aim of revealing the fundamental aspects of Lacerda's worldview as well as the historical context in which he lived. By grasping Lacerda's own thinking and historical role we will be able to better understand the political regime then in force, its place within Brazil's democratic odyssey, and some of the reasons for its end.

TI  - Remote sensing of ecosystem trajectories as a proxy indicator for watershed water balance
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem trajectories are inextricably linked to hydrology; however, water availability is not easily observed within the landscape. The response of vegetation to soil water availability may provide an indicator of local hydrology and the resilience or sensitivity of ecosystems to long-term changes in water balance. In this study, vegetation trajectories derived from Landsat Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index over a 22-year period are used as an indicator of spatio-temporal changes of watershed water balance and surface water storage within 6 proximal watersheds of the Boreal Plains ecozone of Alberta, Canada. The interactions between hydrology, topography, geology, and land cover type are examined as they relate to vegetation change.In this study, we find that run-off ratio (run-off/precipitation) is greater within watersheds with greater variability of relief, compared within subhumid, wetland-dominated watersheds (average = 0.35, 0.20, respectively), which experience lagged run-off response. A 2-year drought had a greater impact on vegetation trajectories within variable relief watersheds containing a high proportion of coarse-grain surficial geology, compared with peatland-dominated watersheds. The drought extended for an additional 1 to 2 years within 3 subhumid watersheds, reducing watershed run-off to less than 50 mm per water year (November to October) in 2 watersheds. However, proportional area of decline of Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index was significantly less within these watersheds. The results of this study indicate that wetlands play an important role for local water balance and ecosystem maintenance during periods of water stress and should be considered within land use planning and reclamation strategies of the Boreal Plains.

TI  - Stand age estimation of rubber (<i>Hevea brasiliensis</i>) plantations using an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model and annual Landsat time series
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations are a rapidly increasing source of land cover change in mainland Southeast Asia. Stand age of rubber plantations obtained at fine scales provides essential baseline data, informing the pace of industrial and smallholder agricultural activities in response to the changing global rubber markets, and local political and socioeconomic dynamics. In this study, we developed an integrated pixel- and object-based tree growth model using Landsat annual time series to estimate the age of rubber plantations in a 21,115 km(2) tri-border region along the junction of China, Myanmar and Laos. We produced a rubber stand age map at 30 m resolution, with an accuracy of 87.00% for identifying rubber plantations and an average error of 1.53 years in age estimation. The integration of pixel- and object-based image analysis showed superior performance in building NDVI yearly time series that reduced spectral noises from background soil and vegetation in open-canopy, young rubber stands. The model parameters remained relatively stable during model sensitivity analysis, resulting in accurate age estimation robust to outliers. Compared to the typically weak statistical relationship between single-date spectral signatures and rubber tree age, Landsat image time series analysis coupled with tree growth modeling presents a viable alternative for fine-scale age estimation of rubber plantations.

TI  - Estimation of LAI in Winter Wheat from Multi-Angular Hyperspectral VNIR Data: Effects of View Angles and Plant Architecture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - View angle effects present in crop canopy spectra are critical for the retrieval of the crop canopy leaf area index (LAI). In the past, the angular effects on spectral vegetation indices (VIs) for estimating LAI, especially in crops with different plant architectures, have not been carefully assessed. In this study, we assessed the effects of the view zenith angle (VZA) on relationships between the spectral VIs and LAI. We measured the multi-angular hyperspectral reflectance and LAI of two cultivars of winter wheat, erectophile (W411) and planophile (W9507), across different growing seasons. The reflectance of each angle was used to calculate a variety of VIs that have already been published in the literature as well as all possible band combinations of Normalized Difference Spectral Indices (NDSIs). The above indices, along with the raw reflectance of representative bands, were evaluated with measured LAI across the view zenith angle for each cultivar of winter wheat. Data analysis was also supported by the use of the PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) model to simulate a range of bidirectional reflectance. The study confirmed that the strength of linear relationships between different spectral VIs and LAI did express different angular responses depending on plant type. LAI-VI correlations were generally stronger in erectophile than in planophile wheat types, especially at the zenith angle where the background is expected to be more evident for erectophile type wheat. The band combinations and formulas of the indices also played a role in shaping the angular signatures of the LAI-VI correlations. Overall, off-nadir angles served better than nadir angle and narrow-band indices, especially NDSIs with combinations of a red-edge (700 similar to 720 nm) and a green band, were more useful for LAI estimation than broad-band indices for both types of winter wheat. But the optimal angles much differed between two plant types and among various VIs. High significance (R-2 > 0.9) could be obtained by selecting appropriate VIs and view angles on both the backward and forward scattering direction. These results from the in-situ measurements were also corroborated by the simulation analysis using the PROSAIL model. For the measured datasets, the highest coefficient was obtained by NDSI(536,720) at -35 degrees in the backward (R-2 = 0.971) and NDSI(571,707) at 55 degrees in the forward scattering direction (R-2 = 0.984) for the planophile and erectophile varieties, respectively. This work highlights the influence of view geometry and plant architecture. The identification of crop plant type is highly recommended before using remote sensing VIs for the large-scale mapping of vegetation biophysical variables.

TI  - Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry to Map and Quantify Permafrost Thaw Subsidence: A Case Study of Eboling Mountain on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Permafrost thaw subsidence, a key indicator of permafrost degradation, remains poorly quantified or understood. It is particularly challenging to detect and measure surface subsidence due to the loss of subsurface ice over a large area because it usually develops gradually, over several years or decades. Here we utilize the persistent scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (PSI) approach to remotely measure gradual surface subsidence on Eboling Mountain in the northeastern region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where thermal erosion gullies are well developed. Most of the previous multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar studies on permafrost used the small baseline subset method. By contrast, the PSI approach benefits from the full spatial resolution and is less affected by temporal or geometric decorrelation. In the PSI analysis, we incorporate a piecewise elevation change model that includes periodic subsidence/uplift because of its seasonally varying components as well as its linear subsidence trends. Applying this permafrost-designated PSI algorithm to 17-L band ALOS-1 PALSAR images taken between 2006 and 2011, we find that both the thermal erosion gullies and the surrounding regions (within about 300m) subside gradually. The subsidence trends range from 0.3 to 3cm/yr. This suggests that permafrost areas near the gullies are more vulnerable to gradual thawing and degradation. This study demonstrates the potential of using PSI to study permafrost thaw processes and of assessing its impacts over vast areas on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and in the Arctic.

TI  - Variations in the Ice Phenology and Water Level of Ayakekumu Lake, Tibetan Plateau, Derived from MODIS and Satellite Altimetry Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) are highly sensitive to variations in climate changes, and the lake ice phenology and water level are considered to be direct indicators of regional climate variability. In this study, we first used 14 years of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover products to analyse the freeze dates, ablation dates, and ice coverage durations. The lake level changes during 2002-2015 were estimated, derived from satellite altimetry and Hydroweb data. Unexpectedly, the freeze dates of lake ice greatly advanced, and the ablation dates were markedly delayed. The complete freezing duration lengthened by approximately 77 days. As a result of the warm-wet climate in the northern TP, the lake area expanded from 770 to 995 km(2) during 2002-2015, and the water levels rose by 4.2 m in total, at a rate of 0.3 m/year. The progressive expansion of Ayakekumu Lake profoundly affected the ice phenology. Larger water volume with larger thermal capacity likely led to the delaying of ablation dates, with the freezing point depression caused by decreasing salinity. Some new narrow and shallow bays located in southern and eastern Ayakekumu Lake were conducive to early freezing of ice. Additionally, the changes in air temperature, precipitation, potential evaporation, and sunshine duration may be related to the prolonged ice cover duration since 2002. In sum, accurate measurements of lake ice and water levels are critical for understanding the water resource balance and hydrologic cycle in arid or semi-arid regions of China.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Above-Ground Biomass by Geographically Weighted Regression and Machine Learning with Sentinel Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for sustaining forest management and mitigating climate change to support REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus the sustainable management of forests, and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) processes. Recently launched Sentinel imagery offers a new opportunity for forest AGB mapping and monitoring. In this study, texture characteristics and backscatter coefficients of Sentinel-1, in addition to multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and biophysical variables of Sentinal-2, based on 56 measured AGB samples in the center of the Changbai Mountains, China, were used to develop biomass prediction models through geographically weighted regression (GWR) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, such as the artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine for regression (SVR), and random forest (RF). The results showed that texture characteristics and vegetation biophysical variables were the most important predictors. SVR was the best method for predicting and mapping the patterns of AGB in the study site with limited samples, whose mean error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, and correlation coefficient were 4 x 10(-3), 0.07, 0.08 Mgha(-1), and 1, respectively. Predicted values of AGB from four models ranged from 11.80 to 324.12 Mgha(-1), and those for broadleaved deciduous forests were the most accurate, while those for AGB above 160 Mgha(-1) were the least accurate. The study demonstrated encouraging results in forest AGB mapping of the normal vegetated area using the freely accessible and high-resolution Sentinel imagery, based on ML techniques.

TI  - Shrub biomass estimation in semi-arid sandland ecosystem based on remote sensing technology
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Global land degradation and sustainable development has become a serious challenge for the terrestrial ecosystems. Shrub plays a crucial role in global ecosystem protection, ecological reconstruction, which is especially important in arid and semi-arid sandland ecosystem. Shrub above ground biomass (AGB) is a proxy of carbon sequestration capacity. Shrub AGB in Mu Us Sandland was estimated using different methods based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, topography data, combined with in situ survey data. Linear regression model, multiple stepwise regression model, machine learning model and geometric optical model were used to estimate shrub biomass in combination with in situ data, respectively and their effects were validated and compared. Results showed that shrub AGB predicted from one multiple stepwise regression model with Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI) and Brightness from K-T transformation as input variables reached highest accuracy. For both high and low shrub coverage regions, shrub AGB distribution maps derived from this multiple stepwise regression model achieved higher precision. All these findings will provide a scientific support for ecological sustainable development in eco-vulnerable ecosystems. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Delineation of Built-Up Areas from Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery Using Multi-Scale Textures and Spatial Dependence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite images possess several advantages in terms of describing the details of ground targets. Extracting built-up areas from VHR images has received increasing attention in practical applications, such as land use planning, urbanization monitoring, geographic information database update. In this study, a novel method is proposed for built-up area detection and delineation on VHR satellite images, using multi-resolution space-frequency analysis, spatial dependence modelling and cross-scale feature fusion. First, the image is decomposed by multi-resolution wavelet transformation, and then the high-frequency information at different levels is employed to represent the multi-scale texture and structural characteristics of built-up areas. Subsequently, the local Getis-Ord statistic is introduced to model the spatial patterns of built-up area textures and structures by measuring the spatial dependence among frequency responses at different spatial positions. Finally, the saliency map of built-up areas is produced using a cross-scale feature fusion algorithm, followed by adaptive threshold segmentation to obtain the detection results. The experiments on ZY-3 and Quickbird datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method through comparisons with existing algorithms.

TI  - The occurrence, diversity and blood feeding patterns of potential vectors of dengue and yellow fever in Kacheliba, West Pokot County, Kenya
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Yellow fever (YF) and dengue (DEN) viruses are important re-emerging mosquito-borne viruses sharing similar vectors and reservoirs. The last documented YF outbreak in Kenya occurred in 1992-95. However, YF virus is re-emerging in bordering countries including Uganda, Ethiopia and South Sudan with the potential for spread to the neighboring regions in Kenya. Dengue is endemic in Kenya with outbreaks being detected in various towns in the north and the coast. This study reports on the Aedes (Stegomyia) mosquito species occurrence, diversity, and blood feeding patterns, as means of measuring the risk of transmission of YF and DEN in Kacheliba sub-county, West Pokot County, which borders previous YF outbreak areas in eastern Uganda.Methodology: Adult mosquitoes were collected using CO2-baited BG Sentinel traps at three time points during the rainy season. Mosquitoes were identified to the species level. Species abundance during the three sampling periods were compared, with emphasis on Aedes aegypti and other Stegomyia species, using generalized linear models that included mosquito diversity. Individually blood-fed mosquitoes were analyzed by DNA amplification of the 12S rRNA gene followed by sequencing to determine the source of blood meal.Results: Overall, 8605 mosquitoes comprising 22 species in 5 genera were collected. Sampled Stegomyia species included Ae. aegypti (77.3%), Ae. vittatus (11.4%), Ae. metallicus (10.2%) and Ae. unilineatus (1.1%). Ae. aegypti dominated the blood-fed specimens (77%, n = 68) and were found to have fed mostly on rock hyraxes (79%), followed by goats (9%), humans and cattle (each 4%), with a minor proportion on hippopotamus and rock monitor lizards (each comprising 1%).Conclusion: Our findings reveal the presence of important Stegomyia species, which are known potential vectors of YF and DEN viruses. In addition, evidence of more host feeding on wild and domestic animals (hyrax and goat) than humans was observed. How the low feeding on humans translates to risk of transmission of these viruses, remains unclear, but calls for further research including vector competence studies of the mosquito populations for these viruses. This forms part of a comprehensive risk assessment package to guide decisions on implementation of affordable and sustainable vaccination (YF) and vector control plans in West Pokot County, Kenya.

TI  - Simulating arbitrary hyperspectral bandsets from multispectral observations via a generic Earth Observation-Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents results of using multi-sensor and multi-angular constraints in the generic Earth Observation-Land Data Assimilation System (EO-LDAS) for reproducing arbitrary bandsets of hyperspectral reflectance at the top-of-canopy (TOC) level by merging observations from multispectral sensors with different spectral characteristics. This is demonstrated by combining Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data to simulate the Compact High Resolution Imaging Spectrometer CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral signal over an agricultural test site, in Barrax, Spain. However, the method can be more generally applied to any combination of spectral data, providing a tool for merging EO data to any arbitrary hyperspectral bandset.Comparisons are presented using both synthetic and observed MISR and Landsat data, and retrieving surface biophysical properties. We find that when using simulated MISR and Landsat data, the CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral signal is reproduced with RMSE 0.0001-0.04. LAI is retrieved with r(2) from 0.97 to 0.99 and RMSE of from 0.21 to 0.38. The results based on observed MISR and Landsat data have lower performances, with RMSE for the reproduced CHRIS/PROBA hyperspectral signal varying from 0.007 to 0.2. LAI is retrieved with r(2) from 0.7 to 0.9 and RMSE from 0.7 to 1.4. We found that for the data considered here the main spectral variations in the visible and near infrared regions can be described by a limited number of parameters (3-4) that can be estimated from multispectral information. Results show that the method can be used to simulate arbitrary bandsets, which will be of importance to any application which requires combining new and existing streams of new EO data in the optical domain, particularly intercalibration of EO satellites in order to get continuous time series of surface reflectance, across programmes and sensors of different designs.

TI  - Transformation of degraded farmlands to agroforestry in Zongi Village, Ethiopia
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction of human land use, steep slopes and erosion has been a serious threat to Ethiopia's ecosystems. Community's initiated land rehabilitation programmes such as tree regeneration on farm lands, hill-side planting and exclosures have been established to rejuvenate debilitated lands. To characterize, map out and monitor such transformations, this study was carried out in Zongi, Tigray Region of northern Ethiopia. The study used an integration of remote sensing data, field observations and information from key informants and randomly selected respondents to analyse the land-use/land cover (LULC) changes from 1984 to 2013. Conventional method of supervised image classification was used for landsat image of 2013 while hybrid method of unsupervised and supervised classification was employed for landsat images of 1984 and 1999. The results revealed significant modifications and conversion of LULC types over the multi-dates. Analysis of the 29-year change matrix revealed that 78.5% of the land underwent significant changes in LULC. The major changes to agroforestry land use(LU)types between 1984 and 2013 were conversion of intensively cultivated land to moderately cultivated land (32.1%) and sparsely cultivated land (11.8%). The drivers of changes were linked to the introduction of land rehabilitation initiatives, government consensus (via agricultural extension) with the community, which were complemented by growing awareness of landowners. This study corroborates the necessity of community involvement and participation to improve their land use systems for environmental sustainability and sustainable livelihood.

TI  - A Simulation Study Using Terrestrial LiDAR Point Cloud Data to Quantify Spectral Variability of a Broad-Leaved Forest Canopy
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this analysis, a method for construction of forest canopy three-dimensional (3D) models from terrestrial LiDAR was used for assessing the influence of structural changes on reflectance for an even-aged forest in Belgium. The necessary data were extracted by the developed method, as well as it was registered the adjacent point-clouds, and the canopy elements were classified. Based on a voxelized approach, leaf area index (LAI) and the vertical distribution of leaf area density (LAD) of the forest canopy were derived. Canopy-radiation interactions were simulated in a ray tracing environment, giving suitable illumination properties and optical attributes of the different canopy elements. Canopy structure was modified in terms of LAI and LAD for hyperspectral measurements. It was found that the effect of a 10% increase in LAI on NIR reflectance can be equal to change caused by translating 50% of leaf area from top to lower layers. As presented, changes in structure did affect vegetation indices associated with LAI and chlorophyll content. Overall, the work demonstrated the ability of terrestrial LiDAR for detailed canopy assessments and revealed the high complexity of the relationship between vertical LAD and reflectance.

TI  - Comprehensive accuracy assessment of MODIS daily snow cover products and gap filling methods
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of the standard Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily snow cover products (Collection 5) and several of the most common and computationally frugal gap-filling methods were validated using 12 years of daily observations from over 800 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations. While several factors affect snow cover accuracy to some extent, the largest controls are associated with land cover type; accuracy fell from the maximum in croplands (94.9%) to the minimum for observations with a land cover type of water (79.5%). The second largest impact on accuracy is attributed to the changes in solar zenith angle, where accuracy decreased from a maximum of similar to 96% at 42 degrees to a minimum of similar to 84% at 58 degrees. Based on the results of this work, the highest accuracy binary daily snow cover dataset can be achieved by reclassifying the fractional snow band using a no-snow/snow threshold of 10 from the MODIS Terra sensor. Gap-filling is best accomplished by a temporal filter on the same dataset, and the window length depends on the desired completeness of the final dataset and the amount of missing values in the area of interest. Decreases in accuracy caused by this gap -filling method taper off after 7 days. Therefore, if a larger temporal window is needed to adequately fill in a time series it is best to extend the window to the largest gap present.

TI  - The utility of Random Forests for wildfire severity mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable fire severity mapping is a vital resource for fire scientists and land management agencies globally. Satellite derived pre- and post-fire differenced severity indices (Delta FSI), such as the differenced Normalised Burn Ratio (Delta NBR), are widely used to map the severity of large wildfires. Fire severity classification is commonly undertaken through the identification of severity class thresholds in Delta FSI. However, several shortcomings have been identified with severity classifications using Delta FSI, including poor delineation of low fire severity classes, and unsatisfactory performance when Delta FSI classification thresholds are applied to new landscapes. Our study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. We collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using Delta NBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE). Results of the bootstrapping validation show that the RF classifier had very high classification accuracy ( > 95%) for unburnt (UB), crown scorch (CS) and crown consumption (CC) severity classes, and high classification accuracy ( > 74%) for low severity classes (crown unburnt, CU; partial crown scorch, PCS). The RF classification outperformed the Delta NBR classification for all severity classes, increasing classification accuracy by between 6%-21%. Cross validation using independent fires produced similar median classification accuracy as the bootstrapping validation, though the RF classification of CU was substantially reduced to similar to 55%. Delta NBR, Delta NDWI and Delta NDVI were the three most important variables in the RF model. The Landsat satellite platform used to derive the indices had little effect on classification accuracy. Maps produced using the RF classifier in GEE had similar spatial patterns in fire severity classes as maps produced using time-consuming hand digitisation of aerial images. GEE was found to be a highly efficient platform for image acquisition, processing and production of severity maps. Our study shows that fire severity mapping using RF classifiers provides a robust method for broad scale mapping of fire severity across heterogeneous landscapes. Furthermore, the GEE-based classification framework supports the operational application of this approach in a land management agency context for the rapid production of fire severity maps.

TI  - Mitigation of Tropospheric Delay in SAR and InSAR Using NWP Data: Its Validation and Application Examples
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The neutral atmospheric delay has a great impact on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) absolute ranging and on differential interferometry. In this paper, we demonstrate its effective mitigation by means of the direction integration method using two products from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast: ERA-Interim and operational data. Firstly, we shortly review the modeling of the neutral atmospheric delay for the direct integration method, focusing on the different refractivity models and constant coefficients available. Secondly, a thorough validation of the method is performed using two approaches. In the first approach, numerical weather prediction (NWP) derived zenith path delay (ZPD) is validated against ZPD from permanent GNSS (global navigation satellite system) stations on a global scale, demonstrating a mean accuracy of 14.5 mm for ERA-Interim. Local analysis shows a 1 mm improvement using operational data. In the second approach, NWP derived slant path delay (SPD) is validated against SAR SPD measured on corner reflectors in more than 300 TerraSAR-X High Resolution SpotLight acquisitions, demonstrating an accuracy in the centimeter range for both ERA-Interim and operational data. Finally, the application of this accurate delay estimate for the mitigation of the impact of the neutral atmosphere on SAR absolute ranging and on differential interferometry, both for individual interferograms and multi-temporal processing, is demonstrated.

AB  - We investigate the correlation between stress-related compounds produced by corals of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) and local atmospheric propertiesan issue that goes to the core of the coral ecosystem's ability to survive climate change. We relate the variability in a satellite decadal time series of fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD) to a coral stress metric, formulated as a function of irradiance, water clarity, and tide, at Heron Island in the southern GBR. We found that AOD was correlated with the coral stress metric, and the correlation increased at low wind speeds, when horizontal advection of air masses was low and the production of non-biogenic aerosols was minimal. We posit that coral reefs may be able to protect themselves from irradiance stress during calm weather by affecting the optical properties of the atmosphere and local incident solar radiation.

TI  - Assessing and refining the satellite-derived massive green macro-algal coverage in the Yellow Sea with high resolution images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - During over the past 10 years, the massive green macro-algal bloom has regularly occurred in the Yellow Sea, the spatial coverage of which is mainly derived by the remote sensing community from satellite images with moderate/low resolution (30-m-1000-m), such as the 250-m-resolution MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). In this paper, the MODIS estimates are compared for the first time with the concurrent high resolution (3-m) airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. We find that the MODIS results are overestimated by more than a factor of 3 when each algae pixel is assumed to be pure (i.e. 100% algae cover), whereas the overestimation is significantly reduced to 1.14 when the pure pixel assumption is abandoned and the genuine (fractional) algae coverage is derived with the linear pixel un-mixing method. These results, together with the re-sampling processing of the high resolution images, indicate that the mixed pixel effect, that is inherent with images with moderate and low resolutions, is the key factor for the satellite extraction of the macro algae coverage, and these findings are further confirmed by the satellite data with different resolutions. Besides, significant correlations (R-2 > 0.9) are found between the macro-algae coverage from 3-m resolution SAR images and those from concurrent satellite images with various resolutions (30-m-1000-m) under the pure pixel assumption, which provides an alternative statistics-based method (in addition to the linear pixel un-mixing) for the accurate macro-algae coverage extraction from satellite images with coarse resolution (e.g. HJ-1 CCD, AQUA MODIS, COMS GOCI). This new method is independently validated with high resolution optical images, and applied to derive the annual maxima of the massive green macro-algal bloom areas (fractional coverage) in the Yellow Sea from 2007 to 2016, which ranges from 45.6 to 732.9-km(2) with an average of 247.9 +/- 199.3-km(2).

TI  - Impact of Wavelength Shift in Relative Spectral Response at High Angles of Incidence in Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Future Landsat Design Concepts
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat program plays an important role in providing continuous long-term multispectral moderate resolution observations of the earth's surface. There is an interest by the community to improve the temporal sampling in future generations of the sensors. One way to achieve higher sampling is to collect imagery with a wider swath. For future instruments using multilayer dielectric filters for band selection, this has the further implication that light may enter the filters on the detectors at a higher angle of incidence, which will shift the center wavelength of the spectral bandpasses. Through simulation of a forest environment this paper explored the impact of this effect on measured spectral radiance and the normalized vegetation difference index. The effect is quantified both for angles of incidence seen in the current Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager as well as for pushbroom designs with up to 13 degrees off-axis imaging. Results indicate the effect will be significant compared to instrument noise and comparable to the limit of current requirements on filter manufacturing tolerances.

TI  - A Hydroclimatological Analysis of Precipitation in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding seasonal precipitation input into river basins is important for linking large-scale climate drivers with societal water resources and the occurrence of hydrologic hazards such as floods and riverbank erosion. Using satellite data at 0.25-degree resolution, spatial patterns of monsoon (June-July-August-September) precipitation variability between 1983 and 2015 within the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) river basin are analyzed with Principal Component (PC) analysis and the first three modes (PC1, PC2 and PC3) are related to global atmospheric-oceanic fields. PC1 explains 88.7% of the variance in monsoonal precipitation and resembles climatology with the center of action over Bangladesh. The eigenvector coefficients show a downward trend consistent with studies reporting a recent decline in monsoon rainfall, but little interannual variability. PC2 explains 2.9% of the variance and shows rainfall maxima to the far western and eastern portions of the basin. PC2 has an apparent decadal cycle and surface and upper-air atmospheric height fields suggest the pattern could be forced by tropical South Atlantic heating and a Rossby wave train stemming from the North Atlantic, consistent with previous studies. Finally, PC3 explains 1.5% of the variance and has high spatial variability. The distribution of precipitation is somewhat zonal, with highest values at the southern border and at the Himalayan ridge. There is strong interannual variability associated with PC3, related to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Next, we perform a hydroclimatological downscaling, as precipitation attributed to the three PCs was averaged over the Pfafstetter level-04 sub-basins obtained from theWorldWildlife Fund (Gland, Switzerland). While PC1 was the principal contributor of rainfall for all sub-basins, PC2 contributed the most to rainfall in the western Ganges sub-basin (4524) and PC3 contributed the most to the rainfall in the northern Brahmaputra (4529). Monsoon rainfall within these two sub-basins were the only ones to show a significant relationship (negative) with ENSO, whereas four of the eight sub-basins had a significant relationship (positive) with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical South Atlantic. This work demonstrates a geographic dependence on climate teleconnections in the GBM that deserves further study.

TI  - Linking surface hydrodynamics to planktonic ecosystem: the case study of the ichthyoplanktonic assemblages in the Central Mediterranean Sea
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanographic processes play a key role in influencing the structure of the marine planktonic ecosystems. Taking advantage of the quasi-simultaneous collection of a large ichthyoplanktonic dataset in different regions of the Central Mediterranean Sea (Italian/Maltese, Tunisian and Libyan waters), this study aimed at the identification of the main environmental drivers that control the structure of the larval fish assemblages. Spatial distribution and taxa composition were related to physical forcings (geostrophic currents and wind stress) and environmental conditions (bottom depth, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-a concentration). ANOSIM and SIMPER identified contribution of fish taxa to the average Bray-Curtis dissimilarity among regions. In Italian and Libyan waters, two assemblages (neritic and oceanic) were identified, while a mixed assemblage characterized only some stations. Two neritic and one oceanic assemblages were discriminated in Tunisian waters. Random Forest classification model highlighted the essential role of the bathymetry, while Lagrangian simulations evidenced the action of the hydrodynamics in mixing neritic and oceanic assemblages in the Italian/Maltese and partially in Libyan waters. These findings highlighted the importance of the multidisciplinary approach and shed light on the potential value of the ichthyoplanktonic surveys for the assessment of the state of the marine ecosystem and the conservation of the fishery resources.

TI  - Alluvial fan surface ages recorded by Landsat-8 imagery in Owens Valley, California
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alluvial fans are important depositional landforms that offer valuable records of terrestrial sedimentation history if their surfaces can be mapped and dated accurately. Unfortunately, as this often depends on detailed field mapping and intensive absolute dating techniques, it can be a challenging, expensive and time-consuming exercise. In this study, we demonstrate that quantitative information about the ages of alluvial fan surfaces in Owens Valley, California, is recorded by Landsat-8 multispectral satellite imagery. We show that systematic changes in the wavelength-dependent brightness of fan surfaces occur gradually over a timescale of similar to 100 kyr in this semi-arid setting, and are highly correlated with known deposit ages. Using spectro-radiometry and X-ray diffraction analysis of sediment samples collected in the field, we interpret that surface reflectance evolves primarily in response to the in-situ production of secondary illite and iron oxide by weathering in this landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate that first-order predictions of absolute fan surface age can be derived from multispectral imagery when an initial age calibration is available. These findings suggest that multispectral imagery, such as Landsat data, can be used (i) for preliminary mapping of alluvial fans prior to detailed field work and before choosing sampling sites for conventional dating techniques, and (ii) to extend age models to undated neighbouring surfaces with equivalent physical properties, once an age-brightness calibration has been established.

TI  - Impacts of meteorological nudging on the global dust cycle simulated by NICAM coupled with an aerosol model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we present simulations of the global dust cycle for present day conditions using a new dust-atmosphere model based on the Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) coupled with the Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS), We focus on evaluations of the dust simulation with respect to emissions, depositions, surface concentrations, aerosol optical depths (AODs), and the dust-aerosol direct radiative effects (DREs). The sensitivities of the dust simulation to the meteorological fields are also investigated through with and without meteorological nudging. NICAM without meteorology nudging tends to systemically overestimate the 10 m wind speeds by approximately 30%-40%, whereas the daily magnitudes and variations in the 10 m wind speeds are both significantly improved with meteorological nudging, especially over the Sahara Desert. The estimated annual global mean dust emission flux, dust AOD, and dustaerosol shortwave DRE at the top of the atmosphere with meteorological nudging are 1463 Tg yr(-1), 0.033, and -1.3 Wm(-)(2), respectively. Due to the approximately 30%-40% overestimations of the 10 m wind speeds over the two major desert regions, the estimated annual global mean dust emission flux, AOD, and DRE without meteorological nudging are significantly greater than those with meteorological nudging. The overestimations of 10 m wind speeds and the associated dust emissions are mainly caused by the positive biases of wind speeds especially from surface to approximately 2 km and slightly affected by the temperature fields. The monthly variations in the dust depositions over the Atlantic and the surface dust concentrations over the Pacific are all better simulated with meteorological nudging. Compared to both the AERONET (Aerosol Robotics Network)and MODIS (Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)- retrieved AODs, the simulated daily AOD variations are significantly improved with meteorological nudging, especially over the dust-aerosol dominated regions. The global and annual mean dust lifetime and size distribution, which are two critical factors for estimating dust radiative effects, are quite similar between the dynamic and nudged NICAMs. We therefore can use the dynamic model to understand climate-dust interactions in a global and annual scale. Furthermore, we can improve the model performances for some applications in regional and seasonal scales by meteorological nudging which probably cannot be achieved by just tuning the dust emission.

TI  - DInSAR for a Regional Inventory of Active Rock Glaciers in the Dry Andes Mountains of Argentina and Chile with Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Dry Andes region of Argentina and Chile is characterized by a highly developed periglacial environment. In these arid or semi-arid regions, rock glaciers represent one of the main pieces of evidence of mountain creeping permafrost and water reserves in a solid state. However, their distribution, degree of activity, and response to global warming are not yet well understood. In this context, this work aims to show the potential of the Sentinel-1-based interferometric technique (DInSAR) to map active rock glaciers at a regional level. In particular, the paper presents an active rock glacier inventory for the study area, which covers approximately 40,000 km(2), ranging from latitude 30 degrees 21S to 33 degrees 21S. A total of 2116 active rock glaciers have been detected, and their elevations show a high correlation with the west-east direction. This result was obtained by using only 16 interferometric pairs. Compared to other remote sensing classification techniques, the interferometric technique offers a means to measure surface displacement (active rock glacier). This results in a reliable classification of the degree of activity compared to other methods, based on geomorphological, geomorphometric, and/or ecological criteria. This work presents evidence of this aspect by comparing the obtained results with existing optical data-based inventories. We conclude that the combination of both types of sensors (radar and optical) is an appropriate procedure for active rock glacier inventories, as both mapping methodologies are complementary.

TI  - Development of a Model to Predict Invasiveness in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ Diagnosed by Percutaneous Biopsy-Original Study and Critical Evaluation of the Literature
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to develop a model to predict invasiveness in patients with a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ found at percutaneous biopsy. The calculated sample size was 296 patients. We used Nagelkerke's R-2 and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests to improve statistical analysis. We evaluated 354 patients and developed 2 models that have the best discrimination reported to date.Background: Approximately 30% of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases have an invasive component discovered on the final analysis that could affect surgical management. The aims of the present study were to determine the risk factors associated with the underestimation of DCIS and to develop a model to predict the probability of invasiveness. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on the data for all patients with a diagnosis of DCIS found by percutaneous biopsy from January 2008 to February 2016. Thirteen potential predictors of invasiveness were examined. The statistical analysis of the present study was improved using Nagelkerke's R-2, the area under the receiving operating characteristic (AUC) curve, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Results: Of 354 biopsy specimens deemed to be DCIS on initial biopsy, 100 (28.2%) were recategorized as invasive carcinoma after surgery. On multivariate analysis, the strongest predictors of invasiveness were comedonecrosis, size on mammography, suspected microinvasion, histologic grade, and younger patient age. The model had a good discriminative ability, with an AUC of 0.764. The overall performance of the model was fair, with a Nagelkerke's R-2 of 40.9%. A separate analysis performed on 274 specimens obtained through vacuum-assisted biopsy revealed different variables were associated with underestimation; however, a similar AUC (0.743) and Nagelkerke's R-2 (45.7% ) were obtained. Conclusion: Our model had the best AUC for predicting DCIS invasiveness reported to date. However, further statistical analysis showed only a fair overall performance. The currently known clinical, radiographic, and pathologic features might be insufficient to identify which patients with DCIS have underestimated disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Response of Riparian Vegetation, Instream Habitat, and Aquatic Biota to Riparian Grazing Exclosures
T2  - NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improper riparian grazing can alter riparian vegetation and reduce streambank stability, negatively impacting aquatic habitat and biota. We evaluated differences in riparian and instream habitat, benthic macroinvertebrates, and fish inside versus outside seven riparian exclosures constructed from 1982 to 2005 in Idaho. The normalized difference vegetation index from Landsat imagery (1985 to 2015) showed significant increases in riparian vegetation productivity after some but not all exclosures were constructed. Field data collected in 2015 showed woody riparian vegetation to be more abundant, streambanks less altered, and stream channels narrower inside versus outside exclosures, as we expected. However, instream habitat, a benthic macroinvertebrate index, fish species richness, and adult salmonid density showed no response. Higher age-0 salmonid densities were the only aquatic organism response observed. Broader watershed-scale factors likely limited strong and consistent responses by aquatic biota to exclosures. We conclude that riparian exclosures have localized effects on stream systems, such as increased riparian vegetation, reduced streambank alteration, and improved channel stability, but may not always influence aquatic biota that commonly reflect larger watershed-scale processes and conditions. Therefore, well-maintained riparian exclosures should be used to eliminate livestock use in localized areas of stream corridors that are sensitive to disturbance. To improve stream health at the larger watershed scale that is relevant to most aquatic biota, exclosures should only be one of several grazing management tools implemented simultaneously to reduce the impacts of improper livestock grazing.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this article is to describe the epidemiology of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) and non-LGV Chlamydia trachomatis anorectal infections in France and to examine the characteristics of the affected populations via a voluntary sentinel surveillance system for LGV between 2010 and 2015. Anorectal samples positive for C. trachomatis (CT) were sent by the participating laboratories to the National Reference Center for CT for LGV identification. Biological and clinical data were collected by biologists and clinicians. There were 1740 LGV episodes and 2248 non-LGV episodes. Continuous monitoring highlighted a sharp increase in the number of LGV and non-LGV anorectal infections, which were 2.3-fold and 6.5-fold, respectively. Most of the infections occurred in men who have sex with men. LGV patients were older than non-LGV patients and were more frequently human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive compared to non-LGV patients. Anorectal LGV was significantly associated with residence in Paris, HIV co-infection, concurrent syphilis and bloody anal discharge. Undocumented patient characteristics were strongly associated with anorectal LGV. The anorectal LGV epidemic is poorly controlled in France. Early detection and prompt treatment of patients and their sexual partners are required to prevent transmission in the context of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV infection.

TI  - Megafires in Chile 2017: Monitoring multiscale environmental impacts of burned ecosystems
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - During the summer of 2017, several megafires in South-Central Chile burned down forest plantations, native forests, shrublands and human settlements. National authorities identified the relevant effects of the wildfires on infrastructure and ecosystems. However, other indirect effects such as the risk of flooding or, increased air pollution were not assessed. The present study assesses: i) the geographic characterization of wildfires, ii) amount of damage to ecosystems and the severity of wildfires, iii) the effects of megafires on air quality in nearby and distant urban areas, and iv) identification of cities potentially exposed to landslides and flooding. We ran remote sensing analyses based on the Normalized Burn Ratio taken from Landsat imagery, "active fires" from MODIS, and ASTER GDEM. The particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) levels measured on 34 Chilean's municipalities were correlated with the burning area/distance ratio by Spearman correlation. Socionatural hazards were evaluated usingmulti-criteria analyses combining proximity to burned areas, severity, potential flowof water and sediments as indicated by the Digital Elevation Model, drainage networks and the location of human settlements. 91 burned areas were identified, covering 529,794 ha. The most affected ecosystems were forest plantations and native shrublands. We found significant correlations between burned area/distance ratios and PM2.5 and PM10 levels, leading to increased levels over the Chilean air quality standard in the most populated cities. 37 human settlements were at increased risk of landslides and flooding hazards after fires and eleven could now be characterized as dangerously exposed. The 2017 wildfires in Chile have had an impact at both a small and large scale, with far-reaching air pollutants dispersing and affecting >74% of the Chilean population. The impact of the wild-fires was also extended over time, creating future potential for landslides and flooding, with the risk increasing in rainy seasons. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Conurbation, Urban, and Rural Living as Determinants of Allergies and Infectious Diseases: Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre Annual Report 2016-2017
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Living in a conurbation, urban, or rural environment is an important determinant of health. For example, conurbation and rural living is associated with increased respiratory and allergic conditions, whereas a farm or rural upbringing has been shown to be a protective factor against this.Objective: The objective of the study was to assess differences in general practice presentations of allergic and infectious disease in those exposed to conurbation or urban living compared with rural environments.Methods: The population was a nationally representative sample of 175 English general practices covering a population of over 1.6 million patients registered with sentinel network general practices. General practice presentation rates per 100,000 population were reported for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and infectious conditions grouped into upper and lower respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infection, and acute gastroenteritis by the UK Office for National Statistics urban-rural category. We used multivariate logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, comorbidities, and smoking status, reporting odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.Results: For allergic rhinitis, the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.23; P=.003) for urban and 1.29 (95% CI 1.19-1.41; P<.001) for conurbation compared with rural dwellers. Conurbation living was associated with a lower OR for both asthma (OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.67-0.73; P<.001) and lower respiratory tract infections (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98; P=.005). Compared with rural dwellers, the OR for upper respiratory tract infection was greater in urban (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03-1.08; P<.001) but no different in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97-1.03; P=.93). Acute gastroenteritis followed the same pattern: the OR was 1.13 (95% CI 1.01-1.25; P=.03) for urban dwellers and 1.04 (95% CI 0.93-1.17; P=.46) for conurbation dwellers. The OR for urinary tract infection was lower for urban dwellers (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99; P=.02) but higher in conurbation dwellers (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00-1.13; P=.04).Conclusions: Those living in conurbations or urban areas were more likely to consult a general practice for allergic rhinitis and upper respiratory tract infection. Both conurbation and rural living were associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection. Living in rural areas was associated with an increased risk of asthma and lower respiratory tract infections. The data suggest that living environment may affect rates of consultations for certain conditions. Longitudinal analyses of these data would be useful in providing insights into important determinants.

TI  - Issues in Building a Nursing Home Syndromic Surveillance System with Textmining: Longitudinal Observational Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: New nursing homes (NH) data warehouses fed from residents' medical records allow monitoring the health of elderly population on a daily basis. Elsewhere, syndromic surveillance has already shown that professional data can be used for public health (PH) surveillance but not during a long-term follow-up of the same cohort.Objective: This study aimed to build and assess a national ecological NH PH surveillance system (SS).Methods: Using a national network of 126 NH, we built a residents' cohort, extracted medical and personal data from their electronic health records, and transmitted them through the internet to a national server almost in real time. After recording sociodemographic, autonomic and syndromic information, a set of 26 syndromes was defined using pattern matching with the standard query language-LIKE operator and a Delphi-like technique, between November 2010 and June 2016. We used early aberration reporting system (EARS) and Bayes surveillance algorithms of the R surveillance package (Hohle) to assess our influenza and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) syndromic data against the Sentinelles network data, French epidemics gold standard, following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance system assessment guidelines.Results: By extracting all sociodemographic residents' data, a cohort of 41,061 senior citizens was built. EARS_C3 algorithm on NH influenza and AGE syndromic data gave sensitivities of 0.482 and 0.539 and specificities of 0.844 and 0.952, respectively, over a 6-year period, forecasting the last influenza outbreak by catching early flu signals. In addition, assessment of influenza and AGE syndromic data quality showed precisions of 0.98 and 0.96 during last season epidemic weeks' peaks (weeks 03-2017 and 01-2017) and precisions of 0.95 and 0.92 during last summer epidemic weeks' low (week 33-2016).Conclusions: This study confirmed that using syndromic information gives a good opportunity to develop a genuine French national PH SS dedicated to senior citizens. Access to senior citizens' free-text validated health data on influenza and AGE responds to a PH issue for the surveillance of this fragile population. This database will also make possible new ecological research on other subjects that will improve prevention, care, and rapid response when facing health threats.

TI  - Retrieval of the canopy chlorophyll content from Sentinel-2 spectral bands to estimate nitrogen uptake in intensive winter wheat cropping systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most common approaches to reducing the environmental impact of nitrogen (N) fertilisation in intensive agrosystems is to adjust the N input of the crop requirement. This adjustment is frequently related to the nitrogen nutrition index (NNI) based on the concepts of the critical and actual N absorbed (kg/ha) in the crop canopy (respectively, N-c and CNC). Accurate estimation of the N-c and CNC at the field scale over large areas based on freely available satellite imagery is thus a key issue to address. Relying on a large dataset of farmers' fields, this study highlights the high correlation (R-2 = 0.90) between the wheat CNC and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieved from Sentinel-2 (S2) with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The estimation is related to errors of 4 and 21 kg/ha (depending on the growing stage), which is a promising result for evaluating the NNI. There are four major outcomes from this result: (i) the importance of working at the canopy level; (ii) the independence of the relationship to the considered cultivars; (iii) the dependence of the relationship on the growing stage; and (iv) the potential to use only the 10 m S2 bands, opening the way for precision agriculture. In parallel, estimation accuracies were investigated for the three biophysical variables (BV) related to the CNC and N-c, i.e., the green area index (GAI), leaf chlorophyll content (Cab) and CCC. From this analysis, the added value of the red-edge bands for improving the estimation of the 3 BVs of interest was quantified as was the performance reduction related to the field heterogeneity.

TI  - Integrating spatiotemporal dynamics of natural capital security and urban ecosystem carbon metabolism
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to address and quantify the increase in urban expansion and carbon (C) metabolism burden on ecosystem service value (ESV), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and C storage of urban footprint. Urban footprint is required to meet the demands arising from economic consumption and production as well as waste accumulation and assimilation. Spatiotemporal changes in main land covers (LCs) were detected using remotely sensed data (Landsat 5 and 8, and digital elevation model) between 1987 and 2016. Changes in ESV and C influx, efflux and pools associated with LC dynamics were approximated using global proxies for a western Mediterranean region in Turkey of 54,162km(2). Urban expansion over the 29-year period decreased ESV by 22% ($7.28 +/- 0.4 billion), NEP by 4.3% (2.3 +/- 9GgC), and total ecosystem C pool by 10.9% (1008.3 +/- 1006GgC) and led to a 62.8% appropriation of the total NEP (50.1 +/- 51GgC) of the urban footprint in 2016. The main cause of the environmental degradation across the study region was the loss of the seminatural areas. Our findings emphasize that the deterioration rate of ecosystems should be slowed down by natural capital-friendly decisions and should not exceed rehabilitation rate of damaged ecosystems in the face of rapidly increasing burdens of the cities on their footprint.

TI  - Effect of Primary Breast Tumor Location on Axillary Nodal Positivity
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Variables such as tumor size, histology, and grade, tumor biology, presence of lymphovascular invasion, and patient age have been shown to impact likelihood of nodal positivity. The aim of this study is to determine whether primary location of invasive disease within the breast is associated with nodal positivity.Patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing axillary staging from 2010 to 2014 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base. Rates of axillary nodal positivity by primary tumor locations were compared, and multivariable analysis performed using logistic regression to control for factors known to impact nodal positivity.A total of 599,722 patients met inclusion criteria. Likelihood of nodal positivity was greatest with primary tumors located in the nipple (43.8%), followed by multicentric disease (40.8%), central breast lesions (39.4%), and axillary tail lesions (38.4%). Tumor location remained independently associated with nodal positivity on multivariable analysis adjusting for variables known to affect nodal positivity with odds ratio 2.8 for tumors in the nipple [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.5-3.1], 2.2 for central breast (95% CI: 2.2-2.3), and 2.7 for axillary tail (95% CI: 2.4-2.9). When restricted to patients with clinically negative nodes (n = 430,949), a similar association was seen.Patients with invasive breast cancer located in the nipple, central breast, and axillary tail have the highest risk of positive axillary lymph nodes independent of patient age, tumor grade, biologic subtype, histology, and size. This should be considered along with other factors in preoperative counseling and decision-making regarding plans for axillary lymph node staging.

TI  - Hurricanes as a Major Driver of Coastal Erosion in the Mississippi River Delta: A Multi-Decadal Analysis of Shoreline Retreat Rates at Bay Champagne, Louisiana (USA)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Louisiana shoreline is rapidly retreating as a result of factors such as sea-level rise and land subsidence. The northern Gulf of Mexico coast is also a hotspot for hurricane landfalls, and several major storms have impacted this region in the past few decades. A section of the Louisiana (USA) coast that has one of the highest rates of shoreline retreat in North America is the Caminada-Moreau headland, located south of New Orleans. Bay Champagne is a coastal lake within the headland that provides a unique opportunity to investigate shoreline retreat and the coastal effects of hurricanes. In order to examine the influence of hurricanes on the rate of shoreline retreat, 35 years (1983-2018) of Landsat imagery was analyzed. During that period of time, the shoreline has retreated 292 m. The overall rate of shoreline retreat, prior to a beach re-nourishment project completed in 2014, was over 12 m per year. A period of high hurricane frequency (1998-2013) corresponds to an increased average shoreline retreat rate of > 21 m per year. Coastal features created by multiple hurricanes that have impacted this site have persisted for several years. Bay Champagne has lost 48% of its surface area over the last 35 years as a result of long-term shoreline retreat. If shoreline retreat continues at the average rate, it is expected that Bay Champagne will disappear completely within the next 40 years.

TI  - Landslide Detection and Susceptibility Mapping by AIRSAR Data Using Support Vector Machine and Index of Entropy Models in Cameron Highlands, Malaysia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since landslide detection using the combination of AIRSAR data and GIS-based susceptibility mapping has been rarely conducted in tropical environments, the aim of this study is to compare and validate support vector machine (SVM) and index of entropy (IOE) methods for landslide susceptibility assessment in Cameron Highlands area, Malaysia. For this purpose, ten conditioning factors and observed landslides were detected by AIRSAR data, WorldView-1 and SPOT 5 satellite images. A spatial database was generated including a total of 92 landslide locations encompassing the same number of observed and detected landslides, which was divided into training (80%; 74 landslide locations) and validation (20%; 18 landslide locations) datasets. Results of the difference between observed and detected landslides using root mean square error (RMSE) indicated that only 16.3% error exists, which is fairly acceptable. The validation process was performed using statistical-based measures and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results of validation process indicated that the SVM model has the highest values of sensitivity (88.9%), specificity (77.8%), accuracy (83.3%), Kappa (0.663) and AUROC (84.5%), followed by the IOE model. Overall, the SVM model applied to detected landslides is considered to be a promising technique that could be tested and utilized for landslide susceptibility assessment in tropical environments.

TI  - Study on the change rate of shoreline based on Digital Coastal Analysis System (DSAS): taking the shoreline of the Yellow River Delta and Laizhou Bay as an example
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - The change of shoreline plays an important role in the coastal area ecological environment change and coastal land erosion. The extraction and monitoring of shoreline is of great significance to the protection and management of coastal ecosystem. Based on the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), this paper studies the temporal and spatial variation of the shoreline of the Yellow River Delta and Laizhou Bay. Results show that: by extracting the Landsat 6 images from 1985 to 2015, it was found that the shoreline of the Yellow River Delta and Laizhou Bay showed a significant trend of expanding to the sea in the past 30 years, and the growth rate was accelerated. (1)The average of the End Point Rate(EPR) was about 73.0 m/a, and the linear regression rate (LRR) was about 75.48 m/a. The growth rate of the Yellow River port - Dazui ditch was the fastest (129.2 m/a). Due to the influence of the sediment transport in the Yellow River, the shoreline's geometric shaped of the Yellow River estuary and the old Yellow River estuary showed a smooth trend; (2) The average growth in the Laizhou Bay was about 139.5 m/a (EPR) and 144.3 m/a (LRR). The growth rate of the Zimai-Bailang section was the fastest(197.6 m/a). The areas with relatively significant changed in shoreline are concentrated in areas such as ports, seawall dams, mariculture, etc. DSAS model had a significant advantage in the quantitative analysis of shoreline. EPR and LRR indicators can scientifically and effectively simulated the time and space rate of shoreline.

TI  - PHOTOSYNTHETIC PARAMETERS AS PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF TOLERANCE TO CADMIUM STRESS IN SUNFLOWER GENOTYPES
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the tolerance to cadmium (Cd) of sunflower genotypes grown in greenhouse conditions, and the effectiveness of using photosynthetic parameters as physiological indicators of this tolerance. Seeds of two sunflower genotypes previously identified as tolerant (H358) and Cd-sensitive (AG960) to Cd were used. The seeds were germinated in plastic cups containing plant substrate; after 9 days, the seedlings were transplanted to plastic basins containing a nutrient solution with 0 or 10 mu M of Cd, where they remained for 16 days. Samples of the plants were harvested every 5 days. The experiment was carried out in a randomized complete design, using a 4x2x2 factorial arrangement (4 days of grown in a nutrient solution with Cd, 2 sunflower genotypes, and 2 Cd levels) with four replications. Cd stress decreased CO2 net assimilation, stomatal conductance, carboxylation efficiency, photosynthetic pigment contents, potential quantum yield (F-v/F-m), and effective quantum yield of plants of the two evaluated genotypes. The decrease in photosynthetic rates of these plants was caused by both stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. Plants of the AG960 genotype showed more pronounced deleterious effects due to Cd stress than those of the H358 genotype. Thus, CO2 net assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and chloroplast pigment content are good physiological indicators of sunflower tolerance to Cd and can at least in part, explain the greater tolerance of the H358 genotype to Cd stress when compared to the AG960 genotype.

TI  - Towards a national, remote-sensing-based model for predicting field-scale crop yield
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Existing agricultural grain yield models predict yield at the field scale, or at regional scales (like districts and countries), but not both with consistent accuracy. Here we describe a scalable, satellite-based yield model called C-Crop. It is calibrated locally and so has field-scale accuracy. Its input data can be inferred remotely (namely crop type, foliage cover and air temperature) and so it can be potentially applied at any regional scale. We calibrated C-Crop using harvester-derived yield data for canola (31 field-years) and wheat (160 field-years), across the Australian cropping zone. C-Crop explained 69 and 68% of the observed variability in field-scale canola and wheat yields, respectively, with errors in the order of 33% and 32% of total yield. Given its simplicity, C-Crop is an effective model for estimating field-scale crop yields and has the potential to be applied across large regions.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies in the application of geostationary satellite sensors, such as the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) onboard the European Union's meteorological satellite, and the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) from South Korea, to monitor the Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) in coastal waters have shown that the higher temporal dynamics in the coastal processes can be better achieved with high temporal resolution geostationary satellite sensors. The availability of the geostationary satellite, Himawari-8 carrying the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) sensor with visible, Near InfraRed (NIR) and Shortwave InfraRed (SWIR) bands over the coastal waters of Australia has prompted this study to test the feasibility of AHI in mapping TSS concentration. In this study, we present an atmospheric correction method for AHI data using two different aerosol correction methods, a combination of two SWIR bands, and a combination of one NIR and one SWIR band. The outcome from this study indicated that the atmospherically corrected AHI data at 10 min temporal resolution can be used to discern TSS concentrations greater than similar to 0.15 mg/L when solar zenith angles (theta(0)) are less than 60 degrees. The result of the cross-validation of AHI derived TSS concentration, with MODIS-Aqua and Lansat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) derived TSS concentration showed good correlation, with correlation coefficients r = 0.71 and r = 0.91, respectively.

TI  - Current and future glacier and lake assessment in the deglaciating Vilcanota-Urubamba basin, Peruvian Andes
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier shrinkage is a strong driver of change for mountain hydrology and landscape development and bears multiple risks as well as new options for human livelihoods. In the tropical Andes, current rates of glacier loss are investigated to some point but associated future extent of both vanishing glacier and forming lake areas and volumes are poorly explored. This study combines an analysis of current (1988-2016) and future (2050/2100) glacier and lake development in the Vilcanota-Urubamba basin (Cusco, Southern Peru). Total glacier area (volume) decreased by 37.3% (20.5%) from 226.1 km(2) (8.122 km(3)) in 1988 to 141.7 km(2) (6.457 km(3)) in 2016. Adjacent lakes increased in area (number) by 15.5% (18.3%) from 23.3 km(2) (460 lakes) in 1988 to 26.9 km(2) (544 lakes) in 2016 while corresponding lake volume has grown by 9.7% from 0.637 km(3) to 0.699 km(3), respectively. High spatiotemporal variability can be observed in the basin, with strongest glacier shrinkage in the lower lying northwest (Cordilleras Urubamba and Vilcabamba) and highest growth and lake extent in the Altiplano region of the southeast (Cordillera Vilcanota and Quelccaya ice cap). Future glacier areas could substantially decrease between 40.7% (RCP2.6) and 44.9% (RCP8.5) within the next decades (2031-2060) and between 41.4% and 92.7%, respectively, within this century (2071-2100). Hence, Andean landscapes would transform into mostly glacier-free areas with some remaining ice-covered summits over similar to 6000 m asl. and this would imply a loss of permanently stored water of several km(3). Until the end of this century, important future lake areas could develop and continue to grow between 3.2% (RCP 2.6) and 6.0% (RCP8.5) with an associated volume increase of 0.032 km(3) (4.6%) and 0.041 km(3) (5.9%), respectively. Our current baseline and future projections suggest that a decrease of glacier shrinkage is also followed by a slowdown in lake formation and particularly volume growth which might have already developed or occur in the near-future. Under the depicted scenarios of change, strong emphasis needs to be promptly put on feasible water management and storage options as robust adaptation measures tackling high uncertainties, risks and complex hydroclimatic and socioenvironmental intertwining.

TI  - The value of camels as sentinels for Bluetongue virus in Morocco
T2  - VETERINARIA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - A serosurvey was conducted to determine the value of camels (Camelus dromedaries) as sentinel animals for the detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) in Morocco. Between 2010 and 2013, camels from various localities in Morocco were randomly tested for antibodies against BTV serotypes-1, -4, -6, -8, -11, -14, and -16. Antibodies against 1 or more serotypes were detected in 41.8% of 537 camels tested with a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) diagnostic test. Of the 7 tested serotypes, only BTV-11 antibodies were not detected with serum neutralisation assays. This study not only confirms the epidemiological presence of BTV-1, -4, and -8 in Morocco, but also presents the first evidence of BTV-6, -14, and -16 in the country. As such, we conclude that camels would be ideal sentinel animals to determine the potential risk of BTV in Morocco.

TI  - Comparison of femoral neck cross-sectional morphology between gorilla and human
T2  - Jiepou Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To analyze the mechanical effect of different modes of locomotion on the whole femoral neck of the gorilla and human. Methods The femoral specimens of the gorilla (n = 8) and human (n = 18) were scanned by the computed tomography. We obtained five femoral neck slices from the base of the femoral head to the trochanteric line, and measured the cross-sectional geometric properties. Results Cross-sectional geometric properties [eg, Ix/Iy, Zx/Zy and standardized cortical area(CA)] of the femoral neck were increasing from the proximal to distal portion, besides the standardized polar section modulus(Zp) of the human. The values of standardized CA and Zp were lower in the gorilla than the human. Conclusion The similarity and difference of cross-sectional geometric properties between the gorilla and human femoral neck, respectively, correspond to its structure character which acts as a cantilevered beam and the different load conditions during bipedal and quadrupedal walking. Additionally, the polar section modulus of human mid-neck is significantly lower than other cross-sections, making it a fracture-prone region.

TI  - Detecting biodiversity refugia using remotely sensed data
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Habitats characterized by improved soil moisture availability can function as microrefugia (hereafter referred to as "refugia") for the persistence of rare plant species in dry environments. Such areas are dominated by Mediterranean woody vegetation (shrubland and woodland). An analysis of these refugia elucidates their spatial distribution at the landscape scale.Objectives Explore whether potential refugia, detected using the upper quantile of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are related, in space and time, with the survivability of rare species in dry environments.Methods We used upper NDVI quantile (25%) values to predict potential refugia in nine selected areas in northern parts of Israel from 1992 to 2011. Next, we developed an index based on the ratio of density (number of observations per area) of rare species in non-refugia versus refugia patches, per site (density of rare species index, DRSI). Finally, we examined the temporal stability of the DRSI using ANOVA and Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests.Results Refugia classifications and DRSI values for all areas were stable over time (1992-2011). The DRSI values were significantly lower than 1; that is, the density of rare species in the predicted refugia areas was higher than in non-refugia areas.Conclusions We assumed that patches of dense woody vegetation, determined by the upper 25% quantile of the NDVI, could be used to identify potential biodiversity refugia in dry environments. This assumption was validated by the DRSI results; it confirms that the local conditions in refugia support rare species.

TI  - Making the Most of Culture and Context: Sociocultural Strengths and Contextual Vulnerability When Eliciting Indigenous Resilience Insights With Remote South African Elders and Young People
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUALITATIVE METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research aimed at generating evidence to address elicitation challenges that arise because of extreme inequality and marginalized perspectives requires deliberation on relevant methodologies that can elicit insights by both revering marginalized sociocultural strengths and being sensitive to power imbalances. In this article, we provide examples of participatory methods that make the most of often silenced non-Western sociocultural strengths and create opportunities for participation despite barriers due to inequality. The examples emerged from multiple researcher journals and visual data from a study that documented indigenous psychology on resilience with elders (n = 24; male = 10, female = 14) and young people (n = 48; male = 21, female = 27) in two remote Southern African border communities. We describe the examples of elicitation methods to make the most of culture using (i) symbols that reflect nonmainstream sociocultural perspectives, (ii) familiar multiliteracies, (iii) a variety of spoken languages, and (iv) familiar collectivist modes, as well as contextual characteristics to (i) equalize opportunity given structural disparity, (ii) equalize power, and (iii) honor gender and age hierarchies. We conclude that methods for indigenous research can honor and leverage marginalized cultures and contexts to extend beyond sympathy for an oppressed worldview or a context of deprivation.

TI  - Monitoring of Water-Level Fluctuation of Lake Nasser Using Altimetry Satellite Data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Apart from the Renaissance Dam and other constructed dams on the River Nile tributaries, Egypt is classified globally as a state of scarce water. Egypt's water resources are very limited and do not contribute a significant amount to its water share except the River Nile (55.5 billion m(3)/year). While the number of population increases every year, putting more stress on these limited resources. This study aims to use remote-sensing data to assess the change in surface area and water-level variation in Lake Nasser using remote-sensing data from Landsat-8 and altimetry data. In addition, it investigates the use of thermal data from Landsat-8 to calculate water loss based on evaporation from Lake Nasser. The eight Landsat-8 satellite images were used to study the change in surface area of Lake Nasser representing winter (January) and summer (June/July) seasons in two consecutive years (2015 and 2016). Time series analyses for 10-day temporal resolution water-level data from Jason-2/OSTM and Jason-3 altimetry was carried out to investigate water-level trends over the long term (1993 and 2016) and short term (2015-2016) in correspondence with the change of the surface area. Results indicated a shrink in the lake surface area in 2016 of approximately 14% compared to the 2015 area. In addition, the evaporation rate in the lake is very high causing a loss of approximately 20% of the total water share from the river Nile.

TI  - Estimating the Mean Circulation and Water Exchange of the Gulf of Suez-Red Sea via a Validated One-Way Atmospheric-Hydrodynamic Coupled Model
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gulf of Suez, Northern Islands protected area, and Hurghada zone are experiencing mega developments in all sectors including tourism, industry, and logistics. The need for moderately accurate near-shore hydrodynamic models is increasing to support the sustainable development of this oceanic area. This can be accomplished by following a nesting approach including the downscaling of global atmospheric and oceanic models into local models using higher resolution datasets. This work aims to present the development of a one-way coupling between atmospheric and hydrodynamic models for the Gulf of Suez (GOS) to understand the local oceanic characteristics and processes. The Regional Climate Model system (RegCM4) is used to simulate moderate resolution atmospheric features and its results are used to force a local dedicated application of Delft3D model. The results indicate that the predicted water level, water temperature, and evaporation accurately follow in situ measurements, remotely sensed data, and re-analysis data. The results suggest that the annual sea surface temperature is averaged at 23 degrees C, while the annual average of evaporation rates equals 8.02 mm/day. The study suggests that the water level displays a marked seasonal and spatial variation. Moreover, the water balance in the Gulf of Suez was controlled by the difference between inflows and outflows through the Straits of Gubal and by the net precipitation. In addition, the water balance indicated a net loss of approximately 3.9x10(-3) m of water during 2013. Moreover, the exchange through the Straits of Gubal showed a two-way exchange with a net inflow of 0.0007 Sv, where the outflow dominated in the surface layer along the western coast and the inflow dominated in the lower layers along the middle of the Straits. To conclude, the one-way coupling modeling technique proved to be a reliable tool for studying local features of the GOS region.

TI  - The impact of acute stroke service centralisation: a time series evaluation.
T2  - Future healthcare journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - We evaluated the impact of the centralisation of three acute stroke units into a single hyperacute stroke unit within a large urban and rural NHS trust in North East England in June 2015. We performed retrospective interrupted time series analyses of 4,305 stroke patients admitted between 1 April 2013 and 31 December 2017 utilising data recorded for the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme. Centralisation was -associated with reductions in total length of inpatient stay (-4.9 days [95% CI: -8.1 to -1.7]). Time from admission to thrombolysis shortened by 26.0 minutes (95% CI: -40.0 to -12.1), and time from admission to brain imaging for thrombolysed patients improved by 16.2 minutes (95% CI: -22.0 to -10.4). Time from stroke onset to hospital admission, mortality and dependency (as measured by median modified Rankin Scale) were unaffected by centralisation. This study provides further evidence to support the centralisation of acute stroke services in England.

TI  - Performance of four published risk models to predict sentinel lymph-node involvement in Australian women with early breast cancer
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph-node biopsy has reduced the need for extensive axillary surgery for staging. It still exposes women to associated morbidity. Risk models that use clinical and pathology information of the primary tumour to predict sentinel lymph-node metastasis may allow further improvements in care. This study assessed the performance of four published risk models for predicting sentinel lymph-node metastasis in Australian women with early breast cancer; including one model developed in an Australian population.Methods: The Sentinel Node Biopsy Versus Axillary Clearance (SNAC) trial dataset was used to assess model discrimination by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) and the false-negative rate for sentinel lymph-node metastasis using model-predicted risk cut-points of 10%, 20%, 30%, and calibration using Hosmer-Lemeshow tests and calibration plots.Results: The sentinel node was positive in 248 of 982 (25.2%) women (158 macrometastasis, 90 micrometastasis). The AUCs of risk models ranged from 0.70 to 0.74 for prediction of any sentinel-node metastasis; 0.72 to 0.75 for macrometastasis. Calibration was poor for the three models developed outside of Australia (lack-of-fit statistics, P < 0.001). For women with a model-predicted risk of sentinel lymph-node metastasis <= 10%, observed risk was 0-13% (three models <10%), false-negative rate 0-9%; 1 -17% of women were classified in this range.Conclusion: All four models showed good discrimination for predicting sentinel lymph-node metastasis, in particular for macrometastasis. With further development such risk models could have a role in the provision of reassurance to low risk women with normal nodes sonographicaally for whom no axillary surgery is contemplated.

TI  - Assessment of Irrigation Water Performance in the Nile Delta Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive framework for irrigation water performance assessment (IWPA) based on satellite data was proposed. This framework consists of external IWPA (EIWPA) and internal IWPA (IIWPA). The EIWPA indicates the water supply as well as agricultural and economic performances. On the other hand, the IIWPA expresses the temporal and spatial performances of irrigation water use adequacy (PA), equity (PE), and dependability (PD) indicators. This framework was applied to the irrigation scheme of the Al-Qased canal in the Nile Delta, Egypt, during the winter between 2015 and 2016. The crop water requirements (ETc) were calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and Landsat 8 images. Three classes, from "good" to "poor," to classify the EIWPA and IIWPA values were proposed. The EIWPA was classified as "poor" in irrigation efficiency (51.2%) due to the oversupply of irrigation water in relation to the ETc while the economic indicators showed that the net profit was 7.84% of the gross value of crop production. The PE, PD, and PA were classified as "fair," which indicated a non-uniform irrigation water distribution between the head and tail branch canals. Moreover, the irrigation water was inadequate during the growing months and could not meet the ETc. The framework presented an efficient tool for the IWPA in terms of spatial, temporal, agricultural, and economic performances.

TI  - Mapping and assessment of vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using multispectral Sentinel-2 and SAR Sentinel-1 satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed mapping and regular monitoring of tropical rainforests is important for conservation and management of highly fragmented tropical rainforest habitats and biodiversity. Several studies have observed that it is highly challenging to map different vegetation types in tropical rainforests due to large environmental heterogeneity, high topographical variability and near constant cloud cover. In the present study, we assessed the capability of optical multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI bands, their derived NDVI and textures, and SAR Sentinel-1 bands and their textures to discriminate different vegetation types in the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats using maximum likelihood and random forest classification. We also compared the results of our classification with previous such maps of the study area. Finally, we evaluated the magnitude of habitat fragmentation by using derived landscape metrics. Our classification had high accuracy ( > 75%), especially compared to previous classification efforts. Our results emphasise the significance of using vegetation indices and textures for vegetation type classification in the Western Ghats. Furthermore, the results suggest that rainforest habitats and other agro-ecosystems, suitable as habitats for numerous plant and animal species, are highly fragmented and require top conservation priority. High spectral and spatial resolution, continuity, affordability and access makes Sentinel-2 one of the best options for regular monitoring of tropical rainforests.

TI  - Implications of Pixel Quality Flags on the Observation Density of a Continental Landsat Archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel quality (PQ) products delivered with Analysis Ready Data (ARD) provide users with information about the conditions of the surface, atmosphere, and sensor at the time of acquisition. Knowing whether an observation was affected by clouds or sensor saturation is crucial when selecting data to include in automated analysis, as imperfect or erroneous observations are undesirable for most applications. There is, however, a certain rate of commission error in cloud detection, and saturation may not affect all spectral bands at a time, which can lead to suitable observations being excluded. This can have a substantial impact on the amount of data available for analysis. To understand how different surface types can affect cloud commission and saturation, we analyzed cloud and per-band saturation PQ flags for 31 years of Landsat data within Digital Earth Australia. Areas showing substantial reduction in observation density compared to their surroundings were investigated to characterize how specific surface types impact on the temporal density of observations deemed desirable. Using Fmask 3.2 by way of example, our approach demonstrates a method that can be applied to summarize the characteristics of cloud-screening algorithms and sensor saturation. Results indicate that cloud commission and sensor saturation rates show specific characteristics depending on the targets under observation. This potentially leads to an imbalance in data availability driven by surface type in a given study area. Based on our findings, the level of detail in PQ flags delivered with ARD is pivotal in maximizing the potential of EO data.

TI  - Enhanced Axillary Evaluation Using Reflector-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: A Prospective Feasibility Study and Comparison With Conventional Lymphatic Mapping Techniques
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast cancer patients with nodal involvement often undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The previously biopsied node (PBN) provides the most accurate information regarding treatment response. This study aimed to evaluate the success of a reflector-guided excision of the PBN to predict the response of the axilla. The reflector described in this report effectively targets the PBN without institutional safety concerns, and reflects the status of the axilla in all cases.Background: Recently there are efforts to use sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) techniques after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to minimize axillary surgery. However, studies have shown higher false negative rates in this scenario, which might result in inaccurate assessment of treatment response and patient prognosis as well as leaving residual disease behind. In this study, we describe the use of reflector-guided excision of the percutaneously biopsied node (PBN) as an aid to conventional SLNB and its predictor of the axillary status after NAC. Patients and Methods: This was a single-institution analysis of patients who underwent axillary fiducial-reflector placement and subsequent SLNB compared with conventional SLNB. Results: Nineteen patients in the reflector group were matched with 19 patients who underwent conventional SLNB (conventional group). The PBN was identified in the SLNB in 19 patients (100%) in the reflector group and in 9 patients (47.3%) in the conventional group (P = .002). In the remaining 10 patients in the conventional group, the PBN was identified in the axillary lymph node dissection specimen in 4 patients (21%) and not identified in 6 patients (31.7%). Among the 38 patients, traditional mapping failed to identify the PBN in 13 patients (34.2%). The PBN was negative in 10 patients (36%) and positive in 18 patients (64%); no additional positive nodes were identified among patients with a negative PBN, correctly reflecting the status of the axilla in 100% of cases. Conclusion: Mapping failure after NAC might compromise SLNB. Reflector-guided excision of the PBN is not only facile and feasible, but more accurately reflects the status of the axilla after NAC.

TI  - Mapping pine plantations in the southeastern US using structural, spectral, and temporal remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The southeastern U.S. produces the most industrial roundwood in the U.S. each year, largely from commercial pine plantations. The extent of plantation forests and management dynamics can be difficult to ascertain from periodic forest inventories, yet short-rotation tree plantations also present challenges for remote sensing. Here, we integrated spectral, temporal, and structural information from airborne and satellite platforms to distinguish pine plantations from natural forests and evaluate the contribution from planted forests to regional forest cover in the southeastern U.S. Within flight lines from NASA Goddard's Lidar, Hyperspectral, and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager, lidar metrics of forest structure had the highest overall accuracy for pine plantations among single-source classifications (90%), but the combination of spectral and temporal metrics from Landsat generated comparable accuracy (91%). Combined structural, temporal, and spectral information from G-LiHT and Landsat had the highest accuracy for plantations (92%) and natural forests (88%). At a regional scale, classifications using Landsat spectral and temporal metrics had between 74 and 82% mean class accuracy for plantations. Regionally, plantations accounted for 28% of forest cover in the southeastern U.S., a result similar to plot-based estimates, albeit with greater spatial detail. Regional maps of plantation forests differed from existing map products, including the National Land Cover Database. Combining plantation extent in 2011 with Landsat-based forest change data identified strong regional gradients in plantation dynamics since 1985, with distinct spatial patterns of rotation age (east-west) and plantation expansion (interior). Our analysis demonstrates the potential to improve the characterization of dynamic land cover classes, including economically important timber plantations, by integrating diverse remote sensing datasets. Critically, multi-source remote sensing provides an approach to leverage periodic forest inventory data for annual monitoring of managed forest landscapes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Present study analyses techniques in Remote Sensing (RS) and spatial data in studying the effects of Sea Level Rise (SLR) in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Its importance in restoring and protecting mangroves is reflected most clearly in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). Three parameters, including distribution of species, increases in sedimentation, salinity, and flooded areas were analyzed using RS. Data acquired from Landsat Thematic Mapper and field investigations were used to map the forest distribution and MIKE21 and MIKE11 software used to simulate sea level rise scenarios. The analysis showed an increase in the prevalence of Goran (Ceriops) replacing other mangrove species. We also identified there is an upsurge in sedimentation within the Sundarbans is likely to increase with SLR, particularly in river floodplains and increase flood frequency. This will also have salinity intrusion impacts in near future. Our results inform mangrove forest management and sustainable experts about the sedimentation and salt water intrusion spots and priority mitigation areas from mangrove species degradation in Sundarbans mangrove forest.

TI  - AMSR2 Soil Moisture Downscaling Using Temperature and Vegetation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) applications in terrestrial hydrology require higher spatial resolution soil moisture products than those provided by passive microwave remote sensing instruments (grid resolution of 9 km or larger). In this investigation, an innovative algorithm that uses visible/infrared remote sensing observations to downscale Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) coarse spatial resolution SM products was developed and implemented for use with data provided by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). The method is based on using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) modulated relationships between day/night SM and temperature change at corresponding times. Land surface model output variables from the North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS), remote sensing data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used in this methodology. The functional relationships developed using NLDAS data at a grid resolution of 12.5 km were applied to downscale AMSR2 JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) SM product (25 km) using MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and NDVI observations (1 km) to produce the 1 km SM estimates. The downscaled SM estimates were validated by comparing them with ISMN (International Soil Moisture Network) in situ SM in the Black Bear-Red Rock watershed, central Oklahoma between 2015-2017. The overall statistical variables of the downscaled AMSR2 SM validation R-2, slope, RMSE and bias, demonstrate good accuracy. The downscaled SM better characterized the spatial and temporal variability of SM at watershed scales than the original SM product.

TI  - Estimation of the directional and whole apparent clumping index (ACI) from indirect optical measurements
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy clumping index (CI) indicates the non-random distribution of foliage components in space, and is an important structural parameter for better understanding the radiative transfer process in a canopy. The apparent clumping index (ACI), calculated using the logarithmic gap fraction averaging method, is reported by the LAI-2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer. While LAI-2200 calculates the gap fraction and ACI from different conical rings, calculation of ACI for other geometric units (e.g., an angular cell or an azimuth sector) and instruments has been lacked. Building upon the LAI-2200 ACI, this study compares the ACIs calculated for different geometric spaces from different optical instruments. The field data obtained from seasonal continuous measurements with LAI-2200, digital hemispheric photography (DHP), and AccuPAR at a paddy rice field in northeast China were used to calculate the directional ACIs at different levels-a directional cell (Omega(A)(theta,phi)), a concentric ring (Omega(A)(theta)), an azimuth sector (Omega(A)(phi)), and over the horizontal landscape (Omega(A)(nu)). The whole ACIs were calculated from the directional ACIs with an angular integration method, a simple averaging method, a non-linear correction method, and a variance-to-mean ratio method. The directional ACIs for paddy rice generally follow the ord er of Omega(A)(theta,phi) < Omega(A)(theta) and Omega(A)(phi) < Omega(A)(nu), displaying an increase of foliage randomness with the segment size. The Omega(A)(theta,phi) estimated from DHP indicates canopy clumping at the finest level and is consistent with the CIs estimated from the logarithmic averaging method (Omega(LX)) and the ratio method (the effective leaf area index (LAI(e)) divided by the LAI). The ACI metrics expand the current CI metrics and can be obtained with different optical instruments. The expanded metrics can be applied in the canopy radiative transfer modeling and in the estimation of canopy biophysical parameters for other vegetation ecosystems.

TI  - Treatment of Advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Current Therapeutic Options and Novel Immunotherapy Approaches
T2  - TARGETED ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a very aggressive, rare neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with a high frequency of locoregional recurrence and metastasis, and a high mortality rate. Surgical resection, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and radiotherapy represent the gold standard of treatment in patients with localized disease, while chemotherapy has a significant role in the treatment of advanced disease. However, no definitive evidence on the survival impact of radiotherapy in the advanced stages has been provided to date, and response to chemotherapy remains brief in the majority of cases, indicating an urgent need for alternative approaches. Biological and genome sequencing studies have implicated multiple molecular pathways in MCC, thus leading to the development of new agents that target angiogenic factors, anti-apoptosis molecules, poly-ADP ribose polymerase, intracellular signal proteins such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and peptide receptors such as somatostatin receptors. More recently, immunotherapy agents such as avelumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab, which act by blocking the programmed cell-death (PD)-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint, have shown promising results, especially in the advanced setting, and should now be considered standard of care for metastatic MCC. Current research is focusing on developing new immunotherapeutic strategies, identifying predictive biomarker to aid in the selection of patients responsive to immunotherapy, and defining combination approaches to increase efficacy in refractory patients.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Change of Aeolian Desertification Land Distribution in Northern China from 2001 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land desertification is one of the world's most important global ecological environment problems and sensitive to global climate change. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) data were used to obtain aeolian desertification land distribution in Northern China. Aeolian desertification land distribution from 2001 to 2015 was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in this area. Results show that aeolian desertification situation of 70 counties is expanded with low slope values and 250 counties is reversed. Aeolian desertification situation in most areas is improved in recent 15 years. Gravity center of the aeolian desertification has a trend to move towards the direction of the high latitude and low longitude. It moves towards north about 0.06A degrees and west about 2.2A degrees from 2001 to 2015. The main distribution area is between 90-100A degrees E, 30- 40A degrees N and altitude which less than 2000 m in desert and steppe climate zone. Aeolian desertification is worsening in recent 5 years around rivers and lakes. In recent years, the government has made great efforts to strengthen ecological construction with positive effect, but we still need to pay more attention to environment deterioration of rivers, lakes and the nearby areas in the future.

T2  - MODERN LANGUAGE REVIEW

AB  - The sentinel Francisco, in Hamlet, seems eminently forgettable: after the first twenty lines, he makes his final exit. Yet, he leaves a haunting impression, especially with his unexplained self-diagnosis, 'I am sick at heart'-the first reference to disease in the language of the play. Perhaps the final words addressed to him-'O farewell, honest soldier'-reveal why Denmark has sickened Francisco. For a representative of honesty, the corrupt world of the play is an alien habitat, and he is a foreign particle that must be expelled for the organism of Hamlet to continue its course towards sickness unto death.

TI  - Study of the spread of antimicrobial-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from wild mammals in the National Park of Aspromonte (Calabria, Italy)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria are a threat to global health. Epidemiological studies are necessary to gain a more detailed understanding of the transmission modality of resistant bacteria to wild animals and their diffusion into the environment to ensure a broader evaluation of the epidemiological role of wildlife. The study aimed to identify little-known epidemiological aspects by focusing on the isolation of Enterobacteriaceae in order to bring knowledge on the bacterial flora of wild mammals living in the National Park of Aspromonte (Calabria, Italy). Two hundred twenty-five faecal samples of wild mammals were collected and submitted to standard bacteriological examination for Enterobacteriaceae detection. Isolates were identified by mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation - time of fligt mass spectrometry). The 30 isolates showing the highest number of resistances were screened for Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) production. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the bacterial isolates was performed by the disk diffusion method. Two hundred sixty-three strains were isolated. The most frequently recovered bacterial species were Hafnia alvei, Escherichia cob and Citrobacter spp.. Potentially pathogenic species including Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica and Serratia marcescens have also been identified. Isolates displayed significant frequencies of antibiotic resistance. The resistance to amoxicillin (71.4%) was the most frequent, followed by amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (55.5%), ampicillin (49.8%), streptomycin (35.7%), doxycycline (16.3%), tobramycin (15.2%), tetracycline (13.3%) and gentamicin (10.6%). Nine strains showed resistance to imipenem and 1 to meropenem. All isolates were negative for the presence of ESBL-encoding genes. Wild animals can be regarded as sentinel species and used as environmental health indicators.

TI  - Cadmium in tissues of green turtles (<i>Chelonia mydas</i>): A global perspective for marine biota
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Cadmium (Cd) is a metal of toxicological interest because of its potential high toxicity to organisms and ability to biomagnify. Evaluating concentrations of Cd in organisms on a large spatial scale can provide insights to its global distribution. This study examined Cd concentrations in kidney and liver tissues of 137 specimens of green turtles (Chelonia mydas) collected in Australia, Brazil, Hawaii, Japan, and the continental United States (Gulf of Mexico). We used comparative analyses of kidney and liver of 35 individuals, of which seven turtles from each locality belong to the same size class for comparison purposes between their ocean of origin. Cd was detected in all samples, with the highest bioconcentration in kidneys. Specimens originating from the Pacific Ocean had significantly higher mean Cd levels in liver (13.24 mu g/g) and kidney (34.17 mu g/g) than the specimens collected in the Atlantic Ocean with lower mean values in liver (1.00 mu g/g) and kidney (4.04 mu g/g). Furthermore, Cd concentrations in turtle tissues were generally greater than concentrations found in other marine organisms, for example dolphins. This result was unexpected because dolphins occupy a higher trophic level than green turtles which are only herbivorous. A possible explanation is a change in feeding habits of green turtles, in which juveniles feed in near shore habitats, potentially resulting in greater Cd accumulation in juveniles compared to adults. This global distribution trend has also been observed in other marine organisms (e.g., insects, birds, and mammals) and indicates that global factors may be more important than regional factors in determining Cd concentrations of marine organisms.Capsule: Global factors are more relevant than local factors in the distribution of cadmium in biota, using green turtle as a sentinel species.

TI  - Human Coronavirus Infections in Israel: Epidemiology, Clinical Symptoms and Summer Seasonality of HCoV-HKU1
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) cause mild to severe respiratory diseases. Six types of HCoVs have been discovered, the most recent one termed the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The aim of this study is to monitor the circulation of HCoV types in the population during 2015-2016 in Israel. HCoVs were detected by real-time PCR analysis in 1910 respiratory samples, collected from influenza-like illness (ILI) patients during the winter sentinel influenza survey across Israel. Moreover, 195 HCoV-positive samples from hospitalized patients were detected during one year at Soroka University Medical Center. While no MERS-CoV infections were detected, 10.36% of patients in the survey were infected with HCoV-OC43 (43.43%), HCoV-NL63 (44.95%), and HCoV-229E (11.62%) viruses. The HCoVs were shown to co-circulate with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and to appear prior to influenza virus infections. HCoV clinical symptoms were more severe than those of RSV infections but milder than influenza symptoms. Hospitalized patients had similar HCoV types percentages. However, while it was absent from the public winter survey, 22.6% of the patients were HCoV-HKU1 positives, mainly during the spring-summer period.

TI  - Near-infrared fluorescence for detection of sentinel lymph nodes in women with cervical and uterine cancers (FILM): a randomised, phase 3, multicentre, non-inferiority trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Accurate identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with cancer improves detection of metastatic disease and decreases surgical morbidity. We sought to establish whether indocyanine green fluorescent dye is non-inferior to isosulfan blue dye in detecting sentinel lymph nodes in women with cervical and uterine cancers.Methods In this non-inferiority, within-patient comparison study, patients aged 18 years or older with clinical stage I endometrial or cervical cancer undergoing curative surgery were randomly assigned 1:1 to lymphatic mapping with isosulfan blue dye (visualised by white light) followed by indocyanine green (visualised by near-infrared imaging), or indocyanine green followed by isosulfan blue dye. Permuted block randomisation with stratification by study site was done with a computerised random number generator. All participants were masked to their randomisation assignment until after the procedure; however, investigators were not masked to the procedure used. Laparoscopic surgery with the PINPOINT near-infrared fluorescence imaging system (Stryker, Kalamazoo, MI, USA) was used in all cases. The primary outcome was efficacy of intraoperative indocyanine green with near-infrared fluorescence imaging versus that of isosulfan blue dye in the identification of lymph nodes, defined as the number of lymph nodes identified by indocyanine green and isosulfan blue dye, respectively (and confirmed as lymphoid tissue by histology), divided by the number of lymph nodes identified intraoperatively and excised. The study had a 5% non-inferiority margin needed to show non-inferiority of the frequency of lymph node detection with indocyanine green to that with isosulfan blue dye with 80% power at a 5% two-sided significance level. Analyses were done in both per-protocol and modified intention-to-treat populations. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02209532, and is completed and closed.Findings Between Dec 21, 2015, and June 19, 2017, 180 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the two groups (90 to each group); 176 patients received the intervention and were evaluable (modified intention-totreat population). 13 patients with major protocol violations were subsequently excluded from the per-protocol population. 517 sentinel nodes were identified in the per-protocol population (n=163), of which 478 (92%) were confirmed to be lymph nodes on pathological processing: 219 (92%) of 238 nodes that were both blue and green, all seven nodes that were blue only, and 252 (95%) of 265 nodes that were green only (p=0.33). Seven sentinel lymph nodes were neither blue nor green but were removed for appearing suspicious or enlarged on visual examination. In total, 471 (97%) of 485 lymph nodes were identified with the green dye and 226 (47%) with the blue dye (difference 50%, 95% CI 39-62; p<0.0001). In the modified intention-to-treat population (n=176), 545 nodes were identified, of which 513 (94%) were confirmed to be lymph nodes on pathological processing: 229 (92%) of 248 nodes that were both blue and green, all nine nodes that were blue only, and 266 (95%) of 279 nodes that were green only (p=0.30). Nine sentinal lymph nodes were neither blue nor green but were removed for appearing suspicious or enlarged on visual examination. 495 (96%) of 513 nodes were identified with the green dye and 238 (46%) with the blue dye (50%, 39-61; p<0.0001).Interpretation Indocyanine green dye with near-infrared fluorescence imaging identified more sentinel nodes than isosulfan blue dye in women with cervical and uterine cancers, with no difference in the pathological confirmation of nodal tissue between the two mapping substances.

TI  - Atmospheric Effect Correction for InSAR With Wavelet Decomposition-Based Correlation Analysis Between Multipolarization Interferograms
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a wavelet decomposition-based correlation analysis (WDCA) method to correct atmospheric effects for interferometric synthetic aperture radar interferometry. The main idea is based on the a priori knowledge that the atmospheric effects are independent of the polarizations. This provides the possibility to find the identical atmospheric phases (ATPs) from the two different polarimetric interferograms. To achieve this goal, differential interferometry is performed with different topographic data so that the obtained differential interferograms (D-Infs) have different topographic errors. A polynomial incorporating topographic information is then used to remove the orbit error phase. Thus, the ATPs are the only identical components in the obtained D-Infs. A forward wavelet transform is then utilized to perform multiresolution analysis for the two obtained D-Infs. After this, we apply correlation analysis to identify the wavelet coefficients attributed to the atmospheric effects. The corrected D-Infs are then obtained by down-weighting the wavelet coefficients during inverse wavelet transform. The performance of the WDCA method was tested with L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR dual-polarization SAR images acquired over Southern California and Qilian mountain test sites characterized by different topographic conditions. For the Southern California test site, two interferometric pairs with long and short baselines (750 and 50 m) were formulated. The results show that the WDCA method can work well for both of the interferometric pairs, and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the obtained DEMs with respect to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model (DEM) are 7.86 and 13.78 m, and show a decrease of 34.7% and 80.4% for the long- and short-baseline cases, respectively. For the Qilian mountain test site, the corrected interferogram can provide a DEM with an RMSE of 19.73 m, which is an improvement of 22.3% with respect to the DEM containing the atmospheric signals. In addition, the above two experiments show that compared with the existing topographic information-based wavelet method, this approach can remove not only the topography-dependent ATP but also the turbulent ATP.

TI  - Cervical cancer staging, pretreatment planning, and surgical treatment in the Nordic countriesSurvey from the Surgical Subcommittee of the Nordic Society of Gynecological Oncology
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionWomen with cervical cancer in the Nordic countries are increasingly undergoing pretreatment imaging by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) or computed tomography, or sentinel lymph node procedure. The present survey reports the influence of pretreatment imaging findings on the recorded clinical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage in Nordic countries and its impact on treatment planning and preferred surgical approach in cervical cancer.Material and methodsThe Nordic Society of Gynecological Oncology Surgical Subcommittee developed a questionnaire-based survey that was conducted from 1 January to 31 March 2017. All the 22 Nordic Gynecological Oncology Centers (Denmark 5, Finland 5, Iceland 1, Norway 4, and Sweden 7) were invited to participate.ResultsThe questionnaires were returned by 19 of 22 (86.3%) centers. The median number (range) of women with cervical cancer treated at each center annually was 32 (15-120). In 58% (11/19) of the centers, imaging findings were reported to influence the clinical staging. MRI in combination with PET-CT was the preferred imaging method and the results influenced treatment planning. Robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy was the preferred surgical method in 72% (13/18) of the centers. Sentinel lymph node procedure was not routinely implemented in the majority of the Nordic centers.ConclusionMore than half of the Nordic Gynecological Oncology Centers already report a clinical FIGO stage influenced by pretreatment imaging findings. The trend in preferred treatment is robotic-assisted radical hysterectomy and the sentinel lymph node procedure is gradually being introduced.

TI  - Classification of Small Seasonal Ponds Based on Soil-Water Environments in the Cuvelai Seasonal Wetland System, North-Central Namibia
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objectives of this study were to classify the small seasonal ponds that develop in the Cuvelai Seasonal Wetland System in north-central Namibia based on soil physicochemical properties so that potential agricultural uses of the ponds could be assessed. Satellite imagery was used to examine the relationships between soil characteristics and the probability of water presence in the region. Soil samples were collected from 66 ponds at three sites and their physicochemical properties and levels of salt accumulation were investigated. Soil data were analyzed by using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The ponds were classified into four types based on soil properties. Type A accounted for 20% of the ponds and was characterized by high levels of clay, silt, total N, and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Type B accounted for 14% of the ponds and was characterized by high values of organic C, C/N ratios, and available P. Type C accounted for 20% of the ponds, and this type featured high levels of salinity and sodicity. The remaining ponds were classified as Type D. If these seasonal ponds are to be considered for crop production, Type C should be avoided and Type D would require soil fertility improvements.

TI  - Anti-mumps IgM antibody positive rate with sudden sensorineural hearing loss using second-generation enzyme immunoassay: A retrospective, multi-institutional investigation in Hokkaido, Japan
T2  - AURIS NASUS LARYNX
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Although elevated anti-mumps IgM antibody levels were reported in 5.7%-7.2% of Japanese patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL), there were several reports of false-positive cases, such as the continually IgM positive case and the IgM positive case in normal adults. To improve specificity, the new enzyme immuno assay (EIA) anti-mumps IgM antibody measurement kit was introduced in December 2009. This study re-examined the frequency of anti mumps IgM antibody test positivity with SSNHL using the new measurement kit and compared the results with those from a previous report that used old kit.Methods: This is a retrospective multi-institutional study involving patients diagnosed with SSNHL who exhibited the anti-mumps IgM antibody. We compared the positive rate of anti-mumps IgM antibody and the annual average number of mumps cases per sentinel in Hokkaido between the patients in the present study and patients previously evaluated.Results: Overall, 100 patients with SSNHL were enrolled. One case (1.0%) was positive for anti mumps IgM antibody. Of the 69 patients evaluated in the previous study, 5 cases (7.2%) were positive for anti-mumps IgM antibody. The positive rate of the anti-mumps IgM antibody in the present cases was significantly lower than that previously reported (p = 0.042). The annual average number of mumps cases per sentinel in Hokkaido of the present and previous surveillance period was 34.47 and 42.77, respectively; no significant difference was seen in these data (p = 0.4519).Conclusion: The present study revealed that 1.0% of SSNHL was positive for the anti-mumps IgM antibody using the new EIA-IgM measurement kit. After the introduction of the new EIA-IgM measurement kit, anti-mumps IgM antibody positive rate with SSNHL significantly decreased, indicating that the proportion of asymptomatic mumps among etiology of SSNHL may be lower than those previously reported.

TI  - Axillary dissection versus no axillary dissection in patients with breast cancer and sentinel-node micrometastases (IBCSG 23-01): 10-year follow-up of a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial
T2  - LANCET ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background We previously reported the 5-year results of the phase 3 IBCSG 23-01 trial comparing disease-free survival in patients with breast cancer with one or more micrometastatic (<= 2 mm) sentinel nodes randomly assigned to either axillary dissection or no axillary dissection. The results showed no difference in disease-free survival between the groups and showed non-inferiority of no axillary dissection relative to axillary dissection. The current analysis presents the results of the study after a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR 7.8-12.7).Methods In this multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial, participants were recruited from 27 hospitals and cancer centres in nine countries. Eligible women could be of any age with clinical, mammographic, ultrasonographic, or pathological diagnosis of breast cancer with largest lesion diameter of 5 cm or smaller, and one or more metastatic sentinel nodes, all of which were 2 mm or smaller and with no extracapsular extension. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) before surgery (mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery) to no axillary dissection or axillary dissection using permuted blocks generated by a web-based congruence algorithm, with stratification by centre and menopausal status. The protocol-specified primary endpoint was disease-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (as randomly assigned). Safety was assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received their allocated treatment (as treated). We did a one-sided test for non-inferiority of no axillary dissection by comparing the observed hazard ratios (HRs) for disease-free survival with a margin of 1.25. This 10-year follow-up analysis was not prespecified in the trial's protocol and thus was not adjusted for multiple, sequential testing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00072293.Findings Between April 1,2001, and Feb 8,2010,6681 patients were screened and 934 randomly assigned to no axillary dissection (n=469) or axillary dissection (n=465). Three patients were ineligible and were excluded from the trial after randomisation. Disease-free survival at 10 years was 76.8% (95% CI 72.5-81.0) in the no axillary dissection group, compared with 74.9% (70.5-79.3) in the axillary dissection group (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.65-1.11; log-rank p=0.24; p=0.0024 for non-inferiority). Long-term surgical complications included lymphoedema of any grade in 16 (4%) of 453 patients in the no axillary dissection group and 60 (13%) of 447 in the axillary dissection group, sensory neuropathy of any grade in 57 (13%) in the no axillary dissection group versus 85 (19%) in the axillary dissection group, and motor neuropathy of any grade (14 [3%)] in the no axillary dissection group vs 40 [9%] in the axillary dissection group). One serious adverse event (postoperative infection and inflamed axilla requiring hospital admission) was attributed to axillary dissection; the event resolved without sequelae.Interpretation The findings of the I BCSG 23-01 trial after a median follow-up of 9.7 years (IQR 7.8-12.7) corroborate those obtained at 5 years and are consistent with those of the 10-year follow-up analysis of the Z0011 trial. Together, these findings support the current practice of not doing an axillary dissection when the tumour burden in the sentinel nodes is minimal or moderate in patients with early breast cancer.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Satellite Images on Topsoil Attribute Quantification and the Relationship with Soil Classes and Geology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The mapping of soil attributes provides support to agricultural planning and land use monitoring, which consequently aids the improvement of soil quality and food production. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images are often used to estimate a given soil attribute (i.e., clay), but have the potential to model many other attributes, providing input for soil mapping applications. In this paper, we aim to evaluate a Bare Soil Composite Image (BSCI) from the state of SAo Paulo, Brazil, calculated from a multi-temporal dataset, and study its relationship with topsoil properties, such as soil class and geology. The method presented detects bare soil in satellite images in a time series of 16 years, based on Landsat 5 TM observations. The compilation derived a BSCI for the agricultural sites (242,000 hectare area) characterized by very complex geology. Soil properties were analyzed to calibrate prediction models using 740 soil samples (0-20 cm) collected of the area. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on the BSCI spectral dataset was performed to quantify soil attributes. The method identified that a single image represents 7 to 20% of bare soil while the compilation of the multi-temporal dataset increases to 53%. Clay content had the best soil attribute prediction estimates (R-2 = 0.75, root mean square error (RMSE) = 89.84 g kg(-1), and accuracy = 74%). Soil organic matter, cation exchange capacity and sandy soils also achieved moderate predictions. The BSCI demonstrates a strong relationship with legacy geological maps detecting variations in soils. From a single composite image, it was possible to use spectroscopy to evaluate several environmental parameters. This technique could greatly improve soil mapping and consequently aid several applications, such as land use planning, environmental monitoring, and prevention of land degradation, updating legacy surveys and digital soil mapping.

TI  - Mapping three-dimensional co-seismic surface deformations associated with the 2015 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>7.2 Murghab earthquake based on InSAR and characteristics of crustal strain
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional (3D) co-seismic surface deformations are of great importance to interpret the characteristics of co-seismic deformations and to understand the geometries and dynamics of seismogenic faults. In this paper, we propose a method for mapping 3D co-seismic deformations based on InSAR observations and crustal strain characteristics. In addition, the search strategy of correlation points is optimized by adaptive correlation distance, which greatly improves the applicability of the proposed method in restoring deformations in decorrelation areas. Results of the simulation experiment reveal that the proposed method is superior to conventional methods in both the accuracy and completeness. The proposed method is then applied to map the 3D co-seismic surface deformations associated with the 2015 M(w)7.2 Murghab earthquake using ascending and descending ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 images. The results show that the seismogenic fault is the Sarez-Karakul fault (SKF), which is dominated by NE-SW strike slips with an almost vertical dip angle. The north section and the south segment near the epicentre have obvious subsidence along with a southwestward motion in the northwest wall, and the southeast wall has northeast movement and surface uplift trend along the fault zone. The strain field of the earthquake is also obtained by the proposed method. It is found that the crustal block of the seismic area is obviously affected by dilatation and shear forces, which is in good agreement with the movement character of the sinistral slip.

TI  - Assessing and monitoring the human influence on water quality in response to land transformation within Wular environs of Kashmir Valley
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wular Lake is the largest freshwater lake of India located in north western Himalayas of Kashmir Valley which has got deteriorated over the period of time due to the enough human interference within its catchment areas. The purpose of the present research study is to identify the changes in land use and land cover in the Wular catchment as well as its transformation into other classes and its impact on the overall water quality of the lake. For the present study Landsat (TM) image of 1992 and Landsat-8 (OLI) of 2015 have been used for assessing the changes in land use/land cover. Supervised classification technique was used to generate LULC maps of different categories pertaining to study area for years 1992 and 2015. Regarding water quality, water samples were collected from five different spots of the lake in four different seasons of the yearfrom December 2014 to September 2015. The sites from which samples were collected are Vintage Park, Ashtungo, Watlab, Makhdomyari and Ningal as site 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. Some parameters of water like temperature, transparency, depth, conductivity and pH were examined on the spot during the sample collection by their respective measuring instruments. The rest of the parameters were examined in hydrological laboratory within 24h after collection following the standard methods of APHA (Standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater, 21st edn. American Public Health Association, Washington, DC, 2005). The relationship between the LULC classes and water quality parameters has been calculated with the help of SHDI which has shown both positive and as well as negative results.

TI  - A topographic mechanism for arcing of dryland vegetation bands
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Banded patterns consisting of alternating bare soil and dense vegetation have been observed in water-limited ecosystems across the globe, often appearing along gently sloped terrain with the stripes aligned transverse to the elevation gradient. In many cases, these vegetation bands are arced, with field observations suggesting a link between the orientation of arcing relative to the grade and the curvature of the underlying terrain. We modify the water transport in the Klausmeier model of water-biomass interactions, originally posed on a uniform hillslope, to qualitatively capture the influence of terrain curvature on the vegetation patterns. Numerical simulations of this modified model indicate that the vegetation bands arc convex-downslope when growing on top of a ridge, and convex-upslope when growing in a valley. This behaviour is consistent with observations from remote sensing data that we present here. Model simulations show further that whether bands grow on ridges, valleys or both depends on the precipitation level. A survey of three banded vegetation sites, each with a different aridity level, indicates qualitatively similar behaviour.

TI  - Scheme for Characterizing Clutter Statistics in SAR Amplitude Images by Combining Two Parametric Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the statistical properties of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude data is essential for the processing and interpretation of SAR images. During the last few decades, parametric models have been extensively investigated for use in characterizing the statistics of SAR amplitude data. Among them, the generalized gamma distribution (G Gamma D) has been widely applied in many fields of SAR image processing, as it has been demonstrated to be appropriate for describing the statistical behaviors of both SAR land and sea clutter. However, the G Gamma D is not effective when the third-order sample log-cumulant of SAR data is close to zero as it cannot match the distribution of actual data. In this case, the recently proposed G(AO) model shows good performance for fitting the distribution of the actual SAR data. In this paper, we theoretically derive the analytical conditions of the G(AO) model applicability. Based on the derivations, a scheme describing the statistical behaviors of SAR pixel amplitudes is given by combining the G Gamma D and the G(AO) model. Experiments performed on C-band RADARSAT-2 and L-band ALOS-PALSAR SAR data verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The usefulness of the G(AO) model for extremely heterogeneous land clutter, for example, from urban regions, is also demonstrated.

TI  - <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> infection in raptors from Italy: Seroepidemiology and risk factors analysis
T2  - COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite infecting a wide range of intermediate hosts, including birds. Nevertheless, scant information on the spread of infection in wild bird populations is available to date. With the aim of updating information on T. gondii infection in birds of prey and possible risk factors associated with the infection, a serosurvey was planned on both wild and captive raptors. An overall of 93 raptors from Northern Italy were tested for the presence of anti-T. gondii antibodies with a commercial modified agglutination test (MAT). A T. gondii prevalence of 10.7% was recorded; the highest seroprevalence was observed within the Family Strigidae (12.5%). Only wild animals tested positive; any statistical difference among species, taxonomic family, age, origin, use, migratory behavior and diet composition was not highlighted. Toxoplasmosis in birds of prey, sentinel species for the environmental spread of T. gondii, should always be considered within sanitary programs devoted to avian species protection.

TI  - Spaceborne Staring Spotlight SAR Tomography-A First Demonstration With TerraSAR-X
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the objective of exploiting hardware capabilities and preparing the ground for the next-generation X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X are now able to operate in staring spotlight mode, which is characterized by an increased azimuth resolution of approximately 0.24 m compared with 1.1 m of the conventional sliding spotlight mode. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time its potential for SAR tomography (TomoSAR). To this end, we tailored our interferometric and tomographic processors for the distinctive features of the staring spotlight mode, which will be analyzed accordingly. By means of its higher spatial resolution, the staring spotlight mode will not only lead to a denser point cloud but also to more accurate height estimates due to the higher signal-to-clutter ratio. As a result of a first comparison between sliding and staring spotlight TomoSAR, first, the density of the staring spotlight point cloud is approximately 5.1-5.5 times as high; and, second, the relative height accuracy of the staring spotlight point cloud is approximately 1.7 times as high.

It comprises tectonic slices of ophiolite rocks including mylonitic gabbros, meta-ultramafic rocks, metabasalts, and elastic rock in a matrix of turbidites, and the melange contains blocks of schists, gneiss, and marble. In this study, multispectral data Sentinel-2A and ASTER were employed to discriminate lithological units in the unvegetated arid region. Several image enhancement algorithms, including Band Ratio (BR), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were applied to the data for lithological mapping. A specialized band ratio, (Sentinel-2A band 3+ASTER band 9)/(Sentinel-2A band 12+ASTER band 8), combining ASTER and Sentinel-2A data was designed to distinguish serpentine minerals in the ophiolite complex. Color composites of principal components (PCs) of ASTER and Sentinel-2A data were utilized to differentiate rock units within the ophiolite complex. It was found that the color composites of PCs of Sentinel-2A have higher color contrast and saturation than ASTER, enabling to better visually interpret the ophiolite rock units and provide a more detailed geological map of the study area. The SVM classification results of the original and MNF versions of the ASTER data indicate that the image processing methods such as MNF could highlight specific rock units and improve classification accuracy. In addition, with the comparison between MNF images for lithological classification of Sentinel-2A and ASTER data, it was demonstrated that Sentinel-2A data outperformed ASTER in lithological mapping in the Shibanjing ophiolite complex.

TI  - Monitoring ecosystem degradation using spatial data and the R package spatialwarnings
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Some ecosystems show nonlinear responses to gradual changes in environmental conditions, once a threshold in conditions-or critical point-is passed. This can lead to wide shifts in ecosystem states, possibly with dramatic ecological and economic consequences. Such behaviours have been reported in drylands, savannas, coral reefs or shallow lakes for example. Important research effort of the last decade has been devoted to identifying indicators that would help anticipate such ecosystem shifts and avoid their negative consequences.2. Theoretical and empirical research has shown that, as an ecosystem approaches a critical point, specific signatures arise in its temporal and spatial dynamics; these changes can be quantified using relatively simple statistical metrics that have been referred to as "early warning signals" (EWS) in the literature. Although tests of those EWS on experiments are promising, empirical evidence from out-of-laboratory datasets is still scarce, in particular for spatial EWS. The recent proliferation of remote-sensing data provides an opportunity to improve this situation and evaluate the reliability of spatial EWS in many ecological systems.3. Here, we present a step-by-step workflow along with code to compute spatial EWS from raster data such as aerial images, test their significance compared to permutation-based null models, and display their trends, either at different time steps or along environmental gradients. We created the R-package spatial-warnings (MIT license) to help achieve all these steps in a reliable and reproducible way, and thereby promote the application of spatial EWS to empirical data.4. This software package and associated documentation provides an easy entry point for researchers and managers into spatial EWS-based analyses. By facilitating a broader application, it will leverage the evaluation of spatial EWS on real data, and eventually contribute to providing tools to map ecosystems' fragility to perturbations and inform management decisions.

TI  - Mapping tidal channel dynamics in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh, between 1974 and 2017, and implications for the sustainability of the Sundarbans mangrove forest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the spatial and temporal dynamics of tidal channels in the Bangladesh Sundarbans. Parts of the Passur River system were considered for this investigation. Tidal channel bank layers were extracted from aerial photographs from 1974 and 2011 and a Sentinel-2 image from 2017. On-screen digitizing of a tidal channel was undertaken to create the tidal channel layers, and special care was taken during digitization to obtain more accurate results. Layers were overlaid together so that the tidal channel position could be seen for each date. Tidal channel positions were highlighted to infer the erosion/accretion sectors along the channel, and the tidal channel dynamics were calculated. Remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS) platforms were used to analyse, interpret and visualize data on accretion and erosion, as well as the locations of the tidal channel bank over different years. The results revealed that erosion was severe in the larger channels, whereas accretion was dominant in the smaller channels. These erosion and accretion processes played an active role in the displacement of tidal channel banks during the period under investigation. Displacement of the tidal channel bank has had a profound impact on the Sundarbans mangrove ecosystem, and continued erosion and accretion processes are of concern for the future sustainability of biodiversity in the Sundarbans. While in the short term, these changes may not have much impact; over decades, the dynamics of tidal channels may significantly contribute to the imbalance of fauna and flora in the Sundarbans.

TI  - Sentinel node mapping in vulvar carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Vulvar cancer typically spreads through the inguinofemoral lymph nodes and traditionally en bloc resection of these nodes is performed as their status is an important prognostic factor. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping in vulvar carcinoma directs the surgeon to the first draining node from the tumour. Hypothesis of sentinel node(SLN) biopsy is that, if these nodes are negative for malignancy, the remaining regional lymph nodes will also be negative. This technique spares SLN-negative women the morbidity of unnecessary regional lymphadenectomy.

TI  - A mid-late Holocene tidally-influenced drainage system revealed by integrated remote sensing, sedimentological and stratigraphic data
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing employment of Remote Sensing (RS) techniques in paleoenvironmental studies, the strati graphic interpretation of RS-derived paleodrainage traces is still an open issue, as their relation to subsurface is largely unexplored. Here we applied a multi-data analysis approach, including publicly available optical images from different satellites (Landsat, ASTER, Sentinel, Hyperion), LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model (DTM), soil reflectance spectra and facies core data, which succeeded in revealing a paleodrainage system buried beneath a 200-sq km wide wetland (the Mezzano Lowland-ML) of the Po coastal plain (northern Adriatic Sea, Italy). Data integration in a GIS environment allowed the 3D mapping of numerous and temporally persistent meandering traces. From distal to proximal locations, the RS-derived traces show a hierarchical organization, in terms of sinuosity and width, and form a dense and dendritic pattern typical of a tidally-influenced system. Surface and subsurface cross-investigation of two meandering traces through soil reflectance spectra and core stratigraphy reveal that these landforms represent the surface expression of buried channels that eroded the underlying lagoonal succession, with lateral transition to intertidal deposits. LiDAR-detected micro-morphologies related to paleomeanders evolution strongly influenced the spatial distribution of mid-late Holocene peat-bearing lithofacies (i.e., salt marsh and swamp), and hence soil moisture distribution, inducing the sharp radiance contrasts (traces) detected by satellite sensors on the surface. On-trace areas invariably lack peat deposits and record the top of 3-4 m-thick channel-fill sands, some 2-4 m below the ground level. In contrast, out-of-trace areas are characterized by organic-rich soils that cap a 2.5-3.5 m-thick succession of intertidal-supratidal peat deposits, accumulated in depressed areas lateral to the channel-levee complex. We conclude that in the early stage of Po Delta construction, between ca. 6000-2500 cal yr BP, two distinct tidal-influenced drainage networks fed the Mezzano Lowland lagoon under a predominantly autogenic control. These findings indicate the suitability of a low-cost RS-stratigraphic approach to improve the reconstruction of past paleogeographic scenarios buried beneath deltaic lowlands, shedding new light on the evolution trends of coastal landforms, environments and sedimentary patterns under highstand conditions.

TI  - Results from a mobile outreach influenza vaccination program for vulnerable and high-risk populations in a high-income setting: lessons learned
T2  - AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The aim of this pilot project was to assess the feasibility of an outreach mobile influenza vaccination program led by a large hospital network targeting high-risk and vulnerable populations in a high-income setting. Methods: Key populations were identified and stakeholders with established access to these populations were engaged. A mobile, nurse-led immunisation service attended sites where these populations attend and offered influenza vaccine. Data was collected on risk factors for severe disease and past vaccination history. Vaccine type and date of administration were entered onto the Australian Immunisation Registry. Results: Sixteen sites were visited, and 520 influenza vaccines were administered. Of those receiving the vaccine, 61% had received it previously, but only 39% in the past 12 months. A total of 232/520 participants (45%) self-reported a risk factor for severe disease. Conclusions: Appropriate identification of vulnerable populations, with good engagement of key stakeholders, can successfully deliver vaccines to sections of the population who may struggle to engage with healthcare services even when they are freely available. Implications for public health: Taking vaccines to vulnerable populations is well received and remains an important strategy to maximise uptake, even within high-income settings with universal access to healthcare.

TI  - Unmixing Polarimetric Radar Images Based on Land Cover Type Identified by Higher Resolution Optical Data Before Target Decomposition: Application to Forest and Bare Soil
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting information from a polarimetric radar representation usually consists in decomposing it with target decomposition algorithms. This first step can be seen as a geometric analysis of the polarimetric information: the identification of physical radar scattering mechanisms. The problem is that average physical parameters are estimated. As a consequence, these parameters might not describe correctly any of the land cover types that can be mixed together into the radar resolution cell. Therefore, using the polarimetric parameters for land cover classification is challenging. The novelty of the method is to propose a thematic analysis of the polarimetric information preceding the geometric one. The objective is to assess if splitting off polarimetric information on a land cover type basis before applying usual target decomposition algorithms can produce more consistent radar scattering mechanisms when land cover classes are mixed inside the radar resolution cell. A cooperative fusion framework in which very high-resolution optical images are used to unmix physical radar scattering mechanisms is proposed. For bare soil and forests, we point out that a linear unmixing model applied to the covariance matrix is able to split off polarimetric information on a land cover type basis. The assessment of the unmixed radar matrices is carried out with polarimetric radar images from the Radarsat-2 satellite. It was found that despite speckle, the reconstructed radar information after the unmixing process is statistically relevant with the observations. The question whether the unmixed radar images contain relevant thematic information is more challenging, but results tend to validate this property. This method could be used to have a better estimation of vegetation biomass in the context of open forested areas.

TI  - Detecting Areas Vulnerable to Sand Encroachment Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques in Nouakchott, Mauritania
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand dune advances poses a major threat to inhabitants and local authorities in the area of Nouakchott, Mauritania. Despite efforts to control dune mobility, accurate and adequate local studies are still needed to tackle sand encroachment. We have developed a Sand Dune Encroachment Vulnerability Index (SDEVI) to assess Nouakchott's vulnerability to sand dune encroachment. Said index is based on the geo-physical characteristics of the area (wind direction and intensity, slope and surface height, land use, vegetation or soil properties) with Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques that can support local authorities and decision-makers in implementing preventive measures or reducing impact on the population and urban infrastructures. In order to validate this new index, we use two remote sensing approaches: optical-Sentinel 2 and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-Sentinel 1 data. Results show that the greatest vulnerability is located in the north-eastern part of Nouakchott, where local conditions favor the advance of sand in the city, although medium to high values are also found in the eastern part. Optical images enabled us to distinguish desert sand using the ratio between near infrared/blue bands, and SAR Coherence Change Detection (CCD) imagery was used to assess the degree of stability of those sand bodies. The nature of the SDEVI index allows us to currently assess which areas are vulnerable to sand encroachment since we use long data records. Nevertheless, optical and SAR remote sensing allow sand evolution to be monitored on a near real-time basis.

TI  - Vegetation Phenology Driving Error Variation in Digital Aerial Photogrammetrically Derived Terrain Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have emerged as synergistic technologies capable of enhancing forest inventory information. A known limitation of DAP technology is its ability to derive terrain surfaces in areas with moderate to high vegetation coverage. In this study, we sought to investigate the influence of flight acquisition timing on the accuracy and coverage of digital terrain models (DTM) in a low cover forest area in New Brunswick, Canada. To do so, a multi-temporal UAS-acquired DAP data set was used. Acquired imagery was photogrammetrically processed to produce high quality DAP point clouds, from which DTMs were derived. Individual DTMs were evaluated for error using an airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived DTM as a reference. Unobstructed road areas were used to validate DAP DTM error. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) were generated to assess the significance of acquisition timing on mean vegetation cover, DTM error, and proportional DAP coverage. GAMM models for mean vegetation cover and DTM error were found to be significantly influenced by acquisition date. A best available terrain pixel (BATP) compositing exercise was conducted to generate a best possible UAS DAP-derived DTM and outline the importance of flight acquisition timing. The BATP DTM yielded a mean error of -0.01 m. This study helps to show that the timing of DAP acquisitions can influence the accuracy and coverage of DTMs in low cover vegetation areas. These findings provide insight to improve future data set quality and provide a means for managers to cost-effectively derive high accuracy terrain models post-management activity.

TI  - P-spline smoothing for spatial data collected worldwide
T2  - SPATIAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial data collected worldwide from a huge number of locations is frequently used in environmental and climate studies. Spatial modelling for this type of data presents both methodological and computational challenges. In this work we illustrate a computationally efficient non-parametric framework in order to model and estimate the spatial field while accounting for geodesic distances between locations. The spatial field is modelled via penalized splines (P-splines) using intrinsic Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) priors for the spline coefficients. The key idea is to use the sphere as a surrogate for the Globe, then build the basis of B-spline functions on a geodesic grid system. The basis matrix is sparse as is the precision matrix of the GMRF prior, thus computational efficiency is gained by construction. We illustrate the approach with a real climate study, where the goal is to identify the Intertropical Convergence Zone using high-resolution remote sensing data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Google search patterns monitoring the daily health impact of heatwaves in England: How do the findings compare to established syndromic surveillance systems from 2013 to 2017?
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the implications of climate change is a predicted increase in frequent and severe heatwaves. The impact of heatwaves on the health of the population is captured through real-time syndromic healthcare surveillance systems monitored daily in England during the summer months. Internet search data could potentially provide improved timeliness and help to assess the wider population health impact of heat by capturing a population sub-group who are symptomatic but do not seek healthcare. A retrospective observational study was carried out from June 2013 to September 2017 in England to compare daily trends in validated syndromic surveillance heat related morbidity indicators against symptom-based heatwave related Google search terms. The degree of correlation was determined with Spearman correlation coefficients and lag assessment was carried out to determine timeliness. Daily increases in frequency in Google search terms during heatwave events correlated well with validated syndromic indicators. Correlation coefficients between search term frequency and syndromic indicators from 2013 to 2017 were highest with the telehealth service NHS 111 (range of 0.684-0.900 by search term). Lag analysis revealed a similar timeliness between the data sources, suggesting Google data did not provide a delayed or earlier signal in the context of England's syndromic surveillance systems. This work highlights the potential benefits for countries which lack established public health surveillance systems to monitor heat-related morbidity and the use of internet search data to assess the wider population health impact of exposure to heat.

TI  - Conservative Management of Positive Axilla After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy-The Need for, and Review of, Techniques Used for Lymph Node Localization
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Involvement of axillary lymph nodes is an important prognostic factor in relationship to the management of breast cancer. However, the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy is widespread in the treatment of positive axilla and such treatment leads to downstaging of axillary disease. Hence, the role of targeted axillary lymph node biopsy appears to play a vital role after primary systemic therapy. Given that this is a relatively novel approach, we have discussed the evidence for this approach and the different techniques currently available for localization of biopsy-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes. We have also highlighted the need for universal guidelines for conservative management of positive axilla after systemic therapy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Evaluation of an ad hoc paper-based syndromic surveillance system in Ibaraki evacuation centres following the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Outbreaks of infectious diseases can occur after natural disasters as vital services are disrupted and populations move into evacuation centres. National notifiable disease surveillance may be inadequate in these situations because of resource-consuming disease confirmation or system interruptions. Although syndromic surveillance has been used as an alternative in post-disaster situations, no systematic evaluations of it have been published. We evaluated the ad hoc paper-based syndromic surveillance system implemented in evacuation centres in Ibaraki prefecture after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We assessed the simplicity, acceptability, data quality, timeliness and portability of this system and reviewed its usefulness. We concluded that the system was simple, acceptable, portable and useful. The documentation and monitoring of disease events and trends were useful for developing interventions in evacuation centres and have since been used to improve post-disaster infectious disease and surveillance knowledge in Japan. We believe timeliness was a challenge due to the chain of data transmission and communication passing through an intermediary. Future implementations of this system could consider a more direct chain of data transmission and communication from collectors to analysers. Too few key informant interviewees and the inability to obtain original paper-based data from evacuation centres limited our findings; we conducted this evaluation four years after the response occurred. Future evaluations should be completed closer to when operations cease. The usefulness of the system suggests adopting it in future disasters. A simple, plain-language manual should be developed to improve future employment.

TI  - Reconstructing long term annual deforestation dynamics in Para and Mato Grosso using the Landsat archive
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based monitoring of deforestation in the tropics is crucial to better understand global land use change and related changes in ecosystem service provision and to inform governments and civil society on the effectiveness their forest protection policies. In Brazil, deforestation has been closely coupled to the expansion of grazing and cropping systems primarily in the tropical forest, but no spatially explicit high resolution database on deforestation exists that captures tropical forest clearing prior to 2000. The open Landsat archive provides > 45 years of imagery and is well suited for wall-to-wall assessments of historic deforestation dynamics which are valuable to policy development and environmental impact assessments. Image analysis procedures for reconstructing long-term deforestation dynamics over large areas need to cope with regions and time periods for which the archive contains heterogeneous data densities on a yearly and decadal basis. We create for the first time yearly 30 m maps of long term, annual deforestation dynamics (LTAD) covering the period from 1984 to 2014 for Path and Mato Grosso, two Brazilian federal states that cover much of the Brazilian arc-of-deforestation. Our results provide valuable insights into historic deforestation trends, with annually increasing deforestation from 1990 to 1999 for both Para and Mato Grosso. Peak deforestation occurred in 2004 after which deforestation leveled off - with a more pronounced decrease in Mato Grosso than in Path. Contrary to Mato Grosso, Para again experienced increasing annual forest clearing in recent years. For the time period after 2000, we provide an indepth comparison with two widely used products, the Brazilian PRODES and the Global Forest Change maps (GFC, Hansen et al., 2013). Our deforestation estimates (407,000 +/- 42,000 km(2) at 95% confidence level) are above those provided by PRODES, while GFC results are closer to our estimates for the comparison period. Recent PRODES estimates are consistently below our and the GFC results. Overall, our results exemplify the potential of open image archives for multi-decadal, wall-to-wall and fine grain reconstruction of forest change. The presented approach prototypes similar assessments of tropical forest dynamics globally faced with issues of data scarcity.

TI  - Crop Classification Based on Differential Characteristics of <i>H</i>/α Scattering Parameters for Multitemporal Quad- and Dual-Polarization SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-type classification is one of the most significant applications in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) imagery. As a remote sensing technique, PolSAR has been proved to have the ability to provide high-resolution information of illustrated objects. However, single-temporal PolSAR data are restricted to provide sufficient information for crop identification due to the complicated condition of varying morphology within various growing stages. With an increasing number of spaceborne PolSAR systems launched, a large amount of real PolSAR data are being generated and used to provide great opportunities for multitemporal analysis. The main contribution of this paper is to improve crop classification accuracy with various features of classical H/alpha parameters. First, in order to deal with dual-PolSAR data, H/alpha decomposition algorithm for quad-PolSAR is modified to suit to the case of dual polarization. Second, according to the differential scattering characteristics of main crops, a new parameter is innovatively defined to measure the differential characteristics in the H/alpha classification plane. Third, crop types are discriminated by applying a supervised classification method with the newly defined parameter. Furthermore, the correctness of the parameter is verified with simulated and real Sentinel-1 data as well as AirSAR data. Finally, the performances of the classification method are investigated by the comparison with complex Wishart, Freeman-Wishart, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Hence, the experimental results show that the proposed method and SVM classifier with the newly defined parameter have the ability to improve crop classification accuracy.

TI  - Uncertainty and Variation of Remotely Sensed Lake Ice Phenology across the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Tibetan Plateau (TP), the changes of lake ice phenology not only reflect regional climate change, but also impose substantial ecohydrological impacts on the local environment. Due to the limitation of ground observation, remote sensing has been used as an alternative tool to investigate recent changes of lake ice phenology. However, uncertainties exist in the remotely sensed lake ice phenology owing to both the data and methods used. In this paper, three different remotely sensed datasets are used to investigate the lake ice phenology variation in the past decade across the Tibetan Plateau, with the consideration of the underlying uncertainties. The remotely sensed data used include reflectance data, snow product, and land surface temperature (LST) data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). The uncertainties of the three methods based on the corresponding data are assessed using the triple collocation approach. Comparatively, it is found that the method based on reflectance data outperforms the other two methods. The three methods are more consistent in determining the thawing dates rather than the freezing dates of lake ice. It is consistently shown by the three methods that the ice-covering duration in the northern part of the TP lasts longer than that in the south. Though there is no general trend of lake ice phenology across the TP for the period of 2000-2015, the warmer climate and stronger wind have led to the earlier break-up of lake ice.

T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To study of the infrared signature of an aerial target, it is required to precisely model the background radiation. Simple empirical models or standard atmospheric models in LOWTRAN/MODTRAN were used in earlier studies. To further precisely model the thermal radiation of earth's surface and atmospheric radiance/transmittance, the atmospheric profile, land surface temperature, and emissivity, the sea surface temperature retrieved from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, and the sea surface emissivity model developed by Wu and Smith are utilized in this study. Meanwhile, considering that the reflection of background radiation incident from different directions in each spectral wavelength can be calculated in parallel, implementations using open multi-processing and compute unified device architecture on a multi-core CPU and many-core graphics processing unit (GPU) are presented and speedups of 9are obtained on a platform with dual Xeon E5-2652 CPU and an NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU card, respectively.

TI  - Predicting Post Neoadjuvant Axillary Response Using a Novel Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the postneoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) setting, conventional radiographic complete response (rCR) is a poor predictor of pathologic complete response (pCR) of the axilla. We developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm to better predict post-NAC axillary response using a breast MRI dataset.An institutional review board-approved retrospective study from January 2009 to June 2016 identified 127 breast cancer patients who: (1) underwent breast MRI before the initiation of NAC; (2) successfully completed Adriamycin/Taxane-based NAC; and (3) underwent surgery, including sentinel lymph node evaluation/axillary lymph node dissection with final surgical pathology data. Patients were classified into pathologic complete response (pCR) of the axilla group and non-pCR group based on surgical pathology. Breast MRI performed before NAC was used. Tumor was identified on first T1 postcontrast images underwent 3D segmentation. A total of 2811 volumetric slices of 127 tumors were evaluated. CNN consisted of 10 convolutional layers, 4 max-pooling layers. Dropout, augmentation and L2 regularization were implemented to prevent overfitting of data.On final surgical pathology, 38.6% (49/127) of the patients achieved pCR of the axilla (group 1), and 61.4% (78/127) of the patients did not with residual metastasis detected (group 2). For predicting axillary pCR, our CNN algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 83% (95% confidence interval [CI] +/- 5) with sensitivity of 93% (95% CI +/- 6) and specificity of 77% (95% CI +/- 4). Area under the ROC curve (0.93, 95% CI +/- 0.04).It is feasible to use CNN architecture to predict post NAC axillary pCR. Larger data set will likely improve our prediction model.

TI  - Metastatic acral lentiginous melanoma in a tertiary referral center in Switzerland: a systematic analysis
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) is a unique histopathological subtype of melanoma with a poorer prognosis than other cutaneous melanomas. This study aims to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics, metastatic pattern, prognostic factors, response to systemic therapy, and overall survival (OS) of ALM in a White population. This is a retrospective study of patients who were diagnosed and/or treated for ALM at the Department of Dermatology of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, from January 2005 to December 2015. Overall, 172 patients with histologically confirmed ALM were included in the study. In univariate Cox regression, Breslow thickness (P<0.001), age (P=0.003), status of sentinel lymph node (P=0.005), and ulceration (P=0.008) were identified as significant prognostic factors for OS in ALM. In multivariate analysis, only Breslow thickness (P=0.0003) showed statistical significance. The median OS (mOS) was 155.7 months in the entire cohort (n=172) and 11.2 months for stage IV patients (n=36), irrespective of treatment. When first treatment was considered (n=35), mOS for stage IV patients was 8.9, 16.6, 21.7, and 3.7 months, for patients who had received chemotherapy (ChT) (n=17), immunotherapy (n=9), targeted therapy (TT) (n=3), and no therapy (n=6), respectively. The overall response rate was 44% (7/16 patients) to ChT, 100% to TT (3/3), and 25% to ipilimumab (2/8). In our study, Breslow thickness represents the best prognostic factor for OS. In stage IV ALM patients treated with either immunotherapy or TT, there is a trend for extended mOS compared with ChT.

TI  - Use of remote sensing to analyse peatland changes after drainage for peat extraction
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale peat extraction, in Finland and elsewhere, typically takes place on rather small extraction sites but has major impacts on surrounding aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The environmental conditions prior to drainage (baseline conditions) must be quantified in a statutory environmental impact assessment (EIA), but this is generally difficult due to lack of historical data. In this study, we developed and tested a method for EIA based on a reference area approach and remote sensing. The method calculates the normalized difference vegetation index in preextraction and postextraction periods using Landsat images of affected areas and reference surrounding areas. In a case study, we applied the method to assess changes after peat extraction at a site in northern Finland. The peat extraction area showed significant transformation from peatland vegetation to bare soil. Adjacent areas downstream and upstream were also affected by extraction. These results indicate that our method is a useful tool for EIA of peatland drainage.

TI  - Analyzing spatiotemporal land use/cover dynamic using remote sensing imagery and GIS techniques case: Kan basin of Iran
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LU/LC) that are significant elements for the interconnection of human activities and environment monitoring can be useful to find out the deviations of saving a maintainable environment. Remote sensing is a very useful tool for the affair of land use or land cover monitoring, which can be helpful to decide the allocation of land use and land cover. Supervised classification-maximum likelihood algorithm in GIS was applied in this study to detect land use/land cover changes observed in Kan basin using multispectral satellite data obtained from Landsat 5 (TM) and 8 (OLI) for the years 2000 and 2016, respectively. The main aim of this study was to gain a quantitative understanding of land use and land cover changes in Kan basin of Tehran over the period 2000-2016. For this purpose, firstly supervised classification technique was applied to Landsat images acquired in 2000 and 2016. The Kan basin was classified into five major LU/LC classes including: Built up areas, garden, pasture, water and bare-land. Change detection analysis was performed to compare the quantities of land cover class conversions between time intervals. The results revealed both increase and decrease of the different LU/LC classes from 2000 to 2016. The results indicate that during the study period, built-up land, and pastures have increased by 0.2% (76.4km(2)) and 0.3% (86.03km(2)) while water, garden and bare land have decreased by 0, 0.01% (3.62km(2)) and 0.4% (117.168km(2)), respectively. Information obtained from change detection of LU/LC can aid in providing optimal solutions for the selection, planning, implementation and monitoring of development schemes to meet the increasing demands of human needs in land management.

TI  - Predicting Land Use/Land Cover Changes Using a CA-Markov Model under Two Different Scenarios
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal Landsat images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) acquired in 1993, 1998, 2003 and 2008 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) from 2017, are used for analysing and predicting the spatio-temporal distributions of land use/land cover (LULC) categories in the Halgurd-Sakran Core Zone (HSCZ) of the National Park in the Kurdistan region of Iraq. The aim of this article was to explore the LULC dynamics in the HSCZ to assess where LULC changes are expected to occur under two different business-as-usual (BAU) assumptions. Two scenarios have been assumed in the present study. The first scenario, addresses the BAU assumption to show what would happen if the past trend in 1993-1998-2003 has continued until 2023 under continuing the United Nations (UN) sanctions against Iraq and particularly Kurdistan region, which extended from 1990 to 2003. Whereas, the second scenario represents the BAU assumption to show what would happen if the past trend in 2003-2008-2017 has to continue until 2023, viz. after the end of UN sanctions. Future land use changes are simulated to the year 2023 using a Cellular Automata (CA)-Markov chain model under two different scenarios (Iraq under siege and Iraq after siege). Four LULC classes were classified from Landsat using Random Forest (RF). Their accuracy was evaluated using kappa and overall accuracy. The CA-Markov chain method in TerrSet is applied based on the past trends of the land use changes from 1993 to 1998 for the first scenario and from 2003 to 2008 for the second scenario. Based on this model, predicted land use maps for the 2023 are generated. Changes between two BAU scenarios under two different conditions have been quantitatively as well as spatially analysed. Overall, the results suggest a trend towards stable and homogeneous areas in the next 6 years as shown in the second scenario. This situation will have positive implication on the park.

TI  - A Mixed Property-Based Automatic Shadow Detection Approach for VHR Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Shadows in very high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images hinder many applications, such as change detection, target recognition, and image classification. Though a wide variety of significant research has explored shadow detection, shadow pixels are still more or less omitted and are wrongly confused with vegetation pixels in some cases. In this study, to further manage the problems of shadow omission and vegetation misclassification, a mixed property-based shadow index is developed for detecting shadows in very high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images based on the difference of the hue component and the intensity component between shadows and nonshadows, and the difference of the reflectivity of the red band and the near infrared band between shadows and vegetation cover in nonshadows. Then, the final shadow mask is achieved, with an optimal threshold automatically obtained from the index image histogram. To validate the effectiveness of our approach for shadow detection, three test images are selected from the multispectral WorldView-3 images of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and are tested with our method. When compared with other investigated standard shadow detection methods, the resulting images produced by our method deliver a higher average overall accuracy (95.02%) and a better visual sense. The highly accurate data show the efficacy and stability of the proposed approach in appropriately detecting shadows and correctly classifying shadow pixels against the vegetation pixels for very high-resolution multispectral remote sensing images.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Horizontal and Vertical Urban Expansion Using Multi-Spatial Resolution Data: A Case Study of Surabaya, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization addresses urban expansion, and it leads conversion of the green space into the built-up area. However, previous studies mainly focused on two-dimensional (2D) urban expansion rather than three-dimensional (3D) growth. Here, the purpose of this study is to examine the urban expansion, including built-up and green space for both horizontal and vertical dimensions using geospatial analysis including remote sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) in the sub-Central Business District (CBD) area of Surabaya, Indonesia. The medium resolution remote sensing data for both image and Digital Surface Model (DSM) acquired by Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) were applied for time-1 (2010). The orthophoto and DSM derived by LiDAR were used for time-2 (2016). We quantified the built-up and green expansions in 2D (area), which were extracted from land use/land cover (LU/LC) by applying hybrid classification. The built-up and green expansions in 3D (volume) were estimated by generating a surface feature model. The spatial configuration of area expansion was investigated using patch metric, while the volume growth was examined using the volume expansion rate. We got three findings. (1) The built-up and green area had expanded about 11.54% and 95.61%, respectively, from 2010 to 2016. The expansion of green area presented in a notable portion, which was mainly contributed by the conversion of bareland to playground or park. However, the expansion of built-up area was less than the volume expansion of 20.6%. It revealed that built-up growth led to vertical rather than horizontal development. (2) The built-up area expansion tended to scatter configuration, whereas, the green area expansion tended to aggregate in a linear pattern. (3) The ratio of built-up volume expansion to green volume expansion showed a mean of 3.7, indicating that the development of built-up and green volume was imbalanced. The built-up growth presented higher than the green growth, mainly in the areas with more vertical building establishment. The pressing need for higher green volume in the study area was identified in several sites located at surrounding artery and toll roads. Overall, our approach can be applied as a reference in monitoring neighborhood environment through greening programs for sustainable urban development.

Young North Atlantic cheloniids (hard-shelled sea turtles) are closely associated with surface-pelagic drift communities (SPDCs), which are dominated by macroalgae of the genus Sargassum. We quantified SPDCs in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, a region that hosts four species of cheloniids during their surface-pelagic juvenile stage. Landsat satellite imagery was used to identify and measure the areal coverage of SPDCs in the eastern Gulf during 2003-2011 (1323 images). Although the SPDC coverage varied annually, seasonally, and spatially, SPDCs were present year-round, with an estimated mean area of SPDC in each Landsat image of 4.9 km(2) (SD = 10.1). The area of SPDCs observed was inversely proportional to sea-surface wind velocity (Spearman's r = -0.33, p < 0.001). The SPDC coverage was greatest during 2005, 2009, and 2011 and least during 2004 and 2010, but the 2010 analysis was affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which occurred within the study region. In the eastern Gulf, the area of SPDC peaked during June-August of each year. Although the SPDC coverage appeared lower in the eastern Gulf than in other regions of the Gulf and the North Atlantic, surface-pelagic juvenile green, hawksbill, Kemp's ridley, and loggerhead turtles were found to be using this habitat, suggesting that eastern Gulf SPDCs provide developmental habitats that are critical to the recovery of four sea turtle species.

TI  - What drives changes in aerosol properties over the Yangtze River Basin in past four decades ?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the Reform and Opening up in China, aerosols increasingly affect the country's climate change and human health. However, remote sensing studies have been inconclusive as to long-term trends in Chinese aerosol emissions. The newly-released MERRA-2 product provides a long-term (1980 onward) aerosol reanalysis dataset, and thus is used in this study for identifying trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol direct radiative effect (ADRE) in clear sky over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) based on the MK nonparametric method. Results reveal that there is a notable turning point in AOD trends around 2008, i.e., significantly increasing by 0.0201 year(-1) before 2008 and then deceasing by -0.0185 year(-1). The reason may be the decreases of SO2, NOx and soot (dust) emissions from major cities in the YRB since 2006. Likewise, the cooling (warming) effects at the top of atmosphere (TOA), surface (SFC) and atmosphere (ATM) strongly increase by -0.3744 and -0.5652 (0.2935) wm(-2) year(-1) before 2008, and then significantly decrease by 0.2731 and 0.5868 (-0.3145) wm(-2) year(-1). Trend analyses confirm that changes in AOD dominate ADRE trends. Furthermore, AOD is significantly negatively (positively) associated with NDVI and precipitation (GDP and Population density) over most areas of the YRB. Besides, similar spatial trends with AOD are also identified in GDP and NDVI. This indicates that increases in GDP and decreases in NDVI caused by rapid urbanization partly lead to the growth of AOD over the middle and lower reaches of the YRB. However, changes in precipitation and Population density alone may not be the main factors for the increasing AOD.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the optical image simulation from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data using deep learning based methods. Two models, i.e., optical image simulation directly from the SAR data and from multi-temporal SAR-optical data, are proposed to testify the possibilities. The deep learning based methods that we chose to achieve the models are a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a residual architecture and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN). We validate our models using the Sentinel-1 and -2 datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the model with multi-temporal SAR-optical data can successfully simulate the optical image; meanwhile, the state-of-the-art model with simple SAR data as input failed. The optical image simulation results indicate the possibility of SAR-optical information blending for the subsequent applications such as large-scale cloud removal, and optical data temporal super-resolution. We also investigate the sensitivity of the proposed models against the training samples, and reveal possible future directions.

TI  - Coral reef applications of Sentinel-2: Coverage, characteristics, bathymetry and benthic mapping with comparison to Landsat 8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2A and 2B Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) offers a specification of potential value toward a number of objectives in remote sensing of coral reefs. Coral reefs represent a unique challenge for remote sensing, being highly heterogeneous at metre scales and occurring at variable depths and water clarity regimes. However, conservation initiatives, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, add urgency to the need for the large scale environmental monitoring information that remote sensing can provide. In the quest to meet this challenge a range of satellite instruments have been leveraged, from Landsat to high spatial resolution sensors such as WorldView-2, toward objectives such as: mapping of bottom types, bathymetry, change detection, and detection of coral bleaching events. Sentinel-2A and 2B offer a new paradigm of available instruments, with a 5-day revisit, 10m multispectral spatial resolution and freely available data. Pre-launch simulation analyses by several of the authors suggested Sentinel-2 would have good performance for reef applications, in this paper we follow up on this study by reviewing the potential based on the substantial archive of actual data now available.First we determine to what extent the World's reefs are covered by Sentinel-2, since the mission requirements do not by default include all reefs. Secondly we review how a 5-day revisit translates to a usable acquisition rate of clear images, given that cloud and surface glint are common confounding factors. The usable acquisition rate is the real determinant of the objectives to which the data can be applied. Finally we apply current processing algorithms to Sentinel-2 data of several sites over the Great Barrier Reef, including physics-based bathymetry inversion and object-orientated benthic mapping. Landsat 8 OLI is most comparable current sensor to Sentinel-2 MSI, so direct comparisons and the possibilities for data synthesis are explored.Our findings confirm that Sentinel-2 has excellent performance for meeting several essential coral reef scientific and monitoring objectives. Taking into account cloud and sun glint, the usable acquisition rate for a large proportion of reefs is likely to be around 20 clear images a year on average, giving a new potential for evaluation of short time-scale disturbances and impacts. The spatial resolution of 10 m is a key threshold for delineating benthic features of interest such as coral structures, and there is evidence from image and field data that bleaching is detectable. Radiometrically Sentinel-2 data can support good results in physics-based methods, such as bathymetric mapping, comparable to Landsat 8 and WorldView-2. In addition the large scale acquisition area, provided by the 290 km wide swath, offers advantages over high spatial resolution imagery for mapping at multi-reef scales.Sentinel-2 data can be immediately leveraged with existing methods, to provide a new level of reef monitoring information compared to that previously available by remote sensing. Combined with Landsat 8 and the historical Landsat archive, the data collected today will be invaluable for decades or even centuries to come. In this context, the main downside of the Sentinel-2 mission is that approximately 12% of the World's reefs currently lie outside the acquisition plan and are not imaged. Surprisingly, for a European initiative, coral reefs in European governed territories are among the worst served globally. These omissions, approximately only 1/200th of the currently imaged area, limit the global scope which otherwise would be one of Sentinel-2s greatest strengths.

AB  - If the indications of sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection have been the subject of many trials, the indications of radiotherapy, in the absence of axillary lymph node dissection are a matter of debate. We reviewed the available literature on this topic and tried to draw some practical applications. In case of negative result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, patients could be viewed as having pN0 disease and indications of adjuvant radiotherapy based on this paradigm. However, when the result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive and no axillary lymph node dissection performed, indications of adjuvant radiotherapy are not so clear. For example, micrometastases could indicate a nodal irradiation as in the AMAROS trial, or not as in the IBCSG trial. Indications of postmastectomy radiotherapy are also not clearly defined in this setting. In the end, a clinical proposal was designed, emphasizing the unanswered questions.

TI  - Microglia in neurodegeneration
T2  - NATURE NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - The neuroimmune system is involved in development, normal functioning, aging, and injury of the central nervous system. Microglia, first described a century ago, are the main neuroimmune cells and have three essential functions: a sentinel function involved in constant sensing of changes in their environment, a housekeeping function that promotes neuronal well-being and normal operation, and a defense function necessary for responding to such changes and providing neuroprotection. Microglia use a defined armamentarium of genes to perform these tasks. In response to specific stimuli, or with neuroinflammation, microglia also have the capacity to damage and kill neurons. Injury to neurons in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases, as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, results from disruption of the sentinel or housekeeping functions and dysregulation of the defense function and neuroinflammation. Pathways associated with such injury include several sensing and housekeeping pathways, such as the Trem2, Cx3cr1 and progranulin pathways, which act as immune checkpoints to keep the microglial inflammatory response under control, and the scavenger receptor pathways, which promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Peripheral interference from systemic inflammation or the gut microbiome can also alter progression of such injury. Initiation or exacerbation of neurodegeneration results from an imbalance between these microglial functions; correcting such imbalance may be a potential mode for therapy.

TI  - Mapping Crop Residue and Tillage Intensity Using WorldView-3 Satellite Shortwave Infrared Residue Indices
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop residues serve many important functions in agricultural conservation including preserving soil moisture, building soil organic carbon, and preventing erosion. Percent crop residue cover on a field surface reflects the outcome of tillage intensity and crop management practices. Previous studies using proximal hyperspectral remote sensing have demonstrated accurate measurement of percent residue cover using residue indices that characterize cellulose and lignin absorption features found between 2100 nm and 2300 nm in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The 2014 launch of the WorldView-3 (WV3) satellite has now provided a space-borne platform for the collection of narrow band SWIR reflectance imagery capable of measuring these cellulose and lignin absorption features. In this study, WorldView-3 SWIR imagery (14 May 2015) was acquired over farmland on the Eastern Shore of Chesapeake Bay (Maryland, USA), was converted to surface reflectance, and eight different SWIR reflectance indices were calculated. On-farm photographic sampling was used to measure percent residue cover at a total of 174 locations in 10 agricultural fields, ranging from plow-till to continuous no-till management, and these in situ measurements were used to develop percent residue cover prediction models from the SWIR indices using both polynomial and linear least squares regressions. Analysis was limited to agricultural fields with minimal green vegetation (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index < 0.3) due to expected interference of vegetation with the SWIR indices. In the resulting residue prediction models, spectrally narrow residue indices including the Shortwave Infrared Normalized Difference Residue Index (SINDRI) and the Lignin Cellulose Absorption Index (LCA) were determined to be more accurate than spectrally broad Landsat-compatible indices such as the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), as determined by respective R-2 values of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.84 and respective residual mean squared errors (RMSE) of 7.15, 8.40, and 12.00. Additionally, SINDRI and LCA were more resistant to interference from low levels of green vegetation. The model with the highest correlation (2nd order polynomial SINDRI, R-2 = 0.94) was used to convert the SWIR imagery into a map of crop residue cover for non-vegetated agricultural fields throughout the imagery extent, describing the distribution of tillage intensity within the farm landscape. WorldView-3 satellite imagery provides spectrally narrow SWIR reflectance measurements that show utility for a robust mapping of crop residue cover.

TI  - Hydrothermally altered mineral mapping using synthetic application of Sentinel-2A MSI, ASTER and Hyperion data in the Duolong area, Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Duolong area is in a strong potential copper mineralization zone associated with felsic intrusions, and several porphyry copper deposits (PCDs) have been identified. The PCDs are characterized by hydrothermal alteration zones. In this study, Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and Hyperion data are combined to map hydrothermally altered minerals. Three temporal Sentinel-2A MSI images are processed by integrating the Crosta technique and the anomaly-overlaying selection method to map iron oxides and hydroxyl-bearing minerals. These approaches are implemented to omit interference-induced false anomalies. The six shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands of ASTER are used to extract information on Al-OH and Mg-OH group minerals. The distribution of Al-OH minerals in the ASTER image map corresponds to that of hydroxyl-bearing minerals in the MSI image map. A combination of minimum noise fraction (MNF), pixel purity index (PPI), n-dimensional visualizer (n-D Visualizer) and matched filtering (MF) is adopted to process the Hyperion image to obtain accurate hydrothermal alteration mapping results. The overall accuracy for mineral mapping is 92.75% and the kappa coefficient is 0.89. The results of the Hyperion image are spatially consistent with those of the Sentinel-2A MSI and ASTER images. The image processing results were validated by field investigations and spectral reflectance measurements. Hydrothermally altered rocks correspond well with the five PCDs in the Duolong area. Three mineralization prospects associated with felsic intrusions are discovered in accordance with the results. The methodologies and data are effective in detecting porphyry copper mineralization in other arid areas.

TI  - From Remotely-Sensed Data of Norwegian Boreal Forests to Fast and Flexible Models for Estimating Surface Albedo
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance to consider changes in surface albedo and go beyond simple carbon accounting when assessing climate change impacts of forestry and land use activities is increasingly recognized. However, representation of albedo changes in climate models is complex and highly parameterized, thereby limiting their applications in climate impact studies. The availability of simple yet reliable albedo models can enhance consideration of albedo changes in land use studies. We propose a set of simplified models for estimating surface albedo in a boreal forest. We process and harmonize datasets of remotely-sensed albedo estimates, forest structure parameters, and meteorological records for different forest locations in Norway. By combining linear unmixing with nonlinear programming, we simultaneously produce albedo estimates at the same resolution of the land cover dataset (16m, notably higher than satellite retrievals) and a variety of flexible models for albedo predictions. We test different combinations of functional forms, variables, and constraints, including variants specific for snow-free conditions. We find that models capture the seasonal pattern of surface albedo and the interactive effect of forest structures and meteorological parameters, and many of them show good statistical scores. The cross-validation exercise shows that the models derived from one area perform reasonably well when applied to other forested areas in Norway, regardless of the temporal and spatial scales. By incorporating changes in forest structure and climate conditions as explicit variables, these models are simple to be used in different applications aiming at estimating albedo changes from forest management and climate change.Plain Language Summary Surface albedo is the fraction of solar radiation reflected back into the atmosphere by a surface, and it determines how much energy is re-distributed in the biosphere. It is one of the most important physical properties of land cover and a key mechanism for climate control. By combining satellite retrievals of Norwegian boreal forest with high resolution land cover data and meteorological records, our study produces a range of relatively simple models to estimate surface albedo using the forest structure parameters and climate data. The models require simple variables of forest structure information (age and/or volume) and temperature and/or snow water equivalents. These models are relatively easy and fast to be used for quantifying effects of forest management and climate change on surface albedo.

TI  - Assessing Impacts of Urban Form on Landscape Structure of Urban Green Spaces in China Using Landsat Images Based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The structure of urban green spaces (UGS) plays an important role in determining the ecosystem services that they support. Knowledge of factors shaping landscape structure of UGS is imperative for planning and management of UGS. In this study, we assessed the influence of urban form on the structure of UGS in 262 cities in China based on remote sensing data. We produced land cover maps for 262 cities in 2015 using 6673 scenes of Landsat ETM+/OLI images based on the Google Earth Engine platform. We analyzed the impact of urban form on landscape structure of UGS in these cities using boosted regression tree analysis with the landscape and urban form metrics derived from the land cover maps as response and prediction variables, respectively. The results showed that the three urban form metricsperimeter area ratio, road density, and compound terrain complexity indexwere all significantly correlated with selected landscape metrics of UGS. Cities with high road density had less UGS area and the UGS in those cities was more fragmented. Cities with complex built-up boundaries tended to have more fragmented UGS. Cities with high terrain complexity had more UGS but the UGS were more fragmented. Our results for the first time revealed the importance of urban form on shaping landscape structure of UGS in 262 cities at a national scale.

TI  - Study of Typical Arid Crops Classification Based on Machine Learning
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crops classification information is of great significance for arid food security monitoring and ecological management. Adding sensitive waveband and improving classification methods are the major development trends of crops classification. In this paper, we carry out crop classification study based on Sentinel 2A time-series remote sensing data, and establish an object-oriented parcel point set in study area, trying to explore the influence of using different classification features on machine learning classification accuracy. Results indicate as follows; (1) Random forest classifier can effectively integrate the benefits of multidimensional vectors such as spectral or vegetation index, all the accuracy of different groups in this study are above 89%, while the supreme overall accuracy up to 94. 02%. (2) The classification features extraction method, which was supported by object-oriented parcel point set, can resolve the issue of salt-and-pepper noise and fuzzy parcel boundary well. Meanwhile, it also improves the efficiency and accuracy of machine learning classifier, which can be demonstrated by the result that the classification accuracy of spectral group and index group increased by 3. 13% and 4. 07% respectively. (3)Red-edge features can help the classifier to capture the phenological differences and unique growth characteristics of different crops. And the introduction of the red-edge spectrum and red-edge index can improve the classification accuracy by 2. 39% and 1. 63% respectively, while the recognition ability of spring and winter wheat also improved significantly. The result of this study can be referred for the application of the machine learning method and the Sentinel 2A remote sensing data in arid agriculture remote sensing.

TI  - Estimating forest canopy cover dynamics in Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico, using LiDAR and Landsat data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing tree canopy cover has led to increasing wildfire activity in conifer dominated areas of the southwestern United States. Estimating historical changes in the spatial distribution of tree canopy cover can provide further insights into the dynamics of forest and fuel conditions in these landscapes and help prioritize areas for restoration to mitigate wildfire risks and restore biological functioning. In this study, we explored the relationship between LiDAR derived canopy cover data and Landsat reflectance values, and derived a model to estimate percent canopy cover (PCC) on historical Landsat data from 1987 to 2015 for the Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP), located in the southwest Jemez Mountains of New Mexico. We developed a regression model between LiDAR generated canopy cover collected in June 2010 and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) reflectance values (bands 1-7 except band 6) and vegetation indices collected for the same date. About 5% (17,000) of the total LiDAR points (329,102) were used as training points and a separate, non-overlapping set of 17,000 points as test points to validate the regression model. A simple linear model with the red band (band 3; R-2 = 0.70) was selected as the best model to predict PCC in the rest of the images for 1987-2015. In general, we found a strong consistency between the spatial dynamics of modelled tree canopy cover based on historical Landsat data, wildfire events and forest management practices that occurred during the same period. Results showed that about 11% of the study area experienced an increase in PCC for the period of 1987-2015 while 41% of the study area experienced a reduction in PCC during the same time period, mostly in the areas which were affected by stand replacing wildfires in 2011 and 2013. The results indicate an overall increase in medium and high canopy cover classes in specific regions of the study area, which could lead to hazardous wildfires such as those in 2011 and 2013. In the context of ongoing ecological restoration of these montane forests, predicted PCC of contemporary forests could help local managers to identify the areas in the need of immediate restoration efforts by focusing management practices on the areas with closed canopy.

TI  - Health and health service use of very elderly Newfoundlanders
T2  - CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To develop a better understanding of the current health status and health care use of the population of very elderly Newfoundlanders to inform policy makers, decision makers, and health care providers about aspects of the health care system that might be in higher demand in the near future.Design Descriptive analysis using data from the Newfoundland and Labrador component of the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network database for the 2013 calendar year.Setting Newfoundland.Participants A total of 1204 Newfoundlanders aged 80 years and older.Main outcome measures Encounters with family physicians, medications used, hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, laboratory tests, and mortality were described and compared by sex, age, and location (rural vs urban).Results Compared with men, women were prescribed more medications (P = .01), were less likely to be hospitalized (P = .007), were more likely to visit an ED (P = .049), and died less frequently (P = .001). Compared with those aged 90 and older, those aged 80 to 89 made more visits to their family doctors (P = .001) and were prescribed more medications (P = .001). Predictably, those aged 90 and older died more frequently than their younger counterparts did (P = .001). Compared with those in rural communities, urban dwellers were prescribed more medications (P = .031), were hospitalized more often (P = .001), were more likely to visit the ED (P = .002), were more likely to have laboratory tests ordered (P = .001), died more frequently (P = .023), and visited their family physicians more frequently (P = .001).Conclusion Octogenarian women living in urban areas are the subcohort using the most resources. This might be owing to movement of the elderly to urban locations as they age.

TI  - EVALUATION OF DAMAGES CAUSED BY FLOODS, BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGES. CASE STUDY: JIJIA RIVER, SLOBOZIA-DANGENI SECTOR, JULY 2010
T2  - PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aimed to identify flooded areas following the July 2010 floods, using Landsat 7-ETM + satellite imagery and a more efficient way to extract water bodies. By computing several indices, such as MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, AWI, WRI and NDMI, it was concluded that, in the present case, the NDWI index was most effective, the data obtained having a very good accuracy. The studied area was the Jijia River Slobozia-Dangeni sector, the Landsat 7-ETM + images were taken on July 3, 2010. The flow rate at this time at the Dangeni station was 473 cm, decreasing compared to July 1, 2010 when the share reached 579 cm. The flooded area obtained is 15.80 km 2 , the maximum extension of the flood area on July 3, 2010 being approx. 1 km on the localities of Durnesti and Sapoveni. The study found 143 houses in 19 localities flooded. Of the total flooded areas, the largest share is held by arable land (44.58%), with a surface area of 7.04 km(2).

TI  - Quality of life evolution in elderly survivors with localized breast cancer treated with radiotherapy over a three-year follow-up
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This paper studies the Quality of Life (QL) of elderly early-stage breast cancer survivors. The aims are to compare the QL scores of these patients after follow-up with their scores before the start of radiotherapy (RT) and compare QL among different axillary treatment groups.Methods: Of 173 patients over 65 who began treatment and completed the EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23 and the Interview for Deterioration in Daily Living Activities in Dementia (IDDD) before RT, 138 also completed these questionnaires three years after RT.Longitudinal changes in QL were assessed for the whole sample using linear mixed-effect models. Also assessed were differences in QL scores between axillary treatment groups (axillary node dissection ALND, sentinel lymph node biopsy SLNB, and no surgery) at the end of the follow-up (Anova or Kruskal-Wallis) and differences in the evolution of QL from baseline among these groups (linear regression models).Results: QL scores in the follow-up were high (>70/100 points) in most QL areas, with moderate limitations (>30) in sexual functioning and enjoyment. Five areas (pain, nausea/vomiting, financial impact, breast symptoms and IDDD) improved significantly (<6 points) in the follow-up.The ALND group scored less for the future perspective item (15-20 points) in the follow-up than the other two axillary treatment groups. No differences between the pre-treatment and follow up assessments regarding treatment were found among the axillary treatment groups.Conclusions: Our results suggest that early-stage breast cancer patients adapted well both to their disease and treatments over the follow-up period and to the administration of RT. There were few QL differences between the axillary treatment groups. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating basin-wide air temperature by partial integration of remote sensing data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A comparison of various methods that enable temporally continuous computation of basin-wide air temperature is presented. An approach that combines remote sensing data with measurements at meteorological stations for obtaining basin-wide air temperature is proposed and compared to the standard interpolation methods of point measurements. For a basin of over 1000 km(2), the proposed approach provides significantly more reliable air temperature rasters (average Delta = 9%) than the standard interpolation methods (average Delta = 25%), all by using satellite images and measurements from only two meteorological stations in comparison to standard methods using measurements from 10 meteorological stations.

TI  - Coastal Upwelling Revisited: Ekman, Bakun, and Improved Upwelling Indices for the US West Coast
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal upwelling is responsible for thriving marine ecosystems and fisheries that are disproportionately productive relative to their surface area, particularly in the world's major eastern boundary upwelling systems. Along oceanic eastern boundaries, equatorward wind stress and the Earth's rotation combine to drive a near-surface layer of water offshore, a process called Ekman transport. Similarly, positive wind stress curl drives divergence in the surface Ekman layer and consequently upwelling from below, a process known as Ekman suction. In both cases, displaced water is replaced by upwelling of relatively nutrient-rich water from below, which stimulates the growth of microscopic phytoplankton that form the base of the marine food web. Ekman theory is foundational and underlies the calculation of upwelling indices such as the Bakun Index that are ubiquitous in eastern boundary upwelling system studies. While generally valuable first-order descriptions, these indices and their underlying theory provide an incomplete picture of coastal upwelling. Here we review the relevant dynamics and limitations of classical upwelling indices, particularly related to representation of the surface wind stress, the influence of geostrophic currents, and the properties of upwelled water. To address these shortcomings, we present two new upwelling indices for the U.S. West Coast (31-47 degrees N), which are available from 1988 to present. The Coastal Upwelling Transport Index and the Biologically Effective Upwelling Transport Index provide improved estimates of vertical transport and vertical nitrate flux, respectively, by leveraging technological and scientific advances realized since the introduction of the Bakun Index nearly a half century ago.The California Current System, running along the North American West Coast, hosts a rich and diverse marine ecosystem that provides considerable socioeconomic benefit. The process underlying this exceptional biological productivity is wind-driven coastal upwelling, which delivers deep, nutrient-rich water to the sunlit surface layer and stimulates growth of phytoplankton that form the base of the marine food web. Given the ecological importance of upwelling, indices designed to monitor its intensity (e.g., the Bakun Index) were introduced nearly 50years ago. While these indices have proved extremely useful, they have a number of limitations as they are derived from relatively coarse resolution atmospheric pressure fields. In particular, uncertainties arise in the estimation of wind stress and from the omission of the influence of ocean circulation. Furthermore, historical indices estimate only the amount of water upwelled, not the nutrient content of that water. Here we present new indices that leverage ocean models, satellite data, and in situ observations to more accurately estimate upwelling strength as well as the amount of nitrate being upwelled. The new indices are publicly available, extend from 1988 to present, and will be valuable for monitoring upwelling in near real time and for understanding its impacts on the marine ecosystem.

TI  - Growth rate of alpine phytoplankton assemblages from contrasting watersheds and N-deposition regimes exposed to nitrogen and phosphorus enrichments
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. High mountain lakes are a network of sentinels, sensitive to any events occurring within their waterbodies, their surrounding catchments and their airsheds. By modifying nutrient balance and availability in water, both local and global changes are expected to alter primary productivity and to trigger strong ecological impacts in these ecosystems.2. Predicting ecological trajectories under future change is a key challenge for both scientists and conservation managers. French alpine lakes, in the most southern and western part of the European Alps, have received surprisingly little attention to date. In this article, we address how variations in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) supply are likely to impact the area's phytoplankton growth. We performed N and/or P enrichment microcosm experiments under controlled conditions on 12 phytoplankton assemblages sampled during the summer 2016 in four French alpine lakes with contrasting catchments and N-deposition regimes.3. The nutrients limiting phytoplankton growth varied according to the nutrient stoichiometry of the lake water. In the lakes exposed to high N-deposition rates 0700 kg N km(2) year 1 ), the water contained more N than P and phytoplankton growth in microcosms was either limited by P or not limited by either N or P. In the lakes exposed to low N-deposition rates 0500 kg N km(2) year 1 ), N availability relative to P was lower in the lake with vegetated catchment than in the lake with rocky catchment, resulting in a switch from P to NP colimitation of the phytoplankton in microcosms.4. Our data clearly indicate that French alpine lakes do not host the same diversity and structure of phytoplankton communities and that phytoplankton composition influenced phytoplankton growth in microcosms. First, we show that nonmotile colonial chlorophytes appeared in late summer assemblages, with lower growth rates but P-storage abilities. Second, our findings indicate that the growth of phytoplankton assemblages dominated by diatoms was increasingly limited by silica (SiO2) throughout the summer, along with a 70% decrease in SiO2 concentration in lake water.5. The forecast global changes in the French Alps should increase phytoplankton growth in most high mountain lakes where P is the main limiting nutrient, before NP colimitation. These changes are likely to be of lesser extent in lakes with large vegetated catchments in the northern area with lower N-deposition rates and of greater extent in the southern area with higher N-deposition rates and future P-deposition rates.6. By investigating the relationship between nutrient availability, phytoplankton composition and phytoplankton growth rate, this experimental laboratory microcosm study will help interpret current multifactorial data from in situ monitoring networks in the Alps. It will also be helpful to develop models to better predict the sentinel lake responses to local and global changes.

TI  - Looking for Medium-term Conservation and Development Impacts of Community Management Agreements in Uganda's Rwenzori Mountains National Park
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the impact of collaborative management agreements (CMAs) designed to protect forests and raise incomes for smallholders living adjacent to Rwenzori Mountains National Park (RMNP), Uganda. We use a quasi-experimental study design to estimate changes in several income measures, as well as land cover using three waves (2003, 2007, and 2012) of household survey and remote sensing data. Overall, we find no significant impact of CMAs on any of our income measures. However, when disaggregating households by income quartile, we find that access to forest resources in RMNP may have had an income stabilizing effect for poor households. Forest income grew significantly faster among the poorest quartile of treatment relative to control households, partially because poor households recorded very low income from forests at baseline. The effect of CMAs on forest cover is minimal, although we find that conversion of woody savanna and savanna to cropland is more pronounced in villages with CMAs. These findings suggest that in the medium-term, CMAs have failed to deliver conservation or development benefits related to enhancing livelihoods or conserving forests near RMNP. Practitioners should consider different CMA models or other strategies for improving welfare and forest health outcomes in communities neighboring protected areas.

TI  - Improved pure pixel identification algorithms to determine the endmembers in hyperspectral images
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image analysis mainly concentrates on handling big satellite datasets efficiently and to identify the endmembers more accurately. This paper proposes improved pure pixel identification algorithms to identify the endmembers in hyperspectral images. In the proposed endmember extraction algorithms the skewers are generated based on the statistical parameters of the hyperspectral dataset, which implicitly changes the vertices of the convex hull. This reduces the false alarm probability of the conventional Pixel Purity Index algorithm. Moreover in the proposed Skewer based NFINDR algorithm eliminates the random initialization of the end members in the first step, which leads to more promising results. The running time is reduced by decreasing the floating point operations involved. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed endmember extraction algorithms in terms of improved accuracy and reduced computational complexity. My study proves the proposed algorithms were able to identify the endmembers accurately even in a noisy environment, thereby validating its effectiveness.

TI  - Characterization of Piospheres in Northern Liddar Valley of Kashmir Himalaya
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazing in pastures results in the formation of degraded patches called piospheres. It alters soil composition and vegetation in the vicinity of the watering points, shade, mineral licks and sheepfolds. A comparative approach was adopted in Liddar valley of Himalaya to study soil and vegetation composition of piosphere patches using various techniques. Pasture soils were investigated for nitrogen (N), organic matter (OM), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total phosphorus (P2O5), total potassium (K2O), total calcium (CaO), total magnesium (MgO) and total sulfur (S) using energy dispersive X-ray florescence and physical properties like soil texture and bulk density were also studied using respective techniques. Importance value index and plant species compositions were studied using transect method along the weakening effect radiating outward from center of piosphere. The change in their spatial extent was also studied using remote sensing technique. The results indicate that there is an enrichment of nutrients in piospheres such as N (0.02%), P (0.30%), K (0.04%), S (0.04%), and reduction of others like Ca (0.30%) and Mg (0.38%). Soil fractions like clay decreased by (17.62%) coupled with increase of sand and silt portion by 9.83% and 7.78% respectively, which eventually resulted in increase of bulk density by 0.08%. Furthermore, number of species have decreased to half (31) in the piospheres as compared to non piospheres (64). Paired samples t test was performed to determine the differences existed between two grazing intensities. The enrichment of some nutrients especially P results in terrestrial eutrophication which becomes suitable for the encroachment of weedy and unpalatable plant species. Remote sensing data also indicates that the total area under these degraded patches increased from 2.07% in 1992 to 2.69% in 2010. The management perspectives degradation of pasturelands by piosphere formation needs an immediate attention which otherwise shall reduce the grazing area and economic value of grazing lands in Himalayas.

TI  - Perspectives on the opioid crisis from pain medicine clinicians
T2  - DM DISEASE-A-MONTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients experiencing a terminal drug related event reflect a sentinel event. If this pharmacotherapy is a widely used agent, it may be viewed as a catastrophic problem. If patients are dying from illegal drug use when the medical establishment fails them by withdrawing or minimizing their medically prescribed medication, then the burden rests with their health care providers, legislation, and insurance carriers to actively participate in a collegial fashion to achieve parity. Causing a decay in functionality in previously functional patients, may occur with appropriately prescribed opioid medications addressing non-cancer pain when withdrawing or diminishing either with or without patient consent. The members of the medical profession have diminished their prescribing of opioids for their patients out of apparent fear of reprisal, state or federal government sanctions, and other concerned groups. Diminishing former dosages or deleting the opioid medication, preferably in concert with the patient, often results in inequitable patient care. Enforcing sanctioned decreases or ceasing to prescribe from their former required/established opioid medications precipitate patient discord. In absence of opioid misuse, abuse, diversion or addiction based upon medical "guidelines" and with a poor foundation of Evidence Based Medicine the CDC guidelines, it may be masked as a true guideline reflecting a decrement of clinical judgment, wisdom, and compassion. This article also discusses the role of pharmacy chains, insurance carriers, and their pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) contribution to this multidimensional problem. There may be a potential solution, identified in this paper, if all the associated political, medical and insurance groups work cohesively to improve patient care. This article and the CDC guidelines are not focused at hospice, palliative, end of life care pain management. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Registration Method between High Resolution Optical and SAR Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Integration analysis of multi-sensor satellite images is becoming increasingly important. The first step in integration analysis is image registration between multi-sensor. SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) is a representative image registration method. However, optical image and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images are different from sensor attitude and radiation characteristics during acquisition, making it difficult to apply the conventional method, such as SIFT, because the radiometric characteristics between images are nonlinear. To overcome this limitation, we proposed a modified method that combines the SAR-SIFT method and shape descriptor vector DLSS(Dense Local Self-Similarity). We conducted an experiment using two pairs of Cosmo-SkyMed and KOMPSAT-2 images collected over Daejeon, Korea, an area with a high density of buildings. The proposed method extracted the correct matching points when compared to conventional methods, such as SIFT and SAR-SIFT . The method also gave quantitatively reasonable results for RMSE of 1.66m and 2.45m over the two pairs of images.

TI  - Nationwide Projection of Rice Yield Using a Crop Model Integrated with Geostationary Satellite Imagery: A Case Study in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) of the Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) increases the chance of acquiring images with greater clarity eight times a day and is equipped with spectral bands suitable for monitoring crop yield in the national scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m. The objectives of this study were to classify nationwide paddy fields and to project rice (Oryza sativa) yield and production using the grid-based GRAMI-rice model and GOCI satellite products over South Korea from 2011 to 2014. Solar insolation and temperatures were obtained from COMS and the Korea local analysis and prediction systems for model inputs, respectively. The paddy fields and transplanting dates were estimated by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance and land cover products. The crop model was calibrated using observed yield data in 11 counties and was applied to 62 counties in South Korea. The overall accuracies of the estimated paddy fields using MODIS data ranged from 89.5% to 90.2%. The simulated rice yields statistically agreed with the observed yields with mean errors of -0.07 to +0.10 ton ha(-1), root-mean-square errors of 0.219 to 0.451 ton ha(-1), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies of 0.241 to 0.733 in four years, respectively. According to paired t-tests ( = 0.05), the simulated and observed rice yields were not significantly different. These results demonstrate the possible development of a crop information delivery system that can classify land cover, simulate crop yield, and monitor regional crop production on a national scale.

TI  - Passive microwave response associated with two main earthquakes in Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal anomalies associated with earthquakes using satellite infrared data are being studied in different parts of the world for more than three decades. The thermal anomalies have emerged as one of the potential earthquake precursor. However, often cloud cover obstructs detection of the thermal anomalies. Compared to infrared, passive microwave sensors provide information about the thermal radiations under any weather conditions. In the present study, we have carried out detailed analysis of brightness temperature data derived from the Defense Meteorological Space Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) to determine thermal anomalies associated with the 1997 Manyi and 2001 Kokoxili earthquakes. Brightness temperature data for 13 years period from 1996 to 2008 observed from F13 satellite were considered to avoid difference in the sensor sensitivity. Based on 9 years background data that ignoring data for the years in which strong earthquake occurred, we computed Index of Microwave Radiation Anomaly (IMRA) over the Manyi-Yushu Fault (MYF) and Kun Lun Fault (KLF) zones, Tibetan Plateau. Our results indicate that the microwave brightness temperature at 19.35 GHz has higher sensitivity to the seismic anomalies in comparison to the other higher frequency channels. The IMRA with multi-region, multi-frequency, and multi-parameter variation were analyzed to validate our results. In addition, variation of different parameters (microwave brightness temperature, near surface air temperature and carbon monoxide-CO) observed for Kokoxili earthquake shows the transfer process of thermal anomalies from the focal region to the atmosphere during the preparation and occurrence of earthquake. Passive microwave satellite data combined with other surface and atmospheric parameters provide better understanding of physical mechanism of thermal anomalies associated with earthquakes.

AB  - Although surgical and medical treatment options are available for the treatment of chronic lymphedema, there is no cure. Recent advances in microsurgery have provided an opportunity to perform immediate lymphatic reconstruction after lymphadenectomy for disease prevention. In this review, we provide the historical background leading to a paradigm shift in performing this procedure. We will also discuss the current evidence for immediate lymphatic reconstruction, potential oncologic procedures amenable to this approach, and detail ongoing challenges.

TI  - NDVI exhibits mixed success in predicting spatiotemporal variation in caribou summer forage quality and quantity
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is commonly used by researchers and managers to represent ungulate forage conditions in landscapes across the globe, despite limited information about how it compares to empirical measurements of forage quality and quantity. The application of NDVI as a forage metric is particularly appealing for studying migratory caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in remote Arctic ecosystems, where field assessments are logistically and financially prohibitive, and climate-mediated changes in vegetation have been hypothesized to influence population declines. To determine the utility of NDVI for adequately representing caribou forage conditions, we compared NDVI derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery to empirical measures of caribou forage biomass, nitrogen, digestible nitrogen, and digestible energy within the summer range of the Central Arctic Caribou Herd on the North Slope of Alaska. Specifically, we determined the strength of forage-NDVI relationships at the start of the growing season and across the summer, assessed the efficacy of NDVI variables for modeling spatiotemporal variation in field measurements of different forage components, and used long-term MODIS data to estimate temporal changes in forage between 2000 and 2016. We found that NDVI values were weakly correlated with caribou forage quality at the start of the growing season and throughout the summer. Although linear models of forage-NDVI relationships performed poorly, NDVI variables (NDVI and the number of days from when NDVI reached its maximum value) were useful for modeling spatiotemporal variation in empirical measurements of forage components across the growing season, but only when we incorporated nonlinear forage-NDVI relationships and other habitat covariates. Phenological advances in the date of peak NDVI were associated with significant changes in forage conditions, particularly nitrogen, which exhibited earlier seasonal declines. Using long-term MODIS data, predicted values of forage nitrogen declined between 2000 and 2016, driven by exceedingly low values in 2014 and 2015. Given our results, we caution the application of NDVI as a general (linear) proxy of caribou forage conditions across the growing season, and encourage practitioners to use NDVI variables to model spatiotemporal variation in specific forage conditions from empirical field data, accounting for nonlinear forage-NDVI relationships.

AB  - Predicting variations in the near-Earth space environment that can lead to spacecraft damage and failure is one example of "space weather" and a big space physics challenge. A project recently funded through the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) Directed Research and Development (LDRD) program aims at developing a new capability to understand, model, and predict Space Hazards Induced near Earth by Large Dynamic Storms, the SHIELDS framework. The project goals are to understand the dynamics of the surface charging environment (SCE), the hot (keV) electrons representing the source and seed populations for the radiation belts, on both macro and micro-scale. Important physics questions related to particle injection and acceleration associated with magnetospheric storms and substorms, as well as plasma waves, are investigated. These challenging problems are addressed using a team of world-class experts in the fields of space science and computational plasma physics, and state-of-the-art models and computational facilities. A full two-way coupling of physics-based models across multiple scales, including a global MHD (BATS-R-US) embedding a particle-in-cell (iPIC3D) and an inner magnetosphere (RAM-SCB) codes, is achieved. New data assimilation techniques employing in situ satellite data are developed; these provide an order of magnitude improvement in the accuracy in the simulation of the SCE. SHIELDS also includes a post-processing tool designed to calculate the surface charging for specific spacecraft geometry using the Curvilinear Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) code that can be used for reanalysis of satellite failures or for satellite design.

TI  - Mapping of wet forests using Earth Observation tools in El Kala area (Algeria)
T2  - REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wet forests are among the most threatened and degraded wetland ecosystems in the world. In Algeria, they are mainly represented by specific, fragile and rare forest habitats. The region of El Kala (North-East of Algeria) hosts many unique wetlands (e.g. lakes, marshlands, wet meadows, lagoons, etc.) but also some of the most extended wet forests in North Africa. The main objective of this study is to develop a new mapping approach for the location and the delineation of these ecosystems using Earth Observation (EO) tools. This methodology is based on a combination of topographic and hydro-geomorphological indices derived from Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), with spectral variables extracted from Landsat-8 satellite images and in-situ data collected from the field. The final result showed that the studied area hosts more than 3900 ha of wet forests (alder and riparian forests), with an overall accuracy, estimated using field observations, higher than 85 %.This new approach allows mapping the spatial distribution of wet forests at large geographic scales and could be used as a support to facilitate their monitoring, using EO time series, but also to better implement management and conservation measures.

TI  - FOREST-FIRE BURNED AREA MAPPING USING COMBINATIONS OF SPECTRAL INDICES AS MEMBERSHIP FUNCTION IN OBJECT-BASED IMAGE ANALYSIS (OBIA)
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) is a hierarchical classification approach which is applicable in solving numerous remote sensing research problems. Even though, the usage of OBIA for monitoring wildfire and burned area estimation are quite limited. This study focusses on comparing the potential of satellite-derived indices including Normalized Multi-Band Drought Index (NMDI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Burn Area Index Modified (BAIM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for mapping the area of forest effected by forest fire. In this research, pre and post forest fire images of Landsat 8 (OLI) were processed using multi-resolution segmentation and assign class algorithm in eCognition software. Burned and non-burned areas were mapped using the combinations of selected indices (NMDI-NBR, BAIM-NBR and NDVI-NBR). The combination of BAIM-NBR index produced the highest accuracy of (80%). The study conclude that spectral indices, if use in combinations, assembled satisfactory outcomes in terms of classification accuracy.

TI  - Pattern Analysis of Forest Dynamics of the Katangese Copper Belt Region in the Democratic Republic of the Congo: II. Complementary Analysis on Forest Fragmentation
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The social welfare search has led to the emergence of various anthropogenic activities in the Katangese Copper Belt (K.C.B.), including mining, which has led to a significant decline in its forest cover. This study analyzed the forest fragmentation in the K.C.B. from 2002 to 2015, using a 10 km x 10 km grid overlaid on a mosaic of classified Landsat images. Pattern metrics highlighted a significant deforestation as well as a lesser extent reforestation. The K.C.B. forest are characterized by a high spatial dispersal which increased over time. The forest degradation is largely caused by agricultural development. The reforestation observed in some south-east and south-west grids is explained by factors like the energy wood consumption, the urbanization and the mining activities, the privatization of some concessions, their inaccessibility and/or remoteness to large cities. However, anthropization endangers these regenerating forests, as long as miners, farmers and charcoal producers remain in activity.

TI  - Snow Cover Mapping for Mountainous Areas by Fusion of MODIS L1B and Geographic Data Based on Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover plays an important role in meteorological and hydrological researches. However, the accuracies of currently available snow cover products are significantly lower in mountainous areas than in plains, due to the serious snow/cloud confusion problem caused by high altitude and complex topography. Aiming at this problem, an improved snow cover mapping approach for mountainous areas was proposed and applied in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. In this work, a deep learning framework named Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoders (SDAE) was employed to fuse the MODIS multispectral images and various geographic datasets, which are then classified into three categories: Snow, cloud and snow-free land. Moreover, two independent SDAE models were trained for snow mapping in snow and snow-free seasons respectively in response to the seasonal variations of meteorological conditions. The proposed approach was verified using in-situ snow depth records, and compared to the most widely used snow products MOD10A1 and MYD10A1. The comparison results show that our method got the best performance: Overall accuracy of 98.95% and F-measure of 73.84%. The results indicated that our method can effectively improve the snow recognition accuracy, and it can be further extended to other multi-source remote sensing image classification issues.

TI  - Sentinel-2 Based Temporal Detection of Agricultural Land Use Anomalies in Support of Common Agricultural Policy Monitoring
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020 timeframe reform will reshape the agriculture land use control procedures from a selected risk fields-based approach into an all-inclusive one. The reform fosters the use of Sentinel data with the objective of enabling greater transparency and comparability of CAP results in different Member States. In this paper, we investigate the analysis of a time series approach using Sentinel-2 images and the suitability of the BFAST (Breaks for Additive Season and Trend) Monitor method to detect changes that correspond to land use anomaly observations in the assessment of agricultural parcel management activities. We focus on identifying certain signs of ineligible (inconsistent) use in permanent meadows and crop fields in one growing season, and in particular those that can be associated with time-defined greenness (vegetation vigor). Depending on the requirements of the BFAST Monitor method and currently time-limited Sentinel-2 dataset for the reliable anomaly study, we introduce customized procedures to support and verify the BFAST Monitor anomaly detection results using the analysis of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) object-based temporal profiles and time-series standard deviation output, where geographical objects of interest are parcels of particular land use. The validation of land use candidate anomalies in view of land use ineligibilities was performed with the information on declared land annual use and field controls, as obtained in the framework of subsidy granting in Slovenia. The results confirm that the proposed combined approach proves efficient to deal with short time series and yields high accuracy rates in monitoring agricultural parcel greenness. As such it can already be introduced to help the process of agricultural land use control within certain CAP activities in the preparation and adaptation phase.

TI  - Monthly Analysis of Wetlands Dynamics Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As wetlands are one of the world's most important ecosystems, their vulnerability necessitates the constant monitoring and mapping of their changes. Satellite-based remote sensing has become an essential data source for mapping and monitoring wetlands. As wetlands are dynamic ecosystems, their classification depends on many different parameters. However, considering their complex structure; wetlands tend to be challenging land cover for classification, which sometimes requires the use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques. The objectives of this study were: (i) to investigate the monthly dynamics of several wetland classes using multi-sensor parameters; (ii) to find correlations between the investigated parameters. Thus, we extracted the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 8, and extracted dual polarization backscatter values (VH-VV) from the Sentinel-1 satellite at a monthly period over a year. The results showed strong correlation between the LST and the NDVI values of 0.94, and strong correlation between the microwave (VH) and both thermal and optical parameters with a 0.81 correlation coefficient, while there was weak or no correlation between the VV and the other investigated parameters. We strongly recommend that future studies clarify the Sentinel-1 backscatter values in wetland areas, by taking multiple field measurements close to the image acquisition time.

TI  - Narrowband shortwave minima of multispectral reflectance as indication of algal blooms associated with the mesoscale variability in the Brazil-Malvinas Confluence
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine the narrowband shortwave minima (NSM) of multispectral reflectance as indication of mesoscale algal blooms. They are frequent in the Brazil-Malvinas confluence zone (BMCZ) where our testing site (TS) belongs. Its MODIS A images of December 2008 and 2014 were the source of initial data. Classification of reflectance spectra in these images revealed that the TS look from space was determined by the most populated cluster of pixels having the only NSM at 443 nm. We divided this cluster into sub-clusters by maximum wavelengths lambda(max) from 412 to 555 nm and retrieved the estimates of lambda(max) (proxy for abundance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM)), chl_a (MODIS chlorophyll), R-rs (555) (turbidity proxy), and C-ALH (NSM-based chlorophyll) on a pixel-by-pixel basis. This allowed us to demonstrate: (1) the NSM magnitude at 443 nm peaked in mesoscale structures, (2) C-ALH was consistent with chlorophyll in the BMCZ waters samples, (3) positive linear correlation of R-rs (555) and C-ALH was characteristic of the TS waters at any lambda(max), (4) the MODIS chl_a was overestimated when lambda(max) > 488 nm, (5) localization and outlines of mesoscale structures agreed well in the fields of pairs R-rs(555) - C-ALH and lambda(max) - chl_a, but not in the C-ALH - chl_a pair. The NSM-based chlorophyll C-ALH outperformed the standard chl_a determinations in exactness because the C-ALH is insensitive to CDOM. This is advantageous when studying the Case 1 waters of intensive mesoscale variability where chlorophyll co-exists with the CDOM from eddy-induced blooms.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of different land features with similar spectral response is an enigmatical task for pixel-based classifiers, as most of these algorithms rely only on the spectral information of the satellite data. This study evaluated the performance of six major pixel-based land-use classification techniques (both common and advanced) for accurate classification of the heterogeneous land-use pattern of Jharia coalfield, India. WorldView-2 satellite data was used in the present study. The land-use classification results revealed that Maximum Likelihood classifier algorithm performed best out of the four common algorithms with an overall accuracy of about 84%. The advanced classifiers used in the study were Neural-Net and Support Vector Machine both of which gave excellent results with an overall accuracy of 91% and 95%, respectively. It was observed that use of very high-resolution data is not sufficient for obtaining high classification accuracy, selection of an appropriate classification algorithm is equally important to get better classification results. Advanced classifiers gave higher accuracy with minimal errors, hence, for critical planning and monitoring tasks these classifiers should be preferred.

TI  - Mapping and Forecasting Onsets of Harmful Algal Blooms Using MODIS Data over Coastal Waters Surrounding Charlotte County, Florida
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past two decades, persistent occurrences of harmful algal blooms (HAB; Karenia brevis) have been reported in Charlotte County, southwestern Florida. We developed data-driven models that rely on spatiotemporal remote sensing and field data to identify factors controlling HAB propagation, provide a same-day distribution (nowcasting), and forecast their occurrences up to three days in advance. We constructed multivariate regression models using historical HAB occurrences (213 events reported from January 2010 to October 2017) compiled by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and validated the models against a subset (20%) of the historical events. The models were designed to capture the onset of the HABs instead of those that developed days earlier and continued thereafter. A prototype of an early warning system was developed through a threefold exercise. The first step involved the automatic downloading and processing of daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua products using SeaDAS ocean color processing software to extract temporal and spatial variations of remote sensing-based variables over the study area. The second step involved the development of a multivariate regression model for same-day mapping of HABs and similar subsequent models for forecasting HAB occurrences one, two, and three days in advance. Eleven remote sensing variables and two non-remote sensing variables were used as inputs for the generated models. In the third and final step, model outputs (same-day and forecasted distribution of HABs) were posted automatically on a web map. Our findings include: (1) the variables most indicative of the timing of bloom propagation are bathymetry, euphotic depth, wind direction, sea surface temperature (SST), ocean chlorophyll three-band algorithm for MODIS [chlorophyll-a OC3M] and distance from the river mouth, and (2) the model predictions were 90% successful for same-day mapping and 65%, 72% and 71% for the one-, two- and three-day advance predictions, respectively. The adopted methodologies are reliable at a local scale, dependent on readily available remote sensing data, and cost-effective and thus could potentially be used to map and forecast algal bloom occurrences in data-scarce regions.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Results from four global cloud climate data records (ISCCP-HGM, ESA Cloud CCI V3, CLARA-A2 and PATMOS-x) have been inter-compared in global time series plots, in global maps and in zonal region plots covering the period in common, 1984-2009. The investigated cloud parameters were total cloud fraction and cloud top pressure. Averaged seasonal cycles of cloud cover, as observed by the CALIPSO-CALIOP sensor over the 2007-2015 period, were also used as an additional independent and high-quality reference for the study of global cloud cover. All CDRs show good agreement on global cloud amounts (65%) and also a weak negative trend (0.5-1.9% per decade) over the period of investigation. Deviations between the CDRs are seen especially over the southern mid-latitude region and over the poles. Particularly good results are shown by PATMOS-x and by ESA Cloud CCI V3 when compared to the CALIPSO-CALIOP reference. Results for cloud top pressure show large differences (60 hPa) between ISCCP-HGM and the other CDRs for the global mean. The two CDR groups show also opposite signs in the trend over the period.

TI  - Low-Frequency Noise in Supported and Suspended MoS<sub>2</sub> Transistors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRON DEVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensitivity of sensors, the phase noise of oscillators, and intrinsic device performance at the nanoscale are primarily limited by fluctuations in resistance at low frequencies, also called flicker noise. These intrinsic fluctuations in resistance become more prominent in two-dimensional materials due to their ultrathin nature. Here, we report the low-frequency noise (LFN) behavior of supported and suspended MoS2 FETs. Carrier-number fluctuation mechanism was found to be responsible for LFN in both configurations. The extracted frequency index (gamma in 1/f(gamma)) indicates the different trap time constants and mechanisms responsible for LFN in MoS2 transistors. A gamma value of 2 in suspended transistors indicates a tight trap time-constant distribution likely due to recombination-generation through trap states arising only from intrinsic defects and/or extrinsic adsorbates. A wide time-constant distribution (gamma similar to 1 to 1.4) in supported transistors indicates the presence of various kinds of traps, such as adsorbates, intrinsic defects, as well as interface and oxide traps. Furthermore, variation in S-0 (characterizes the magnitude of noise) with gate voltage in both supported and suspended device configurations was validated analytically using the carrier-number fluctuation model.

TI  - Low-Shot Learning for the Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in computer vision using deep learning with RGB imagery (e.g., object recognition and detection) have been made possible thanks to the development of large annotated RGB image data sets. In contrast, multispectral image (MSI) and hyperspectral image (HSI) data sets contain far fewer labeled images, in part due to the wide variety of sensors used. These annotations are especially limited for semantic segmentation, or pixelwise classification, of remote sensing imagery because it is labor intensive to generate image annotations. Low-shot learning algorithms can make effective inferences despite smaller amounts of annotated data. In this paper, we study low-shot learning using self-taught feature learning for semantic segmentation. We introduce: 1) an improved self-taught feature learning framework for HSI and MSI data and 2) a semisupervised classification algorithm. When these are combined, they achieve the state-of-the-art performance on remote sensing data sets that have little annotated training data available. These low-shot learning frameworks will reduce the manual image annotation burden and improve semantic segmentation performance for remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Cultural worldview and genetically modified food policy preferences
T2  - FOOD POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - After more than twenty years of persistent efforts to raise concern over the risk of consuming genetically modified (GM) foods, GM labeling proponents have more recently adopted the themes of: (1) environmental harm, (2) the collusion of big business and government, and (3) the "right to know" if food contains GM ingredients (Lendman, 2015). Proponents of mandatory labeling have been effective in mobilizing supporters around these themes which may influence individual-level support for different GM policy outcomes due to how these themes interact with a person's cultural values. Consequently, we use cultural cognition theory to explore the relationship between cultural worldview and preferences for GM policy. Using a survey, we first examine the effect of cultural worldview on consumers' preferences for voluntary and mandatory GM labeling programs. Second, using a choice experiment, we explore how cultural worldview influences consumer valuations of and willingness to pay for non-GM and GM food labels. Our results establish a reliable connection between cultural worldview and preferences for GM policy and preferences for GM labeling. As predicted by cultural cognition theory, the most dramatic differences exist between those with relatively egalitarian-communitarian and hierarchical-individualistic worldviews. Egalitarian-comnumitaricuis were 42% less likely to support change in the current voluntary approach and 79% more likely to support mandatory labeling than hierarchical-individualists; these individuals were also willing to pay about 67% more to avoid GM foods by purchasing products with a non-GMO label. Although important differences do exist, our research demonstrates that there is common ground and individual attitudes towards labeling can be mediated by cultural worldview.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Communication failures can lead to sentinel events in the operating room. Knowledge of basic surgical steps is important for all team members to ensure work flow efficiency. Surgeons and non-surgeons were surveyed to determine perceived and actual quality of communication between team members, using knowledge of surgical steps as a marker of communication quality. Participants agreed that communication was important, but non-surgeons were unable to name the four key steps of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p=5.0E-07), indicating poor communication between surgeons and non-surgeons.

TI  - The new 8th edition of TNM staging and its implications for skin cancer: a review by the British Association of Dermatologists and the Royal College of Pathologists, UK
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The 8th edition of TNM (tumour, node and metastasis) has numerous and important changes compared with the 7th edition. Public Health England and the Royal College of Pathologists, U.K., have adopted the 8th edition of TNM (TNM8) published by the Union for International Cancer Control for skin cancer staging. These changes will have an impact on the management and commissioning of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). The T1-T3 categories for NMSC staging require the clinician to measure the maximum dimension (usually diameter) of every potential invasive cancer. For squamous, basal and adnexal carcinomas, but not Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), the T1-T3 categories are defined by new 20-mm and 40-mm divisions based on the maximum dimension of the lesion. In addition, new risk factors upstage T1 or T2 to T3. For melanoma, mitotic index no longer influences separation of pathological stage (pT1). There is a new, additional stratification level at 08-mm Breslow thickness. Subdivision pT1b, with a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of pN0, is now stage IA compared with the previous IB. For MCC, SLNB is now included specifically in the pN staging system. The pT1 subdivision requires clinical information as to whether histologically involved nodes were clinically occult or detectable. For both melanoma and MCC the clinician must state whether the lymph nodes are occult or clinically detectable. Eyelid carcinoma continues to have a staging system different from that in general skin and the system is substantially revised in TNM8.

TI  - Integration of high resolution remotely sensed data and machine learning techniques for spatial prediction of soil properties and corn yield
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread adoption of precision agriculture requires timely acquisition of low-cost, high quality soil and crop yield maps. Integration of remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms offers cost-and time-effective approach for spatial prediction of soil properties and crop yield compared to conventional approaches. The objectives of this study were to: (i) evaluate the role of remotely sensed images; (ii) compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms; and (iii) identify the importance of remotely sensed image-derived variables, in spatial prediction of soil properties and corn yield. This study integrated field based data on five soil properties (i.e., soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and pH) and yield monitor based corn yield data with multispectral aerial images and topographic data, both collected in 2013, from seven fields at the Molly Caren Farm near London, Ohio. Digital elevation model data, at a resolution of 1 m, was used to derive topographic properties of the fields. Multispectral images collected at bare-soil conditions, at a resolution 0.30 m, were used to derive soil and vegetation indices. Models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield using linear regression (LM) and five machine learning algorithms (i.e., Random Forest (RF); Neural Network (NN); Support Vector Machine (SVM) with radial and linear kernel functions; Gradient Boosting Model (GBM); and Cubist (CU)) were evaluated in terms of coefficient of determination (R-2) and root mean square error (RMSE). Machine learning algorithms were found to outperform LM algorithm for most of the times with a higher R-2 and lower RMSE. Based on models for seven fields, on average, NN provided the highest accuracy for SOM (R-2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.44) and CEC (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 2.35); SVM for K (R-2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.49) and Mg (R-2 = 0.22, RMSE = 4.57); and GBM for pH (R-2 = 0.15, RMSE = 0.62). For corn yield, RF consistently outperformed other models and provided higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.53, RMSE = 0.97). Soil and vegetation indices based on bare-soil imagery played a more significant role in demonstrating in-field variability of corn yield and soil properties than topographic variables. The accuracy of the models developed for prediction of soil properties and corn yield observed in this study suggested that the approach of integrating remotely sensed data and machine learning algorithms are promising for mapping soil properties and corn yield at a local scale, which can be useful in locating areas of potential concerns and implementing site-specific farming practices.

TI  - Impacts of tidal link drain, along the coastal areas of districts Badin and Sujawal in Indus deltaic region, Sindh Pakistan
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal Link Canal has been one of the causes of seawater intrusion and coastal erosion along the coastal areas of Sindh Pakistan. The literature reviews, along with satellite images and tidal data were analyzed to investigate the causes and impacts of seawater intrusion along the coastal areas of Badin and Sujawal districts of Sindh. This study represents that seawater intrusion has taken place up to 70 km upstream from the mouth of Tidal Link Canal and about 2.95 million acres agricultural land has been affected by seawater intrusion. Meanwhile, on the basis of satellite data 30 m year average erosion rate was estimated for the past 17 years in tidal link canal. However sea water intrusion and coastal erosion are have a devastating environmental and social impact along the Left Bank Outfall Drain site, thus the whole ecosystem of lakes is facing serious threat. The fresh water lakes as well as agricultural lands and ground water have been affected by seawater intrusion and coastal erosion. During the southwest monsoon, the neighboring sea in the south inundates vast area with salt water through tidal link drain. Extensive field investigations and a high resolution coastal ocean model are urgently needed for future study to fully understand the dynamic process in this coastal region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has been envisaged to model streamflow runoff-contributed mostly by snowmelt from Budhigandaki catchment in Nepal. Available hydro-meteorological data have been collected from the Department of Hydrology and Metrology, Nepal. The MODIS Aqua (MYD10A2) and Terra (MOD10A2) 8 day maximum snow cover extent product have been used to derive the snow cover area (SCA) in the basin. The modeling of streamflow has been carried out using HEC-HMS and SRM models. The performance of these models have been evaluated by using three well known evaluation criteria NSE, R-2 and PEV (percentage error in volume). The values of NSE, R-2 and PEV were found to be 0.944, 0.944 and -0.3% for SRM and 0.778, 0.785 and -1.83% for HEC-HMS, respectively. Similarly, in validation period the average values of NSE, R-2 and PEV were found to be 0.811, 0.816 and 2.01% for SRM model and 0.773, 0.777 and 3.5% for HEC-HMS, respectively. Sensitivity analysis of the models revealed that constant loss rate is very sensitive parameters for HEC-HMS model, whereas runoff coefficient is found to be most sensitive parameters for SRM model. In comparison between two models SRM model has given slightly better simulation results compared to HEC-HMS model.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the work is to describe the restaurant text in the poetry of the Silver Age, to reveal its invariant semantic basis, and to determine the different forms of the embodiment of this model. The material of the paper is poetic texts, where the restaurant semantic complex appears (poems by I. Annensky, A. Akhmatova, N. Gumilyov, O. Mandelstam, S. Yesenin, Vyach. Ivanov, A. Blok). The paper focuses on semiotic mechanisms that ensure the integrity and coherence of the restaurant text. The main method is structural-typological analysis.In the theoretical part of the work, the authors, referring to the works of V.N. Toporov, justify the concept of the spatial text as a complex of motives and images. It is shown that this text includes such structures as a binary space built as a ritual space; the general "fund" of motives and images; specific plot situations; modal elements.In the practical part of the work, the authors of the paper prove that the restaurant text, found in the poetry of the Silver Age, can be attributed to such semantic unities. Structural features of this text are the restaurant locus elements, the system of characters, plot situations related to drunkenness, modal elements caused by the author's attitude to the restaurant semiosphere.The main hypothesis of the paper is an assumption that the restaurant text in Modernism has key parameters for any text: coherence and integrity. The coherence of the restaurant text is conditioned by the common set of motifs, which become certain repetitive plot lines; and its integrity is determined by the category of space, which provides the restaurant text with invariant self-identity.The research has shown that the functioning of the restaurant text depends on the way of the restaurant space conceptualization, which is conditioned by the worldview system of a poetic school. Thus, in Symbolism, "another space" associated with the locus of the restaurant is understood as a space of the spirit, which determines the basic Symbolist plot of the initial transition. In Acmeism, on the contrary, "another space" is conceptualized as a space of death, which leads to an iterative repetition and return plot. These types of plots, in turn, determine the themes of positive and negative metamorphosis (in Acmeist and Symbolist discourses, respectively).Inclusion of metamorphosis in the motive complex of restaurant symbolics makes it possible to reveal the deep archetypal basis of the latter, and to show that the core of the restaurant complex in Symbolism and Acmeism is the semantics of the "sacred kitchen", and the restaurant text itself is its next historical incarnation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Nodal melanocytic nevi (NNs) encountered during sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLB) for malignant melanoma are usually difficult to distinguish from metastatic melanoma. However, NNs have not been well studied in acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) in Asian populations.Objective: To investigate the clinical characteristics and significance of NNs in SLB specimens from patients with ALM.Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 84 patients with ALM who underwent SLB between June 2010 and July 2017.Results: Of the 84 patients with ALM, 9 (10.7%) had NNs in their SLB specimens. NNs were significantly more common in SLB specimens than in specimens not obtained by SLB. The presence of pre-existing melanocytic lesions was found to be associated with NNs (P<.001). The 5-year overall survival was significantly higher in patients with ALM with NNs than in patients with a positive SLB result (P=.047). Distant recurrence in patients with ALM with NNs was significantly lower than in patients a positive SLB result (P=.03).Limitations: The small sample size, single-center study design, and retrospective nature of the study were the limitations.Conclusion: In Asian populations, the prevalence of NNs in ALM is similar to that reported in Europe and the United States. The rates of distant recurrence and overall survival in patients with ALM who have NNs are similar to those of patients who do not have metastatic melanoma.

TI  - Mishima Yukio's Modern Noh Play <i>Sotoba Komachi</i>: Nietzsche's Influence and the Ideal Post-war Artist
T2  - SUNGKYUN JOURNAL OF EAST ASIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The medieval Noh. play Sotoba Komachi educates its audience about the Buddhist concept of ichinyokan by staging a series of conflicting concepts and then resolving them. Mishima Yukio's modern Noh play of the same name removes the Buddhist coloring from ichinyokan to depict a reversal of contradictory ideas. This reversal reveals Mishima's artistic worldview that emerged from his personal experiences as a writer in a society devastated by defeat in war. Mishima's perceptions of art and the artist were influenced by Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy, especially the idea that art is the realization of conflict, but also contains complementary Dionysian and Apollonian elements; I argue that Mishima learned of dualism through the dualism of Nietzsche, and that after discovering this dualism in the original Sotoba Komachi, he exploited it in his modern version.

T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the displacement of large buildings in downtown areas. First, we improved an existing Persistent Scatterer InSAR technique and developed an algorithm to calibrate temperature data. Second, we collated TerraSAR-X satellite images of Seoul captured over 22 months from November 2011 to September 2013, automatic weather system data, and a topographic map. Third, the Gangnam Station area, one of the most crowded areas of downtown Seoul, was selected as a study area for precise analysis. We used the algorithm to analyze the displacement rates of downtown buildings. Fourth, by processing GIS data of the study area, we analyzed the individual displacements of 15 large buildings. These buildings occupied the top 0.1 percent of the building area. The average displacement rate of these 15 large buildings caused by vertical land rising and settlement was 4.7 mm. Fifth, three of the 15 large buildings were found to have undergone significant settlement ('-' displacement). One of them, CHA Gangnam Medical Center, which is located at one of the exits of Eonju Station. Over the study period, a maximum displacement of - 20 mm was observed. In addition, these buildings were located near subway lines and very close to areas where road collapses and underground holes had been reported in the past. These results show that the method used in this study is effective for analyzing the displacement of large buildings in broad downtown areas. Using this method, it will be possible to respond to signs of settlement and collapse of large buildings in advance.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN GREEK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Broadly transcultural as well as intertextual in approach, this article explores the extent to which Zorba the Greek (1946) is shaped by the ideas, philosophy, and religion of East Asian countries, such as China and Japan. The significant engagements discussed in this article include: (1) the Japanese concept of fudoshin, mainly used in Japanese Zen Buddhism (zazen) and Japanese martial arts (budo); (2) the Lunyu (Analects) by Kongzi (Confucius); (3) the Mengzi by Mengzi (Mencius); and (4) the Zhuangzi by Zhuang Zhou (Chuang-tzu). Kazantzakis's until now largely undiscerned dialogue with these East Asian thinkers turned out to be vital to his worldview and literary universe, particularly in Zorba the Greek, which can be read as the narrator's progression from Zen Buddhism toward the Dao.

TI  - Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms in Crop Classification: Impact of Hyper-parameters and Training Sample Size
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to compare machine learning algorithm and deep learning algorithm in crop classification using multi-temporal remote sensing data. For this, impacts of machine learning and deep learning algorithms on (a) hyper-parameter and (2) training sample size were compared and analyzed for Haenam-gun, Korea and Illinois State, USA. In the comparison experiment, support vector machine (SVM) was applied as machine learning algorithm and convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied as deep learning algorithm. In particular, 2D-CNN considering 2-dimensional spatial information and 3D-CNN with extended time dimension from 2D-CNN were applied as CNN. As a result of the experiment, it was found that the hyper-parameter values of CNN, considering various hyper-parameter, defined in the two study areas were similar compared with SVM. Based on this result, although it takes much time to optimize the model in CNN, it is considered that it is possible to apply transfer learning that can extend optimized CNN model to other regions. Then, in the experiment results with various training sample size, the impact of that on CNN was larger than SVM. In particular, this impact was exaggerated in Illinois State with heterogeneous spatial patterns. In addition, the lowest classification performance of 3D-CNN was presented in Illinois State, which is considered to be due to over-fitting as complexity of the model. That is, the classification performance was relatively degraded due to heterogeneous patterns and noise effect of input data, although the training accuracy of 3D-CNN model was high. This results imply that a proper classification algorithms should be selected considering spatial characteristics of study areas. Also, a large amount of training samples is necessary to guarantee higher classification performance in CNN, particularly in 3D-CNN.

AB  - Ecosystems provide social, ecological and economic benefits and are linked through the landscape. Landscape degradation and loss of biodiversity undermine ecosystem functioning especially in vital ecosystems such as the Mara Basin in Africa. Holistically monitored and assessed landscape provide values to support conservation strategy which could enhance sustainable resource utilisation. The study relied on high resolution 10-m Sentinel 2A, Landsat 30-m and SEBAL to generate biophysical parameters for valuation in the landscapes. A household survey was used to derive forest benefits to local livelihoods. The well conserved Trans Mara forest provided high ecological benefits but few social benefits to the local community. Tea buffers have proven to be an effective conservancy strategy for the forest ecosystem. The long term carbon-based benefits in conservation areas of rural Africa is hindered by communities' high dependency on firewood and charcoal energy. The land policy on limited livestock access to the pastoralists in the conservancies should be based on the livestock carrying capacity of the lands. Further, the valuation maps can be used for land use planning where critical wildlife protection areas, movement corridors and mixed use zones of high livestock value can be identified. The holistic assessment of value of African landscape based on key functionalities and linked spatially over the landscape using remotely sensed data is indeed crucial to improve decision making and conservation strategy towards sustainable ecosystem management.

TI  - A prospective feasibility study applying the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria to Japanese patients with early breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery and having positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), the ACOSOG Z0011 trial showed equivalent loco-regional outcomes for patients receiving SLN dissection (SLND) alone and those receiving axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We conducted a prospective single-arm study to confirm the applicability of the Z0011 criteria to Japanese patients with breast cancer.Patients meeting the Z0011 inclusion criteria and providing consent to receive no additional ALND were prospectively enrolled at the Osaka International Cancer Institute from April 2012 to December 2016. Cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence was estimated and compared to that of the Z0011 study.Among a total of 881 patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery, 189 fulfilling the Z0011 criteria were enrolled and eligible for the subsequent analysis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 113 (59.8%) patients, adjuvant hormone therapy to 170 (89.9%), and whole breast irradiation to 183 (96.8%). The frequency of tumors with positive lymphovascular invasion (p < 0.0001) and macrometastases in SLNs (p < 0.0001) were significantly higher in our study than in the Z0011 study. At the median follow-up of 36 months (range 10-64 months), only 2 of 189 patients (1.1%) experienced loco-regional recurrence. The 5-year cumulative rate of loco-regional recurrences was 1.3% (95% CI 0-3.1%), and the 3-year distant DFS rate was 96.8% (95% CI 94.0-99.6%).Our prospective study showed that it is feasible to apply the Z0011 strategy to Japanese patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer undergoing breast-conserving surgery with planned whole breast irradiation.

TI  - The best of both worlds: a hybrid approach for optimal pre- and intraoperative identification of sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeHybrid image-guided surgery technologies such as combined radio- and fluorescence-guidance are increasingly gaining interest, but their added value still needs to be proven. In order to evaluate if and how fluorescence-guidance can help realize improvements beyond the current state-of-the-art in sentinel node (SN) biopsy procedures, use of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nancolloid was evaluated in a large cohort of patients.Patients and methodsA prospective trial was conducted (n=501 procedures) in aheterogeneous cohort of 495 patients with different malignancies (skin malignancies, oral cavity cancer, penile cancer, prostate cancer and vulva cancer). After injection of ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid, SNs were preoperatively identified based on lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT. Intraoperatively, SNs were pursued via gamma tracing, visual identification (blue dye) and/or near-infrared fluorescence imaging during either open surgical procedures (head and neck, penile, vulvar cancer and melanoma) or robot assisted laparoscopic surgery (prostate cancer). Asthe patients acted as their own control, use of hybrid guidance could becompared to conventional radioguidance and the use of blue dye (n=300). This was based on reported surgical complications, overall survival, LN recurrence free survival, and false negative rates (FNR).ResultsA total of 1,327 SN-related hotspots were identified on 501 preoperative SPECT/CT scans. Intraoperatively, a total number of 1,643 SNs were identified based on the combination of gamma-tracing (>98%) and fluorescence-guidance (>95%). In patients wherein blue dye was used (n=300) fluorescence-based SN detection was superior over visual blue dye-based detection (22-78%). No adverse effects related to the use of the hybrid tracer or the fluorescence-guidance procedure were found and outcome values were not negatively influenced.ConclusionWith ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid, the SN biopsy procedure has become more accurate and independent of the use of blue dye. With that, the procedure has evolved to be universal for different malignancies and anatomical locations.

TI  - Height of Successional Vegetation Indicates Moment of Agricultural Land Abandonment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major land use and land cover changes in Europe is agricultural land abandonment (ALA) that particularly affects marginal mountain areas. Accurate mapping of ALA patterns and timing is important for understanding its determinants and the environmental and socio-economic consequences. In highly fragmented agricultural landscapes with small-scale farming, subtle land use changes following ALA can be detected with high resolution remotely sensed data, and successional vegetation height is a possible indicator of ALA timing. The main aim of this study was to determine the relationship between successional vegetation height and the timing of agricultural land abandonment in the Budzow community in the Polish Carpathians. Areas of vegetation succession were vectorized on 1977, 1997, and 2009 orthophotomaps, enabling the distinguishing of vegetation encroaching on abandoned fields before and after 1997. Vegetation height in 2012-2014 was determined from digital surface and terrain models that were derived from airborne laser scanning data. The median heights of successional vegetation that started development before and after 1997 were different (6.9 m and 3.2 m, respectively). No significant correlations between successional vegetation height and elevation, slope, aspect, and proximity to forest were found. Thus, the timing of agricultural land abandonment is the most important factor influencing vegetation height, whereas environmental characteristics on this scale of investigation may be neglected.

TI  - Low rates of <i>Plasmodium falciparum Pfcrt</i> K76T mutation in three sentinel sites of malaria monitoring in Cote d'Ivoire
T2  - ACTA PARASITOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite efforts to eliminate it, malaria remains a major public health concern, particularly in Cote d'Ivoire. Chloroquine (CQ) was one of the first drugs used for its treatment, but was officially withdrawn from the market in 2007 following reports of high levels of chloroquine resistance. The present study was carried out after the withdrawal of CQ and provides an update on the rates of CQ resistance in Cote d'Ivoire. Samples were collected between September 2013 and March 2014 in Abidjan and from January to May 2016 in Abengourou and San Pedro through cross-sectional studies. Parasitemia was assessed by microscopy, and single nucleotide polymorphism in the Pfcrt (codon 76) gene was analyzed by nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. A total of 343 samples were analyzed: 119, 106 and 118 were from Abidjan, Abengourou, and San Pedro, respectively. The sex ratio of patients was 0.92. The mean age of patients enrolled was 9.6 years (SD = 10.8). The geometric mean of parasite density was 21,337 parasites/L (SD = 49,508; range, 2,000-200,000). Molecular analysis revealed 57 K76T mutants (16.6%): 33, 9, and 15 in Abidjan, Abengourou and in San Pedro, respectively. Most of these were found in patients aged 15 years (42/57) who had parasitemia greater than 10,000 parasites/L (40/57). This is the first study conducted in Cote d'Ivoire reporting a decline in Pfcrt K76T mutation rate. Thus, our results indicate the importance of following up on the observed trend also at a national level.

TI  - Mapping threats to agriculture in East Africa: Performance of MODIS derived LST for frost identification in Kenya's tea plantations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Frost is a major threat to crop productivity in the Kenyan highlands. With agriculture being central to the Kenyan economy, every effort needs to be taken to alleviate losses especially on high value crops like tea, the leading foreign exchange earner. Current frost mapping efforts by SERVIR, a joint initiative between National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and its hub institution in Eastern and Southern Africa, the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD), utilizes Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) to probabilistically map areas that have been affected by frost. In this paper, we assessed the accuracy of these frost maps by testing the performance of MYD11A1 MODIS product in indicating areas affected by frost. MODIS derived LST values corresponding to frost and no frost observation locations and dates were reclassified according to 6 predetermined categories representing frost severity levels. The overall accuracy of each threshold category as LST cutoff separating frost and no frost affected areas was determined. An overall performance measure was then estimated using a Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (ROC). Overall accuracies of 67.3%-71.9% among the thresholds were obtained. An area under the ROC curve of 0.69 was obtained, indicating a poor performance of MODIS LST to distinguish frost from no frost areas. This shows that although MODIS derived LST can be used to identify frost-affected areas, it is not on its own sufficient in discriminating these areas with high levels of accuracy. Revision of temperature thresholds is recommended, in addition to improved characterization of frost occurrence in the region to include other factors that may be affecting frost occurrence. These results stand to better prepare the agricultural sector for damaging weather related events.

TI  - Analysis of Undesirable Sequelae of Sentinel Node Surgery in Breast Cancer Patients - a Prospective Cohort Study
T2  - PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Use of sentinel lymph node biopsy limits the frequency and severity of sequelae of surgical treatment. However, the procedure itself may not be completely free of complications. The goal of this work was to analyze prospectively the occurrence of undesirable sequelae in patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy as an isolated intervention in the axillary fossa. This prospective observational study was conducted on a group of 104 women. Patients were examined on five occasions: one day before the procedure, one day after the procedure, one month, three months, and six months after the procedure. At every stage of the study they were assessed for tactile sensation, range of motion in the shoulder joint, upper limb circumference, sensation abnormalities, winged scapula sign, and pain severity according to Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). In the study group we observed statistically significant differences, such as limited mobility in the shoulder joint (p0.01), gradual increase in limb circumference on the operated side (p<0.01) and pain (p0.01). Despite relatively low invasiveness of the procedure, sentinel lymph node biopsy is not entirely devoid of the risk of undesirable sequelae.

TI  - Identifying Wetland Consolidation Using Remote Sensing in the North Dakota Prairie Pothole Region
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial drainage of wetlands in the Great Plains has been linked to increased runoff, erosion, and the consolidation of small, seasonal wetlands into larger, more permanent bodies of water. We analyzed hydrologic changes to over 1.2 million water bodies across the entire North Dakota portion of the Prairie Pothole Region using the ratio of aggregate water area and total perimetric length in a landscape-scale shape index calculated from existing Landsat derived data of water presence/absence. This ratio showed a clear change point toward more consolidation of wetlands around the period 1999 (+/- 1 year) after an extended multiyear period of above-average rainfall. We used hydrologic simulations with forcing data from across the region to show that this shift is unlikely to be due solely to natural variation in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Using county-level regressions, we found that wetland consolidation as measured by the shape index was highly correlated with agricultural transitions out of wheat and into corn and soybeans over the period 1984-2014 (R-2 > 0.4), though we do not find evidence of a strong correlation between reported drainage and wetland consolidation. These results highlight a potential hysteretic interaction involving interannual variations in hydrologic forcing and anthropogenic landscape alterations on wetland consolidation in the North Dakota prairie potholes.Plain Language Summary We measured the area and perimeter of a large number of water bodies in the North Dakota prairies using satellite imagery and found evidence of a clear break in their usual relationship around the year 1999 following a period of above-average rainfall. The magnitude of this change appears to be related to changes in agricultural practices across the region. These findings suggest that the behavior of wetland systems can change abruptly at large scales as a result of human-climate interactions.

T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and chlorophyll a in the Caspian Sea water column from April to November in 2008-2016 is analyzed. It is shown that the spatiotemporal variability of SPM concentration is defined by its sources, especially by the autochthonous (primary production) and allochthonous (particulate river runoff, aerosols) components. The effect of marginal filters of rivers on the volume of coming allochthonous SPM is considered. It is revealed that chlorophyll a is a reliable marker of the autochthonous component of SPM and biogenic sedimentation conditions. The stable vertical stratification defines the distribution of allochthonous and autochthonous SPM in the water column. Vertical profiles of these SPM components in the active layer (its thickness is usually up to similar to 60 m, more rarely to similar to 100 m) of the sea are similar in April and October-November and differ much in May-September.

TI  - Impact of UAS Global Hawk Dropsonde Data on Tropical and Extratropical Cyclone Forecasts in 2016
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - A preliminary investigation into the impact of dropsonde observations from the Global Hawk (GH) on tropical and extratropical forecasts is performed using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS). Experiments are performed during high-impact weather events that were sampled as part of the NOAA Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) Sensing Hazards with Operational Unmanned Technology (SHOUT) field campaigns in 2016: 1) three extratropical systems in February 2016 and 2) Hurricanes Matthew and Nicole in the western Atlantic. For these events, the benefits of GH observations under a satellite data gap scenario are also investigated. It is found that the assimilation of GH dropsondes reduces the track error for both Matthew and Nicole; the improvements are as high as 20% beyond 60 h. Additionally, the localized dropsondes reduce global forecast track error for four tropical cyclones by up to 9%. Results are mixed under a satellite gap scenario, where only Hurricane Matthew is improved from assimilated dropsondes. The improved storm track is attributed to a better representation of the steering flow and atmospheric midlevel pattern. For all cases, dropsondes reduce the root-mean-square error in temperature, relative humidity, wind, and sea level pressure by 3%-8% out to 96 h. Additional benefits from GH dropsondes are obtained for precipitation, with higher skill scores over the southeastern United States versus control forecasts of up to 8%, as well as for low-level parameters important for severe weather prediction. The findings from this study are preliminary and, therefore, more cases are needed for statistical significance.

TI  - Thermohaline structure, transport and evolution of the Black Sea eddies from hydrological and satellite data
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Combination of altimetry-based method of eddy identification and historical hydrological measurements for 1992-2015 is used to analyze the thermohaline and dynamic structure of the Black Sea eddies and its relation with eddy intensity, eddy age and season of a year. Anticyclonic eddies (AEs) are characterized by negative salinity anomalies, which can reach -1.7 psu at the depth of the main halocline. The temperature anomalies are positive in their upper layers, and negative in the deeper layers, because of the vertical displacement of the waters of the Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL). Cyclonic eddies (CEs) have the opposite structure with increased salinity, colder upper layers and warmer deeper layers. Thermohaline anomalies in the eddies of both signs are maximal in summer, while in winter they are shallowest and minimal. The displacement of pycnocline in eddies causes the decrease/increase of stratification in the upper layer of AEs/CEs and opposite increase/decrease in their deeper layers. It also causes the deepening/uplift of the layer of maximum geostrophic vertical shear in AEs/CEs. The latter is the probable reason of the observed higher intensity and deeper penetration of orbital velocities in AEs than in CEs. The changes of isopycnals positions during the eddies' lifetime are used to quantify the evolution of vertical velocity in AEs and CEs. In the beginning of AEs life during intensification phase, vertical velocity is directed downward, while during the decaying phase it change its sign and is directed upward. The opposite is observed in CEs. Vertical velocity is maximal at the pycnocline depth of 100-110 m with values changing from (- 8 to 8)* 10(-6) m/s in AEs, and from (+ 5 to -25)10(-6) m/s in CEs. Eddies thermohaline structure and altimetry-derived orbital velocity is tightly related. This relation obtained in the study and altimetry-derived data an the distribution of eddy frequency, translational speed and orbital velocity is used to quantify eddies salt, heat content and transport in the basin. The transport velocity of water in the eddies core (2-4 cm/s) is significantly smaller than the average velocity of the large-scale currents (similar to 10-40 cm/s). Such slowing causes the "relative" transport of eddies against the mean flow direction. This effect leads to the accumulation of brackish and cold water in the deep layers of east Black Sea and maintain the observed east-west asymmetry of the basin thermohaline fields.

TI  - Rediscovery of <i>Culex</i> (<i>Neoculex</i>) <i>martinii</i> Medschid, 1930 (Diptera, Culicidae) in Germany
T2  - PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The culicid Culex martinii is an extremely rare species in Germany, with only one reference in the scientific literature, according to which larvae were found once in 1935 in the eastern part of the country. During regular mosquito sampling activities with BG-Sentinel traps, Cx. martinii was rediscovered in autumn 2017 at one location in the German federal state of Thuringia. Prompted by this finding, the Peus mosquito collection at the Senckenberg Museum Frankfurt was checked for further specimens of this species. Indeed, it contained Cx. martinii specimens from two sites in southern Germany from 1973 in addition to the published finding from 1935 and further specimens from that latter site from 1936 and 1951. Due to its rarity, little is known on the ecology of Cx. martinii and nothing on a possible vector role.

TI  - How much can airborne laser scanning based forest inventory by tree species benefit from auxiliary optical data?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the benefit of three different optical data sources (Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and aerial images) to support airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in species-specific forest inventory. The data covered 633 sample plots in eastern Finland. We used nearest neighbor imputation for simultaneous prediction of Scots pine, Norway spruce and broadleaved species' volume by species group. The variable selection was performed by means of simulated annealing of different data combinations. The results showed that, on average, all optical data sources improved the species-specific plot volume predictions. The improvement was always greatest for broadleaves. The species-specific root mean square errors were 64.3%, 61.5%, 58.1% and 57.9% for ALS, ALS + Landsat 8, ALS + Sentinel-2 and ALS + aerial image data combinations, respectively, and 54.2% for ALS with the channels of both aerial images and Sentinel-2. Compared to using just ALS and aerial images, adding the Sentinel's second red edge and narrow near-infrared bands improved the separation of pine and spruce. Sentinel-2 outperformed Landsat 8 and was almost as good an option as aerial images. The results suggest that all optical data, from airborne or spaceborne sources, are useful when combined with ALS data in species-specific forest inventory.

TI  - Assessment of trophic state and water quality of coastal-inland lakes based on Fuzzy Inference System
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment and monitoring of coastal and inland water quality by satellite optical remote sensing is challenging due to improper atmospheric correction algorithm, inaccurate quantification of in-water constituents' concentration and a lack of efficient models to predict the water quality status. The present study aims to address the latter two parts in conjugation with an appropriate atmospheric correction algorithm to assess trophic status and water quality conditions of two coastal lagoons using Landsat-8 OLI data. Three vital underwater light attenuating factors, directly related to water quality, are considered namely, turbidity, chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (a(CDOM)). These water quality parameters are quantified based on certain sensitive normalised water-leaving radiance band ratios and threshold values. To assess the accuracy of the derived products, these algorithms were applied to independent in-situ data and statistical evaluation of the results showed good agreement between the estimated and measured values with the errors within desirable limits. Being a primary nutrient indicator, the chlorophyll concentration was used to evaluate Trophic State Index. The Water Quality Index was derived from three parameters namely, chlorophyll concentration, turbidity and a(CDOM)(443) which were expressed in terms of Trophic State Index, Turbidity Index and Humic-Fulvic Index, respectively. The Water Quality Index maps, derived using a Fuzzy Inference System based on the Centre of Gravity method, provided insights into spatial structures and temporal variability of water quality conditions of the coastal lagoons which are influenced by anthropogenic factors, hydrographic changes and land-ocean-atmospheric interaction processes.

TI  - Google Earth Engine Applications Since Inception: Usage, Trends, and Potential
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Google Earth Engine (GEE) portal provides enhanced opportunities for undertaking earth observation studies. Established towards the end of 2010, it provides access to satellite and other ancillary data, cloud computing, and algorithms for processing large amounts of data with relative ease. However, the uptake and usage of the opportunity remains varied and unclear. This study was undertaken to investigate the usage patterns of the Google Earth Engine platform and whether researchers in developing countries were making use of the opportunity. Analysis of published literature showed that a total of 300 journal papers were published between 2011 and June 2017 that used GEE in their research, spread across 158 journals. The highest number of papers were in the journal Remote Sensing, followed by Remote Sensing of Environment. There were also a number of papers in premium journals such as Nature and Science. The application areas were quite varied, ranging from forest and vegetation studies to medical fields such as malaria. Landsat was the most widely used dataset; it is the biggest component of the GEE data portal, with data from the first to the current Landsat series available for use and download. Examination of data also showed that the usage was dominated by institutions based in developed nations, with study sites mainly in developed nations. There were very few studies originating from institutions based in less developed nations and those that targeted less developed nations, particularly in the African continent.

TI  - Dynamics of suspended sediment load with respect to summer discharge and temperatures in Shaune Garang glacierized catchment, Western Himalaya
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The observed and predicted rise in temperature will have deleterious impact on melting of snow and ice and form of precipitation which is already evident in Indian Himalayan Region. The temperature-dependent entities like discharge and sediment load will also vary with the observed and predicted rise posing environmental, social and economic threat in the region. There is little known about sediment load transport in relation to temperature and discharge in glacierized catchments in Himalaya mainly due to the scarcity of ground-based observation. The present study is an attempt to understand the suspended sediment load and transportation in relation to variation in discharge and temperature in the Shaune Garang catchment. The result shows strong dependence of sediment concentration primarily on discharge (R-2 = 0.84) and then on temperature (R-2 = 0.79). The catchments with similar geological and climate setting were observed to have comparatively close weathering rate. The sediment load was found to be higher in the catchments in eastern and central part of Indian Himalayan Region in comparison with western part due to dominance of Indian Summer Monsoon leading to high discharge. The annual physical weathering rate in Shaune Garang catchment was found to be 411 t km(-2) year(-1) which has increased from 327 t km(-2) year(-1) in around three decades due to rise in temperature causing increase in discharge and proportion of debris-covered glacierized area.

TI  - Short-term forecasting of solar irradiance without local telemetry: A generalized model using satellite data
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the increasing integration of solar power into the electrical grid, forecasting short-term solar irradiance has become key for many applications, e.g. operational planning, power purchases, reserve activation, etc. In this context, as solar generators are geographically dispersed and ground measurements are not always easy to obtain, it is very important to have general models that can predict solar irradiance without the need of local data. In this paper, a model that can perform short-term forecasting of solar irradiance in any general location without the need of ground measurements is proposed. To do so, the model considers satellite-based measurements and weather-based forecasts, and employs a deep neural network structure that is able to generalize across locations; particularly, the network is trained only using a small subset of sites where ground data is available, and the model is able to generalize to a much larger number of locations where ground data does not exist. As a case study, 25 locations in The Netherlands are considered and the proposed model is compared against four local models that are individually trained for each location using ground measurements. Despite the general nature of the model, it is shown show that the proposed model is equal or better than the local models: when comparing the average performance across all the locations and prediction horizons, the proposed model obtains a 31.31% rRMSE (relative root mean square error) while the best local model achieves a 32.01% rRMSE.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage cervical cancer: A systematic review
T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure is included as part of the standard protocol of radical hysterectomy for women with early-stage cervical cancer (Stage IA to IB1). However, an important sequel to lymphadenectomy procedure is the possible occurrence of lymphedema in the lower abdomen and lower extremities. Previous researches also find that women with lymphedema experience many emotional impacts, including depression, anxiety, and adjustment problems. Only approximately 10% of women with clinical stage IB cervical carcinoma were involved with metastatic disease. If we could better define the relevant lymphatic nodes that must be removed, it is then possible to limit routinely performed lymphadenectomy for regional nodal metastasis in the pelvis, and hence reduce the need for extended surgical staging (para-aortic lymphadenectomy). We systematically reviewed a body of literature and updated available information concerning the current progress on the application of sentinel lymph node biopsy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. All detection methods (preoperative injection of radiocolloid tracer, intraoperative injection of blue dye, or a combination of both techniques) demonstrated reasonable sensitivity (with a few exceptions), high specificity, low false-negative rate and high negative predictive value. The review of the literature in this paper should convince the readers that sentinel lymph node biopsy has the potential to improve the quality of life and the possibility to maintain relapse-free survival for women with cervical cancer. The proper identification of negative sentinel lymph node allows individualized therapy and may preclude the need of lymphadenectomy procedure in most of these women.

TI  - Sentinel lymphatic mapping among women with early-stage cervical cancer: A systematic review
T2  - TAIWANESE JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence of pelvic lymph node metastases is without doubt the most significant prognostic factor that determines recurrences and survival of women with early-stage cervical cancer. To avoid the underdiagnosis of lymph node metastasis, pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure is routinely performed with radical hysterectomy procedure. However, the pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure may not be necessary in most of these women due to the relatively low incidence of pelvic lymph node metastasis. The removal of large numbers of pelvic lymph nodes could also render non-metastatic irreversible damages for these women, including vessel, nerve, or ureteral injuries; formation of lymphocysts; and lymphedema. Over the past decades, the concept of sentinel lymph node biopsy has emerged as a popular and widespread surgical technique for the evaluation of the pelvic lymph node status in gynecologic malignancies. The histological status of sentinel lymph node should be representative for all other lymph nodes in the regional drainage area. If metastasis is non-existent in the sentinel lymph node, the likelihood of metastatic spread in the remaining regional lymph nodes is very low. Further lymphadenectomy is therefore not necessary for a patient with negative sentinel lymph nodes. Since the uterine cervix has several lymphatic drainage pathways, it is a challenging task to assess the distribution pattern of sentinel lymph nodes in women with early-stage cervical cancer. This review article will adapt the methodology proposed in these studies to systematically review sentinel lymphatic mapping among women with early-stage cervical cancer.

TI  - An empirical model for prediction of wheat yield, using time-integrated Landsat NDVI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on long-term yield variability is important for tailoring farming practices to the needs of crops. We present a linear mixed-effects model to predict wheat yield at a within-field scale in the northern grain-growing region of Australia. The model predicts yield as a function of Landsat time-integrated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (iNDVI), and is trained on sparsely sampled yield-monitored data from 17 farms from 2001 to 2016. The model is flexibly parameterized, to use information from specific fields, farms or years, to capture local departures from the global yield-iNDVI relation. We estimated iNDVI numerically by integrating the area under a fitted asymmetric bell-shaped growth function, across the growing season (May to October), using NDVI time-series from April to November. We performed leave-one-out cross-validation, where data from individual farms, fields and years were omitted in a series of tests. Results showed moderate predictive accuracy at a within field scale, with an average RMSE of 0.79 Mg/ha. The spatial pattern of within-field yield variation was adequately represented. The benefit of the mixed-effects model is that, as well as describing the general relation between wheat yield and iNDVI, it explicitly considers the spatial and temporal differences among farms, fields and years, which are related to variations in soil conditions, farm-management practices and climate. The longterm archive of Landsat imagery combined with a growing archive of yield maps provides potential for the model to predict yield variation across large regions and many seasons. Such information could help farmers make decisions on site-specific soil and nutrient management, and simultaneously guide policy-makers towards regional development objectives.

TI  - Estimating smallholder crops production at village level from Sentinel-2 time series in Mali's cotton belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Mali's cotton belt, spatial variability in management practices, soil fertility and rainfall strongly impact crop productivity and the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. To identify crop growth conditions and hence improve food security, accurate assessment of local crop production is key. However, production estimates in heterogeneous smallholder farming systems often rely on labor-intensive surveys that are not easily scalable, nor exhaustive. Recent advances in high-resolution earth observation (EO) open up new possibilities to work in heterogeneous smallholder systems. This paper develops a method to estimate individual crop production at farm-to-community scales using high-resolution Sentinel-2 time series and ground data in the commune of Koningue, Mali. Our estimation of agricultural production relies on (i) a supervised, pixel-based crop type classification inside an existing cropland mask, (ii) a comparison of yield estimators based on spectral indices and derived leaf area index (LAI), and (iii) a Monte Carlo approach combining the resulting unbiased crop area estimate and the uncertainty on the associated yield estimate. Results show that crop types can be mapped from Sentinel-2 data with 80% overall accuracy (OA), with best performances observed for cotton (Fscore 94%), maize (88%) and millet (83%), while peanut (71%) and sorghum (46%) achieve less. Incorporation of parcel limits extracted from very high-resolution imagery is shown to increase OA to 85%. Obtained through inverse radiative transfer modeling, Sen2-Agri estimates of LAI achieve better prediction of final grain yield than various vegetation indices, reaching R-2 of 0.68, 0.62, 0.8 and 0.48 for cotton, maize, millet and sorghum respectively. The uncertainty of Monte Carlo production estimates does not exceed 0.3% of the total production for each crop type.

TI  - Development of Operational Applications for TerraSAR-X
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the course of the TerraSAR-X mission, various new applications based on X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data have been developed and made available as operational products or services. In this article, we elaborate on proven characteristics of TerraSAR-X that are responsible for development of operational applications. This article is written from the perspective of a commercial data and service provider and the focus is on the following applications with high commercial relevance, and varying operational maturity levels: Surface Movement Monitoring (SMM), Ground Control Point (GCP) extraction and Automatic Target Recognition (ATR). Based on these applications, the article highlights the successful transition of innovative research into sustainable and operational use within various market segments. TerraSAR-X's high orbit accuracy, its precise radar beam tracing, the high-resolution modes, and high-quality radiometric performance have proven to be the instrument's advanced characteristics, through, which reliable ground control points and surface movement measurements are obtained. Moreover, TerraSAR-X high-resolution data has been widely exploited for the clarity of its target signatures in the fields of target intelligence and identification. TerraSAR-X's multi temporal interferometry applications are non-invasive and are now fully standardised autonomous tools to measure surface deformation. In particular, multi-baseline interferometric techniques, such as Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PSI) and Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) benefit from TerraSAR-X's highly precise orbit information and phase stability. Similarly, the instrument's precise orbit information is responsible for sub-metre accuracy of Ground Control Points (GCPs), which are essential inputs for orthorectification of remote sensing imagery, to locate targets, and to precisely georeference a variety of datasets. While geolocation accuracy is an essential ingredient in the intelligence field, high-resolution TerraSAR-X data, particularly in Staring SpotLight mode has been widely used in surveillance, security and reconnaissance applications in real-time and also by automatic or assisted target recognition software.

TI  - Uncertainty estimation method and Landsat 7 global validation for the Landsat surface temperature product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface temperature is a valuable metric for many Earth monitoring applications, which motivated the development of the Landsat Surface Temperature (LST) product. The initial LST algorithm, developed by Cook, was geographically restricted since the atmospheric inputs and truth data were limited to North America (Cook, 2014. Atmospheric Compensation for a Landsat Land Surface Temperature Product. Rochester Institute of Technology). The main objectives for this product are to produce an LST image for every available Landsat thermal image, and to also provide a per-pixel estimate of LST uncertainty. Various studies were performed in order to allow the LST algorithm to operate globally, after which a thorough global validation study was performed for Landsat 7 images. In this study, the LST algorithm was found to have an average error for all cases of -0.211 K compared to the MODIS Sea Surface Temperature (SST) product. For cases where transmission was less than 0.3 and clouds were within 1 km of the validation, the LST RMSE was 2.61 K. When transmission was at least 0.85 and clouds were more than 40 km away, the RMSE was 0.51 K. A LST uncertainty estimation method was developed that utilizes standard error propagation in combination with observed trends between LST error, transmission, and cloud proximity. When the uncertainty method was applied to the global validation dataset, 20% of the estimated LST uncertainties were less than 1 K and 63% were less than 2 K. LST uncertainty can be extended to other Landsat sensors pending small validation studies, and will be an extremely beneficial tool for users, since it allows them to select all pixels in an LST image that meet their accuracy requirements.

TI  - Surgeon-associated variation in breast cancer staging with sentinel node biopsy
T2  - SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for axillary staging in early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer, so it is paramount that this operation be both precise and accurate, because excessive sentinel lymph node removal increases morbidity, whereas understaging risks inadequate treatment. The goal of this study was to assess surgeon variation in the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed and the oncologic yield of sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer.Methods: All patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database who underwent operative treatment for breast cancer from 2007-2011 were eligible for inclusion. Deidentified provider codes were used to track operations performed by individual surgeons. Only records in which an individual surgeon could be linked to a specific breast cancer operation were analyzed. The total number of sentinel lymph nodes removed and the number that were pathologically positive (oncologic yield) were recorded. Surgeon variation by T stage was analyzed using linear mixed-effects regression and logistic mixed-effects regression models.Results: Query of the database identified 15,571 patients who met inclusion criteria, representing 2,478 providers. The mean number of sentinel lymph node procedures performed per provider per year was 1.3 (range 1-103). The lowest quartile of providers performed 1 or fewer sentinel lymph node procedures per year. The highest quartile of providers performed >8 sentinel lymph node procedures per year.The average number of sentinel lymph node removed per operation increased with increasing T stage for all providers (P < .001), including when NO (P < .001) and node-positive (P = .003) patients were evaluated separately. There was surgeon-associated variation in the number of sentinel lymph node removed for each T stage (P < .001). In addition, there was surgeon-associated variation in the oncologic yield (sentinel lymph node positivity rate) by T stage (P < .001).Conclusion: This study found surgeon-associated variation in axillary sentinel lymph node staging of breast cancer patients, which suggests the need to improve standardization of surgical practices to optimize the oncologic yield of these procedures and ensure accurate staging.

TI  - Collaboration Across Worldviews: Managers and Scientists on Hawai'i Island Utilize Knowledge Coproduction to Facilitate Climate Change Adaptation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex socio-ecological issues, such as climate change have historically been addressed through technical problem solving methods. Yet today, climate science approaches are increasingly accounting for the roles of diverse social perceptions, experiences, cultural norms, and worldviews. In support of this shift, we developed a research program on Hawai'i Island that utilizes knowledge coproduction to integrate the diverse worldviews of natural and cultural resource managers, policy professionals, and researchers within actionable science products. Through their work, local field managers regularly experience discrete land and waterscapes. Additionally, in highly interconnected rural communities, such as Hawai'i Island, managers often participate in the social norms and values of communities that utilize these ecosystems. Such local manager networks offer powerful frameworks within which to co-develop and implement actionable science. We interviewed a diverse set of local managers with the aim of incorporating their perspectives into the development of a collaborative climate change research agenda that builds upon existing professional networks utilized by managers and scientists while developing new research products. We report our manager needs assessment, the development process of our climate change program, our interactive forums, and our ongoing research products. Our needs assessment showed that the managers' primary source of information were other professional colleagues, and our in-person forums informed us that local managers are very interested in interacting with a wider range of networks to build upon their management capacities. Our initial programmatic progress suggests that co-created research products and in-person forums strengthen the capacities of local managers to adapt to change.

TI  - Perceiving the Divine: Alexander Schmemann and the Sacramental Affordances of the Liturgy
T2  - MODERN THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orthodox liturgical theologian Alexander Schmemann is well known for his view that the liturgy is the locus theologicus par excellence and the fundamental source of a sacramental worldview. In this article, I develop these insights from Schmemann by drawing upon James Gibson's ecological psychology of perceptual affordances and the Patristic doctrine of spiritual senses. I argue that the liturgy is a privileged place for the cultivation of spiritual senses, which are necessary for perceiving the world sacramentally. I first focus on the liturgical objects of spiritual perception, which I conceptualize in terms of sacramental affordances. I then turn to the liturgical subject of spiritual perception, the homo adorans, and examine the way spiritual senses enable the perception of sacramental affordances in the liturgy. By reinforcing the philosophical and theological foundations of Schmemann's sacramental vision, I demonstrate the continual relevance of the liturgy for Christian formation.

TI  - Analysis of Ship Classification Performances Using OpenSARShip DB
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship monitoring using satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images consists of ship detection, ship discrimination, and ship classification. A large number of methods have been proposed to improve the detection and discrimination capabilities, while only a few studies exist for ship classification. Thus, many studies for the ship classification are needed to construct ship monitoring system having high performance. Note that constructing database (DB), which contains both SAR images and labels of various ships, is important for research on the ship classification. In the airborne SAR classification, many methods have been developed using moving and stationary target acquisition and recognition (MSTAR) DB. However, there has been no publicly available DB for research on the ship classification using satellite SAR images. Recently, Shanghai Key Laboratory has constructed OpenSARShip DB using both SAR images of various ships generated from Sentinel-1 satellite of European Space Agency (ESA) and automatic identification system (AIS) information. Thus, the applicability of OpenSARShip DB for ship classification should be investigated by using the concepts of airborne SAR classification which have shown high performances. In this study, ship classification using satellite SAR images are conducted by applying the concepts of airborne SAR classification to OpenSARShip DB, and then the applicability of OpenSARShip DB is investigated by analyzing the classification performances.

TI  - Barriers to reporting of patient safety incidents in tertiary hospitals: A qualitative study of nurses and resident physicians in South Korea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We explored the barriers to reporting patient safety incidents experienced by nurses and resident physicians while working in tertiary hospitals in South Korea. Sixteen in-depth interviews with 10 nurses and 6 resident physicians, all of whom had experienced patient safety incidents, were conducted. The interviews were analyzed using directed content analysis in accordance with a coding scheme developed in this study, which contains 4 categories (incidents and reporters, reporting procedures and systems, feedbacks, and reporting culture) and 9 subcategories. The barriers to reporting near-misses included the following: characteristics of the incident (eg, nonhazardous and high frequency), reporters' lack of knowledge, uncertainty, fear of blame, lack of role model, and inappropriate responses. Reporting adverse/sentinel events was also prevented by feelings of pressure or guilt, the fact that reporting was nonmandatory, and a belief that reporting was not part of the job. Some other barriers included lack of education, review process after reporting, lack of confidentiality when reporting, absence of feedback for reporting, unfair reporting based on work experience, perception of potential blame, and stigmatization resulting from it. In South Korea, a national system for reporting and learning of patient safety accidents has been operating since July 2016. To fully implement this system, it is necessary to encourage reporting at the institutional level. Our results might help reduce the barriers to patient safety incident reporting among nurses and resident physicians in tertiary hospitals in Korea through informing the development of improvement plans.

TI  - Intraoperative Imaging with a Portable Gamma Camera May Reduce the False-Negative Rate for Melanoma Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article

CP  - 71st Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology (SSO)
CL  - Chicago, IL
AB  - Preoperative imaging and intraoperative gamma probe (GP) localization is standard for identifying sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in melanoma patients. The aim of this prospective Institutional Review Board-approved study was to investigate whether an intraoperative portable gamma camera (PGC) improves SLN detection over the GP.Lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography were performed after injection of 99mTc-Tilmanocept in melanoma patients (ae<yen> 18 years, Breslow thickness >= 1.0 mm). A GP was used to localize the SLNs in each basin, which was explored by the GP to ensure that the operative field was < 10% counts of the hottest SLN. The PGC was then used after a negative GP screening. Any residual hotspots identified by the PGC were considered as additional SLNs and were removed following the 10% rule.Preoperative imaging of 100 patients identified 138 SLN basins, with 306 SLNs being identified by conventional surgery. The PGC localized 89 additional SLNs in 54 patients. Thus, the PGC identified an additional 23% of SLNs [95% confidence interval (CI) 18-27%]. Four of these 89 SLNs showed micrometastasis in four patients, in two of whom the only tumor-positive SLN was identified by the PGC, preventing two false-negative cases. Thus, the null hypothesis that the PGC did not detect additional positive SLNs was rejected (p = 0.000). The overall SLN positive rate was 9.9% (39/395, 95% CI 6-12), and the overall patient positive rate was increased using the PGC, from 25 to 27% (27/100).Intraoperative PGC imaging yielded additional SLNs in a significant number of patients over GP alone. Identification of these additional SLNs resulted in upstaging of four patients with two patients being converted from a negative to a positive status, thus, preventing two false-negative cases.

TI  - The Anthroposeen: The Invention of Linear Perspective as a Decisive Moment in the Emergence of a Geological Age of Mankind
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The beginning of the Anthropocene has been inconclusively debated. Usually, its starting point is linked to the moment in which some measurable human physical impact, such as global carbon dioxide emissions, increased in an unprecedented manner. However, to grasp the fact that mankind became at some point the major change agent of the earth system it is important to identify how and when humans began to perceive their role as that of an active creator, capable of dominating and changing nature. Although no monocausal explanation exists, I argue that the invention of linear perspective in fifteenth-century Renaissance Italy was a major trigger. Linear perspective changed the way humans saw and interpreted the world around them. It fostered an anthropocentric worldview that placed humans in control of their physical environment, allowed the advancement of scientific methods and the ultimate disenchantment of the physical world. Linear perspective marks the beginning of the 'Anthroposeen' without which the Anthropocene would not have manifested itself in the accelerated way it has. This holds important lessons. It reminds us that to understand the nature of the Anthropocene, we have to understand the parameters that made us think, see and ultimately act the way we do.

TI  - Cross-contamination of Pathology Specimens: A Cautionary Tale
T2  - CUTIS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many potential sources of error in clinical practice. An astute clinician must not only work hard to prevent errors but also minimize harmful sequelae that could arise from errors that do occur. A rare but real source of error is cross-contamination of pathology specimens. Such contaminants are colloquially referred to as floaters. If not recognized expediently, floaters can lead to misdiagnoses that may prompt unnecessary and inappropriate treatment. We report the case of a patient with a benign adnexal neoplasm on the face that, due to cross-contamination of pathology specimens, was initially diagnosed as an aggressive invasive melanoma that would have warranted wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Review of solar irradiance and daylight illuminance modeling and sky classification
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In many parts of the world, the solar radiation and daylight illuminance data taken from surfaces of interest are not always readily available. Without direct measurement, the data can be predicted from empirical models based on geographical variations and meteorological parameters. Recently, the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) has adopted a list of 15 standard skies. Each standard sky represents a unique, well-defined sky radiance and luminance pattern expressed by mathematical equations that can use to compute solar irradiance and daylight illuminance on inclined surfaces and variously oriented vertical planes. An issue is whether the sky conditions can be correctly categorized. This paper reviews the solar radiation and daylight illuminance model developments and sky classification methods. The findings indicated that Machine Learning techniques have been effectively used for predicting solar radiation and daylight illuminance and classifying the standard skies. Such approaches could be globally adopted and useful to compute the required climatic data for renewable and sustainable developments and energy-efficient building designs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analyzing Trends of Dike-Ponds between 1978 and 2016 Using Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images in Shunde District of South China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dike-ponds have experienced significant changes in the Pearl River Delta region over the past several decades, especially since China's economic reform, which has seriously affected the construction of ecological environments. In order to monitor the evolution of dike-ponds, in this study we use multi-source remote sensing images from 1978 to 2016 to extract dike-ponds in several periods using the nearest neighbor classification method. A corresponding area weighted dike-pond invasion index (AWDII) is proposed to describe the spatial evolution of dike-ponds, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the evolution mechanisms of dike-ponds are determined, which can be attributed to both natural conditions and human factors. Our results show that the total area of dike-ponds in 2016 was significantly reduced and fragmentation had increased compared with the situation in 1978. The AWDII reveals that Shunde District has experienced three main phases, including steady development, rapid invasion and a reduction of invasion by other land use types. Most dike-ponds have now converted into built-up areas, followed by cultivated lands, mainly due to government policies, rural area depopulation, and river networks within Shunde. Our study indicates that the AWDII is applicable towards the evaluation of the dynamic changes of dike-ponds. The rational development, and careful protection, of dike-ponds should be implemented for better land and water resource management.

TI  - Hyperspectral and LiDAR Fusion Using Deep Three-Stream Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been intensively investigated for the classification of remote sensing data by extracting invariant and abstract features suitable for classification. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for the fusion of hyperspectral images and LiDAR-derived elevation data based on CNN and composite kernels. First, extinction profiles are applied to both data sources in order to extract spatial and elevation features from hyperspectral and LiDAR-derived data, respectively. Second, a three-stream CNN is designed to extract informative spectral, spatial, and elevation features individually from both available sources. The combination of extinction profiles and CNN features enables us to jointly benefit from low-level and high-level features to improve classification performance. To fuse the heterogeneous spectral, spatial, and elevation features extracted by CNN, instead of a simple stacking strategy, a multi-sensor composite kernels (MCK) scheme is designed. This scheme helps us to achieve higher spectral, spatial, and elevation separability of the extracted features and effectively perform multi-sensor data fusion in kernel space. In this context, a support vector machine and extreme learning machine with their composite kernels version are employed to produce the final classification result. The proposed framework is carried out on two widely used data sets with different characteristics: an urban data set captured over Houston, USA, and a rural data set captured over Trento, Italy. The proposed framework yields the highest OA of for Houston and Trento data sets. Experimental results confirm that the proposed fusion framework can produce competitive results in both urban and rural areas in terms of classification accuracy, and significantly mitigate the salt and pepper noise in classification maps.

TI  - A Fast Reprojection Method for MODIS Products with Sinusoidal Projection
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For studies and applications based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products with sinusoidal (SIN) projection, reprojection often is required. But this process can be time-consuming. To accelerate this procedure, this study proposes a practical fast reprojection method that includes 3 major features. (1) Only pixels in target projection space that have corresponding points in MODIS products ("effective pixels") are further processed. (2) Tags of effective pixels and their corresponding points in MODIS products are retrieved and stored by 1-dimensional (1-D) index of image matrix rather than 2-dimensional subscripts. (3) Pixel values in target images are assigned from MODIS products in bulk rather than in a loop procedure that assigns pixels one by one. In a comparative analysis, the proposed method performs better than the other three tested methods. Based on these improvements, use of prestored 1-D indices of corresponding pixel pairs significantly speeds reprojection. It therefore shows the potential for batch processing of large volume of MODIS products with a SIN projection in reasonable time.

TI  - A model for downscaling SMOS soil moisture using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A model for downscaling SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) soil moisture products is developed by using multi-temporal dual-polarized (HH + HV) C-band SAR data. In this model, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture retrieval from SAR data is minimized by using the water-cloud model (WCM), in which vegetation contribution is quantified using the backscatter coefficient of HV polarization. The wavelet transform is used to fuse high resolution Sentinel-1A SAR backscatter with low resolution SMOS soil moisture, where the difference in spatial heterogeneity between scales is also accounted for. The influence of soil surface roughness is eliminated by using multi-temporal data. The multi-temporal SMOS soil moisture and dual-pol Sentinel-1/SAR data are the only inputs of this downscaling model. The model is tested in southern Ontario, Canada to downscale 40 km resolution SMOS soil moisture to 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions. The downscaled results show good agreements with the in-situ soil moisture collected in May and July of 2016 with an unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.045 m(3)/m(3) and 0.047 m(3)/m(3) and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.54 and 0.70 at 1.25 km and 2.5 km resolutions respectively. The results suggest that the model can be applied for C-band at regional scales to provide continuous soil moisture mapping at higher resolutions. The high revisit frequency of the up-coming Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) combined with its large areal coverage characteristics are ideal for the generation of downscaled products.

TI  - A directional thermal radiance model for row crop canopy impact of sensor footprint
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The direction of thermal radiance is one of the key problems in thermal infrared remote sensing retrieval and product validation. Aiming at row crop, a directional thermal radiance model is built by considering the sunlit/shaded leaf, sunlit/shaded soil, multiple scattering and field of view. The accuracy and sensitivity of the model are discussed and the results show that the model can not only explain the row crop structure and hot spot effect well, but also be suitable for simulating the thermal radiance of continuous canopy. Compared with the FRA97 and the FovMod model, the directional distributions of directional brightness temperature are in good agreement. The root mean square error is 0.18 K and 0.36 K respectively.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Vegetation Greenness Change and Associated Climatic and Anthropogenic Drivers on the Tibetan Plateau during 2000-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine vegetation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is known to be sensitive to both climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. However, the magnitude and patterns of alpine vegetation dynamics and the driving mechanisms behind their variation on the TP remains under debate. In this study, we used updated MODIS Collection 6 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Terra satellite combined with linear regression and the Break for Additive Season and Trend model to reanalyze the spatiotemporal patterns of vegetation change on the TP during 2000-2015. We then quantified the responses of vegetation variation to climatic and anthropogenic factors by coupling climatic and human footprint datasets. Results show that growing season NDVI (GNDVI) values increased significantly overall (0.0011 year(-1), p < 0.01) during 2000-2015 and that 70.37% of vegetated area on the TP (23.47% significantly with p < 0.05) exhibited greening trends with the exception of the southwest TP. However, vegetation greenness experienced trend shifts from greening to browning in half of the ecosystem zones occurred around 2010, likely induced by spatially heterogeneous temporal trends of climate variables. The vegetation changes in the northeastern and southwestern TP were water limited, the mid-eastern TP exhibited strong temperature responses, and the south of TP was driven by a combination of temperature and solar radiation. Furthermore, we found that, to some extent, anthropogenic disturbances offset climate-driven vegetation greening and aggravated vegetation browning induced by water deficit. These findings suggest that the impact of anthropogenic activities on vegetation change might not overwhelm that of climate change at the region scale.

TI  - Dynamics of vegetation autumn phenology and its response to multiple environmental factors from 1982 to 2012 on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Autumn phenological shifts induced by environmental change have resulted in substantial impacts on ecosystem processes. However, autumn phenology and its multiple related controlling factors have not beenwell studied. In this study, the spatiotemporal patterns of the end date of the vegetation growing season (EGS) and their multiple controls (climate change, summer vegetation growth and human activities) over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) were investigated using the satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based on GIMMS3g datasets during 1982-2012. The results showed that there was no significant temporal trend in the EGS during the period of 1982-2012. Spatially, there was a notable advancing trend in the southwest region and a delayed trend in the other regions of the QTP during 1982-2000, and this spatial trend was reversed during 2001-2012. We found average temperature, precipitation and sunshine duration of autumn exerted positive effects on EGS on the QTP, while average temperature and sunshine duration of summer exerted negative effects. Our results indicated that vegetation growth in summer tends to induce an earlier EGS in alpine vegetation, whereas summer vegetation degradation could delay the EGS on the QTP. In contrast, moderate grazing delays vegetation browning in autumn, while overgrazing leads to advancement of grass senescence. This study improves our understanding of how multiple environmental variables jointly affect autumn phenology and highlights the importance of biotic controls for autumn phenology on the QTP.

TI  - EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED BUILDING DETECTION BASED ON OBJECT-LEVEL TEXTURE FEATURE CHANGE DETECTION OF MULTI-TEMPORAL SAR IMAGES
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The damage of buildings is the major cause of casualties of from earthquakes. The traditional pixel-based earthquake damaged building detection method is prone to be affected by speckle noise. In this paper, an object-based change detection method is presented for the detection of earthquake damage using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The method is based on object-level texture features of SAR data. Firstly, the principal component analysis is used to transform the optimal texture features into a suitable feature space for extracting the key change. And then, the feature space is clustered by the watershed segmentation algorithm, which introduces the concept of object orientation and carries out the calculation of the difference map at the object level. Having training samples, the classification threshold values for different grade of earthquake damage can be trained, and the detection of damaged building is achieved. The proposed method could visualize the earthquake damage efficiently using the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-1 (ALOS-1) images. Its performance is evaluated in the town of jiegu, which was hit severely by the Yushu Earthquake. The cross-validation results shows that the overall accuracy is significantly higher than TDCD and IDCD.

TI  - Monitoring the tabular icebergs C28A and C28B calved from the Mertz Ice Tongue using radar remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the evolution processes of two tabular icebergs, C28A and C28B, originating from iceberg C28, using continuous multisource radar remote sensing data. The monitoring began during the calving of iceberg C28 from the Mertz Ice Tongue in February 2010 and ended in April 2012. The evolution of the iceberg area was determined from ENVISAT ASAR images, and the freeboard change was derived from CryoSat-2 profiles. Two patterns of iceberg area decreases are observed during iceberg drifting. In austral summer (from October to next March), iceberg area shows a gradual decrease and it is interpreted to represent edge wasting, sidewall melting and wave erosion, the gradual decrease of the area of C28A occurred at rates between 8.1 km(2)/month and 16.5 km(2)/month. In austral winter (from April to September), iceberg area has several discrete decreases (sudden drop) while it remained constant for most of the time, and it is interpreted to be large rift calving primarily caused by ocean swell and basal melting. Calving area of the two studied icebergs is observed to be greater in the winter. The freeboard decreased at different rates at different locations on the same iceberg (between -0.02 +/- 0.22 and -0.82 +/- 0.28 m/month for C28A and C28B), suggesting a laterally inhomogeneous melting of icebergs. The average rate of change of the C28B freeboard during its 22-month grounding period was -0.03 +/- 0.01 m/month, which is considerably smaller than the -0.76 +/- 0.23 m/month observed when it was freely drifting in the ocean. The cold-water regime surrounding the iceberg can help the iceberg maintain a stable state. This study reveals the potential use of radar remote sensing when monitoring Antarctic icebergs.

TI  - Mapping annual urban dynamics (1985-2015) using time series of Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The information of urban dynamics at fine spatiotemporal resolutions is crucial to urban growth modeling and sustainable urban development. However, there are still challenges in deriving the change information of urbanization in timing and location over a long period. In this study, we developed a framework to map urban expansion at an annual interval from 1985 to 2015 by using the time series of Landsat data. First, the time series of Landsat data (1985-2015) were grouped into three periods, i.e., 1985-2001, 2001-2011, and 2011-2015, according to the available National Land Cover Database (NLCD). Then, a temporal segmentation approach was implemented for each period using three indicators representing changes from vegetation, water, and bare land to urban. Turning years of the start and end of change were identified. Three temporal segments representing phases of prior change, change, and post change, were generated accordingly. Thereafter, urban extents before 2001 and after 2011 were classified using a change vector analysis (CVA) based approach aided by the NLCD and identified temporal segments. Finally, urbanized pixels in each period were determined according to the identified turning years. Our approach of temporal segmentation is reliable for detecting changes caused by urban growth, with an overall accuracy of 90% in identifying turning years (+/- 1 year). Using an independent validation sample set, the CVA based approach reaches an overall accuracy of 87%. The derived product of urban dynamics shows a relatively stable increment of urban growth in Des Moines and Ames, Iowa, US, and most urbanized areas were converted from vegetated lands within 2-3 years. The proposed framework is capable of mapping long-term dynamics of urban extents at an annual interval and the outcome is useful in effectively updating current products of urban extents and improving urban growth modeling.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 1st International Workshop on Advancement of Polarimetric Observations - Calibration and Improved Aerosol Retrievals (APOLO)
CL  - Hefei, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) is the first Chinese multi-angle polarized earth observation satellite sensor, which will be launched onboard the GaoFen-5 Satellite in Chinese High-resolution Earth Observation Program. GaoFen-5 runs in a sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination angle of 98, with the 13:30 PM local overpass time and the 2-days revisiting period. DPC employed a charge coupled device detection unit with 512 x 512 effective pixels from the 544 x 512 useful pixels, realizing spatial resolution of 3.3 km under a swath width of 1850 km. Meanwhile, DPC has 3 polarized channels (490, 670 and 865 nm) together with 5 non-polarized bands (443, 565, 763, 765 and 910 nm), and can obtain at least 9 viewing angles by continuously capturing series images over the same target on orbit. Based on the optimal estimation theory and improved bidirectional reflectance distribution function model, an inversion framework for the simultaneous retrieval of aerosol and surface parameters is presented by taking full advantage of available radiometric and polarimetric measurements. The retrieved wavelength-independent fine-mode and coarse-mode aerosol volumes are used to assess the DPC performance on the inversion capability of spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD), from which the Angstrom exponent and fine-mode fraction (FMF) could be further obtained. In addition, based on the synthetic DPC data for various observation geometries, aerosols and surface types, the aerosol inversion capabilities are systematically evaluated, and the information content analysis results show that the aerosol spectral optical properties can be well retrieved over various land surfaces.

TI  - Urban landscape extraction and analysis in the mega-city of China's coastal regions using high-resolution satellite imagery: A case of Shanghai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of urban land-cover classes and their spatial patterns are important problems in urban ecology, especially in ecologically fragile coastal areas. It is of great significance to those who optimize urban functional zones and are involved in urban planning management and sustainable development. High-resolution imagery has become an instrumental data source for detailed urban spatial pattern analysis, due to the complex structure of urban land covers made it difficult to achieve accurate and detailed information for urban landscape using medium or low-resolution images. In this study, based on China's GaoFen-1 (GF-1) high spatial resolution remote sensing images and a reference dataset, an information extraction technology based on a combination of pixel-, object-, and knowledge- based methods is developed to classify the land covers in urban built-up areas (BUAs) of Shanghai, China. The mapping and landscape pattern analysis of urban BUAs in Shanghai has been completed based on the results of land cover classification. The experimental results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficients of the land-cover classification in Shanghai urban BUAs are 83.7% and 0.71, respectively, which provide effective and reliable data for spatial mapping and landscape pattern analysis. Through the landscape analysis of the classification results of land cover in Shanghai, the results demonstrated that not only is there a high degree of exploitation and utilization of land resources in Shanghai but also that the spatial distribution pattern of land cover types is reasonable, which indicates that its development is sustainable.

TI  - Soil Moisture Retrieval Using UWB Echoes via Fuzzy Logic and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) retrieval using wireless signals has become a research focus with the development of sensor devices in Internet of Things. Studies applying ground-penetrating radar have improved the accuracy of SM retrieval; however, the field-scaled data are hardly satisfactory mainly due to the frequency response of the antenna, and it is not cost-effective for farmers to monitor the soil conditions. In this paper, we compare two fuzzy logic systems (FLSs): 1) type-1 FLS and 2) adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to extract fuzzy parameters of soil. Moreover, two machine learning algorithms: 1) random forest (RF) and 2) artificial neural network with principal component analysis are applied in the SM classifications. Nine types of UWB soil echoes of different texture and volume water content (VWC) are collected and investigated using our approaches. Final analysis shows that ANFIS with RF provides the best VWC correct recognition rate compared to other algorithms.

TI  - A new, valid measure of climate change understanding: associations with risk perception
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationship between climate change understanding and other variables, including risk perception, beliefs, and worldviews, is an important consideration as we work to increase public attention to climate change. Despite significant effort to develop rigorous mechanisms for measuring affective variables, measurement of climate change understanding is often relegated to unvalidated questions or question sets. To remedy this situation, we constructed and analyzed a climate change concept inventory using a suite of validity and reliability steps, including Rasch analysis. The resultant 21-item test has a high degree of validity and reliability for measuring understanding about basic climate change processes. Inventory scores along with other variables were included in a model of climate change risk perception, providing both concurrent validity for the test and new insight into the importance of understanding, worldview, and values on risk perception. We find that environmental beliefs and cultural cognition worldview play a larger role in predicting an individual's risk perception than knowledge. Implications for addressing climate change are considered.

AB  - The detection of radioactive noble gas isotopes is one of the key tools in detecting underground nuclear explosions, but other volatile elemental species, that have historically been overlooked, may also migrate to the surface. To investigate this possibility we have been studying which elements are most readily volatilized into air from solid materials (rocks, concrete, glass, etc.) following short duration (60-120 s) spot heating spanning a wide temperature range (100-2000 degrees C). The widest possible range of elements (Li-U) was monitored during the experiments that produced some unexpected results with regards to the apparent atmospheric persistence of some volatile signatures long after heating had ceased and the sample had returned to room temperature. Results highlighting elemental volatility as a function of temperature from different materials will be presented along with examples illustrating the extended periods over which some elements remain detectable by real time atmospheric sampling.

TI  - Soil Erosion Potential at Sungai Bilut Catchment, Raub, Pahang using Integration of RUSLE and GIS
T2  - SAINS MALAYSIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use activities within catchment area are one of the factors contributing to deterioration of river water quality due to soil erosion. Potential soil erosion at the Sungai Bilut catchment, which is the main source of water supply in Raub district, can be determined using Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and Geographical Information System (GIS). The aims of this research were to determine the potential soil loss and also to determine the main factors that influence the rate of soil erosion. This study involved analysis of secondary data of rainfall, soil series and topography data to generate factors of rainfall erosivity (R), soil erodibility (K) and length and steepness of slope (LS). Vegetation coverage and conservation practices factors were generated from satellite image of Landsat 8 (2014). The results showed that the R factor value in the study area is 8927.68-9775.18 MJ mm ha(-1) h(-1) yr(-1), K value is 0.0036-0.500 tones h(-1) MJ(-1) mm(-1), LS value is 0-514, C value is 0.03-0.80 and P value is 0.1-0.7. The area that has very low to low erosion potential is 81%, while medium to very high erosion potential is 19% of total study area. The model has an accuracy of 81%. The main factors that contribute to the potential of soil erosion in the study area are topography, vegetation cover, and soil erodibility. The results indicated the potential of integration of RUSLE and GIS analysis in determination of potential soil erosion in wide area consisting of various land use, topography and soil type.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in women today. It is surgically staged, and while surgery is the primary treatment modality, the identification of disease extent-in particular extrauterine spread-prior to surgery is important to optimize treatment decision making. Ultrasound and MRI are useful for evaluating the extent of local disease, while CT and PET are used for detecting lymph node or distant metastases. Diffusion-weighted MRI has also been used for detecting small metastatic deposits in lymph nodes and omentum. Extrauterine soft tissue involvement can be detected by ultrasound, CT, MRI, and PET. Recently, intraoperative visualization techniques, such as sentinel lymph node mapping, are increasingly used to avoid extensive surgical staging without compromising treatment. Imaging is also used for planning adjuvant treatment and detection of postoperative residual disease in high-risk patients, monitoring and detecting recurrent disease, and in post-treatment surveillance of asymptomatic patients with high risk of relapse.

TI  - Ground subsidence monitoring with SAR interferometry techniques in the rural area of Al Wagan, UAE
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate the past and present land deformation in Al Wagan area in the United Arab Emirates. The area is primarily an agricultural region where dependence on groundwater is documented. Such a reliance on ground water resources in a region which is characterized by very low precipitation can lead to significant land subsidence as was observed in this study which identified fast and localized deformation trends. The quantification of ground deformations of large magnitude and small amplitude in this area with SAR Interferometry is a challenging task using moderate resolution data due to the incoherent surface background. Even though SAR acquisitions were sparse over this region, the available ENVISAT, ALOS and Sentinel-1A imagery was analysed with differential interferometry and the Small Baseline Subset technique in order to provide estimates about the evolution of the deformation pattern in a limited area. A clear evidence of subsidence phenomena has been identified in the study area. During the period 2003-2010 the subsidence was estimated to reach 18 cm/year as observed in the DInSAR processing results of data from ENVISAT and ALOS Satellites. However it appears to be slightly more stable during the recent past (Dec/2016-March/2018) as observed in the results with recent Sentinel-1 data where a maximum localized subsidence in the order of 10 cm was estimated. The depletion of the aquifer resources which is confirmed from groundwater level data is speculated to be the most probable cause.

TI  - Automatic delineation of debris-covered glaciers using InSAR coherence derived from X-, C- and L-band radar data: a case study of Yazgyl Glacier
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite their importance for mass-balance estimates and the progress in techniques based on optical and thermal satellite imagery, the mapping of debris-covered glacier boundaries remains a challenging task. Manual corrections hamper regular updates. In this study, we present an automatic approach to delineate glacier outlines using interferometrically derived synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence, slope and morphological operations. InSAR coherence detects the temporally decorrelated surface (e.g. glacial extent) irrespective of its surface type and separates it from the highly coherent surrounding areas. We tested the impact of different processing settings, for example resolution, coherence window size and topographic phase removal, on the quality of the generated outlines. We found minor influence of the topographic phase, but a combination of strong multi-looking during interferogram generation and additional averaging during coherence estimation strongly deteriorated the coherence at the glacier edges. We analysed the performance of X-, C- and L- band radar data. The C-band Sentinel-1 data outlined the glacier boundary with the least misclassifications and a type II error of 0.47% compared with Global Land Ice Measurements from Space inventory data. Our study shows the potential of the Sentinel-1 mission together with our automatic processing chain to provide regular updates for land-terminating glaciers on a large scale.

TI  - A New Model to Downscale Urban and Rural Surface and Air Temperatures Evaluated in Shanghai, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple model, the Surface Temperature and Near-Surface Air Temperature (at 2 m) Model (TsT2m), is developed to downscale numerical model output (such as from ECMWF) to obtain higher-temporal- and higher-spatial-resolution surface and near-surface air temperature. It is evaluated in Shanghai, China. Surface temperature (T-s) and near-surface air temperature (T-alpha) submodels account for variations in land cover and their different thermal properties, resulting in spatial variations of surface and air temperature. The net all-wave radiation parameterization (NARP) scheme is used to compute net wave radiation for the surface temperature submodel, the objective hysteresis model (OHM) is used to calculate the net storage heat fluxes, and the surface temperature is obtained by the force-restore method. The near-surface air temperature submodel considers the horizontal and vertical energy changes for a column of well-mixed air above the surface. Modeled surface temperatures reproduce the general pattern of MODIS images well, while providing more detailed patterns of the surface urban heat island. However, the simulated surface temperatures capture the warmer urban land cover and are 10.3 degrees C warmer on average than those derived from the coarser MODIS data. For other land-cover types, values are more similar. Downscaled, higher-temporal- and higher-spatial-resolution air temperatures are compared to observations at 110 automatic weather stations across Shanghai. After downscaling with TsT2m, the average forecast accuracy of near-surface air temperature is improved by about 20%. The scheme developed has considerable potential for prediction and mitigation of urban climate conditions, particularly for weather and climate services related to heat stress.

TI  - Global Fractional Vegetation Cover Estimation Algorithm for VIIRS Reflectance Data Based on Machine Learning Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an essential input parameter for many environmental and ecological models. Recently, several global FVC products have been generated using remote sensing data. The Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC product, which is generated from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, has attained acceptable performance. However, the original MODIS operation design lifespan has been exceeded. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite was designed to be the MODIS successor. Therefore, developing an FVC estimation algorithm for VIIRS data is important for maintaining continuous FVC estimates in case of MODIS failure. In this study, a global FVC estimation algorithm for VIIRS surface reflectance data was proposed based on machine learning methods, which investigated the performances of back propagating neural networks (BPNNs), general regression networks (GRNNs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The training samples were extracted from the GLASS FVC product and corresponding reconstructed VIIRS surface reflectance in 2013 over the global sampling locations. The VIIRS reflectances of red and near infrared (NIR) bands were the input variables for these machine learning methods. The theoretical performances and independent validation results indicated that the four machine learning methods could achieve similar and reliable FVC estimates. Regarding the FVC estimation accuracy, the GPR method achieved the best performance (R-2 = 0.9019, RMSE = 0.0887). The MARS method had the obvious advantage of computational efficiency. Furthermore, the FVC estimates achieved good spatial and temporal continuities. Therefore, the proposed FVC estimation algorithm for VIIRS data can potentially generate reliable global FVC data for related applications.

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution of traditional soybean planting structure in Songnen Plain, China in 1996-2016
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the impacts of genetically modified soybean, the planting area of traditional soybean in China has fallen sharply. Understanding the traditional soybean planting structure and dynamics in the main soybean producing areas is of great significance to China's soybean import and export trade and safeguarding national food security. With the Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1996 to 2016, we extracted the spatial distribution information of soybean planting using random forest (RF) method based on remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques and analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of soybean planting structure in the Songnen Plain using landscape pattern index. The results showed that the soybean planting area in the Songnen Plain was fluctuating during 1996-2016. Among the area conversion with other land-use types, the interchanges between soybean and other crop lands were the most obvious. The proportion of soybean patch area to the total crop area increased first and then decreased, while the patch density index and the resolution index decreased first and then increased. In conclusion, the spatiotemporal evolution of the traditional soybean planting structure in the Songnen Plain showed the characteristics of fluctuation in planting area, increase in fragmentation, and discrete spatial distribution. The domestic and foreign markets as well as policy guidance were the important factors afecting the traditional soybean planting structure.

TI  - Real-Time Monitoring of Crop Phenology in the Midwestern United States Using VIIRS Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Real-time monitoring of crop phenology is critical for assisting farmers managing crop growth and yield estimation. In this study, we presented an approach to monitor in real time crop phenology using timely available daily Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) observations and historical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets in the Midwestern United States. MODIS data at a spatial resolution of 500 m from 2003 to 2012 were used to generate the climatology of vegetation phenology. By integrating climatological phenology and timely available VIIRS observations in 2014 and 2015, a set of temporal trajectories of crop growth development at a given time for each pixel were then simulated using a logistic model. The simulated temporal trajectories were used to identify spring green leaf development and predict the occurrences of greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, and maximum greenness onset using curvature change rate. Finally, the accuracy of real-time monitoring from VIIRS observations was evaluated by comparing with summary crop progress (CP) reports of ground observations from the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The results suggest that real-time monitoring of crop phenology from VIIRS observations is a robust tool in tracing the crop progress across regional areas. In particular, the date of mid-greenup phase from VIIRS was significantly correlated to the planting dates reported in NASS CP for both corn and soybean with a consistent lag of 37 days and 27 days on average (p < 0.01), as well as the emergence dates in CP with a lag of 24 days and 16 days on average (p < 0.01), respectively. The real-time monitoring of maximum greenness onset from VIIRS was able to predict the corn silking dates with an advance of 9 days (p < 0.01) and the soybean blooming dates with a lag of 7 days on average (p < 0.01). These findings demonstrate the capability of VIIRS observations to effectively monitor temporal dynamics of crop progress in real time at a regional scale.

TI  - Heavy metal-induced stress in rice crops detected using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional-level information on heavy metal pollution in agro-ecosystems is essential for food security because excessive levels of heavy metals in crops may pose risks to humans. However, collecting this information over large areas is inherently costly. This paper investigates the possibility of applying multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite images to detect heavy metal-induced stress (i.e., Cd stress) in rice crops in four study areas in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. For this purpose, we compared seven Sentinel-2 images acquired in 2016 and 2017 with in situ measured hyper-spectral data, chlorophyll content, rice leaf area index, and heavy metal concentrations in soil collected from 2014 to 2017. Vegetation indices (VIs) related to red edge bands were referred to as the sensitive indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice. The coefficients of spatio-temporal variation (CSTV) derived from the VIs allowed us to discriminate crops exposed to pollution from heavy metals as well as environmental stressors. The results indicate that (i) the red edge chlorophyll index, the red edge position index, and the normalized difference red edge 2 index derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images were good indicators for screening stressed rice from unstressed rice; (ii) Rice under Cd stress remained stable with lower CSTV values of VIs overall growth stages in the experimental region, whereas rice under other stressors (i.e., pests and disease) showed abrupt changes at some growth stages and presented "hot spots" with greater CSTV values; and (iii) the proposed spatio-temporal anomaly detection method was successful at detecting rice under Cd stress; and CSTVs of rice VIs stabilized regardless of whether they were applied to consecutive growth stages or to two different crop years. This study suggests that regional heavy metal stress may be accurately detected using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images, using VIs sensitive to the spatio-temporal characteristics of crops.

TI  - Factors controlling changes in evapotranspiration, runoff, and soil moisture over the conterminous US: Accounting for vegetation dynamics
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - While remotely-sensed data reveal enhanced vegetation growth under a warming climate, how such vegetation dynamics could alter regional hydrology is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how changes in leaf area index (LAI) and climatic variability alter long-term trends and seasonal variability of evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (R), and soil moisture (SM) over the conterminous United States (CONUS) during the period 1983-2009 by using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model with transient remotely-sensed LAI inputs. Factor-controlled simulation experiments reveal that while precipitation is the dominant factor controlling long-term trends and inter-annual fluctuations of water fluxes, other factors (temperature, LAI, and atmospheric CO2) make significant contributions to long-term trends, particularly over specific regions. Changes in LAI result in minor overall contributions to the inter -annual variability of ET, R, and SM over the CONUS as a whole; however, they do make a more significant contribution over certain regions, such as the Midwest. Furthermore, changing LAI is the second most important factor in controlling variability in ET and SM, particularly over the cool season. Anomalies of LAI during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases result in no significant correlations with anomalies in R and SM, but result in positive correlations with ET, indicating that vegetation dynamics can have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle over continental scales.

TI  - Assessment of the eco-environmental quality in the Nanweng River Nature Reserve, North-east China by remote sensing
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Scientific and rapid assessment of the ecological environment quality based on remote sensing can provide basis for regional protection, management and planning. In this study, using Landsat TM/OLI/TIRS in 1990, 2000 and 2015 as data sources, four indices including the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation (WET), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDSI), and land surface temperature ( LST) were derived, with the weights being determined by principal components analysis (PCA). Remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) was used to evaluate the eco-environmental quality of Nanweng River Nature Reserve from 1990 to 2015. Results showed that RSEI was an effective indicator for evaluating spatio-temporal dynamics of eco-environmental quality. From 1990 to 2015, the mean value of RSEI of Nanweng River Nature Reserve increased from 0.55 to 0.83, the proportion of area with excellent and good levels of RSEI trended to increase, probably due to the increase of forests at those levels. Meanwhile, 91.4% of the total land area in the reserve had an improved eco-environmental quality. Such improvement was attributed to the establishment of the reserve and implement of a series of engineering and non-engineering protection measures. In the north of core area and buffer area, decrease of eco-environmental quality was due to forest fires which destroyed a large area of forest vegetation. In the road side and southeast of the experimental area, intensified human activities led to the decrease of regional eco-environmental quality.

TI  - Quantifying the relative impacts of climate and human activities on vegetation changes at the regional scale
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding human and climate-induced vegetation changes could benefit regional ecological management. In this paper, a framework was established to quantify the relative contribution rates of human and climate factors to vegetation changes in Chongqing, China, from 2000 to 2015. MODIS NDVI time series data were collected, and land use data were produced using Landsat TM/OLI images. A combined analysis of land use and vegetation changes was conducted, and the residual trends method (RESTREND) was explored in the framework. The results showed that Chongqing experienced a significant vegetation increase from 2000 to 2015. The relative contribution rates of human activities and climate to the vegetation changes were 90.96% and 9.04%, respectively. These results indicate that human activities had a dominant role in vegetation restoration in Chongqing in 2000-2015. Throughout the study period, extensive land use changes occurred in Chongqing. During the study period, persistent forested land, farmland-forested land (a land use conversion type), persistent farmland, and grassland-forested land were the four most important land use (changed and unchanged) types attributed to the growing season NDVI (GSN) increases in Chongqing from 2000 to 2015. The contributions of these four land use types were 45.03%, 21.19%, 16.79% and 12.60%, respectively. The farmland-forested land was characterized as the most effective land use conversion type for vegetation restoration. The proposed framework allows for human and climate-induced vegetation changes to be quantitatively distinguished at the regional scale and provides the contribution rates of each changed and unchanged land use type. The framework is expected to be useful for regional ecological management and research.

TI  - Near Real-Time Extracting Wildfire Spread Rate from Himawari-8 Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire Spread Rate (FSR) can indicate how fast a fire is spreading, which is especially helpful for wildfire rescue and management. Historically, images obtained from sun-orbiting satellites such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to detect active fire and burned area at the large spatial scale. However, the daily revisit cycles make them inherently unable to extract FSR in near real -time (hourly or less). We argue that the Himawari-8, a next generation geostationary satellite with a 10-min temporal resolution and 0.5-2 km spatial resolution, may have the potential for near real-time FSR extraction. To that end, we propose a novel method (named H8-FSR) for near real-time FSR extraction based on the Himawari-8 data. The method first defines the centroid of the burned area as the fire center and then the near real-time FSR is extracted by timely computing the movement rate of the fire center. As a case study, the method was applied to the Esperance bushfire that broke out on 17 November, 2015, in Western Australia. Compared with the estimated FSR using the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Grassland Fire Spread (GFS) model, H8-FSR achieved favorable performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.54, mean bias error of -0.75 m/s, mean absolute percent error of 33.20% and root mean square error of 1.17 m/s, respectively. These results demonstrated that the Himawari-8 data are valuable for near real-time FSR extraction, and also suggested that the proposed method could be potentially applicable to other next generation geostationary satellite data.

TI  - Land Use and Landscape Pattern Changes in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural reclamation has been the major threat to land use changes in the Sanjiang Plain, Northeast China, over the past decades. However, spatial and temporal dynamics of land use and landscape, especially in the recent years, are not well known. In this study, land use and landscape pattern changes from 1982 to 2015 were analyzed using remote sensing data by splitting the period into five periods. The results indicated that the largest reduction of forestland area was 648.70 km(2) during 1995-2000, and the relative change was -1.84%. The converted area of forestlands to dry farmlands in this period was about 90% of the total reduced forestland area. Marshland areas decreased remarkably by 63.29% and paddy fields increased by 1.78 times from 1982 to 2015. Paddy fields experienced large conversion into dry farmlands during 2005-2010 (1788.57 km(2)), followed by a reverse conversion from 1995 to 2000 (2379.60 km(2)). The difference of relative change revealed development speed of paddy field was faster than that of dry farmlands among the five periods. Landscape pattern was analyzed using class- and landscape-level metrics. The landscape diversity index and number of patches increased, which showed that the degrees of the forestland, marshland, and cropland landscape fragmentation were aggravated. Our study provides the effective means of land use dynamic monitoring and evaluation at the landscape level for the existing forestlands and marshlands protection.

TI  - Effects of Land Use Change on Ecosystem Services in Arid Area Ecological Migration
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological migration is the process of increasing the population density in the immigration area and transferring the ecological pressure from emigration area to immigration area. This process may result in significant changes in land use and land cover in the area of immigration and have an important effect on ecosystem services. Therefore, scientifically revealing the effects and differentiation mechanisms of ecological migration on ecosystem services is becoming an important issue related to the implementation of the national ecological migration strategy in China. This study employed the Hongsibu District as a typical example of ecological migration. Hongsibu District is located in the central Ningxia steppe and desert steppe areas. Remote sensing data covering five periods from the period before ecological migration in 1995 and after migration in 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 was used to measure the value of ecosystem services (ESV). A geographical detector model and the value of ecosystem services model were used to diagnose the dynamic mechanism of the effects of land use change on ecosystem services. The results showed that: 1) The development of large-scale ecological resettlement has caused the area of cultivated land and urbanized land area to increase significantly in the area of immigration, while the grass area decreased significantly. 2) The overall value of the Hongsibu ecosystem services increased in a form of a V'. Among them, during the period of 1995-2005, the overall ESV decreased and had an annual rate of change of -0.67%. During the period of development 2005-2015, the ESV increased steadily, with an annual rate of change of 0.79%. 3) The proportion and total ESV in soil formation and protection, waste treatment, and biodiversity conservation of the Hongsibu District decreased from 57.61% in 1995 to 56.17% in 2015, indicating that the region's ecological regulation function slightly decreased. 4) The ESV in the Hongsibu District, showed a low distribution pattern of ecosystem services increasing from northeast to southwest, and the capacity of three townships, Hongsibu, Taiyangshan, and Liuquan, to provide ecosystem services gradually declined over time. The ecological service function of Xinzhuangji Township and Dahe Township gradually improved. 5) The sensitivity index of the ESV of each land use type was less than 1, indicating that the environment lacks flexibility in providing a strong ESV index in Hongsibu, which shows that the research results are reliable and believable. 6) During the study period, the decisive force of the change of land use on ecosystem services in Hongsibu District was: grassland (0.9934), climate regulation (0.9413), soil formation and protection (0.9321) and waste treatment (0.9241).

TI  - Efficient Patch-Wise Semantic Segmentation for Large-Scale Remote Sensing Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate semantic segmentation is the key technique for automatic remote sensing image analysis. While there have been many segmentation methods based on traditional hand-craft feature extractors, it is still challenging to process high-resolution and large-scale remote sensing images. In this work, a novel patch-wise semantic segmentation method with a new training strategy based on fully convolutional networks is presented to segment common land resources. First, to handle the high-resolution image, the images are split as local patches and then a patch-wise network is built. Second, training data is preprocessed in several ways to meet the specific characteristics of remote sensing images, i.e., color imbalance, object rotation variations and lens distortion. Third, a multi-scale training strategy is developed to solve the severe scale variation problem. In addition, the impact of conditional random field (CRF) is studied to improve the precision. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset collected from a capital city in West China with the Gaofen-2 satellite. The dataset contains ten common land resources (Grassland, Road, etc.). The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves 54.96% in terms of mean intersection over union (MIoU) and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in remote sensing image segmentation.

TI  - Angular momentum management strategy of the FengYun-4 meteorological satellite
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation torque has a great impact on Chinese new generation geostationary meteorological satellite FengYun-4 since its single winged solar array configuration. Daily accumulation in angular momentum stored in reaction wheels may increase about 30Nms, and should be unloaded via bipropellant thrusters during a daily 15 min housekeeping period. How to prevent zero-crossing and saturation of wheels, how to reduce the operation speed range of wheels, and how to ensure the service continuity if any one of wheels fails are the problems to be faced. In addition, both the uncertainty of thruster torque and the variability of solar radiation during all the life span may go against with the automaticity of angular momentum management. In this paper, a null-space-based momentum management method is presented, upon which the angular momentum is managed by null motion control while service and dumped during the housekeeping period. In-flight and numerical simulation results demonstrate the reliability and validity of this strategy.

T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On November 25, 2016, a M(W)6. 6 earthquake occurred in Aketao County, Xinjiang. In this paper, the coseismic deformation field of the earthquake is obtained by using Sentinel-1A TOPSAR data and ALOS2 fine mode data. The interferogram deformation field is distributed along the Muji fault, showing that the earthquake rupture length can reach 70 km, and two deformation centers are formed on the surface. The deformation field eastern to the epicentral is fringe-dense, but the western part is sparsely and has a wide influence range. The cross-sectional profile shows that the maximum deformation of Line of Sight can reach 12 cm. The three-dimensional deformation field of the surface is solved by a multi-angle least square iterative decomposition method constrainted by prior knowledge. The results show that the vertical downward movement of the epicentral eastern deformation center can reach up to 20 cm, and the westward movement of the south side of the Muji fault can reach 10 cm, which shows that the fault main motion characteristics is dextral strike, and have normal slip component. Firstly, the method of forward simulation is used to determine source parameter of the two-segment fault model to recover the observed deformation field, and then the InSAR observation data is used as the constraint to invert the fine slip distribution on the fault plane. The result shows that the earthquake consists of two events. The first event is dominated by dextral strike and occurred on the western section with the striking 103 degrees, the inclination is 76 degrees, the rake angle is -167 degrees, the focal depth is 10.1 km, the cumulative seismic moment is 7.2 X 10(18) N center dot M. The second event occurred on the eastern section with the striking 109 degrees, the dip 55 degrees, the rake -160 degrees, the focal depth 5.3 km and the cumulative seismic moment 7.76 X 10(18) N center dot M, but which has normal slip component. It is a tectonic earthquake occurred at Gongur Shan extensional system.

TI  - Estimation of surface flow speed and ice surface temperature from optical satellite imagery at Viedma glacier, Argentina
T2  - GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Viedma glacier is the largest glacier in Argentina and one of the most dynamic in the Southern Patagonian Icefield. It is a strategic water source. This study analyzes the interactions of glaciological variables that help better explain the behavior of the Viedma glacier. This paper presents the study of surface flow speed and ice surface temperatures during the 2015-2016 warm season by using remote sensing data and includes the statistical correlation between those variables. In addition, a reconstruction of the front fluctuation between 1979 and 2016 through CORONA and LANDSAT images is included. Finally, the displacement modes dominating the Viedma glacier are suggested. Our results showed that the mean surface flow speed during the study period was of around 1.2 +/- 0.3 md(-1) and reached maximum values of 5.5 +/- 0.3 md(-1) and 3 +/- 0.3 md(-1) at middle basin and terminus respectively. Thermal data revealed minimum values of -2 degrees C in the uppermost section of the study area, whilst the glacier's terminus showed supraglacial melt (values above pressure melting point). Front fluctuation analysis revealed the largest front retraction of the last 40 years between 2010 and 2016: around 281 my(-1). Statistical correlation analysis and glaciological data suggested that the middle and lower basins of the Viedma glacier are widely dominated by basal sliding.

TI  - High-speed rail and urban expansion: An empirical study using a time series of nighttime light satellite data in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Transportation, especially high-speed rail (HSR), plays a key role in urban development. Although many empirical studies have substantiated the impact of HSR on urban economic outcomes, the role of HSR in urban spatial expansion is seldom empirically measured. Previous studies have shown that the improvement of transportation infrastructure and technology can promote the expansion of cities, mostly on the construction land area announced by the government. This study, which is based on high-precision calibrated nighttime light satellite images, accurately measured the impact of HSR on urban expansion. We estimated a difference-in-differences model after eliminating selection bias by propensity score matching. HSR has a positive effect on urban expansion with an elasticity of 0.12-0.13. In addition, HSR is almost twice as successful at promoting urban expansion in the underdeveloped central and western cities as in the developed eastern cities in China. Governments should consider the varying responses of cities at different levels of development when using HSR to promote urban development. For future HSR line planning in China, the governments should appropriately focus on the central and western regions in order to achieve the most efficient use of resources and balanced regional development.

TI  - A reliable and non-destructive method for estimating forage shrub cover and biomass in arid environments using digital vegetation charting technique
T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the importance of fodder shrubs to small ruminant diets and production in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, they are often not considered when quantifying grazing land potential. This oversight is mainly due to the time consuming and costly traditional techniques used to estimate shrub biomass. The shrub fodder component should be measured to avoid underestimation of the carrying capacity of rangelands. In this study, we present a fast, reliable and non-destructive method to estimate canopy vegetation cover to obtain aboveground shrub biomass. The experiment was conducted under field conditions in northwest Syria, where seedlings of seven shrub species were monitored for one year: Atriplex leucoclada (Moq.) Boiss., A. halimus L., A. lentiformis (Torr.) S. Watson, A. canescens (Pursh) Nutt., A. nummularia Lindl., Salsola vermiculata L. and Haloxylon aphyllum (C.A. Meyer) Bunge. The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with five replications. We explored the effectiveness of digital vegetation charting technique (DVCT) for estimating shrub canopy cover. Aboveground shrub biomass was clipped to estimate the dry matter (DM) weight per species and to determine its relationship to canopy cover. In this study, an estimate of greenness (percent green vegetation cover) was extracted by way of greenness algorithms. Simple linear regressions between vegetation cover and biomass for 210 plots were performed. The cover of the seven species differed (P<0.01): A. leucoclada had the highest vegetation cover (56%) and H. aphyllum the lowest (7%). Vegetation cover and DM biomass were positively correlated (P<0.01) with R-squared ranging from 0.66 (H. aphyllum) to 0.84 (S. vermiculata). Our method provided reasonable estimations of canopy coverage which could predict aboveground phytomass. We conclude that DVCT offers a rapid, reliable and consistent measurement of shrub cover and biomass provided that shrubs have open architecture. This study shows the potential of digital cameras and image processing to determine cover/biomass in a non-destructive, timely and cost efficient way.

TI  - Dianchi Lake watershed impervious surface area dynamics and their impact on lake water quality from 1988 to 2017
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The relationships between impervious surface area (ISA) patterns and characteristics have long been studied to examine the impacts of hydrological cycles, water management, surface energy balances, and biodiversity. This study assessed the Dianchi Lake watershed as a case study area to illustrate ISA change characteristics and their impacts on Dianchi Lake water quality. More than 200 Landsat images (from 1988 to 2017) were first downloaded through the US Geological Survey (USGS) online portal. Then, a series of ISA maps of the Dianchi Lake watershed at an annual resolution were built using a robust method we proposed. Then, the change characteristics of main water quality parameters were analyzed from spatial-temporal viewpoints. Finally, correlations between ISA and Lake water quality were made. The research results indicated that the ISA proportion of the Dianchi Lake watershed rapidly increased (from 1.84% in 1988 to 34.32% in 2017), the annual ISA total growth rate exceeded 21km(2)/year, and the urban area encircled Dianchi Lake. The Dianchi Lake watershed has begun to adopt the Rashly Advancing and Great Leap Forward strategies of urbanization. Chlorophyll a (Chla), dissolved oxygen (DO), and transparency (Trans) showed significantly changing tendencies, whereas the values of pH, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus stayed relatively constant. The polynomial regression models and corresponding R-2 values indicated strong correlations between ISA and three water quality parameters (Chla, DO, and Trans). The development of better strategies for the control and reduction of water pollution without optimizing ISA spatial distribution is essential for Kunming's continued urbanization.

TI  - Integrating Early Growth Information to Monitor Winter Wheat Powdery Mildew Using Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Powdery mildew is one of the dominant diseases in winter wheat. The accurate monitoring of powdery mildew is important for crop management and production. Satellite-based remote sensing monitoring has been proven as an efficient tool for regional disease detection and monitoring. However, the information provided by single-date satellite scene is hard to achieve acceptable accuracy for powdery mildew disease, and incorporation of early period contextual information of winter wheat can improve this situation. In this study, a multi-temporal satellite data based powdery mildew detecting approach had been developed for regional disease mapping. Firstly, the Lansat-8 scenes that covered six winter wheat growth periods (expressed in chronological order as periods 1 to 6) were collected to calculate typical vegetation indices (VIs), which include disease water stress index (DSWI), optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), shortwave infrared water stress index (SIWSI), and triangular vegetation index (TVI). A multi-temporal VIs-based k-nearest neighbors (KNN) approach was then developed to produce the regional disease distribution. Meanwhile, a backward stepwise elimination method was used to confirm the optimal multi-temporal combination for KNN monitoring model. A classification and regression tree (CART) and back propagation neural networks (BPNN) approaches were used for comparison and validation of initial results. VIs of all periods except 1 and 3 provided the best multi-temporal data set for winter wheat powdery mildew monitoring. Compared with the traditional single-date (period 6) image, the multi-temporal images based KNN approach provided more disease information during the disease development, and had an accuracy of 84.6%. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the proposed approach had 11.5% and 3.8% higher than the multi-temporal images-based CART and BPNN models', respectively. These results suggest that the use of satellite images for early critical disease infection periods is essential for improving the accuracy of monitoring models. Additionally, satellite imagery also assists in monitoring powdery mildew in late wheat growth periods.

TI  - Estimation of daily evapotranspiration and irrigation water efficiency at a Landsat-like scale for an arid irrigation area using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of land-surface evapotranspiration (ET) at high spatial and temporal resolutions is important for management and planning of agricultural water resources, but available remote sensing data generally have either high spatial resolution or high temporal resolution. To overcome this limitation, we evaluated the use of a data fusion scheme, Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), to determine the surface parameters needed to estimate daily ET at a Landsat-like scale (100 m). In particular, we fused Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +) data in analysis of the Heihe River Basin (HRB), an arid region of Northwest China. The surface parameters were then used to drive the revised Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model to estimate daily ET at a spatial resolution of 100 m for this an arid irrigation area during the crop growth period (April to October) in 2012. The results showed that the daily ET estimates had a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 12% and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.81 mm/day relative to ground measurements from 18 eddy covariance (EC) sites in the study area. The validation results indicated good accuracy for land cover types of maize and vegetables, a slight overestimation for residential and wetland sites, and a slight underestimation for orchard site. Our comparison of the input parameter fusion approach (IPFA) and the ET fusion approach (ETFA) with field measurements indicated the IPFA was superior than the ETFA for land surfaces with high spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, our high spatiotemporal ET estimates indicated that irrigation water efficiencies of the irrigation districts (mean: 70%) and villages (mean: 62%) had large spatial heterogeneity. These results point to the need for calculating ET at a high spatiotemporal resolution for monitoring and improving irrigation water efficiency at local scales. Our findings suggest that the proposed framework of estimating daily ET at a Landsat-like scale using multi-source data may also be applicable to other heterogeneous landscapes by providing a foundation for management of water resources at the basin or finer scales.

T2  - PRESENT ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this paper is to detect snow in areas where was detecting and mapping, using Differential Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique, ground displacement. DInSAR is a powerful tool to detect and monitor ground deformation. Iasi county is considered as study area in this research. Study area is geographically situated on latitude 46 degrees 48'N to 47 degrees 35'N and longitude 26 degrees 29'E to 28 degrees 07'E. For this paper, to detect and mapping grond displacement, was used Sentinel - 1 images, provided free by The European Space Agency (ESA), for January 2018, with vertical polarization (VV), ascending orbit and Interferometric Wide swath (IW) mode operated. SNAP was used to process the Sentinel - 1 images. Landsat-8 OLI was taken to detect areas cover with snow using Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) - a numerical indicator that shows snow cover over land areas. ArcMap was used to create NDSI map after Landsat-8 data was preprocessed. The presence of snow has been observed both in the areas where it exists vertical displacement positive and negative.

M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveSynthetic meshes and acellular dermal matrices are increasingly used in implant-based breast reconstruction. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of complications following the implantation of the partially absorbable bi-component soft mesh SERAGYN (R) BR and assess risk factors for adverse operative outcomes.MethodsA retrospective clinical study was performed: The SERAGYN (R) BR soft mesh was utilized in 148 operations (skin-sparing mastectomy, nipple-sparing mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery, and secondary reconstruction after mastectomy) in four different institutions in Germany from June 2012 to February 2014. We analyzed whether the results were affected by tumor morphology (e.g., grading), patient characteristics and comorbidities, previous surgery or therapies, and use of alloplastic materials.ResultsThe SERAGYN (R) BR soft mesh was successfully implanted in 131 of 148 operations. The rate of reconstructive failure was 11.5%. The most common complication was seroma (25.7%), followed by hematoma and skin infection (each 14.2%). Wound-healing issues were detected in 13.5% cases, secondary wound infections in 10.8%. 83.8% of operations had no severe complications. Independent predictors for reconstructive failure were wound-healing issues, nipple- or skin necrosis, wound- or skin infections, a high volume of excised tissue, hematomas, seromas, and sentinel lymph node excisions. A higher body mass index was correlated with a higher rate of infection.ConclusionSERAGYN (R) BR mesh can be used successfully in breast reconstructive surgery. Rates of major complications or reconstructive failure are comparable to the use of other synthetic or biological meshes.

TI  - Organic vs. organic - soil arthropods as bioindicators of ecological sustainability in greenhouse system experiment under Mediterranean conditions
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Organic greenhouse (OGH) production is characterized by different systems and agricultural practices with diverse environmental impact. Soil arthropods are widely used as bioindicators of ecological sustainability in open field studies, while there is a lack of research on organic production for protected systems. This study assessed the soil arthropod abundance and diversity over a 2-year crop rotation in three systems of OGH production in the Mediterranean. The systems under assessment differed in soil fertility management: SUBST - a simplified system of organic production, based on an input substitution approach (use of guano and organic liquid fertilizers), AGROCOM - soil fertility mainly based on compost application and agroecological services crops (ASC) cultivation (tailored use of cover crops) as part of crop rotation, and AGROMAN - animal manure and ASC cultivation as part of crop rotation. Monitoring of soil fauna was performed by using pitfall traps and seven taxa were considered: Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Araneae, Opiliones, Isopoda, Myriapoda, and Collembola. Results demonstrated high potential of ASC cultivation as a technique for beneficial soil arthropod conservation in OGH conditions. SUBST system was dominated by Collembola in all crops, while AGROMAN and AGROCOM had more balanced relative abundance of Isopoda, Staphylinidae, and Aranea. Opiliones and Myriapoda were more affected by season, while Carabidae were poorly represented in the whole monitoring period. Despite the fact that all three production systems are in accordance with the European Union regulation on organic farming, findings of this study displayed significant differences among them and confirmed the suitability of soil arthropods as bioindicators in protected systems of organic farming.

TI  - Indirect Estimation of Structural Parameters in South African Forests Using MISR-HR and LiDAR Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest structural data are essential for assessing biophysical processes and changes, and promoting sustainable forest management. For 18+ years, the Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has been observing the land surface reflectance anisotropy, which is known to be related to vegetation structure. This study sought to determine the performance of a new MISR-High Resolution (HR) dataset, recently produced at a full 275 m spatial resolution, and consisting of 36 Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRF) and 12 Rahman-Pinty-Verstraete (RPV) parameters, to estimate the mean tree height (H-mean) and canopy cover (CC) across structurally diverse, heterogeneous, and fragmented forest types in South Africa. Airborne LiDAR data were used to train and validate Random Forest models which were tested across various MISR-HR scenarios. The combination of MISR multi-angular and multispectral data was consistently effective in improving the estimation of structural parameters, and produced the lowest relative root mean square error (rRMSE) (33.14% and 38.58%), for H-mean and CC respectively. The combined RPV parameters for all four bands yielded the best results in comparison to the models of the RPV parameters separately: H-mean (R-2 = 0.71, rRMSE = 34.84%) and CC (R-2 = 0.60, rRMSE = 40.96%). However, the combined RPV parameters for all four bands in comparison to the MISR-HR BRF 36 band model it performed poorer (rRMSE of 5.1% and 6.2% higher for H-mean and CC, respectively). When considered separately, savanna forest type had greater improvement when adding multi-angular data, with the highest accuracies obtained for the H-mean parameter (R-2 of 0.67, rRMSE of 31.28%). The findings demonstrate the potential of the optical multi-spectral and multi-directional newly processed data (MISR-HR) for estimating forest structure across Southern African forest types.

TI  - Navigating snowscapes: scale-dependent responses of mountain sheep to snowpack properties
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Winters are limiting for many terrestrial animals due to energy deficits brought on by resource scarcity and the increased metabolic costs of thermoregulation and traveling through snow. A better understanding of how animals respond to snow conditions is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on wildlife. We compared the performance of remotely sensed and modeled snow products as predictors of winter movements at multiple spatial and temporal scales using a data set of 20,544 locations from 30 GPS-collared Dall sheep (Ovis dalli dalli) in Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA from 2005 to 2008. We used daily 500-m MODIS normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and multi-resolution snow depth and density outputs from a snowpack evolution model (SnowModel), as covariates in step selection functions. We predicted that modeled snow depth would perform best across all scales of selection due to more informative spatiotemporal variation and relevance to animal movement. Our results indicated that adding any of the evaluated snow metrics substantially improved model performance and helped characterize winter Dall sheep movements. As expected, SnowModel-simulated snow depth outperformed NDSI at fine-to-moderate scales of selection (step scales <112 h). At the finest scale, Dall sheep selected for snow depths below mean chest height (<54 cm) when in low-density snows (100 kg/m(3)), which may have facilitated access to ground forage and reduced energy expenditure while traveling. However, sheep selected for higher snow densities (>300kg/m(3)) at snow depths above chest height, which likely further reduced energy expenditure by limiting hoof penetration in deeper snows. At moderate-to-coarse scales (112-896 h step scales), however, NDSI was the best-performing snow covariate. Thus, the use of publicly available, remotely sensed, snow cover products can substantially improve models of animal movement, particularly in cases where movement distances exceed the MODIS 500-m grid threshold. However, remote sensing products may require substantial data thinning due to cloud cover, potentially limiting its power in cases where complex models are necessary. Snowpack evolution models such as SnowModel offer users increased flexibility at the expense of added complexity, but can provide critical insights into fine-scale responses to rapidly changing snow properties.

AB  - The paper deals with the issues of the structure, content and development of the concept AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISM from the historical perspective. The paper consists of four sections. The first one dwells on the topicality of the chosen topic, which is largely conditioned by the intensive development of lingocultural studies and the increasing interest in national specific cultural concepts witnessed today.Next, the author provides the results of the analysis of the definitions of the word representing the concept ("individualism") found in modern English monolingual dictionaries (including the ones specializing in American English), on the basis of which some conclusions are drawn concerning the key structural features of the concept as well as of its evaluative component. The findings suggest that in the native English speaker's consciousness, individualism is primarily associated with independence, personal freedom, self-reliance and prioritization of one's interests above those of a group. Some sources provide the meaning of the word which is close to the notion "egoism, selfishness", which goes in line with the original meaning of the word in the source language (French).The third section includes the etymological analysis of the name of the concept, which shows that the word "individualism" derives from the Indo-European stem "*width-" (to separate), and was formed with the help of the negative prefix in- and the prefix de- meaning "apart". Thus, the idea of integrity, indivisibility laid the foundation for the content of the concept INDIVIDUALISM.The fourth section, which is also the largest one, is devoted to the evolution of the concept from the point of view of its semantic and evaluative components. As has been noticed above, the word was borrowed from French, where it denoted such strongly negative phenomena associated with the Great French Revolution as lack of unity among people, disorder, anarchy, unfair competition, social stratification, generational gap. It is in this meaning that the word was used by Henry Reeve in the first English translation of the book Democracy in America by Alexis de Tocqueville. However, the publication of Tocqueville's book in the USA triggered numerous disputes in the journalistic discourse concerning the essence and specific character of American individualism and its place in the American life. These disputes largely contributed to the formation of the way the young nation perceived itself, its distinctive features as compared to the Old World and its uniqueness.The paper also includes various excerpts from journalistic and historical texts which reveal the peculiarities of the way American individualism has been perceived in different periods of time. The linguostylistic analysis of the selected passages allows to make some conclusions about the linguistic means through which the given concept is explicated in American journalistic discourse. The author concludes with the modern status of the concept AMERICAN INDIVIDUALISM in modem journalism and research.

TI  - An Operational Land Surface Temperature Product for Landsat Thermal Data: Methodology and Validation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal sensors onboard Landsat satellites have been underutilized due to the lack of consistent and accurate methodologies for retrieving the land surface temperature (LST) at global scales over all land cover types. We present an operational algorithm for generating Landsat LST consistently for all sensors that will be implemented by the United States Geological Survey/The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and made available at the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center. The LST algorithm involves three steps. The observed thermal radiance is atmospherically corrected using a radiative transfer model and reanalysis data. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Emissivity Data Set version 3 is spectrally adjusted and then modified to account for vegetation phenology and snow cover using Landsat visible-shortwave infrared data. The LST is retrieved by inverting the atmospherically and emissivity corrected Landsat radiances with a lookup-table approach. Landsat-derived emissivities were validated at two pseudoinvariant sand dune sites within an average absolute error of 0.54% when compared with laboratory measurements. The Landsat LST retrievals were validated with in situ observations from four surface radiation budget network (SURFRAD) sites, and two inland water bodies (Salton Sea and Lake Tahoe) in the USA. The LST retrievals for Landsat 5 and 7 had a mean bias (root mean square error) of 0.7 K (2.2 K) and 0.9 K (2.3 K) for the SURFRAD sites, and -0.3 K (0.6 K) and 0.4 K (0.7 K) for the inland water bodies, respectively. The operational algorithm will provide a consistent LST record from four decades of historical Landsat thermal data enabling the long-term monitoring of temperature and trends, land cover and land use changes, and improved utilization in models.

TI  - Seasonal variations in the availability of fodder resources and practices of dairy cattle feeding among the smallholder farmers in Western Usambara Highlands, Tanzania
T2  - TROPICAL ANIMAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the seasonal effects on quantity and quality of fodder resources and associated utilization practices among smallholder dairy farmers in Western Usambara Highlands (WUHs) in Tanzania. The WUHs are among the major milk producing areas under smallholder dairy farming systems (SDFS) in Tanzania. Dry season fodder scarcity is a widespread problem affecting the East African SDFS and has been shown to contribute to over 40% reduction in milk yield. There is limited information with regard to seasonal fodder fluctuation and its effects on productivity of dairy cows in different landscape levels of Tanzania. Field and household surveys were conducted in 150 dairy cattle farming households from five villages in three wards located in WUHs. Survey data were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 21. In addition, remote sensing techniques were employed on gap-filled and smoothed Landsat data to generate land cover maps and bimonthly normalized difference vegetation indextime series for the 2009-2016. SDFS landscape was highly heterogeneous typified by crops, bushes, and forests. On average, the household landholding was 1.3ha, while herd size was three cattle. About 87% of household land was devoted to crop growing with limited pasture along the farm margins and contour strips. Fodder scarcity was the major challenge during the dry season (July to October) as indicated by 87% of the respondents. On-farm fodder resources contributed most of the cattle diet (73%) while rangeland, forest, and purchased feed provided small amount. Natural pasture and napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) were the most important feeds in wet season while maize stover was most significant during the dry season. Maize stover was profusely stored for dry season feeding and neither silage nor hay making was practiced. The nutritional values of the fibrous feeds declined during the dry season, whereby the metabolizable energy and crude protein contents were 6.0MJ/kg and 10.1% dry matter, respectively, during wet season compared to 4.8MJ/kg and 7.8% dry matter, respectively, during the dry season. Consequently, milk yield drops from 5.6l per cow per day in the wet season to 3.0l in the dry season. It is concluded that dry season fodder scarcity is a major problem in the WUHs and it hinders sustainable dairy production. It is therefore suggested that increase in fodder production as well as adoption of fodder conservation and feeding technologies are inevitable if sustainable dairy production is to be met in the Western Usambara Highlands and elsewhere with similar environments.

TI  - Early Intracranial Aneurysm Recurrence after Microsurgical Clip Ligation: Case Report and Review of the Literature
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGICAL SURGERY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Microsurgical clip ligation is considered a definitive treatment for intracranial aneurysms (IAs), resulting in low rates of local recurrence that range from 0.2 to 0.5% and a latency period that averages about a decade. Our case report describes an early asymptomatic recurrence (i. e., without sentinel headache or seizure) less than 1 year after this 20-year- old woman underwent clip ligation of a ruptured anterior communicating artery (AComA) aneurysm. At recurrence, the patient underwent coiling of the regrowth; follow- up imaging at 6 and 18months demonstrated complete IA occlusion. To review the putative risk factors of this rare phenomenon, the authors searched the PubMed database using the keywords " intracranial aneurysm," " recurrence," and " clipping" in various combinations. In the seven cases identified, all occurred in initially ruptured IA, which was often at the AComA, and six of seven patients were younger than 50 years old. Although most IA remnants grow slowly, early recurrence may represent a more aggressive biological behavior that warrants special attention in younger patients, positive rupture status, and unintended remnant of any size. In such a constellation, early imaging follow- up within the first 6 months may be warranted to rule out early IA recurrence

AB  - The TaD three-dimensional (3D) electron density (Ne) specification model is compared with in situ measured Ne by the Instrument Sonde Langmuir (ISL) onboard DEMETER satellite. For this purpose, over 2000 parts of satellite orbits over the European region in the years 2009-2011 were selected. For each measured Ne value, a corresponding value was calculated with the TaD 3D model, using maps of foF2 and hmF2 from ionosondes and maps of TEC values from CODE software. To compare modelled and measured Ne, the relative to the model deviation between the two quantities was calculated. The comparisons exceeded the total number of 180,000. The main result shows that the modelled Ne extracted by the TaD profiles that have been calculated through adjustment with the TEC CODE parameters, exhibit significant deviations from the measured Ne at the satellite orbit height. Histograms of the relative deviations relNe show an average offset of 50-60%, while the standard deviation is around 30%. Separate analysis was performed to compare the modelled Ne over 11 ionosonde stations with the measured Ne by the satellite over the ionosonde locations and thus to eliminate the error inferred from the mapping procedure. Here the TaD profiles were adjusted with both the TEC CODE parameters and with TEC values extracted with the single GNSS station solution software with data from GNSS receivers co-located with the ionosondes. In the latter case, the lower TEC values compared to those of TEC CODE yield lower modelled Ne which resulted to smaller deviations with the satellite data. The present study reveals the low consistency between different measurements involved in modeled reconstruction. The comparison presented here shows the importance of assessing the inconsistency between different measurements being assimilated or ingested in the 3D Ne models. Probable inconsistency of different data can create a wrong base for further geophysical studies.

TI  - Simultaneous ocean surface current and wind vectors retrieval with squinted SAR interferometry: Geophysical inversion and performance assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Simultaneous measurements of ocean surface current and wind vectors at the ocean submesoscale (O [1-10 km]) are needed to improve our understanding of upper ocean mixing, air-sea interactions, ocean biophysical processes and large-scale oceanic transports. A new satellite mission concept called SEASTAR aims to do just that. The concept is a Ku-band along-track interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) system with two squinted beams pointing +/- 45 degrees from broadside and incidence angles around 30 degrees. The paper presents an inversion strategy to retrieve simultaneously ocean surface current and wind vectors and reports on the performance obtained with different wind/current conditions and instrument configurations. Results are based on numerical simulations using a Bayesian approach and existing geophysical model functions (GMFs) of the microwave Normalized Radar Cross Section (NRCS) and Doppler shift.Using the baseline two-look instrument configuration and realistic instrument noise figures (radiometric resolution: k(p) = 5 and 12%; Delta df = 2 and 5 Hz), the root-mean square errors (RMSE) of the retrieved current and wind vectors are typically better than [0.1 m/s, 10 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 5 degrees] for wind. This inversion setup yields four ambiguous solutions within a current range of similar to 1 m/s. The addition of dual polarization (VV, HH) capability helps to discriminate these ambiguities. The retrieval performance depends weakly on geophysical parameters such as wind speed, current velocity or current direction, but is sensitive to wind direction because of its strong effect on current retrieval through the wind-wave induced artifact surface velocity (WASV). Larger retrieval errors are obtained when the wind is aligned with one of the antenna line-of-sight (LoS) directions, although errors remain typically below [0.2 m/s, 25 degrees] for current and [0.5 m/s, 15 degrees] for wind. Improving the retrieval performance regardless of wind direction could be achieved either with lower noise figures sigma(0), or with higher incidence angles, or by including an additional third-look direction in azimuth (e.g. to achieve a configuration similar to Metop/ASCAT scatterometers) as per the SEASTAR mission concept submitted to EE10.

AB  - The ability to detect and monitor oil spills at sea is becoming increasingly important due to the high demand of oil-based products. Remote sensing frameworks have been proven to give accurate results in case of major events; nonetheless, also medium and micro oil spills have their own importance, especially in protected areas that deserve special attention. In this paper, we propose a monitoring framework based on the collection of in situ observations and on their integration with remote sensing in order to fill out existing observational gaps. In particular, besides the data collected by special monitoring devices, in situ observations include volunteered geographical information as an additional source of valuable data. Oil spill sights, notified by volunteers through a specially-designed app, are integrated in the monitoring system and therein processed together with remote sensing data in order to proactively detect anomalous events and produce alerts. Field operational tests in two areas demonstrate the technical validity of the approach, while users' reception testifies to its potential in raising people's awareness on marine pollution.

TI  - Red nodular melanoma of the penile foreskin: A case report and literature review
T2  - MOLECULAR AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The penis is an extremely rare primary site for malignant melanomas, and the clinical presentation may vary greatly. We herein present the case of a 71-year-old male patient who presented with a 6-year history of two slow growing, asymptomatic red macules on the penile foreskin. On physical examination, the mobility of the foreskin was good, and there was no metastasis on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The patient underwent segmental circumcision for treatment and histological diagnosis, and the histological examination revealed a malignant melanoma. As cancer cells were identified at the edge of the tissue specimen and computed tomography-positron emission tomography revealed increased uptake of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose in the penis, wider resection and a right sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed; both specimens came back negative. Two years after the surgery, there has been no evidence of locoregional recurrence or distant metastases. The aim of this report is to alert physicians to include melanoma in the differential diagnosis of red-pigmented lesions of the penile foreskin.

TI  - Land consumption monitoring: an innovative method integrating SAR and optical data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for the monitoring of land consumption is analyzed. The paper presents an automatic procedure that integrates SAR and optical data, which can be effectively used to generate land consumption maps or update existing maps. The main input of the procedure is a series of SAR amplitude images acquired over a given geographical area and observation period. The main assumption of the procedure is that land consumption is associated with an increase of the SAR amplitude values. Such an increase is detected in the SAR amplitude time series using an automatic Bayesian algorithm. The results based on the SAR amplitude are then filtered using an NDVI map derived from optical imagery. The effectiveness of the proposed procedure is illustrated using SAR data from the Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X sensors, and optical data from the Sentinel-2 sensor.

TI  - Three decades of forest structural dynamics over Canada's forested ecosystems using Landsat time-series and lidar plots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Attributes that describe forest structure, such as height, canopy cover, volume, and biomass, are required to inform forest inventories and monitoring programs. Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) has been successfully demonstrated as a means to derive a suite of forest structure attributes at the plot level; however, these acquisitions are often constrained to limited spatial extents and to a given point in time. Sample based approaches for model development can accommodate the spatial limitations of lidar acquisitions when characterizing large areas. The combination of lidar plot data and time-series satellite imagery is well suited to provide spatially extensive, and temporally dense, information on forest structure and related dynamics over very large areas. In this research, we combine lidar plot-derived information with Landsat pixel-based composites to produce annual forest structure estimates from 1984 to 2016 over 650 million ha of Canada's forest ecosystems using a nearest neighbor imputation approach with a Random Forests-based distance metric. Imputed variables included lidar metrics of height (e.g., mean height, standard deviation of height) and cover, as well as area-based modelled inventory estimates of Lorey's height, basal area, stem volume, and biomass. Models were validated using reserved validation plots, with model R-2 ranging from 0.62 to 0.64 for lidar metrics of height and cover, and R-2 of 0.67, 0.68, 0.71, and 0.70 for Lorey's height, basal area, volume and biomass, respectively. Unique to this study was the assessment of model extension through time, with model performance for imputing lidar metrics evaluated at the forest stand-level using independent lidar data representing a latitudinal gradient of forest conditions and that was not used in model development. The period evaluated was 2006-2012, with R-2 values ranging from 0.36 to 0.66 for height metrics, and 0.47-0.77 for cover metrics. Ultimately, we show how deriving forest structural estimates on an annual basis enables the analysis of both the dynamics and regional trends of undisturbed forest, as well as regenerating stands following stand-replacing disturbances (i.e., fire, harvesting).

TI  - Pediatric melanoma update
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Pediatric melanoma is a rare disease that affects approximately 6 out of every one million children and accounts for 1-4% of all melanomas. This article reviews the epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of pediatric melanoma - with particular attention to recent updates in the literature. While awareness of melanoma increases among the general population, recent data suggest stable and even declining incidence rates among certain pediatric populations. Studies have examined clinical features and presentations of melanoma among the pediatric population and the conventional ABCDE criteria (asymmetrical shape, border, color, diameter, evolving lesion) used to diagnosis adult melanoma may not be entirely appropriate for pediatric melanoma; as such, additional pediatric-ABCD and CUP criteria (color changing, ulceration, pyogenic granuloma-like lesions) have been proposed. Dermoscopy serves as a valuable tool to detect suggestive patterns among pediatric skin lesions, and aids in the monitoring of skin lesions and detection of melanoma among children and adolescents. The etiology and pathogenesis of the pediatric melanoma is currently being investigated; studies have examined the genetic alterations that may be involved with the development of pediatric melanomas including TERT promoter, BRAF, and NRAS among others. While genetic testing using molecular techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization and fluorescence in-situ hybridization is helpful for diagnosis in certain contexts, molecular workup is not considered standard of care among pediatric melanoma cases, and in fact has not been proven to reliably distinguish between benign and malignant spitzoid tumors in children. Our growing understanding of melanoma has informed treatment decisions regarding management of positive sentinel lymph nodes, use of adjuvant therapy, and use of immunotherapy in treatment plans.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node imaging in urologic oncology
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ANDROLOGY AND UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node (LN) metastases in urological malignancies correlate with poor oncological outcomes. Accurate LN staging is of great importance since patients can benefit from an optimal staging, accordingly aligned therapy and more radical treatments. Current conventional cross-sectional imaging modalities [e.g., computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] are not accurate enough to reliably detect early LN metastases as they rely on size criteria. Radical lymphadenectomy, the surgical removal of regional LNs, is the gold standard of invasive LN staging. The LN dissection is guided by anatomic considerations of lymphatic drainage pathways of the primary tumor. Selection of patients for lymphadenectomy heavily relies on preoperative risk stratification and nomograms and, as a result a considerable number of patients unnecessarily undergo invasive staging with associated morbidity. On the other hand, due to individual variability in lymphatic drainage, LN metastases can occur outside of standard lymphadenectomy templates leading to potential understaging and undertreatment. In theory, metastases from the primary tumor need to pass through the chain of LNs, where the initial node is defined as the sentinel LN. In theory, identifying and removing this LN could lead to accurate assessment of metastatic status. Radiotracers and more recently fluorescent dyes and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) are injected into the primary tumor or peritumoral and the sentinel LNs are identified intraoperatively by a gamma probe, fluorescent camera or a handheld magnetometer. Preoperative imaging [e.g., single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT or MRI] after tracer injection can further improve preoperative planning of LN dissection. While sentinel LN biopsy is an accepted and widely used approach in melanoma and breast cancer staging, its use in urological malignancies is still limited. Most data published so far is in penile cancer staging since this cancer has a typical echelon-based lymphatic metastasizing pattern. More recent data is encouraging with low false-negative rates, but its use is limited to centers with high expertise. Current guidelines recommend sentinel LN biopsy as an accepted alternative to modified inguinal lymphadenectomy in patients with pT1G2 disease and non-palpable inguinal LNs. In prostate cancer, a high diagnostic accuracy could be demonstrated for the sentinel approach. Nevertheless, due to lack of data or high false-negative rates in other urological malignancies, sentinel LN biopsy is still considered experimental in other urological malignancies. More high-level evidence and longitudinal data is needed to determine its final value in those malignancies. In this manuscript, we will review sentinel node imaging for urologic malignancies.

TI  - Collaboration or negotiation: two ways of interacting suggest how shared thinking develops
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper contrasts two ways that shared thinking can be conceptualized: as negotiation, where individuals join their separate ideas, or collaboration, as people mutually engage together in a unified process, as an ensemble. We argue that these paradigms are culturally based, with the negotiation model fitting within an assumption system of separate entities - an assumption system we believe to be common in psychology and in middle-class European American society and the collaboration model fitting within a holistic worldview that appears to be common in Indigenous-heritage communities of the Americas. We discuss cultural differences in children's interactions - as negotiation or collaboration that suggest how these distinct paradigms develop.

TI  - Striking divergences in Earth Observation products may limit their use for REDD
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Countries are required to generate baselines of carbon emissions, or Forest Reference Emission Levels, for implementing REDD+ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and to access results-based payments. Developing these baselines requires accurate maps of carbon stocks and historical deforestation. Global remote sensing products provide low-cost solutions for this information, but there has been little validation of these products at national scales. This study compares the ability of currently available products obtained from remote sensing data to deliver estimates of deforestation and associated carbon emissions in Guinea-Bissau, a West African country encompassing the climate and vegetation gradients that are typical of sub-Saharan Africa. We show that disagreements in estimates of deforestation are striking, and this variation leads to high uncertainty in derived emissions. For Guinea-Bissau, we suggest that higher temporal resolution of remote sensing products is required to reduce this uncertainty by overcoming current limitations in differentiating deforestation from seasonality. In contrast, existing datasets of carbon stocks show better agreement, and contribute much less to the variation in estimated emissions. We conclude that using global datasets based on Earth Observation data is a cost-effective solution to make REDD+ operational, but deforestation maps in particular should be derived carefully and their uncertainty assessed.

TI  - Improving tree cover estimates for fine-scale landscape ecology
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Mapping the presence of trees is an important tool for assessing tree-covered habitats, their changes, and calculating variables, like forest area and fragmentation.Objective Despite the popularity of automated pattern recognition to make tree cover maps, their accuracy and precision are rarely tested or compared to more modest methods, like human-based pattern recognition to identify tree cover.Methods Here, we test the performance of two computer-generated tree mapping products, the Global Change Forest database and the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System, against ground surveys and a human-made tree cover map created using Google Earth to hand digitize the presence and absence of trees in a diversified agricultural region in Costa Rica (934km(2)).Results The human-made tree cover map properly classified 100% ground survey sites and explained 81% of the variance in percent of canopy cover values from the field. The Global Change Forest database misclassified 18 of 23 ground survey sites in deforested locations and explained 6% of the variance in percent of canopy cover values from ground surveys. The Carnegie Landsat Analysis System misclassified 9 of 23 ground survey sites in deforested locations and explained 38% of the variance in percent of canopy cover values from the field.Conclusions Our results suggest that the Global Change Forest database overestimated tree cover by of 20% and the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System by 1%. We caution landscape ecologists working at fine spatial scales against using computer-generated tree cover, especially in the partially forested lands that increasingly cover the planet.

TI  - Impacts of the forest definitions adopted by African countries on carbon conservation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we aim to assess the impacts of the forest definitions adopted by each African country involved in the global climate change programmes of the United Nations on national carbon emission estimations. To do so, we estimate the proportion of national carbon stocks and tree cover loss that are found in areas considered to be non-forest areas. These non-forest areas are defined with respect to a threshold on the percentage of tree cover adopted by each country. Using percent tree cover and aboveground biomass maps derived from remote sensing data, we quantitatively show that in many countries, a large proportion of carbon stocks are found in non-forest areas, where a large amount of tree cover loss can also occur. We further found that under the REDD+ framework (reduced deforestation, reduced degradation, enhancement and conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests), some partner countries have proposed activities related to only reducing deforestation, even when a large proportion of their carbon stocks are stored outside forests. This situation may represent a limitation of the efficiency of the REDD+ mechanism, and could be avoided if these countries choose a lower tree cover threshold for their definition of forests and/or if they were are engaged in other activities.

TI  - Fifteen Years of Cal/Val Service to Reference Altimetry Missions: Calibration of Satellite Altimetry at the Permanent Facilities in Gavdos and Crete, Greece
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimetry provides exceptional means for absolute and undisputable monitoring of changes in sea level and inland waters (rivers and lakes), over regional to global scales, with accuracy and with respect to the center of mass of the Earth. Altimetry system's responses have to be continuously monitored for their quality, biases, errors, drifts, etc. with calibration. Absolute calibration of altimeters is achieved by external and independent to satellite facilities on the ground. This is the mainstay for a continuous, homogenous, and reliable monitoring of the earth and its oceans. This paper describes the development of the Permanent Facility for Altimetry Calibration in Gavdos/Crete, Greece, as of 2001 along with its infrastructure and instrumentation. Calibration results are presented for the reference missions of Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3. Then, this work continues with the determination of relative calibrations with respect to reference missions for Sentinel-3A, HY-2A, and SARAL/AltiKa. Calibration results are also given for Jason-2 and Jason-3 altimeters using the transponder at the CDN1 Cal/Val site on the mountains of Crete, with simultaneous comparisons against sea-surface calibration and during their tandem mission. Finally, the paper presents procedures for estimating uncertainties for altimeter calibration to meet the Fiducial Reference Measurement standards.

TI  - Retrieval algorithm of phycocyanin concentration in inland lakes from Sentinel 3A-OLCI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria is the dominant algae species in inland eutrophic water bodies, and the phycocyanin (PC) is its unique pigment which can be used as an indicator of its presence. Therefore, the retrieval of PC concentration by remote sensing is of great significance to early warning of cyanobacteria bloom. In this paper, the Random Forest retrieval Model for estimating PC concentration based on the sentinel 3A-OLCI bands was developed using in situ data collected from Taihu Lake, Dianchi Lake and Hongzehu Lake. The results of the importance analysis of input variables in random forest demonstrated that the seventh band (674 nm), the eighth band (665 nm) and the ninth band (620 nm) have significant impact on the PC estimation. The accuracy assessment showed that the Mean Absolute Percentage Error(MAPE) of this PC retrieval model is only 34.86% with the Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) of 38.67 mu g/L. The comparison between the mode developed by this paper and other models, i.e., Simis semi-analytic algorithm and PCI exponential model was extensively conducted, and it was found that compared with other two models, the MAPE was improved by 85.65% and 15.65% respectively, and the RMSE was improved by 26.08 mu g/L and 19.86 mu g/L respectively. The atmospheric correction accuracy was further analyzed using the in situ samples and synchronous satellite image, and the result showed that the Management Uint Mathematical Model (MUMM) method can be successfully used for the OLCI image. The atmospheric corrected spectral curves are consistent with the measured spectral curves, and the MAPEs of 8 bands are all less than 30% at the wavelength range between 560 and 779 nm. The random forest model developed for estimating PC concentration in this paper can be successfully applied to Sentinel 3A-OLCI images, which provides a new algorithm for remote estimation of phycocyanin concentration in inland lake.

TI  - Revisiting Fisher's approach to the handling of horizontal spatial correlations of observation errors in a variational framework
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-standing issue in atmospheric data assimilation is that only a fraction of the available observations are used in the analysis. This is especially true for satellite data, which undergo channel selection and are thinned to coarser spatial and temporal resolutions. Up to now, horizontal spatial correlations of observation errors have not been fully accounted for. However, we may expect progress in forecast quality from the assimilation of spatially dense no-thinned data while accounting for correlated errors, as this may provide a better constraint on the initial conditions at smaller scales. This article addresses the handling of the observation-error covariance matrix when the number of observations is large (e.g. above a few thousand). In variational methods, the analysis usually requires evaluation of products with the inverse observation-error covariance matrix; however, the lack of structure and the size of the problem make it difficult to invert this matrix with direct approaches. A method has been proposed several years ago by M. Fisher, in which an observation-error covariance matrix is built from a sequence of operators. The Lanczos algorithm is then used to provide a low-rank eigenvalue decomposition of the correlation matrix, which is regularized and explicitly inverted. This article elaborates on this method, with application to the so-called Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat Second Generation for the convective-scale model of Meteo-France. We analyze the implications of truncating the eigenspectrum. We show that both the modelled spatial correlations and the variances are affected by truncation noise. The noise in the variance, in particular, is linked with the local density of the observations. Overall, several hundred eigenpairs may be required to obtain a fair representation of the covariances. While computationally expensive, this method can be used as a baseline to evaluate other approaches.

TI  - Gross primary productivity of a large metropolitan region in midsummer using high spatial resolution satellite imagery
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although gross primary productivity (GPP) is estimated with remote sensing over large regions of Earth, urban areas are usually excluded due to the lack of light use efficiency (LUE) parameters for urban vegetation and the spatial heterogeneity of urban land cover. Here, we estimated midsummer GPP, both within and among vegetation and land-use types, across the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota metropolitan region. We derived LUE parameters for urban vegetation types using estimates of GPP from tree sap flow and eddy covariance CO2 flux observations, and from fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation based on 2m resolution WorldView-2 satellite imagery. Mean GPP per unit land area (including vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil) was 2.64g C m(-2) d(-1), and was 4.45g C m(-2) d(-1) per unit vegetated area. Mapped GPP estimates were within 11.4% of estimates from independent tall tower eddy covariance measurements. Turf grass GPP had a larger coefficient of variation (0.18) than other vegetation classes (similar to 0.10). Vegetation composition was largely consistent across the study area. Excluding golf courses, mean land-use GPP for the total study area varied more by percent vegetation cover (R-2=0.98, p<0.001) than by variability within vegetation classes (R-2=0.21, p=0.19). Urban GPP in general was less than half that of natural forests and grasslands in the same climate zone.

TI  - Assimilation of All-Sky Infrared Radiances from <i>Himawari</i>-8 and Impacts of Moisture and Hydrometer Initialization on Convection-Permitting Tropical Cyclone Prediction
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the impacts of assimilating all-sky infrared satellite radiances from Himawari-8, a new-generation geostationary satellite that shares similar remote sensing technology with the U.S. geostationary satellite GOES-16, for convection-permitting initialization and prediction of tropical cyclones with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). This case studies the rapid intensification stages of Supertyphoon Soudelor (2015), one of the most intense tropical cyclones ever observed by Himawari-8. It is found that hourly cycling assimilation of the infrared radiance improves not only the estimate of the initial intensity, but also the spatial distribution of essential convective activity associated with the incipient tropical cyclone vortex. Deterministic convection-permitting forecasts initialized from the EnKF analyses are capable of simulating the early development of Soudelor, which demonstrates encouraging prospects for future improvement in tropical cyclone prediction through assimilating all-sky radiances from geostationary satellites such as Himawari-8 and GOES-16. A series of forecast sensitivity experiments are designed to systematically explore the impacts of moisture updates in the data assimilation cycles on the development and prediction of Soudelor. It is found that the assimilation of the brightness temperatures contributes not only to better constraining moist convection within the inner-core region, but also to developing a more resilient initial vortex, both of which are necessary to properly capture the rapid intensification process of tropical cyclones.

TI  - Revisiting the role of metabolism during development
T2  - DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Anemerging view emphasizes that metabolism is highly regulated in both time and space. In addition, it is increasingly being recognized that metabolic pathways are tightly connected to specific biological processes such as cell signaling, proliferation and differentiation. As we obtain a better view of this spatiotemporal regulation of metabolism, and of the molecular mechanisms that connect metabolism and signaling, we can now move from largely correlative to more functional studies. It is, therefore, a particularly promising time to revisit how metabolism can affect multiple aspects of animal development. In this Review, we discuss how metabolism is mechanistically linked to cellular and developmental programs through both its bioenergetic and metabolic signaling functions. We highlight how metabolism is regulated across various spatial and temporal scales, and discuss how this regulation can influence cellular processes such as cell signaling, gene expression, and epigenetic and post-translational modifications during embryonic development.

TI  - An insight into land use and land cover changes and their impacts in Rib watershed, north-western highland Ethiopia
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes have severely threatened ecological and economic sustainability in highland Ethiopia. A clear insight into its extent and rate is, therefore, a crucial step for effective land use planning and decision making. The main objective of this study was to analyse the nature of LULC change and its impacts in north-western highland Ethiopia over the last four decades, using the integrated approach of remote sensing and geographic information system in combination with field data. Multidate Landsat images were used for spatio-temporal change detection through the help of ArcGIS 10.3 and ERDAS IMAGINE 2014 software. A pixel-based statistical analysis was used to measure class-to-class changes and total losses and gains of each LULC class during the study period. The results show that a significant and widespread change of LULC has occurred in the study area during the period 1973-2016. The cropland, grassland, and shrubland were the dominant LULC types taking more than 95% in total over the entire study period. The cropland and built-up land showed a significant increase from 1973 to 2016, whereas grassland and shrubland decreased gradually over the same time period. The LULC change in the study area has caused severe environmental degradation, which in turn has affected ecological sustainability, agricultural productivity, food security, and rural livelihoods. The results of this study are expected to provide local-level current information on the extent, rate, and impacts of LULC change for decision makers seeking to ensure ecological, social, and economic sustainability.

TI  - Vegetation Characterization through the Use of Precipitation-Affected SAR Signals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current space-based SAR offers unique opportunities to classify vegetation types and to monitor vegetation growth due to its frequent acquisitions and its sensitivity to vegetation geometry. However, SAR signals also experience frequent temporal fluctuations caused by precipitation events, complicating the mapping and monitoring of vegetation. In this paper, we show that the influence of a priori known precipitation events on the signals can be used advantageously for the classification of vegetation conditions. For this, we exploit the change in Sentinel-1 backscatter response between consecutive acquisitions under varying wetness conditions, which we show is dependent on the state of vegetation. The performance further improves when a priori information on the soil type is taken into account.

TI  - Geocoding Error Correction for InSAR Point Clouds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is an advanced multitemporal InSAR technique that is capable of retrieving the 3D coordinates and the underlying deformation of time-coherent scatterers. Various factors degrade the localization accuracy of PSI point clouds in the geocoding process, which causes problems for interpretation of deformation results and also making it difficult for the point clouds to be compared with or integrated into data from other sensors. In this study, we employ the SAR imaging geodesy method to perform geodetic corrections on SAR timing observations and thus improve the positioning accuracy in the horizontal components. We further utilize geodetic stereo SAR to extract large number of highly precise ground control points (GCP) from SAR images, in order to compensate for the unknown height offset of the PSI point cloud. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach using TerraSAR-X high resolution spotlight images over the city of Berlin, Germany. The corrected results are compared with a reference LiDAR point cloud of Berlin, which confirms the improvement in the geocoding accuracy.

TI  - Direct toxicity of the water-soluble fractions of a crude and a diesel-motor oil on the survival of free-living nematodes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water-soluble fraction (WSF) of an oil contains different classes of petroleum hydrocarbons and, despite their low potential for bioaccumulation, these can be highly toxic to biota. Nematodes are usually the most abundant and species-rich group of metazoans in marine and freshwater sediments as well as terrestrial soils and have been proposed as excellent models to monitor pollution effects. The first aim of this study was to assess the direct effects of the WSFs of a crude and a diesel-motor oil on the survival of 12 free-living bacterivorous nematode species from marine, freshwater and soil environments, and belonging to diverse taxonomic groups. The second aim was to compare the responses of these twelve test species and assess their suitability as candidate alternatives for the common model species Caenorhabditis elegans in future toxicity testing. The third and final aim was to test the common assumption that nematodes which are phylogenetically more closely related would exhibit more similar sensitivities than more distantly related species, and that - as is commonly stated in literature nematodes belonging to the family Rhabditidae would be the most pollution-tolerant species. While the crude oil was a complex matrix of substances, containing many soluble compounds, the diesel-motor oil 10W40 was characterized by only few soluble substances. Nevertheless, the diesel-motor oil WSF was as toxic (or even more toxic) to some of the tested nematode species as the crude-oil WSF. This could be linked to differences in compounds interactions in each oil-WSF, or to the presence of fuel additives in the 10W40-WSF. Most species exhibited moderate to extreme mortality levels in oil treatments, and experienced an increased mortality with time. Overall, marine nematodes were more sensitive than freshwater/soil organisms, albeit with some exceptions. Species sensitivities to oil did not follow patterns of taxonomic relatedness, contradicting the idea that closely related species should intrinsically respond similarly to pollution. Rhabditidae were not generally more sensitive than other species: out of 6 species of Rhabditidae tested, only Bursilla monhystera was highly tolerant, while C. elegans and cryptic species of Litoditis marina were among the most sensitive taxa. Therefore, we recommend that future effect studies do not focus on a single model species but instead incorporate multiple species for a better and more robust assessment of pollutant effects.

Despite its enormous potential, research investigating the possible uses in archaeology is still very scarce, especially of one which works solely with single date analysis starting with a single SAR scene. Therefore, we present the results of single date analysis developed with the acquisition of a CSK-SPOTLIGHT X-Band SAR image from Telespazio Iberica (Italian Space Agency) which examined 49 km(2) of the territory of the ancient Roman city of Mellaria. This has allowed us to calibrate the possibilities of CSK X-Band SAR in a geographic environment under climatic and atmospheric conditions other than those studied up to now. In addition, it is the first time that it has been used in an archaeological environment as dense as Spain. We tried to use the X-Band SAR (1 m/pixel) image in order to detect archaeological traces in combination with thermal images (0.26 m/pixel) and RGB (0.03 m/pixel) taken airborne. We also used the RGB orthophotographs from the PNOA-IGN (0.50 m/pixel) as a comparative method.

TI  - Tracking arctic marine mammal resilience in an era of rapid ecosystem alteration
T2  - PLOS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is significantly altering arctic marine ecosystems. Specifically, the precipitous loss of sea ice is creating a dichotomy between ice-dependent polar bears and pinnipeds that are losing habitat and some cetaceans that are gaining habitat. While final outcomes are hard to predict for the many and varied marine mammal populations that rely on arctic habitats, we suggest a simplified framework to assess status, based upon ranking a population's size, range, behavior, and health. This basic approach is proposed as a means to prioritize and expedite conservation and management efforts in an era of rapid ecosystem alteration.

TI  - Improving land use/land cover classification utilizing a hybrid method of decision trees and artificial neural networks
T2  - BIOSCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) has become increasingly important for sustainable management of the natural resources to overcome the problems of haphazard development, deteriorating environmental quality, loss of fertile agricultural lands and destruction of wetlands. Comparable to the areas located at the northern part of the Nile Delta, EL-Manzala Lake and its surroundings are continuously subjected to numerous threats. These threats include converting parts of the lake into other land uses such as the fish ponds located to the south and south-east of the lake. The lake water is also subjected to pollution from the inflow of agriculture drainage water. Hence, the necessity arises to have a permanent monitoring strategy for this area to enable decision makers to develop plans to overcome these threats. The aim of this work is to develop a hybrid method that integrates decision trees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to increase the accuracy of classification in a selected area covering El-Manzala Lake and its surrounding. In this study, the DT was designed first in a manner that the classes can be separated and the DT results are then input into an ANN. Two satellites data were integrated as the input of the classification. The data included the reflectance of the Sentinel 2 satellite bands from the blue to the shortwave bands (discarding the red edge bands), and the emission of the thermal bands of the Landsat 8 satellite. The images of both satellites were acquired at the same date. Moreover, theses data were used in the format of band ratios and specific principal component analysis (PCAs). Utilizing this approach the overall accuracy of the classification could reach 98.6% while it could only reach 70.2 % when processing the data using the DT only and has been lower using ANN.

TI  - Soil salinity mapping utilizing sentinel-2 and neural networks
T2  - Indian Journal of Agricultural Research
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is the most important soil property that affects the agriculture productivity. Periodical monitoring of its status is considered a crucial factor in the selection of appropriate agricultural practices to attain a sustainable production. The availability of remote sensing data processed by a somewhat novel method such as artificial neural networks (ANN) offer a potential solution that could easily and affordably replace the in-site monitoring methods. The aim of this work is to use high spectral resolution Sentinel-2 (S2) data for soil salinity prediction utilizing neural networks. The study evaluated three approaches in processing the S2 data for inclusion in the artificial neural network for soil salinity prediction. These approaches included S2 spectral reflectance data, spectral indices and principal component analysis (PCA) of the S2 data. The results revealed that a combination of these approaches including the reflectance data of band 11(shortwave infrared band) of S2, the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and the second PCA (dominated by the near infrared band) gave the best performance when used as input when designing the artificial neural networks to predict the soil salinity. The overall accuracy of this approach has a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.94 between the actual and predicted soil salinity.

TI  - Incidence of Heart Failure and Cardiomyopathy Following Initiation of Medications for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Descriptive Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose/Background Stimulant abuse is associated with cardiomyopathy, but cardiomyopathy rates with therapeutic use of stimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are poorly characterized. Labels for methylphenidate, amphetamine, and atomoxetine caution against use in patients with cardiovascular disease. We sought to assess the incidence of new-onset heart failure or cardiomyopathy among initiators of these medications.Methods/Procedures Using the Sentinel distributed database, we analyzed new-onset heart failure or cardiomyopathy among initiators of selected ADHD medications (amphetamine products including lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, and atomoxetine), by duration of use (0-90, 91-180, 181-270, 271-365, 366-730, and 731-1095 days) and age group (<22, 22-44, 45-64, and 65 years).Findings/Results In our sample of 2,012,948 initiators of ADHD medications, 44.6% were female, and 54.1% were younger than 22 years. Heart failure/cardiomyopathy rates in the age groups younger than 22 and 22 to 44 years old were less than 50 per 10,000 person-years, without clear trends by duration of use. The highest rates occurred soon after treatment initiation in the age group 65 years or older, with 1 case per 10.5 person-years of follow-up, or 950 cases per 10,000 person-years, for days 0-90.Implications/Conclusions Heart failure/cardiomyopathy rates were not higher over 3 years of ADHD medication use compared with shorter-term treatment. In older age groups, lower rates later in treatment could reflect depletion of patients predisposed to the outcome if they develop it soon after starting treatment.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover estimation by using multi-angle vegetation index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation index-based (VI-based) mixture model is widely used to derive green fractional vegetation cover (FVC) from remotely sensed data. Two critical parameters of the model are the vegetation index values of fully-vegetated and bare soil pixels (denoted V-x and V-n hereafter). These are commonly empirically set according to spatial and/or temporal statistics. The uncertainty and difficulty of accurately determining V-x and V-n in many ecosystems limits the accuracy of resultant FVC estimates and hence reduces the utility of VI-based mixture model for FVC estimation. Here, an improved method called MultiVI is developed to quantitatively estimate V-x and V-n from angular VI acquired at two viewing angles. The directional VI is calculated from the MODIS Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)/Albedo product (MCD43A1) data. The results of simulated evaluation with 10% added noise show that the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of FVC is approximately 0.1 (the valid FVC range is [0, 1]). Direct evaluation against 34 globally-distributed FVC measurements from VAlidation of Land European Remote sensing Instruments (VALERI) sites during 2000 to 2014 demonstrated that the accuracy of MultiVI FVC (R-2 = 0.866, RMSD = 0.092) exceeds than from SPOT/VEGETATION bioGEOphysical product version 1 (GEOV1) FVC (R-2 = 0.795, RMSD = 0.159). MultiVI FVC also exhibits higher correlation to the VALERI reference FVC than does the MODIS fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product (MCD15A2H; R-2 is 0.696). A key advantage of the MultiVI method is obvious in areas where fully-vegetated and/or bare soil pixels do not exist in moderate-coarse spatial resolution imagery when compared to the conventional VI-based mixture modelling. The MultiVI method can be flexibly implemented over regional or global scales to monitor FVC, with maps of V-x and V-n generated as two important byproducts.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes in a sub-humid Montane forest in an arid setting: A case study of the Marsabit forest reserve in northern Kenya
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been drastic changes in land-use patterns in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR) as a consequence of anthropogenic processes for livelihood improvement over time. The objective of this study was to assess the land-use and land-cover changes (LULCC), especially those related to the forest cover, in the MFR using multi-temporal Landsat images from Landsat 7 and 8 covering the period 1990 to 2017. Unsupervised and supervised classifications were carried out with the final classification done using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier for each period image to create six dominant land-use and land-cover classes (LULC) which included: shrubland, grassland, bare land, open forest, agriculture and settlement, closed forest, and wetland. The results showed that, between 1990 and 2010, the closed forest area had reduced from 19,599 to 9275 ha (-52.7%), open forest from 30,214 to 7345 ha (-75.7%), and shrubland from 83,288 to 65,212 ha (-21.7%). Over the same period there was, a corresponding increase in the grassland area from 35,233 to 56,066 ha (+58.7%), bare land from 19565 to 35,691 ha (+82.4%) and agriculture/settlement class from 12,842 to 24,072 ha (+87.5%). With the introduction of a forest moratorium illegalising consumptive forest use between 2010 and 2017, the closed forest area increased from 9275 to 12,133 ha (+30.8%), bare land from 35,691 to 42,275 ha (+15.6%) and shrubland 65,212 to 100, 452 ha (+35.1%), with a corresponding decrease in open forest area from 7345 to 1385 ha (-430%), grassland from 56,066 to 39,542 ha (-41.9%), and agriculture/settlement class from 24,072 to 7235 ha (-232.7%). The Focused group discussion (FGD) and Key informant interview (KII) respondents identified illegal logging, livestock incursion/foraging, inadequacies of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) and Kenya Forest Service (KFS) in forest management, forest excisions, firewood collection and illegal settlements in the Marsabit National Reserve (MNR) as the main drivers of LULCC. The study proposes the implementation of the ten-year (2015-2025) Marsabit Forest Ecosystem Management Plan in managing the drivers of LULCC in a bid to safeguard the ecosystem services (ES) provided by the MFR.

TI  - Channel migration zone mapping of the River Ganga in the Diara surrounding region of Eastern India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - River channel migration is the universal phenomenon that is common in almost all alluvial rivers. The holy River Ganga, the heartbeat of India, is also not an exception in this case. It has shifted its course from time to time. After crossing the Rajmahal hills that is situated in the north-eastern corner of the Chota Nagpur plateau, this main river of India has started its lower course by flowing over the great low-lying flat plain of Bengal. In this flat plain area, the channel migration is a common phenomenon which is observed in the River Ganga also. The study is done in the segment of the Ganga River which is situated in the Diara surrounding area. Diara is a physical cum administrative region of the Malda district of the state of West Bengal of India which occupies an area of almost 900km(2). For the identification of channel migration zone, several methods are used like construction of historical migration zone (HMZ), erosion buffer (EB), avulsion potential zone (APZ), restricted and un-restricted migration area (RMA and UrMA) and retreating migration zone (RMZ). The impact of the channel migration over the villages of the Diara region has also been depicted in this study. Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System (RS-GIS) is used to perform this study by taking the help of historical maps, Survey of India topographical sheets, LANDSAT imageries, etc. The results show that the river has a historical migration zone of 855.55km(2) during 1926-2016 period which is near the entire area of the Diara region (i.e. 900km(2)). The construction of EB over the Ganga River for the next 100years shows that more than half of the area of the Diara region will go under the river bed.

TI  - Threats to coastal communities of Mahanadi delta due to imminent consequences of erosion - Present and near future
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal erosion is a natural hazard which causes significant loss to properties as well as coastal habitats. Coastal districts of Mahanadi delta, one of the most populated deltas of the Indian subcontinent, are suffering from the ill effects of coastal erosion. An important amount of assets is being lost every year alongwith forced migration of huge portions of coastal communities due to erosion. An attempt has been made in this study to predict the future coastline of the Mahanadi Delta based on historical trends. Historical coastlines of the delta have been extracted using semi-automated Tasselled Cap technique from the LANDSAT satellite imageries of the year 1990, 1995, 2000, 2006 and 2010. Using Digital Shoreline Assessment System (DSAS) tool of USGS, the trend of the coastline has been assessed in the form of End Point Rate (EPR) and Linear Regression Rate (LRR). A hybrid methodology has been adopted using statistical (EPR) and trigonometric functions to predict the future positions of the coastlines of the years 2020, 2035 and 2050. The result showed that most of the coastline (approximate to 65%) is facing erosion at present. The predicted outcome shows that by the end of year 2050 the erosion scenario will worsen which in turn would lead to very high erosion risk for 30% of the total coastal mouzas (small administrative blocks). This study revealed the coastal erosion trend of Mahanadi delta and based on the predicted coastlines it can be inferred that the coastal communities in near future would be facing substantial threat due to erosion particularly in areas surrounding Puri (a renowned tourist pilgrimage) and Paradwip (one of the busiest ports and harbours of the country).

TI  - Modern approaches for early detection of forest pathogens are sorely needed in the United States
T2  - FOREST PATHOLOGY
M3  - Letter
AB  - Current plant regulatory protocols rely on lists of known pathogens, but many forest pathogens are unknown. Live plants are inspected at port of entry for disease symptoms, but many plant pathogens can persist asymptomatically. Current efforts should be expanded by including random sampling of both symptomatic and asymptomatic plant tissues. Molecular probes and standardized protocols could be developed for invasive forest pathogens of most concern to the United States. High-throughput sequencing (also known as next-generation sequencing, or NGS) and bioinformatics could be used to identify potential pathogens in plant and soil samples collected at ports of entry from sentinel trees planted abroad, or in biosurveillance efforts. If potentially invasive forest pathogens were to be identified at ports of entry, sentinel trees, or with biosurveillance, this information must be shared with agencies that conduct forest health monitoring surveys beyond ports of entry.

TI  - Monitoring the Vulnerability of the Dam and Dikes in Germano Iron Mining Area after the Collapse of the Tailings Dam of FundAo (Mariana-MG, Brazil) Using DInSAR Techniques with TerraSAR-X Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The FundAo tailings dam in the Germano iron mining complex (Mariana, Brazil) collapsed on the afternoon of 5 November 2015, and around 32.6 million cubic meters of mining waste spilled from the dam, causing polluion with mining waste along a trajectory of 668 km, extending to the Atlantic Ocean. The Sela & Tulipa and Selinha dikes, and the main Germano tailings dam, were directly or indirectly affected by the accident. This work presents an investigation using Advanced-Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) techniques for risk assessment in these critical structures during 18 months after the catastrophic event. The approach was based on the integration of SBAS (Small Baseline Subset) and PSI (Persistent Scatterer Interferometry) techniques, aiming at detecting linear and nonlinear ground displacements in these mining structures. It used a set of 48 TerraSAR-X images acquired on ascending mode from 11 November 2015 to 15 May 2017. The results provided by the A-DInSAR analysis indicated an overall stability in the dikes and in the main wall of Germano tailings dam, which is in agreement with in situ topographic monitoring. In addition, it was possible to detect areas within the reservoir showing accumulated values of up to -125 mm of subsidence, probably caused by settlements of the waste dry material due to the interruption of the mining waste deposition, and values up to -80 mm on auxiliary dikes, probably caused by continuous traffic of heavy equipment. The spatiotemporal information of surface displacement of this large mining structure can be used for future operational planning and risk control.

TI  - Evaluating RADARSAT-2 for the Monitoring of Lake Ice Phenology Events in Mid-Latitudes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice is an important component in understanding the local climate as changes in temperature have an impact on the timing of key ice phenology events. In recent years, there has been a decline in the in-situ monitoring of lake ice events in Canada and microwave remote sensing imagery from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is more widely used due to the high spatial resolution and response of backscatter to the freezing and melting of the ice surface. RADARSAT-2 imagery was used to develop a threshold-based method for determining lake ice events for mid-latitude lakes in Central Ontario from 2008 to 2017. Estimated lake ice phenology events are validated with ground-based observations and are compared against the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS band 2). The threshold-based method was found to accurately identify 12 out of 17 freeze events and 13 out of 17 melt events from 2015-2017 when compared to ground-based observations. Mean absolute errors for freeze events ranged from 2.5 to 10.0 days when compared to MODIS imagery while the mean absolute error for water clear of ice (WCI) ranged from 1.5 to 7.1 days. The method is important for the study of mid-latitude lake ice due to its unique success in detecting multiple freeze and melting events throughout the ice season.

TI  - The predictive value of sentinel node biopsy in early breast cancer after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy: A prospective study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: A sentinel Node (SN) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with clinically node negative axilla (cNO). SN after Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is feasible but not accurate in clinically node positive (cN1-3) patients. The goal of this study is to determine the negative predictive value (NPV) of SN in cNO breast cancer after NACT. A secondary endpoint is to determine if ALND can be avoided after NACT regardless of the pre-treatment clinical staging of the axilla, in case of a normalization of the F-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography scan (PET-CT scan).Design: A single institution prospective study regarding the negative predictive value of the SN in breast cancer after NACT was conducted in the Multidisciplinary Breast Clinic of the Antwerp University Hospital from 29/03/2010 until 01/12/2015 (Study number: B30020108368). Inclusion criteria for study participation were: breast cancer, age above 18 years, female, tumor stages T2-T4 NO-3 or T1N1-N3. All patients were staged by a mammography, ultrasound of the axilla, MRI of the breast, PET-CT scan and bone scintigraphy. They received NACT consisting of 12 cycles of paclitaxel or 4 cycles of docetaxel followed by dose dense doxorubicin or epirubicin/cyclofosfamide or vice versa as a standard initial treatment. After 6 weeks, a PET-CT scan was performed for early tumour response evaluation. At the day of operation, a (99)mTC-labelled nanocolloid was used to identify the SN. During the surgery the SN were removed separately together with a complete ALND.Results: A total of 150 patients were enrolled in our study of which 129 were eligible for analysis. 53 patients had a positive SN of which 32 have a positive axillary lymph nodes (ALN), positive predictive value (PPV) was 60%; 76 patients had a negative SN of which 6 had a positive ALN (NPV 92%). The sensitivity is 84% and the specificity 76% with a false omission rate (FOR) of 8%. In total 45 patients ALN were clinical negative and no suspect lymph nodes were seen on ultrasound, MRI and PET-CT scan) and 45 patients had negative a SN, with no ALN and 2 patients had a positive SN of which 1 patients had axillary involvement (NPV 100%). The FOR of cN1: 5%, cN2: 37%, cN3 33%. A total of 22 patients out of 84 patients (26%) of which 15/49 cN1 (30%), 6/23 (26%) cN2, 1/12 (8%) have after 6 weeks of chemotherapy and normalization on PET-CT scan. A total of 17 patients had a negative SN and ALN. The FOR was in this group was 0%.Conclusion: A SNB should become the standard after NACT if case of a cNO. If after NACT the PET CT has normalized, no ALND should be performed if the SN is negative. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Assessment of land cover and land use change impact on soil loss in a tropical catchment by using multitemporal SPOT-5 satellite images and Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a common land degradation problem and has disastrous impacts on natural ecosystems and human life. Therefore, researchers have focused on detection of land cover-land use changes (LCLUC) with respect to monitoring and mitigating the potential soil erosion. This article aims to appraise the relationship between LCLUC and soil erosion in the Cameron Highlands (Malaysia) by using multitemporal satellite images and ancillary data. Land clearing and heavy rainfall events in the study area has resulted in increased soil loss. Moreover, unsustainable development and agricultural practices, mismanagement, and lack of land use policies increase the soil erosion rate. Hence, the main contribution of this study lies in the application of appropriate land management practices in relation to water erosion through identification and prediction of the impacts of LCLUC on the spatial distribution of potential soil loss in a region susceptible to natural hazards such as landslide. The LCLUC distribution within the study area was mapped for 2005, 2010, and 2015 by using SPOT-5 temporal satellite imagery and object-based image classification. A projected land cover-land use map was also produced for 2025 through integration of Markov chain and cellular automata models. An empirical-based approach (Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation) coupled with geographic information system was applied to measure soil loss and susceptibility to erosion over the study area for four periods (2005, 2010, 2015, and 2025). The model comprises five parameters, namely, rainfall factor, soil erodibility, topographical factor, conservation factor, and support practice factor. Results exhibited that the average amount of soil loss increased by 31.77tha(-1)yr(-1) from 2005 to 2015 and was predicted to dramatically increase in 2025. The results generated from this research recommends that awareness of spatial and temporal patterns of high soil loss risk areas can help deploy site-specific soil conservation measures and erosion mitigation processes and prevent unsystematic deforestation and urbanization by the authorities.

TI  - Evidence of bovine viral diarrhea virus transmission by back pond water in experimentally infected piglets
T2  - PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Swine can be infected by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). However, transmission routes among pigs are still unknown. The objective of the present study was to induce experimental infection of BVDV-1 in weaned piglets and to assess the potential transmission through pen back pond water, used to facilitate heat exchange of the pigs housed in barns. Two repetitions (BP1 and BP 2) were performed using 12 piglets proven to be free BVDV (n=6 per repetition) allocated into three groups: control, sentinels and infected with two piglets each. The piglets were placed in stainless steel isolators. The infected group received an inoculum containing BVDV-1, Singer strain. The piglets remained in the cabinets for 25 days, during which samples of nasal swab were collected daily and blood sampled weekly. At the end, the piglets were euthanized, necropsied and organ fragments were collected for histopathology, immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. In the first experiment (BP1) the infected animals shed the virus between days 6 and 21 post-infection. Regarding the sentinel group, shedding occurred in only one piglet, on the 20th day after infection, and seroconversion was observed on the 25th day post-infection. In BP2, infected piglets I3 and I4 shed the virus on days 4 and 21 post-infection, respectively. Only one sentinel piglet (S3) she the virus on day 13 post-infection. Therefore, it was concluded that pigs can become infected with BVDV-1 and shed potentially infectious viral particles consequently, being able to transmit the virus to other pigs through back pond water.

TI  - Survival analysis of early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection and sentinel lymph node dissection
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated equivalent survival in early-stage breast cancer (BC) patients receiving either axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) alone. However, institutional studies have called into question the generalization of these findings outside of a clinical trial.Methods: Early-stage BC patients diagnosed in 2013, that received lumpectomy with whole-breast irradiation, and underwent either ALND or SLND alone, in National Cancer Database were included. Weighted Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate 45-month survival, accounting for demographics, comorbidities, insurance type, cancer and neighborhood characteristics.Results: 62,184 patients were included, of which 21,892 (35%) underwent ALND. Patients undergoing ALND, compared to SLND, appeared to have slightly lower survival (91.4% vs 95.1%); moreover, even after weighting, a small difference persisted (92.7% vs 94.7%, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97, 0.99).Conclusions: SLND is a safe and effective alternative to ALND in BC patients with limited nodal involvement. This study provides additional evidence that the findings of ACOSOG Z0011 are applicable to the larger early-stage BC population. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Modelling potential distribution of bramble (<i>rubus cuneifolius</i>) using topographic, bioclimatic and remotely sensed data in the KwaZulu-Natal Drakensberg, South Africa
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The American bramble (Rubus cuneifolius), a woody perennial invasive shrub, presents serious ecological and economic impacts, particularly in ecologically rich and protected landscapes. Since the ecological factors determining its geographic distribution are poorly understood, a comprehensive analysis and understanding of its potential distribution are essential to understand probable impacts and plan control interventions. Hence, this study sought to explore the use of Maximum Entropy (Maxent) modelling approach to determine the potential distribution of American bramble in the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park (UDP), South Africa. Four sets of model scenarios based on topographic data, topographic and remotely sensed data, topographic and bioclimatic data and a composite of all variables were generated using 73 occurrence points. Model performance was evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistic (TSS) and Kappa statistic. The model built using a composite of all variables yielded the highest accuracies, AUC score (0.957), indicating the best prediction of suitable and unsuitable areas for bramble. The inclusion of remotely sensed data improved model performance with bramble reflecting highly on the red edge bands. Elevation and rainfall of driest quarter were the most important variables associated with bramble distribution. The models predicted low elevation, warm and moist eastern parts as most suitable for bramble establishment and growth. Overall, all the models matched in terms of the geographic extent predicted as probable bramble distribution. Our results demonstrate that an integration of topographic, bioclimatic and remotely sensed variables are useful in determining landscape vulnerability to bramble invasion and provide a valuable tool for planning control strategies.

TI  - Updating our Selves: Synthesizing Philosophical and Neurobiological Perspectives on Incorporating New Information into our Worldview
T2  - NEUROETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the ubiquity and centrality of social and relational influences to the human experience, our conception of self-governance must adequately account for these external influences. The inclusion of socio-historical, externalist (i.e., relational) considerations into more traditional internalist (i.e., individualist) accounts of autonomy has been an important feature of the debate over personal autonomy in recent years. But the relevant socio-temporal dynamics of autonomy are not only historical in nature. There are also important, and under-examined, future-oriented questions about how we retain autonomy while incorporating new values into the existing set that guides our interaction with the world. In this paper, we examine these questions from two complementary perspectives: philosophy and neuroscience. After contextualizing the philosophical debate, we show the importance to theories of autonomous agency of the capacity to appropriately adapt our values and beliefs, in light of relevant experiences and evidence, to changing circumstances. We present a plausible philosophical account of this process, which we claim is generally applicable to theories about the nature of autonomy, both internalist and externalist alike. We then evaluate this account by providing a model for how the incorporation of values might occur in the brain; one that is inspired by recent theoretical and empirical advances in our understanding of the neural processes by which our beliefs are updated by new information. Finally, we synthesize these two perspectives and discuss how the neurobiology might inform the philosophical discussion.

TI  - COSMO-SkyMed Synthetic Aperture Radar Data to Observe the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills are adverse events that may be very harmful to ecosystems and the food chain. In particular, large sea oil spills are very dramatic occurrences that may affect sea and coastal areas. Hence, the sustainability of oil rig infrastructures and oil transportation via oil tankers is linked to law enforcement based on proper monitoring techniques, which are also fundamental to mitigate the impact of such pollution. In this study, a showcase referring to the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil incident, one of the world's largest incidental oil pollution event that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 affecting a sea area larger than 10,000 km(2), is analyzed using remotely-sensed information collected by Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). Although, operationally, SAR sea oil slick observation is typically accomplished using C-band VV-polarized SAR imagery, during the DWH oil incident, because of their very dense revisit time, even single-polarization X-band COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) SAR measurements were collected. In this study, we exploit, for the first time, incoherent dual co-polarization SAR data collected by the Italian CSK X-band SAR constellation showing the key benefits of HH-VV SAR measurements in observing such a huge oil pollution event, especially in terms of the very dense revisit time offered by the CSK constellation.

TI  - Seasonal variability of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes from a tropical karstic region (southern Java, Indonesia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical karstic regions, knowledge about the timing and quantity of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes is important, as those nutrients may affect sensitive coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs. High permeability of karst aquifers, combined with high discharge during heavy rain events, lead to a close connectivity between groundwater in the hinterland and the coastal zone. Alteration between dry and wet periods can lead to a temporal variability of groundwater discharge volume and its associated nutrient fluxes. We studied the seasonal variability of land-ocean groundwater nutrient fluxes in the tropical karstic region of Gunung Kidul (southern Java, Indonesia) from November 2015 to December 2016. Satellite thermal infrared imagery revealed two major areas of direct submarine and coastal groundwater discharge. Nutrient fluxes were estimated at the largest coastal spring using a discharge dataset from a subsurface river dam and a monthly record of nutrient concentrations sampled from the spring. Nitrate fluxes ranged from 6 x 10(6)-245 x 10(6) mol/day, dissolved silicon fluxes from 58 x 10(6)-546 x 10(6) mol/day and phosphate fluxes from 17 x 10(3)-1571 x 10(3) mol/day. Nutrient fluxes are mostly controlled by discharge and show a high variability through time. Extraordinarily high nitrate and phosphate fluxes were observed after a period of constant and heavy rain. Most likely a nutrient pool in the top soil in the hinterland from untreated sewage or fertilizer is flushed during rain events through the aquifer to the coast. In tropical karstic regions sudden inputs of large amounts of nutrients via groundwater discharge may affect coastal ecosystems such as coral reefs making them especially vulnerable during high discharge events.

TI  - Generalizing machine learning regression models using multi-site spectral libraries for mapping vegetation-impervious-soil fractions across multiple cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forthcoming spaceborne imaging spectrometers will provide novel opportunities for mapping urban composition globally. To move from case studies for single cities towards comparative and more operational analyses, generalized models that may be transferred throughout space are desired. In this study, we investigated how single regression models can be spatially generalized for vegetation-impervious-soil (VIS) mapping across multiple cities. The combination of support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data generated from spectral libraries was used for fraction mapping. We developed three local models based on separate spectral libraries from Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), and Santa Barbara (U.S.), and a generalized model based on a combined multi-site spectral library. To examine the performance and transferability of the generalized model compared to local models, we first applied all model variants to simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data from the three cities that were represented in the models, i.e., known sites. Next, we transferred the models to two unknown sites not represented in the models, San Francisco Bay Area (U.S.) and Munich (Germany). In the first mapping constellation, results demonstrated that the generalized model was capable of accurately mapping VIS fractions across all three known sites. Average mean absolute errors (AV-MAEs) were 8.5, 12.2, and 11.0% for Berlin, Brussels, and Santa Barbara. The performance of the generalized model was very similar to the local models, with Delta AV-MAEs falling within a range of +/- 0.7%. A detailed assessment of fraction maps and class-wise accuracies confirmed that modeling errors related to remaining limitations of urban mapping based on optical remote sensing data rather than to the choice between a local or generalized model. For the second mapping constellation, the generalized model proved to be useful for mapping vegetation and impervious fractions in the unknown sites. MAEs for both cover types were 5.4 and 10.9% for the San Francisco Bay Area, and 6.3 and 15.4% for Munich. In contrast, the three local models were only found to have similar accuracies as the generalized model for one of the two sites or for individual VIS categories. Despite the enhanced transferability of the generalized model to the unknown sites, deficiencies remained for accurate soil mapping. MAEs were 22.4 and 12.3%, and high over - and underestimations were observed at the low and high end of the fraction range. These shortcomings indicated possible limitations of the spectral libraries to account for the spectral characteristics of soils in the unknown sites. Overall, we conclude that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data generated from multi-site libraries constitutes a flexible modeling approach for generalized urban mapping across multiple cities.

T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Historically, through the conduct of prospective clinical trials, breast cancer surgeons have performed less radical breast and axillary surgeries with no survival decrement to our patients. Currently, other opportunities exist for the treating breast surgeon to do less. Possibilities include active surveillance for ductal carcinoma in situ, ablative therapy for small primary breast cancers, selective omission of a sentinel node biopsy, and selective elimination of breast surgery after neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Breast surgeons must be leaders in the development and testing of effective therapy with the least intervention possible.

TI  - Differential effects on life history traits and body size of two anuran species inhabiting an environment related to fluorite mine
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activity is an important cause of physicochemical, biological, and landscape alterations. Several studies involving disturbed environments confirmed the modification of demographic traits in anuran populations. The current study aimed to assess the effects of natural and artificial surface waters associated with a fluorite mine on the body size and life history traits of Rhinella arenarum and Boana cordobae. Sampling was done in three areas: stream running on granitic rock, with medium natural fluoride content (CN); stream running on metamorphic rock, with low natural fluoride content (LV); and artificial decantation pond (DP) with large variation in physicochemical parameters. Adult individuals of the two anuran species were measured and weighed, and their body condition (BC) was calculated. Life history traits were assessed using the skeletochronology method. Individuals from DP weighed significantly heavier than individuals from streams. The BC index in R. arenarum was higher at LV, whereas in B. cordobae, a higher index was obtained at both LV and DP. The average age differs between sites in B. cordobae but not in R. arenarum. Growth coefficient was higher for altered environment in both species (CN; DP), whereas the estimated SVLmax was slightly higher in populations from less disturbed sites (LV). The most affected species was B. cordobae. Therefore, for future studies, it is important to know the biology of sentinel species because not all amphibian species may respond in the same way to similar disturbances. Differences obtained in life history traits may be explained by the lack of survival of larger/older individuals or compensatory growth, required to balance fast growth with the costs on survival at more disturbed sites.

TI  - Calibrating the Severity of Forest Defoliation by Pine Processionary Moth with Landsat and UAV Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa Dennis and Schiff.), one of the major defoliating insects in Mediterranean forests, has become an increasing threat to the forest health of the region over the past two decades. After a recent outbreak of T. pityocampa in Catalonia, Spain, we attempted to estimate the damage severity by capturing the maximum defoliation period over winter between pre-outbreak and post-outbreak images. The difference in vegetation index (dVI) derived from Landsat 8 was used as the change detection indicator and was further calibrated with Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery. Regression models between predicted dVIs and observed defoliation degrees by UAV were compared among five selected dVIs for the coefficient of determination. Our results found the highest R-squared value (0.815) using Moisture Stress Index (MSI), with an overall accuracy of 72%, as a promising approach for estimating the severity of defoliation in affected areas where ground-truth data is limited. We concluded with the high potential of using UAVs as an alternative method to obtain ground-truth data for cost-effectively monitoring forest health. In future studies, combining UAV images with satellite data may be considered to validate model predictions of the forest condition for developing ecosystem service tools.

TI  - Detection of Asphalt Pavement Potholes and Cracks Based on the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Asphalt roads are the basic component of a land transportation system, and the quality of asphalt roads will decrease during the use stage because of the aging and deterioration of the road surface. In the end, some road pavement distresses may appear on the road surface, such as the most common potholes and cracks. In order to improve the efficiency of pavement inspection, currently some new forms of remote sensing data without destructive effect on the pavement are widely used to detect the pavement distresses, such as digital images, light detection and ranging, and radar. Multispectral imagery presenting spatial and spectral features of objects has been widely used in remote sensing application. In our study, the multispectral pavement images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were used to distinguish between the normal pavement and pavement damages (e.g., cracks and potholes) using machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine, artificial neural network, and random forest. Comparison of the performance between different data types and models was conducted and is discussed in this study, and indicates that a UAV remote sensing system offers a new tool for monitoring asphalt road pavement condition, which can be used as decision support for road maintenance practice.

TI  - Spatial Pattern and Factor Analyses for Forest Sustainable Development Goals within South Korea's Civilian Control Zone
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offer specific guidelines for improving sustainable forest management, especially Goal 15. Goal 15 protects, restores and promotes the sustainable use of land ecosystems, manages forests sustainably, prevents was against desertification, stops and reverses land degradation and prevents biodiversity loss. The Civilian Control Zone (CCZ) south of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea has functioned as a unique biological preserve due to traditional restrictions on human use but is now increasingly threatened by deforestation and development. We used hot spot analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze spatial patterns of forest land use and land cover (LULC) change and variables influencing these changes, within the CCZ. Remote sensing imagery was used to develop land cover classification maps (2010 and 2016) and a GIS database was established for three change factors (topography, accessibility and socioeconomic characteristics). As a result of Hotspot analysis, Hotspots of change were distributed mainly due to agricultural activities and the development of forest and expansion of villages. Subsequent factor analysis revealed that accessibility had greater influence (-0.635) than the other factors. Among the direct factors, change to bare land had the greatest impact (-0.574) on forest change. These results shed light on forest change patterns and causes in the CCZ and provide practical data for efficient forest management in this area with regards to the SDGs.

AB  - Although surgical management of the axilla for breast cancer continues to evolve, axillary lymphadenectomy remains the standard of care for women with advanced nodal disease. We sought to evaluate national patterns of care in axillary surgery, and its association with overall survival (OS) among women with N2-3 invasive breast cancer.Women (18-90 years) with clinical N2-3 invasive breast cancer who underwent axillary surgery were identified from the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) from 2004 to 2013. Axillary surgery was categorized as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB, 1-5 nodes) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND, >= 10 nodes). Patient and treatment characteristics, trends over time, and overall survival (OS) were compared by surgical treatment.Overall, 22,156 patients were identified. At diagnosis, 68.5% had cN2 and 31.5% had cN3 disease. Treatment included: lumpectomy (27%), mastectomy (73%), adjuvant chemotherapy (53.4%), neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) (39.7%), radiation (74%), and endocrine therapy (54.4%). In total, 9.9% (n = 2190) underwent SLNB and 90.1% (n = 19,966) underwent ALND. Receipt of SLNB was associated with private insurance, grade 3 disease, invasive ductal cancer, NAC, and lumpectomy (all p < 0.001). After adjustment for known covariates, including chemotherapy use, ALND was associated with improved survival [hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, p < 0.001] and this effect was similar for N2 and N3 patients (axillary surgery x cN-stage interaction p = 0.29).Axillary lymphadenectomy was associated with improved survival in patients presenting with clinical N2-3 invasive breast cancer. Further studies, particularly in the neoadjuvant setting, are needed to identify breast cancer patients with advanced nodal disease who may safely avoid a lesser extent of axillary surgery.

TI  - Lymphatic Transport and Lymph Node Location of Microspheres Subcutaneously Injected in the Vicinity of Tumors in a Rabbit Model of Breast Cancer
T2  - PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the lymphatic transport of microparticles of 100 nm, 1 mu m and 10 mu m subcutaneously injected into the breast area of healthy and tumor-bearing rabbits, and to analyze their location in lymph node (LN) in relation to malignant cells.Female rabbits (n = 9) bearing a VX2 tumor in one thoracic mammary gland were subcutaneously injected at D15 with polystyrene fluorescent particles around the nipple, on the tumor and on the healthy sides. The tumor and the LN measured by ultrasound at D9, D15 and D20 were explanted at D20. The LN metastases were evaluated by cytokeratin staining. LN uptake of the particles was measured by quantifying the green fluorescence surface in hot spot regions of healthy and pathologic LN.All animals developed mammary tumors. Metastases were found in 39% of LN from the tumor side. LN invasion was significantly lower for the 10 mu m group versus the 100 nm group (p < 0.0348). The fully invaded area of metastatic LN contained significantly less 100 nm and 1 mu m particles compared to the low and non-invaded regions and to the healthy LN. In the invaded LN, the 1 mu m MS occupied more surface than the 100 nm particles.1 mu m MS arrived numerously into the areas low-invaded and non-invaded by the tumoral cells of the pathologic LN, but they were very rare in the fully invaded regions. Compared to the 100 nm nanospheres, the 1 mu m were better retained (20 times) into the sentinel LN, showing the advantage of micrometric particles for lymph-targeted chemotherapy when injected before complete invasion by metastases.

TI  - Nonvisualization of Sentinel Lymph Nodes by Lymphoscintigraphy in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma: Incidence, Risk Factors, and a Review of Management Options
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Lymphoscintigraphy is often performed before sentinel lymph node biopsy, especially in areas likely to have multiple or aberrant drainage patterns. This study aims to determine the incidence and characteristics of melanoma patients with negative lymphoscintigraphic findings and to review the management options and surgical recommendations.Methods: This is a retrospective study of patients with primary cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy between 2005 and 2016. Patients with nonvisualized lymph nodes on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy were compared in a 1:4 ratio with a randomly selected unmatched cohort drawn from all melanoma patients who underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy within the period of the study. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were compared between these groups.Results: A negative lymphoscintigraphic scan was seen in 2.3 percent of all cases (25 of 1073). In both univariate and multivariate analyses, predictive patient-and tumor-specific factors for negative lymphoscintigraphy included older age and head and neck location. Patients with a nonvisualized sentinel lymph node had significantly worse overall survival compared with patients who had a visualized sentinel lymph node, but there was no difference in melanoma-specific survival. In 16 of the 25 cases (64 percent), at least one sentinel lymph node was found intraoperatively despite the negative lymphoscintigraphic findings.Conclusions: Older patients with head and neck melanomas are more likely to experience nodal nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy. In patients who have nodal nonvisualization, the surgeon should attempt sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of excision of the primary lesion because a sentinel lymph node can still be found in a majority of cases, and it offers prognostic information.CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, II.

TI  - Analysis of the spectrum and vegetation index of rice under different nitrogen levels based on unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing
T2  - CHINESE OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing has low spatial resolution and is susceptible to the atmosphere, cloud layer, rain, and snow and so on. In this paper, the coaxial remote sensing system is constructed by using a coaxial 12-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle with spectrometer. Firstly, the self-designed UAV structure and flight control system are introduced, and a multi-link data backup UAV remote sensing data acquisition system is built around the flight platform, control system and remote sensing load. Then, the change of spectral index of four rices with different nitrogen levels is tested. Finally, by analyzing the experimental data, it can be obtained that the spectral reflectance of rice canopy decreases with the increase of nitrogen level in the visible region, and the spectral reflectance increases with the increase of nitrogen level in the near-infrared region. However, when the nitrogen level is increased to a certain extent, the increase of nitrogen will cause the reflectivity to decrease. Under the four nitrogen levels, the RVI and NDVI increased from tillering stage to jointing stage, then decreased gradually in heading stage, and the values of RVI and NDVI at heading stage are lower than those of RVI and NDVI in tillering stage. The test shows that the multi-rotor UAV platform equipped with a spectrometer composed of agricultural remote sensing monitoring system is feasible in the inversion of crop vegetation index. The UAV remote sensing data acquisition system designed in this paper can obtain remote sensing information effectively and in real time. The real time information of farmland with high spatial resolution and spectral resolution can provide necessary data support for crop growth analysis and health monitoring.

TI  - Bottleneck Channels Algorithm for Satellite Data Dimension Reduction: A Case Study for IASI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The infrared atmospheric sounder interferometer (IASI) onboard the Metop-A and Metop-B satellites is an essential instrument for numerical weather prediction centers. The IASI, with its 8461 channels, enables the observation of the surface and atmospheric geophysical variables twice a day around the world. This data volume will increase in the future, stressing the need for practical and efficient dimension reduction techniques for storage and transmission but also for inversion or assimilation. In a previous paper by Aires et al., a new dimension reduction method, the so-called bottleneck channel (BC), has been introduced. BCs are a good compromise between compression and channel selection techniques. In this paper, we introduce several new technical configurations of the BC approach, comparing their advantages/drawbacks. Comparisons are also made with two classical methodologies widely used in the satellite community: principal component analysis (PCA) compression and entropy reduction channel selection. Beyond the compression ability, the methodologies are tested on the temperature, water vapor, and ozone retrieval application using IASI measurements. Two approaches have been tested. First, theoretical retrieval improvement has been measured when using the various data reduction techniques. The BC achieves good theoretical improvements, comparable to noise-adjusted PCA (NAPCA), for the retrieval of the temperature, water vapor, and ozone. Second, a neural network inversion scheme is tested on real IASI observations using the several data reduction techniques. It is shown that BCs provide similar or better results than the other methods. The BCs present compression, denoising, and information content results comparable to the NAPCA, while preserving the physical meaning (i.e., actual channel brightness temperatures) of a channel selection approach. This has numerous advantages for inversion and assimilation: the mixing problem, contamination effects, minor constituents representation, or radiative transfer speed, and each of these will be discussed.

TI  - Complete lymph node dissection or observation in melanoma patients with multiple positive sentinel lymph nodes: A single-center retrospective analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as a prognostic factor is well established, its consequences for therapy are controversial. The aim of this study was to analyze if complete lymph node dissection (CLND) in patients with more than one positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) significantly improves melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Medical records of patients who underwent SLNB between 2001 and 2016 at the University Hospital of Cologne were reviewed, and patients with positive SLN were identified. Patient and tumor characteristics, patterns of recurrence, progression-free and melanoma-specific survival were analyzed. Seventy-eight patients with multiple positive and 197 patients with one positive SLN were included in this study. Patients with multiple positive SLN had significantly more positive non-SLN compared with patients with only one positive SLN (26.9% vs 8.6%, P = 0.01). However, in the subgroup of patients with multiple positive SLN, CLND did not significantly improve MSS (mean MSS 95 vs 75 months, P = 0.5) and PFS (mean PFS 59 vs 68 months P = 0.167). CLND did not result in a significant improvement in PFS and MSS in patients with multiple positive SLN.

AB  - In this study, we characterise land cover and land use changes in Kwelera Nature Reserve, located along the coastal regions of the Eastern Cape in order to determine possible impacts on water resources in the area. To achieve this objective, moderate resolution satellite data (30-m Landsat series imagery) acquired in the year 1995 and 2016 were used. Image classification was done using maximum likelihood classification algorithm. The results show that significant Land Cover/Use changes have occurred at Kwelera Nature Reserve. For example, in the year 1995, it was observed that bare surfaces had an area coverage of 92.47ha (approx. 50%), grass covered 15.93% whereas forests occupied 38.97ha. In 2016 the area occupied by bare surfaces significantly (a=0.05) decreased to 56.70 ha. This observation is validated by the classification accuracy were thematic maps were derived with an overall accuracies of 72% (1995) and 87% (2016). Overall the results of this study can help to make inferences on the implications of land cover changes on catchment hydrology and water resources in general.

TI  - Suspended Sediment Concentration Estimation from Landsat Imagery along the Lower Missouri and Middle Mississippi Rivers Using an Extreme Learning Machine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring and quantifying suspended sediment concentration (SSC) along major fluvial systems such as the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers provide crucial information for biological processes, hydraulic infrastructure, and navigation. Traditional monitoring based on in situ measurements lack the spatial coverage necessary for detailed analysis. This study developed a method for quantifying SSC based on Landsat imagery and corresponding SSC data obtained from United States Geological Survey monitoring stations from 1982 to present. The presented methodology first uses feature fusion based on canonical correlation analysis to extract pertinent spectral information, and then trains a predictive reflectance-SSC model using a feed-forward neural network (FFNN), a cascade forward neural network (CFNN), and an extreme learning machine (ELM). The trained models are then used to predict SSC along the Missouri-Mississippi River system. Results demonstrated that the ELM-based technique generated R-2 > 0.9 for Landsat 4-5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 sensors and accurately predicted both relatively high and low SSC displaying little to no overfitting. The ELM model was then applied to Landsat images producing quantitative SSC maps. This study demonstrates the benefit of ELM over traditional modeling methods for the prediction of SSC based on satellite data and its potential to improve sediment transport and monitoring along large fluvial systems.

TI  - No evidence for long-term carrier status of pigs after African swine fever virus infection
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study targeted the assessment of a potential African swine fever virus (ASFV) carrier state of 30 pigs in total which were allowed to recover from infection with ASFV Netherlands'86 prior exposure to six healthy sentinel pigs for more than 2months. Throughout the whole trial, blood and swab samples were subjected to routine virological and serological investigations. At the end of the trial, necropsy of all animals was performed and viral persistence and distribution were assessed. Upon infection, a wide range of clinical and pathomorphological signs were observed. After an initial acute phase in all experimentally inoculated pigs, 66.6% recovered completely and seroconverted. However, viral genome was detectable in blood samples for up to 91days. Lethal outcomes were observed in 33.3% of the pigs with both acute and prolonged courses. No ASFV transmission occurred over the whole in-contact phase from survivors to sentinels. Similarly, infectious ASFV was not detected in any of the tissue samples from ASFV convalescent and in-contact pigs. These findings indicate that the suggested role of ASFV survivors is overestimated and has to be reconsidered thoroughly for future risk assessments.

T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A tree list is a list of trees in the area of interest containing, for example, the species, diameter, height, and stem volume of each tree. Tree lists can be used to derive various characteristics of the growing stock, and are therefore versatile and informative sources of data for several forest management purposes. Especially in heterogonous and unmanaged forest structures with multiple species, tree list estimates imputed from local reference field data can provide an alternative to mean value estimates of growing stock (e.g., basal area, total stem volume, mean tree diameter, mean tree height, and number of trees). In this study, reference field plots, airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, and SPOT 5 satellite (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) imagery were used for tree list imputation applying the k most similar neighbors (k-MSN) estimation method in the West Ural taiga region of the Russian Federation for diameter distribution estimation. In k-MSN, weighted average of k field reference plots with highest similarity between field reference plot and target (forest grid cell, or field plot) based on ALS and SPOT 5 features were used to predict the mean values of growing stock and tree lists for the target object simultaneously. Diameter distributions were then constructed from the predicted tree lists. The prediction of mean values and diameter distributions was tested in 18 independent validation plots of 0.25-0.5 ha in size, whose species specific diameter distributions were measured in the field and grouped into three functional groups (Pines, Spruce/Fir, Broadleaf Group), each containing several species. In terms of root mean squared error relative to mean of validation plots, the accuracy of estimation was 0.14 and 0.17 for basal area and total stem volume, respectively. Reynolds error index values and visual inspection showed encouraging results in evaluating the goodness-of-fit statistics of the estimated diameter distributions. Although estimation accuracy was worse for functional group mean values and diameter distributions, the results indicate that it is possible to predict diameter distributions in forests of the test area with the tested methodology and materials.

TI  - Methodology to Apply Low Spatial Resolution Optical Satellite Images for Large-scale Flood Mapping
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and effective mapping is critical step to monitor the spatial distribution and change of flood inundated area in large scale flood event. In this study, we try to suggest methods to use low spatial resolution satellite optical imagery for flood mapping, which has high temporal resolution to cover wide geographical area several times per a day. We selected the Sebou watershed flood in Morocco that was occurred in early 2010, in which several hundred km 2 area of the Gharb lowland plain was inundated. MODIS daily surface reflectance product was used to detect the flooded area. The study area showed several distinct spectral patterns within the flooded area, which included pure turbid water and turbid water with vegetation. The flooded area was extracted by thresholding on selected band reflectance and water-related spectral indices. Accuracy of these flooding detection methods were assessed by the reference map obtained from Landsat-5 TM image and qualitative interpretation of the flood map derived. Over 90% of accuracies were obtained for three methods except for the NDWI threshold. Two spectral bands of SWIR and red were essential to detect the flooded area and the simple thresholding on these bands was effective to detect the flooded area. NIR band did not play important role to detect the flooded area while it was useful to separate the water-vegetation mixed flooded classes from the purely water surface.

TI  - Impact of the Acquisition Geometry of Very High-Resolution Pleiades Imagery on the Accuracy of Canopy Height Models over Forested Alpine Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the accuracy estimation of canopy height models (CHMs) derived from image matching of Pleiades stereo imagery over forested mountain areas. To determine the height above ground and hence canopy height in forest areas, we use normalised digital surface models (nDSMs), computed as the differences between external high-resolution digital terrain models (DTMs) and digital surface models (DSMs) from Pleiades image matching. With the overall goal of testing the operational feasibility of Pleiades images for forest monitoring over mountain areas, two questions guide this work whose answers can help in identifying the optimal acquisition planning to derive CHMs. Specifically, we want to assess (1) the benefit of using tri-stereo images instead of stereo pairs, and (2) the impact of different viewing angles and topography. To answer the first question, we acquired new Pleiades data over a study site in Canton Ticino (Switzerland), and we compare the accuracies of CHMs from Pleiades tri-stereo and from each stereo pair combination. We perform the investigation on different viewing angles over a study area near Ljubljana (Slovenia), where three stereo pairs were acquired at one-day offsets. We focus the analyses on open stable and on tree covered areas. To evaluate the accuracy of Pleiades CHMs, we use CHMs from aerial image matching and airborne laser scanning as reference for the Ticino and Ljubljana study areas, respectively. For the two study areas, the statistics of the nDSMs in stable areas show median values close to the expected value of zero. The smallest standard deviation based on the median of absolute differences (sigma(MAD)) was 0.80 m for the forward-backward image pair in Ticino and 0.29 m in Ljubljana for the stereo images with the smallest absolute across-track angle (-5.3 degrees). The differences between the highest accuracy Pleiades CHMs and their reference CHMs show a median of 0.02 m in Ticino with a sigma(MAD) of 1.90 m and in Ljubljana a median of 0.32 m with a sigma(MAD) of 3.79 m. The discrepancies between these results are most likely attributed to differences in forest structure, particularly tree height, density, and forest gaps. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that temporal vegetational changes between the Pleiades and reference data acquisitions introduce additional, spurious CHM differences. Overall, for narrow forward-backward angle of convergence (12 degrees) and based on the used software and workflow to generate the nDSMs from Pleiades images, the results show that the differences between tri-stereo and stereo matching are rather small in terms of accuracy and completeness of the CHM/nDSMs. Therefore, a small angle of convergence does not constitute a major limiting factor. More relevant is the impact of a large across-track angle (19 degrees), which considerably reduces the quality of Pleiades CHMs/nDSMs.

TI  - Active surveillance of 2017 seasonal influenza vaccine safety: an observational cohort study of individuals aged 6 months and older in Australia
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective To actively solicit adverse events experienced in the days following immunisation with quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine using Australia's near real-time, participant-based vaccine safety surveillance system, AusVaxSafety.Design and setting Observational cohort study conducted in 194 sentinel surveillance immunisation sites (primary care, hospital and community-based clinics) across Australia.Participants Individuals aged >= 6 months who received a routine seasonal influenza vaccine at a participating site (n=102 911) and responded to a survey (via short message service or email) sent 3 days after vaccination about adverse events experienced (n=73 892; 71.8%).Main outcome measure Near real-time and cumulative participant-reported rates of any adverse event, fever or medical attendance experienced within 3 days after vaccination overall, by brand, age, pregnancy status and concomitant vaccine receipt.Results Participant median age was 57 years (range: 6 months to 102 years); 58.1% (n=42 869) were female and 2.7% (n=2018) were pregnant. Near real-time fast initial response cumulative summation and Bayesian analyses of weekly event rates did not demonstrate a safety signal. Children aged 6 months to 4 years had higher event rates (522/6180; 8.4%) compared with older ages; participants aged >= 65 years reported fewer events (1695/28 154; 6.0%). There were no clinically significant differences in safety between brands, by age group or overall. Cumulative data analysis demonstrated that concomitant vaccination was associated with increased rates of fever (2.1% vs 0.8%) and medical attendance (0.8% vs 0.4%), although all rates were low and did not exceed expected levels.Conclusions Novel, postmarketing AusVaxSafety surveillance demonstrated comparable and expected safety outcomes for the 2017 quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine brands used in Australia. These near real-time, participant-reported data are expected to encourage confidence in vaccine safety and promote uptake.

TI  - Assessing the effects of severe weather events through remote sensing on Samothrace, Greece: applications for the management of cultural resources
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article demonstrates the utility of high temporal and spatial resolution satellite imagery for the detection and study of the effects of intense surface runoff, particularly in respect to mitigation efforts to protect archaeological sites. We make use of PlanetScope imagery, which has recently become available as a freely available remote sensing data source with a revisit time of less than 24 hours, almost global coverage, and spectral and spatial resolution on par with other commercially available sensors. The high temporal resolution of PlanetScope data allows for better detection of changes in land cover that are the result of severe weather events, whose effects may be cleared up within several days of occurring or are more pronounced in the immediate aftermath of disturbances. Focusing on two severe storms that struck the island of Samothrace, in the northern Aegean, on July 17 and September 25/26 2017 respectively and which caused considerable damage to local infrastructure and archaeological sites, we test the utility of these data for detecting the island-wide distribution of the effects of these weather events. We find that these data are sufficiently sensitive to detect and quantify the extent of surface runoff processes and argue that the detection and monitoring capabilities of these data provide a useful tool for outlining policies to mitigate future damages to cultural heritage sites.

TI  - Functional Response of Generalist Predators to <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Eggs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an invasive agricultural pest in the United States with the potential to become a serious economic threat to Michigan agriculture. As a novel pest in Michigan's agroecosystems, the potential for a biological control program that utilizes existing natural enemies for H. halys is currently unknown. The present study identified potential H. halys egg predators and determined their effectiveness as biological control agents through functional response testing. Four generalist predators were selected based on video surveillance of sentinel egg masses in the field and through preliminary experiments. The predators were Acheta domesticus (L.) (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), Melanoplus femurrubrum (DeGeer) (Orthoptera: Acrididae), Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), and Conocephalus fasciatus (DeGeer) (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae), and each was tested against four densities of H. halys eggs: 26, 52, 78, and 104 eggs. A. domesticus was the only predator tested that exhibited a Type II functional response with non-negative estimates of handling time and attack rate, suggesting the potential to be a density-dependent mortality factor when H. halys egg densities are low. The theoretical maximum predation rates for female A. domesticus were 189 eggs (+/- 95), or roughly seven egg masses. For males, the theoretical maximum was 116 eggs (+/- 35), or 4.5 egg masses. The remaining predators tested exhibited a Type I functional response and are unlikely to be a stabilizing force in H. halys population dynamics.

TI  - Computationally Efficient Multivariate Calibration and Validation of a Grid-Based Hydrologic Model in Sparsely Gauged West African River Basins
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of freshwater resources remains a challenging task in West Africa, where the decline of in situ measurements has a detrimental effect on the quality of estimates. In this study, we establish a series of modeling routines for the grid-based mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM) using Multiscale Parameter Regionalization (MPR). We provide a computationally efficient application of mHM-MPR across a diverse range of data-scarce basins using in situ observations, remote sensing, and reanalysis inputs. Model performance was first screened for four precipitation datasets and three evapotranspiration calculation methods. Subsequently, we developed a modeling framework in which the pre-screened model is first calibrated using discharge as the observed variable (mHM Q), and next calibrated using a combination of discharge and actual evapotranspiration data (mHM Q/ET). Both model setups were validated in a multi-variable evaluation framework using discharge, actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture and total water storage data. The model performed reasonably well, with mean discharge KGE values of 0.53 (mHM Q) and 0.49 (mHM Q/ET) for the calibration; and 0.23 (mHM Q) and 0.13 (mHM Q/ET) for the validation. Other tested variables were also within a good predictive range. This further confirmed the robustness and well-represented spatial distribution of the hydrologic predictions. Using MPR, the calibrated model can then be scaled to produce outputs at much smaller resolutions. Overall, our analysis highlights the worth of utilizing additional hydrologic variables (together with discharge) for the reliable application of a distributed hydrologic model in sparsely gauged West African river basins.

TI  - Canopy cover or remotely sensed vegetation index, explanatory variables of above-ground biomass in an arid rangeland, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of above-ground biomass is vital for understanding ecological processes. Since direct measurement of above-ground biomass is destructive, time consuming and labor intensive, canopy cover can be considered as a predictor if a significant correlation between the two variables exists. In this study, relationship between canopy cover and above-ground biomass was investigated by a general linear regression model. To do so, canopy cover and above-ground biomass were measured at 5 sub-life forms (defined as life forms grouped in the same height classes) using 380 quadrats, which is systematic-randomly laid out along a 10-km transect, during four sampling periods (May, June, August, and September) in an arid rangeland of Marjan, Iran. To reveal whether obtained canopy cover and above-ground biomass of different sampling periods can be lumped together or not, we applied a general linear model (GLM). In this model, above-ground biomass was considered as a dependent or response variable, canopy cover as an independent covariate or predictor factor and sub-life forms as well as sampling periods as fixed factors. Moreover, we compared the estimated above-ground biomass derived from remotely sensed images of Landsat-8 using NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), after finding the best regression line between predictor (measured canopy cover in the field) and response variable (above-ground biomass) to test the robustness of the induced model. Results show that above-ground biomass (response variable) of all vegetative forms and periods can be accurately predicted by canopy cover (predictor), although sub-life forms and sampling periods significantly affect the results. The best regression fit was found for short forbs in September and shrubs in May, June and August with R-2 values of 0.96, 0.93 and 0.91, respectively, whilst the least significant was found for short grasses in June, tall grasses in August and tall forbs in June with R-2 values of 0.71, 0.73 and 0.75, respectively. Even though the estimated above-ground biomass by NDVI is also convincing (R-2=0.57), the canopy cover is a more reliable predictor of above-ground biomass due to the higher R-2 values (from 0.75 to 0.96). We conclude that canopy cover can be regarded as a reliable predictor of above-ground biomass if sub-life forms and sampling periods (during growing season) are taken into account. Since, (1) plant canopy cover is not distinguishable by remotely sensed images at the sub-life form level, especially in sparse vegetation of arid and semi-arid regions, and (2) remotely sensed-based prediction of above-ground biomass shows a less significant relationship (R-2=0.57) than that of canopy cover (R-2 ranging from 0.75 to 0.96), which suggests estimating of plant biomass by canopy cover instead of cut and weighting method is highly recommended. Furthermore, this fast, nondestructive and robust method that does not endanger rare species, gives a trustworthy prediction of above-ground biomass in arid rangelands.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of landslide in the hilly region of South Korea is a matter of serious concern. This study tries to produce landslide susceptibility maps for Jumunjin Country in South Korea. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Logistic Regression (LR), LogitBoost (LB), and NaiveBayes (NB) are used, and their final model outcomes are compared to each other. Firstly, a landslide inventory map and the associated input data layers of the landslide conditioning factors were developed based on field verification, historical records, and high-resolution remote-sensing data in the geographic information system (GIS) environment. Seventeen landslide conditioning factors were prepared, including aspect, slope, altitude, maximum curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic positioning index (TPI), distance from fault, convexity, forest type, forest diameter, forest density, land use/land cover, lithology, soil, flow accumulation, and mid slope position. The result showed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of LR, LB, and NB models were 84.2%, 70.7%, and 85.2%, respectively. The results revealed that the LR and LB models produced reasonable accuracy than respect to NB model in landslide susceptibility assessment. The final susceptibility maps would be useful for preliminary land-use planning and hazard mitigation purpose.

TI  - Multi-decade, multi-sensor time-series modelling-based on geostatistical concepts-to predict broad groups of crops
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We have mapped the broad groups of crops grown each summer and winter, from 1987 to 2017, for a 300,000km 2 region of Queensland, Australia. These maps are part of a legislated decision-making process for the protection of prime agricultural land. For summer, the two groups of crops are 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' and 'Cotton'. For winter, the two groups of crops are 'Cereal' and 'Pulse'. Non-crop groups, present in both summer and winter, are 'Bare soil' and 'Other' (comprising pastures, woody vegetation, and crop residues). The foundation of the maps is time-series modelling-specifically, applying the concepts of geostatistics in the temporal domain-to model the variation in land-surface phonology within a growing season. The time-series model is flexible, robust, parsimonious, parallelisable, and able to deal with irregular observations. We combined satellite imagery from the Landsat sensors, as well as, when available, Sentinel-2A and MODIS (with the last two reprojected to the 30m grid of Landsat). We applied the time-series model pixel-wise across the study region, to three variables derived from satellite imagery gathered for an individual growing season: enhanced vegetation index, and the sub-pixel proportions of bare-ground and non-photosynthetic vegetation. Weekly-averaged predicted phenological metrics then served as explanatory variables in a tiered, tree-based classification model, for the prediction of the groups. The classification model comprised two expert rules and two random forests. Prior to fitting the classification model, geospatial object-based image analysis was used to change the scale of analysis from individual pixels to (approximately) field-based segments. From the perspective of a map-user, in any given growing season we predicted 'Coarse-grain & Pulse' correctly in 79% of cases; the values for 'Cotton', 'Cereal', and 'Pulse' were 90%, 84%, and 73%, respectively; 'Bare soil' was 72% in summer, and 88% in winter. 'Other' was the most accurately mapped group (98% correct in summer, and 99% correct in winter).

TI  - Measuring the soil water retention capacity with an integrated vegetation and drought index in southwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency of extreme weather events in China has been increasing due to global warming. The variety of soil types makes for varying levels of water retention capacity across Southwest China. However, spatially detailed information about soil water retention capacity is often difficult to obtain on a large scale. It has been hypothesized that agricultural drought is directly related to evapotranspiration fluxes and soil water retention capacity. This paper presents the relative water supply capacity index (RWSI), which is based on the integrated standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and vegetation condition index (VCI) to explore the potential of using the temporal moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer archive and meteorological data collected from stations in Southwest China to estimate the soil water retention capacity. The results showed that the spatial pattern of RWSI correlated well with that of the soil clay content in Southwest China, which suggests that RWSI could reflect the variations in relative soil water retention capacity in the research region. The RWSI was significantly correlated with relative soil moisture at depths of 0 to 10 cm and 10 to 20 cm. These data showed that RWSI could be used to examine and distinguish the relative differences in soil water retention capacity with an integrated implication of VCI and SPEI in Southwest China.

TI  - A New Methodology for Estimating the Surface Temperature Lapse Rate Based on Grid Data and Its Application in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter in the study of the physical processes of land surface. Understanding the surface temperature lapse rate (TLR) can help to reveal the characteristics of mountainous climates and regional climate change. A methodology was developed to calculate and analyze land-surface TLR in China based on grid datasets of MODIS LST and digital elevation model (DEM), with a formula derived on the basis of the analysis of the temperature field and the height field, an image enhancement technique used to calculate gradient, and the fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering applied to identify the seasonal pattern of the TLR. The results of the analysis through the methodology showed that surface temperature vertical gradient inversion widely occurred in Northeast, Northwest, and North China in winter, especially in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the northern and the western parts of the Greater Khingan Mountains, the Lesser Khingan Mountains, and the northern area of Northwest and North China. Summer generally witnessed the steepest TLR among the four seasons. The eastern Tibetan Plateau showed a distinctive seasonal pattern, where the steepest TLR happened in winter and spring, with a shallower TLR in summer. Large seasonal variations of TLR could be seen in Northeast China, where there was a steep TLR in spring and summer and a strong surface temperature vertical gradient inversion in winter. The smallest seasonal variation of TLR happened in Central and Southwest China, especially in the Ta-pa Mountains and the Qinling Mountains. The TLR at very high altitudes (>5 km) was usually steeper than at low altitudes, in all months of the year.

TI  - A Common "Stripmap-Like" Interferometric Processing Chain for TOPS and ScanSAR Wide Swath Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes the technical implementation of a stripmap-like interferometric processing flow that could be used for both Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans (TOPS) and ScanSAR. In this stripmap-like approach, the discontinuous bursts of wide swath mode for the same subswath are stitched into a continuous single look complex (SLC) image at the very beginning of the processing chain. For users who wish not to get into the complexity behind the wide swath mode and simply want to use the interferometric products, this implementation provides the identical processing steps and output products to the stripmap case. This implementation also features a user-friendly processing interface, where all the wide-swath-related processes are hidden under the hood. In addition, this approach makes the best use of an existing standard InSAR processing software. In this article, the complete common processing chain for TOPS and ScanSAR is elaborated and some key issues are discussed, starting from stitching, deramping to coregistration and enhanced spectral diversity (ESD). The authors also introduce a quick implementation of fine coregistration during the ESD step that does not require resampling the slave image using the conventional method.

TI  - Mapping spatiotemporal dynamics of maize in China from 2005 to 2017 through designing leaf moisture based indicator from Normalized Multi-band Drought Index
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize agriculture is experiencing substantial changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of planting areas in the most populous country-China. However, there is no spatially explicit and continuous information at national scale. Mapping maize at national scale is challenging due to intra-class variability of Vegetation Indices (VIs) temporal profile. This study coped with this challenge through combined utilizations of the EVI with two bands (EVI2) and Normalized Multi-band Drought Index (NMDI) time series datasets. A novel Maize mapping algorithm was proposed through Exploring Leaf moisture variation during flowering Stage (MELS). An indicator, the Ratio of Cumulative Positive slope to Negative slope (RCPN) during flowering stage, was developed based on NMDI and utilized as the unique metric for maize mapping. The capability of the MELS method was verified using the 8-day composite MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets in China from 2005 to 2017. The derived maize map was consistent with the agricultural census data (r(2) = 0.8875 in 2015) and 2020 ground truth observations (overall accuracy = 91.49%). Validation with Landsat-interpreted images in the test regions further confirmed its fairly good accuracy, with overall accuracy of 87.91% and kappa coefficient of 0.8577. We first generated annual maize maps from 2005 to 2017 in China. Maize planting areas increased continuously 100,130 km(2) (by 33.20%) during the period 2005-2015 and decreased 10,424 km(2) (by 2.60%) from 2015 to 2017. The increase of cropping intensity, replacement of paddy rice and other non-maize dryland crops areas accounted for 36.48%, 34.23% and 29.29% of the dramatic increased maize areas from 2005 to 2015, respectively.

TI  - Feature Importance Analysis for Local Climate Zone Classification Using a Residual Convolutional Neural Network with Multi-Source Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global Local Climate Zone (LCZ) maps, indicating urban structures and land use, are crucial for Urban Heat Island (UHI) studies and also as starting points to better understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of cities worldwide. However, reliable LCZ maps are not available on a global scale, hindering scientific progress across a range of disciplines that study the functionality of sustainable cities. As a first step towards large-scale LCZ mapping, this paper tries to provide guidance about data/feature choice. To this end, we evaluate the spectral reflectance and spectral indices of the globally available Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery, as well as the Global Urban Footprint (GUF) dataset, the OpenStreetMap layers buildings and land use and the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)-based Nighttime Light (NTL) data, regarding their relevance for discriminating different Local Climate Zones (LCZs). Using a Residual convolutional neural Network (ResNet), a systematic analysis of feature importance is performed with a manually-labeled dataset containing nine cities located in Europe. Based on the investigation of the data and feature choice, we propose a framework to fully exploit the available datasets. The results show that GUF, OSM and NTL can contribute to the classification accuracy of some LCZs with relatively few samples, and it is suggested that Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 spectral reflectances should be jointly used, for example in a majority voting manner, as proven by the improvement from the proposed framework, for large-scale LCZ mapping.

TI  - The Prevalence and Risk for Herpes Zoster Infection in Adult Patients With Diabetes Mellitus in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF DIABETES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Herpes zoster (HZ) is a common infection in Canada that can result in serious and long-term complications. People with diabetes may be at an increased risk for HZ. The objectives of this study were to develop and validate a case definition of HZ diagnosis based on electronic medical records; determine a prevalence estimate for HZ in adult patients in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) and assess the association between HZ and diabetes.Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. Patients 18 years of age or older who had made at least 1 visit to their primary health-care providers within the past 2 years in the CPCSSN were included. These data came from a 2015 extract of CPCSSN data, and a subsample of 289 patients was used to validate our case definition. Prevalences were estimated for the overall population and for people with diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer or HIV. Risk ratios were modelled for these conditions.Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive values for HZ were 100%, 73.8%, 83.9% and 100%, respectively. The 1-year prevalence of HZ in the CPCSSN data was 0.32%. The prevalence of HZ was higher in females (0.35%) than in males (0.28%). People with diabetes have an increased risk for HZ infection (RR 2.64, 95% CI 2.34, 2.99).Conclusions: People with diabetes have an increased risk for the diagnosis of HZ infection in the primary care setting in Canada. Women over the age of 65 years with diabetes and/or other chronic conditions are at greatest risk for developing HZ. (C) 2017 Canadian Diabetes Association.

TI  - Using Satellite-Borne Remote Sensing Data in Generating Local Warming Maps with Enhanced Resolution
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Warming, i.e., increments of temperature, is evident at the global, regional, and local level. However, understanding the dynamics of local warming at high spatial resolution remains challenging. In fact, it is very common to see extremely variable land cover/land use within built-up environments that create micro-climatic conditions. To address this issue, our overall goal was to generate a local warming map for the period 1961-2010 at 15 m spatial resolution over the southern part of the Canadian province of Alberta. Our proposed methods consisted of three distinct steps. These were the: (i) construction of high spatial resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps; (ii) conversion of air temperature (T-a) normal (i.e., 30 years average) at higher spatial resolution using vegetation indices (VI); and (iii) generation of a local warming map at 15m spatial resolution. In order to execute this study, we employed MODIS-driven air temperature data, EVI and NDVI data, and Landsat-driven vegetation indices. The study uncovered that around 58% (up to positive 1 degrees C) of areas in the considered study region were experiencing increased temperature; whereas only about 4% of areas underwent a cooling trend (more than negative 0.25 degrees C). The remaining 38% did not exhibit significant change in temperature. We concluded that remote sensing technology could be useful to enhance the spatial resolution of local warming maps, which would be useful for decision-makers considering efficient decisions in the face of increments in local temperature.

M3  - Article
AB  - Measuring ground displacement is very important, considering its destructive physical and financial effects, and one of the most efficient methods for this purpose is the differential interferometry that uses data with high spatial resolution which, in this research, are 11 TerraSAR-X images over 11-month period. The study area is the plain in the southwest of Tehran, and the subsidence was displayed by extracted interferograms. The maximum displacement of the pairs of consecutive images in this area was 18 cm, and the displacement rate was 13 cm/year (cm/year). By analyzing the time series using neural network, displacement for 12th month was predicted at 32 cm. The obtained results of this research were evaluated and validated by using radar and GPS data associated with similar research. The result of the evaluation indicates compliance of the obtained results in this research with other researches in the field.

T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The data deals with the functions that automatically extracted lineaments from the Cartosat, ASTER and SRTM of Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of different spatial resolutions, in the software Arc-GIS 10.4. The extracted lineaments result shows the ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) DEM gives the lowest number of lineaments reflects Cartosat and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM shows a medium number of lineaments. Cartosat DEM is most appropriate for extraction of contours precisely rather than ASTER and SRTM. This study reveals the Cartosat DEM data is best to use extraction of lineaments in the Indian provinces, offers at most comprehensive geological structural info amongst all the data sets. The extracted lineaments lengths and densities are determined by the statistical method. Based on the data generated lineament density and rose diagram. Cartosat DEM data are the best suited for studying very small areas as through geological and structural information can be mined by using this data. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Japanese encephalitis (JE) is one of the leading causes of viral encephalitis in Southeast Asia, particularly India. The major vector transmitting the disease, Culex tritaeniorhynchus, breeds in paddy field and its associated water bodies. The incidence of human infection usually occurs after the peak in vector abundance. Earlier, an association between JE vector abundance and paddy growth was demonstrated in Bellary district of Karnataka state, India, using radar satellite (RISAT 1) data. In this study, an attempt has been made to validate this phenomenon with the data collected from Uttar Pradesh state, using moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer data.

The comparison of primary sources of the 17th and 18th centuries allows to deduce the correspondences between religion and worldview, from which derive both forms of perception and interpretation of natural phenomena such as ritual practices that allow mitigating their effects. In this field it is intended to deepen in the cultural aspects that determine the religious images that demand greater popular fervor. In this way, the methodology implemented allows to articulate image and cult in the understanding of the colonial art.

TI  - Predicting Melt Pond Fraction on Landfast Snow Covered First Year Sea Ice from Winter C-Band SAR Backscatter Utilizing Linear, Polarimetric and Texture Parameters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early-summer melt pond fraction is predicted using late-winter C-band backscatter of snow-covered first-year sea ice. Aerial photographs were acquired during an early-summer 2012 field campaign in Resolute Passage, Nunavut, Canada, on smooth first-year sea ice to estimate the melt pond fraction. RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data were acquired over the study area in late winter prior to melt onset. Correlations between the melt pond fractions and late-winter linear and polarimetric SAR parameters and texture measures derived from the SAR parameters are utilized to develop multivariate regression models that predict melt pond fractions. The results demonstrate substantial capability of the regression models to predict melt pond fractions for all SAR incidence angle ranges. The combination of the most significant linear, polarimetric and texture parameters provide the best model at far-range incidence angles, with an of 0.62 and a pond fraction RMSE of 0.09. Near- and mid- range incidence angle models provide values of 0.57 and 0.61, respectively, with an RMSE of 0.11. The strength of the regression models improves when SAR parameters are combined with texture parameters. These predictions also serve as a proxy to estimate snow thickness distributions during late winter as higher pond fractions evolve from thinner snow cover.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of LAI Data Assimilation on Simulations of the Soil Water Balance and Maize Development Using MOHID-Land
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling at the catchment scale requires the upscaling of many input parameters for better characterizing landscape heterogeneity, including soil, land use and climate variability. In this sense, remote sensing is often considered as a practical solution. This study aimed to access the impact of assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) data derived from Landsat 8 imagery on MOHID-Land's simulations of the soil water balance and maize state variables (LAI, canopy height, aboveground dry biomass and yield). Data assimilation impacts on final model results were first assessed by comparing distinct modeling approaches to measured data. Then, the uncertainty related to assimilated LAI values was quantified on final model results using a Monte Carlo method. While LAI assimilation improved MOHID-Land's estimates of the soil water balance and simulations of crop state variables during early stages, it was never sufficient to overcome the absence of a local calibrated crop dataset. Final model estimates further showed great uncertainty for LAI assimilated values during earlier crop stages, decreasing then with season reaching its end. Thus, while model simulations can be improved using LAI data assimilation, additional data sources should be considered for complementing crop parameterization.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewTo describe the current knowledge about clinical and microbiological diagnosis of nonventilated hospital-acquired pneumonia (NV-HAP).Recent findingsNV-HAP is emerging as a new challenge for clinicians, particularly because VAP incidence has been decreasing. The clinical diagnosis of NV-HAP uses the classical clinical symptoms and signs. However standard evaluation of their accuracy and the evaluation of new criterion (e.g. lung ultrasound) must be conducted particularly in NV-HAP patients. The use of sputum must be encouraged in patients with NV-HAP, assuring its lower respiratory tract representativeness and quality. It is not clear that invasive approaches (e.g. BAL) are associated with improvements in patient-centred outcomes, and further research is needed to assure their correct indication, guaranteeing safety. Rapid diagnosis methods are promising in NV-HAP, particularly for the quick results and information about antibiotic resistance.SummaryNV-HAP poses several barriers for diagnosis compared with VAP, and the available knowledge is limited. A call for further research in diagnosis of nonventilated HAP is urgent.

TI  - Mapping grassland plant communities using a fuzzy approach to address floristic and spectral uncertainty
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims: The mapping and monitoring of natural vegetation is a challenging but important objective for environmental management. Although remote sensing has been used to map plant communities for several years, the maps produced are not sufficiently accurate to meet management requirements. This can be explained by the cumulative effects of floristic and spectral uncertainty. The objective of this study was to accurately map grassland plant communities using a comprehensive fuzzy approach in order to address floristic and spectral uncertainty.Location: Sub-brackish wet grasslands, Marais Poitevin, France.Methods: We first created a compromise typology-floristically and spectrally consistent-to perform fuzzy noise clustering on a joint PCA matrix derived from vegetation releves and remote sensing data. This typology had two levels, which corresponded to spectral signatures and plant communities, respectively. Second, we mapped grassland plant communities to predict the fuzzy model from the remote sensing data. We applied this approach using (1) a very high spatial resolution multispectral satellite image and a LiDAR-derived Digital Terrain Model acquired on a 73 km(2) wet grassland site and (2) more than 200 releves collected in the field.Results: The results show that (1) the compromise typology yields significantly higher mapping accuracy than classic phytosociological typology (62% and 26%, respectively); (2) compared to a crisp approach, the fuzzy approach improves mapping accuracy by 17 percentage points and (3) a single plant community can be defined by several (1-4) distinct spectral signatures.Conclusions: The comprehensive fuzzy procedure successfully mapped herbaceous plant communities at the ecosystem scale using inexpensive remote sensing data. Floristic and spectral uncertainty was considered in a fuzzy approach, resulting in the mapping of nine herbaceous plant communities with acceptable accuracy. As the natural habitats were characterized at the plant community level, correspondence with functional properties of the species or with ecosystem services can be easily inferred. These encouraging results open up new ways to meet the requirements for monitoring the conservation status of natural habitats in the EU Habitats Directive.

TI  - Everything Is More Critical: A Qualitative Study of the Experiences of Young Breast Cancer Survivors
T2  - COUNSELING AND VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Receiving a breast cancer diagnosis at a young age has the potential to affect survivors' worldview and raise existential concerns. This qualitative study of 13 women diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 40 examined how they made meaning of the impact of their cancer experience. Implementing the consensual qualitative research methodology, the authors found themes related to challenges; coping strategies; reappraisal of self, relationships with others, and life roles; and changes in views and behaviors. These findings suggest the utility of existential counseling for young breast cancer survivors' adjustment posttreatment as they attempt to cultivate a sense of control.

TI  - The impact of urban forest structure and its spatial location on urban cool island intensity
T2  - URBAN ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest can help decrease land surface temperature (LST) and create urban cooling effect (UCI) to mitigate urban heat island (UHI). However, it is still unclear how urban forest structure and its location affect UCI, particularly under different seasons. In this study, with plot-based urban forest structure and UCI intensity extracted from Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) thermal data, we first conducted correlation analyses between UCI and different forest structures (crown closure, tree height, leaf area index, basal area, stem density and diameter at breast height, etc.) and spatial location (distances from buildings and from water bodies and elevation) attributes, and we then carried out quantitative regression analyses between them. Our results indicate that (1) Urban forest could create urban cool islands, which were higher in summer than those in autumn.(2) UCI could be significantly affected by urban forest structural attributes, especially by crown closure and LAI. All urban forest structural attributes had positive linear relationships with UCI except for LAI and basal area which had positive non-linear relationships with UCI.; (3) UCI in urban forest could also be affected by its spatial location but not by its elevation. The UCI non-linearly decreased with decreasing distance from buildings and with increasing distance from water bodies. The threshold values of DB for significantly affecting UCI variation is approximately between 100m and 300m in summer and autumn, respectively; and (4) the relationships between UCI and urban forest structure and its location attributes were complex and seasonal dependent. Urban forest attributes had greater effects on increasing UCI in summer than those in autumn. These findings would deepen our understanding of interactions between UCI and urban forest attributes and provide urban planners with useful information about how to design urban forest to effectively mitigate UHI effects.

TI  - From hotspot to hopespot: An opportunity for the Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - PERSPECTIVES IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - New remote sensing data on vegetation cover and restoration opportunities bring hope to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, one of the hottest of the 36 global biodiversity hotspots. Available estimates of remaining vegetation cover in the biome currently range from 11% to 16%. However, our new land-cover map, prepared at the highest resolution ever (5 m), reveals a current vegetation cover of 28%, or 32 million hectares (Mha) of native vegetation. Simultaneously, we found 7.2 Mha of degraded riparian areas, of which 5.2 Mha at least must be restored before 2038 by landowners for legislation compliance. Restoring the existing legal debt could increase native vegetation cover in the Atlantic Forest up to 35%. Such effort, if well planned and implemented, could reduce extinction processes by increasing connectivity of vegetation remnants and rising total native cover to above the critical biodiversity threshold established for different taxonomic groups. If undertaken, this process can be adaptive to climate change and boost sustainable development in this most populous biome in Brazil, turning it into a hopespot.

TI  - Pleiades Tri-Stereo Data for Glacier InvestigationsExamples from the European Alps and the Khumbu Himal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we use Pleiades tri-stereo data to generate a digital elevation model (DEM) from the Pleiades images using a workflow employing semi-global matching (SGM). We examine the DEM accuracy in complex mountain glaciated terrain by comparing the new DEMs with an independent high-quality DEM based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data for a study area in the Austrian Alps, and with ground control points for a study area in the Khumbu Himal of Nepal. The DEMs derived using the SGM algorithm compare well to the independent high-quality ALS DEM, and the workflow produces models of sufficient quality to resolve ground control points, which are based on Pleiades imagery that are of sufficient quality to perform high spatio-temporal resolution assessments of remote areas for which no field data is available. The relative accuracy is sufficient to investigate glacier surface elevation changes below one meter, and can therefore be applied over relatively short periods of time, such as those required for annual and seasonal assessments of change. The annual geodetic mass balance for the Alpine case derived from our DEM compares well to the glaciological mass balance, and multitemporal DEM analysis is used to resolve the seasonal changes of five glaciers in the Khumbu Himal, revealing that glaciological processes such as accumulation, ablation, and glacier movement mainly take place during the summer season, with the winter season being largely inactive in the year sampled.

TI  - Validity of sentinel node biopsy in early oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study investigates the possibility and sensibility of using sentinel node biopsy (SNB) during surgery for oropharyngeal carcinomas with clinically and radiographically unremarkable cervical lymph nodes.Materials and methods: A total of 36 patients who were treated for early oral and oropharyngeal carcinoma and unremarkable cervical lymph nodes were included in this study. After lymphoscintigraphy for detecting sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), the SLN were excised first. Thereafter elective neck dissection was performed. Histopathological and immunochemical examinations were used to examine the SLN and all other lymph nodes.Results: The preoperative SLN detection rate was 97.2% (35 of 36). SLN in level V were detected in four patients (11.1%). Metastases were found in 33.3% of the patients (12 of 36). All metastases were in the marked SLN. No skip metastases could be detected. A specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 94.4% were identified for the SNB.Conclusion: The study confirms that SNB is a precise diagnostic procedure for assessing the nodal status of cervical lymph nodes. Further studies are needed to determine whether SNB without elective neck dissection for clinically and radiologically unremarkable cervical lymph nodes can become a reliable course of treatment for carcinomas of the head and neck region.

TI  - Estimating One-Minute Rain Rate Distributions in the Tropics From TRMM Satellite Data (October 2017)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internationally recognized prognostic models of rain fade on terrestrial and Earth-space extremely high frequency (EHF) links rely fundamentally on distributions of 1-min rain rates. In Rec. ITU-R P.837-6, these distributions are estimated from the data provided by Numerical Weather Products (NWPs). NWP yields rain accumulations over regions typically larger than 100 km across and over intervals of 6 h. Over the tropics, the Tropical Rain Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data yield instantaneous rain rates over regions 5 km across. This paper uses TRMM data to estimate rain rate distributions for telecommunications regulation over the tropics. Rain rate distributions are calculated for each 1 degrees square between 35 degrees south to 35 degrees north. These distributions of instantaneous rain rates over 5 km squares are transformed to distributions over 1 km squares using a correction calculated from U.K. Nimrod radar data. Results are compared to rain distributions in DBSG3, the database of ITU-R Study Group 3. A comparison with the new Rec. ITU-R P.837-7 is also presented. A table of 0.01% exceeded rain rates over the tropics is provided as associated data.

TI  - Automatic Mapping of Discontinuity Persistence on Rock Masses Using 3D Point Clouds
T2  - ROCK MECHANICS AND ROCK ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Finding new ways to quantify discontinuity persistence values in rock masses in an automatic or semi-automatic manner is a considerable challenge, as an alternative to the use of traditional methods based on measuring patches or traces with tapes. Remote sensing techniques potentially provide new ways of analysing visible data from the rock mass. This work presents a methodology for the automatic mapping of discontinuity persistence on rock masses, using 3D point clouds. The method proposed herein starts by clustering points that belong to patches of a given discontinuity. Coplanar clusters are then merged into a single group of points. Persistence is measured in the directions of the dip and strike for each coplanar set of points, resulting in the extraction of the length of the maximum chord and the area of the convex hull. The proposed approach is implemented in a graphic interface with open source software. Three case studies are utilized to illustrate the methodology: (1) small-scale laboratory setup consisting of a regular distribution of cubes with similar dimensions, (2) more complex geometry consisting of a real rock mass surface in an excavated cavern and (3) slope with persistent sub-vertical discontinuities. Results presented good agreement with field measurements, validating the methodology. Complexities and difficulties related to the method (e. g., natural discontinuity waviness) are reported and discussed. An assessment on the applicability of the method to the 3D point cloud is also presented. Utilization of remote sensing data for a more objective characterization of the persistence of planar discontinuities affecting rock masses is highlighted herein.

TI  - Real-time deep satellite image quality assessment
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for deep satellite image quality assessment based on no-reference satellite images is proposed. We design suitable deep convolutional neural networks, which are named satellite image quality assessment of deep convolutional neural networks (SIQA-DCNN) and SIQA-DCNN++. These sophisticated methods can remove various distorted satellite images in real-time remote sensing. The novelty of this method lies in the objective assessment and restoration of the deep model which understands various distorted satellite images in high- and low-resolution problems. The activation function has a lower computational time and ensures the deactivation of noise by making the mean activators close to zero. Our methods are also effective for transfer learning, which can be used to adequately investigate satellite image classification in deep satellite image quality assessment. Using Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient (SROCC) and linear correlation coefficient (LCC) evaluations, we demonstrated that our methods show better performance than other algorithms, with more than 0.90 of SROCC and LCC values compared to the full-reference and no-reference satellite image in MODIS/Terra and USGS datasets. Regarding computational complexity, we obtained better performance in operational function times. As compared to other methods, SIQA-DCNN and SIQA-DCNN++ also reduced computational time by more than 40 and 56%, respectively, when applied to the USGS dataset, and by more than 46 and 60% respectively, when applied to the MODIS/Terra dataset.

TI  - Fire Activity and Fuel Consumption Dynamics in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - African landscape fires are widespread, recurrent and temporally dynamic. They burn large areas of the continent, modifying land surface properties and significantly affect the atmosphere. Satellite Earth Observation (EO) data play a pivotal role in capturing the spatial and temporal variability of African biomass burning, and provide the key data required to develop fire emissions inventories. Active fire observations of fire radiative power (FRP, MW) have been shown to be linearly related to rates of biomass combustion (kg s(-1)). The Meteosat FRP-PIXEL product, delivered in near real-time by the EUMETSAT Land Surface Analysis Satellite Applications Facility (LSA SAF), maps FRP at 3 km resolution and 15-min intervals and these data extend back to 2004. Here we use this information to assess spatio-temporal variations in fire activity across sub-Saharan Africa, and identify an overall trend of decreasing annual fire activity and fuel consumption, agreeing with the widely-used Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv4) based on burned area measures. We provide the first comprehensive assessment of relationships between per-fire FRE-derived fuel consumption (Tg dry matter, DM) and temporally integrated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) net photosynthesis (PSN) (Tg, which can be converted into pre-fire fuel load estimates). We find very strong linear relationships over southern hemisphere Africa (mean r = 0.96) that are partly biome dependent, though the FRE-derived fuel consumptions are far lower than those derived from the accumulated PSN, with mean fuel consumptions per unit area calculated as 0.14 kg DM m(-2). In the northern hemisphere, FRE-derived fuel consumption is also far lower and characterized by a weaker linear relationship (mean r = 0.76). Differences in the parameterization of the biome look up table (BLUT) used by the MOD17 product over Northern Africa may be responsible but further research is required to reconcile these differences. The strong relationship between fire FRE and pre-fire fuel load in southern hemisphere Africa is encouraging and highlights the value of geostationary FRP retrievals in providing a metric that relates very well to fuel consumption and fire emission variations. The fact that the estimated fuel consumed is only a small fraction of the fuel available suggests underestimation of FRE by Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) and/or that the FRE-to-fuel consumption conversion factor of 0.37 MJ kg(-1) needs to be adjusted for application to SEVIRI. Future geostationary imaging sensors, such as on the forthcoming Meteosat Third Generation (MTG), will reduce the impact of this underestimation through its ability to detect even smaller and shorter-lived fires than can the current second generation Meteosat.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration change due to forest treatment and fire at the basin scale in the Sierra Nevada, California
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the potential magnitude and duration of forest evapotranspiration (ET) decreases resulting from forest-thinning treatments and wildfire in west-slope watersheds of the Sierra Nevada range in California, USA, using a robust empirical relation between Landsat-derived mean-annual normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and ET measured at flux towers. Among forest treatments, the minimum observed NDVI change required to produce a significant departure from control plots with NDVI of about 0.70 was -0.09 units, corresponding to a basal-area reduction of 29.1 m(2)/ha (45% reduction) and equivalent to an estimated ET reduction of 153 mm/year (21% change; approximate mean annual precipitation = 1,000 mm). Intensive thinning in highly productive forests that approached prefire-exclusion densities reduced basal area by 40-50%, generating estimated ET reductions of 153-218 mm/year (21-27% change) over 5 years following treatment. Low-intensity underburn treatments resulted in no significant change in ET. Examining the cumulative impact of wildfires on ET between 1990 and 2008, we found that the lower and wetter American River basin (5,310 km(2)) generated more than twice the ET reduction per unit area than those in the higher and drier Kings River basin (4,790 km(2)), corresponding to greater water and energy limitations in the latter and greater fire severity in the former. A rough extrapolation of these results to the entire American River watershed suggests that ET reductions due to forest thinning by wildfire could approach 10% of full natural flows for dry years and 5% over all years.

TI  - Metabolic fingerprinting analysis of oil palm reveals a set of differentially expressed metabolites in fatal yellowing symptomatic and non-symptomatic plants
T2  - METABOLOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Oil palm (E. guineensis), the most consumed vegetable oil in the world, is affected by fatal yellowing (FY), a condition that can lead to the plant's death. Although studies have been performed since the 1980s, including investigations of biotic and abiotic factors, FY's cause remains unknown and efforts in researches are still necessary.Objectives This work aims to investigate the metabolic expression in plants affected by FY using an untargeted metabolomics approach.Method Metabolic fingerprinting analysis of oil palm leaves was performed using ultra high liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS). Chemometric analysis, using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), was applied to data analysis. Metabolites identification was performed by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), MS/MS experiments and comparison with databases and literature.Results Metabolomics analysis based on MS detected more than 50 metabolites in oil palm leaf samples. PCA and PLS-DS analysis provided group segregation and classification of symptomatic and non-symptomatic FY samples, with a great external validation of the results. Nine differentially expressed metabolites were identified as glycerophosphorylcholine, arginine, asparagine, apigenin 6,8-di-C-hexose, tyramine, chlorophyllide, 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, proline and malvidin 3-glucoside-5-(6-malonylglucoside). Metabolic pathways and biological importance of those metabolites were assigned.Conclusion Nine metabolites were detected in a higher concentration in non-symptomatic FY plants. Seven are related to stress factors i.e. plant defense and nutrient absorption, which can be affected by the metabolic depression of these compounds. Two of those metabolites (glycerophosphorylcholine and 1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine) are presented as potential biomarkers, since they have no known direct relation to plant stress.

TI  - Feasibility and safety of mass drug coadministration with azithromycin and ivermectin for the control of neglected tropical diseases: a single-arm intervention trial
T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Mass drug administration has made a major contribution to the public health control of several important neglected tropical diseases. For settings with more than one endemic disease, combined mass drug administration has potential practical advantages compared with separate programmes but needs confirmation of feasibility and safety. We undertook a study of mass drug administration in the Solomon Islands for trachoma and scabies control using ivermectin and azithromycin, key drugs in the control of neglected tropical diseases worldwide.Methods The entire population of Choiseul province, Solomon Islands, was eligible to participate. An azithromycin-based mass drug administration regimen was offered in line with standard recommendations for trachoma elimination (oral azithromycin or topical tetracycline). An ivermectin-based mass drug administration regimen was offered at the same time (oral ivermectin or topical permethrin), with a further dose 7-14 days later, using a modified version of a regimen demonstrated to be effective for scabies control. All participants underwent safety assessments 7-14 days later. Participants in ten randomly selected sentinel villages underwent a more detailed safety assessment. Routine health system reports of hospital or clinic admissions and deaths were also obtained to compare health outcomes in the 12 month period before and after the mass drug administration.Findings The study enrolled 26 188 participants, 99.3% of the estimated resident population as determined at the 2009 census. Of those enrolled, 25 717 (98.2%) received the trachoma regimen and 25 819 (98.6%) received the first dose of the scabies regimen between Sept 1, and Oct 2, 2015. A second dose of the scabies regimen was received by 21 931 (83.7%) of participants. Adverse events, all mild and transient, were recorded in 571 (2.6%) of the entire study population and 58 (4.1%) of participants in the ten sentinel villages. In the 12 months before and after the mass drug administration the numbers of hospital admissions (1530 vs 1602) and deaths (73 vs 83) were similar. In the month after the mass drug administration, 84 individuals were admitted to hospital and two died, compared with a monthly median of 116 admissions (IQR 106-159) and six deaths (IQR 4-7) in the 12 months before and after the mass drug administration.Interpretation In the largest trial so far involving coadministration of regimens based on ivermectin and azithromycin, the combination was safe and feasible in a population of more than 26 000 people. Coadministration of mass drug administration based on these two drugs opens up new potential for the control of neglected tropical diseases.

TI  - Implications of Internal Mammary Lymph Node Sampling During Microsurgical Breast Reconstruction
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal mammary lymph node (IMN) chain assessment for breast cancer is controversial; however, current oncologic data have shed new light on its importance. Metastatic involvement of the IMN chain has implications for staging, prognosis, treatment, and survival. Here, we analyzed our data gathered during sampling of the IMN and the oncologic treatment changes that resulted from our findings.A retrospective chart review was performed on 581 patients who underwent free-flap breast reconstruction performed by the senior author. All dissected IMNs were submitted for pathological examination. Patient demographics, oncologic data, and the results of IMN sampling were reviewed.581 patients undergoing 981 free flaps were identified. A total of 400 lymph node basins were harvested from 273 patients. Of these, nine had positive IMNs. Two of these nine patients had positive IMNs of the contralateral nonaffected breast. Five patients had positive axillary lymph nodes. Four patients had multifocal tumors, one of which was bilateral. Seven patients had an increase in cancer stage as a result of having positive IMNs. Six patients had a change in treatment: two patients required additional chemotherapy, one received adjuvant radiation therapy, and three necessitated both supplemental chemotherapy and radiation.Opportunistic biopsy of the IMN while dissecting the recipient vessels is simple and results in no added morbidity. We recommend that biopsy of the IMN chain be performed whenever internal mammary vessels are dissected for microsurgical anastomosis in breast cancer patients. Positive IMN involvement should encourage thorough oncological workup and treatment reevaluation.Case series.

TI  - Analyzing the feasibility of a space-borne sensor (SPOT-6) to estimate the height of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in inland waters
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based approaches have been widely used over the years to monitor and manage submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) or aquatic macrophytes mainly by mapping their spatial distribution and at the most, modeling SAV biomass. Remote sensing based studies to map SAV heights are rare because of the complexities in modeling water column optical proprieties. SAV height is a proxy for biomass and can be used to estimate plant volume when combined with percent cover. The objective of this study was to explore the feasibility of a satellite sensor to estimate the SAV height distribution in an inland reservoir. Also to test different radiative transfer theory based bio-optical models for estimating SAV heights using SPOT-6 data. The satellite-based multispectral data have rarely been used and SPOT-6 data, to the best of our knowledge, have never been used to estimate SAV heights in inland water bodies. In addition to depth and hydroacoustic data, in situ hyperspectral radiance and irradiance were measured at different depths to compute remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) and the attenuation coefficients (K-d and K-Lu). Two models, Palandro et al. (2008) and Dierssen et al. (2003), were used to derive bottom reflectance from both in situ and atmospherically corrected SPOT-6 R-rs. Bottom reflectance-based vegetation indices (green-red index, slope index, and simple ratio) were used to estimate SAV heights. Validation was performed using echosounder acquired hydroacoustic data. In situ model calibration produced an R-2 of 0.7, however, the validation showed a systematic underestimation of SAV heights and high Root Mean Square Error (RMSE); indicating that there is a greater sensitivity in in situ models to localized variations in water column optical properties. The model based on SPOT-6 data presented higher accuracy, with R-2 of 0.54 and RMSE of 0.29 m (NRMSE = 15%). Although the models showed a decreased sensitivity for SAVs at depths greater than 5 m with a height of 1.5 m, the finding nonetheless is significant because it proves that re-calibration of existing bottom reflectance models with more field data can enhance the accuracy to be able to periodically map SAV heights and biomass in inland waters. Although the initial results presented in this study are encouraging, further calibration of the model is required across different species, seasons, sites, and turbidity regime in order to test its application potential.

TI  - Shoreline change detection along the coast of Odisha, India using digital shoreline analysis system
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A long-term shoreline change analysis is significant for coastal zone management as well as planning for future development in the coastal zone. The present study analyse a long term (1990-2015) shoreline change along the Odisha coast, India using geo-informatics. The High Water Line (HWL) was considered as shoreline, which was detected by Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) method. The shorelines as vector were extracted from binary raster image which was created by dynamic local threshold values. The shoreline has been updated in river creeks, mouth. Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) developed by USGS, as Arc GIS extension, were used to calculate shoreline change rate. The Linear Regression Rate method was used to calculate shoreline change rate. The result reveals that about 196km (46%) shoreline is eroded, where 78km (18%) shoreline is in stable condition and 156km (36%) shoreline is accreted along the Odisha coast. The Puri and Kendapara districts have found with most eroded shoreline 80km (18.7%) and 41km (9.5%) respectively, whereas most accreted shoreline is around 37km (8.5%), has found along the coast of Bhadrak district. On the other hand Ganjam district has the least eroded shoreline, which is around 8km (2%), whereas the least accreted shoreline has found along the coastline of Puri district (5%). The study has done on the regional scale with significant information, which can help coastal managers and researchers towards sustainable coastal zone research, management and planning.

TI  - Assessment of land use and land cover changes from 1979 to 2017 and biodiversity & land management approach in Quirimbas National Park, Northern Mozambique, Africa.
T2  - Global Ecology and Conservation
M3  - Article
AB  - National parks are established with the aim of guaranteeing and protecting natural biodiversity and ecosystems, in a multi-level and integrated approach. Biodiversity conservation, management of protected areas and sustainable development with strategies targeting rural populations are current challenges in Africa, in the context of exponential human population growth, overexploitation of natural resources, forest destruction and climate change. The Quirimbas National Park (QNP) has been suffering from severe and constant threats originating from different sources and changes in land use and land cover. These changes, and in the context of global climate change, pose permanent challenges to the managers of this conservation area of Mozambique. The research aimed to analyze the historical and recent LULC over the last 38 years, to provide consistent and scientific information for decision making on biodiversity conservation approaches; to identify the main changes and their impacts on the ecosystem to implement/develop appropriate mitigation strategies. A combined and integrated methodological approach has been developed from satellite imagery analyzes of Landsat 2 and 5 MSS (Multispectral Scanner); Landsat 5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and fieldwork (field observation and communities and QNP staff meetings). The results show that the overall map classification obtained was between very good and excellent: 1979 - Kappa 71.84%, Overall Accuracy 86.55%; 1989 - Kappa 83.49%, Overall Accuracy 93.01%; 1999 - Kappa 85.03%, Overall Accuracy 90.07%; 2009 - Kappa 79.57%, Overall Accuracy 86.42%; 2017 - Kappa 80.24%, Overall Accuracy 86.95%. For 38 years, the QNP lost about 301,761.7ha, corresponding to 41.67% of the total QNP coverage land. The main causes are associated with intensive agriculture, human settlements, population growth, illegal exploitation of forest resources and miners inside of the Quirimbas National Park. The impact extends from territory reduction and fragmentation to vegetation and animal biodiversity loss, human-wildlife conflicts, habitat connectivity loss, species isolation and scaring, and basic resources scarcity for the community's livelihoods.

TI  - Compensation of Oxygen Transmittance Effects for Proximal Sensing Retrieval of Canopy-Leaving Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of Sun-Induced vegetation chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) using remote sensing techniques are commonly determined by exploiting solar and/or telluric absorption features. When SIF is retrieved in the strong oxygen (O) absorption features, atmospheric effects must always be compensated. Whereas correction of atmospheric effects is a standard airborne or satellite data processing step, there is no consensus regarding whether it is required for SIF proximal-sensing measurements nor what is the best strategy to be followed. Thus, by using simulated data, this work provides a comprehensive analysis about how atmospheric effects impact SIF estimations on proximal sensing, regarding: (1) the sensor height above the vegetated canopy; (2) the SIF retrieval technique used, e.g., Fraunhofer Line Discriminator (FLD) family or Spectral Fitting Methods (SFM); and (3) the instrument's spectral resolution. We demonstrate that for proximal-sensing scenarios compensating for atmospheric effects by simply introducing the O transmittance function into the FLD or SFM formulations improves SIF estimations. However, these simplistic corrections still lead to inaccurate SIF estimations due to the multiplication of spectrally convolved atmospheric transfer functions with absorption features. Consequently, a more rigorous oxygen compensation strategy is proposed and assessed by following a classic airborne atmospheric correction scheme adapted to proximal sensing. This approach allows compensating for the O absorption effects and, at the same time, convolving the high spectral resolution data according to the corresponding Instrumental Spectral Response Function (ISRF) through the use of an atmospheric radiative transfer model. Finally, due to the key role of O absorption on the evaluated proximal-sensing SIF retrieval strategies, its dependency on surface pressure (p) and air temperature (T) was also assessed. As an example, we combined simulated spectral data with p and T measurements obtained for a one-year period in the Hyytiala Forestry Field Station in Finland. Of importance hereby is that seasonal dynamics in terms of T and p, if not appropriately considered as part of the retrieval strategy, can result in erroneous SIF seasonal trends that mimic those of known dynamics for temperature-dependent physiological responses of vegetation.

TI  - A new fuzzy measurement approach for automatic change detection using remotely sensed images
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new fuzzy change detection and measurement approach to overcome the drawbacks of traditional thresholding methods in remote sensing. The proposed technique is taking the advantages of following concepts: (1) asymmetric thresholding in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of change detection in each spectral bands, (2) fuzzy measurement approach to consider ambiguity in thresholding of difference image, and represent the changes in fuzzy form and fusing the obtained change maps from various spectral bands, and (3) non-linear modeling with artificial neural networks for relative radiometric normalization (RRN). The performance of developed technique is evaluated on a pair of Landsat 5, 7 images which were taken over the southern part of Urmia Lake, Iran. The major merits of developed technique compared to prevalent thresholding techniques are: higher accuracy in change detection and measurement, higher capability in detection of multiple changes and lower dependence on quality of RRN process.

TI  - Evaluation of Manning's n Roughness Coefficient in Arid Environments by Using SAR Backscatter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of arid region flash floods (magnitude and frequency) is essential to ensure the safety of human life and infrastructures and is commonly based on hydrological models. Traditionally, catchment characteristics are extracted using point-based measurements. A considerable improvement of point-based observations is offered by remote sensing technologies, which enables the determination of continuous spatial hydrological parameters and variables, such as surface roughness, which significantly influence runoff velocity and depth. Hydrological models commonly express the surface roughness using Manning's roughness coefficient (n) as a key variable. The objectives were thus to determine surface roughness by exploiting a new high spatial resolution spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technology and to examine the correlation between radar backscatter and Manning's roughness coefficient in an arid environment. A very strong correlation (R-2 = 0.97) was found between the constellation of small satellites for Mediterranean basin observation (COSMO)-SkyMed SAR backscatter and surface roughness. The results of this research demonstrate the feasibility of using an X-band spaceborne sensor with high spatial resolution for the evaluation of surface roughness in flat arid environments. The innovative method proposed to evaluate Manning's n roughness coefficient in arid environments with sparse vegetation cover using radar backscatter may lead to improvements in the performance of hydrological models.

TI  - Morphological Dynamics of the Rivers of Brahmaputra
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study documents the sequential morphological dynamics of rivers of Brahmaputra. Landsat images for the year of 1976 and 1987-2016 (thirty consecutive years) are used in GIS environment to document the activities that have been shaping and reshaping the morphology of the rivers. The use of thirty year consecutive images facilitates an explicit assessment of morphological changes. Apparently, distributary activities, meandering activities, breaches and avulsions, and confluence migrations are the dominant geomorphic agents of morphological changes. A range of distributaries activities are readily noticed in Brahmaputra plain. The plain is densely dissected with numerous rivers and rivulets, and distributaries activities often lead to reorganization in channel network. Considering the frequency of incidence and preserved imprints of abandoned channels, majority of the rivers of Brahmaputra can be categorized as free meanders. Difference in fluvio-geomophic setups of rivers of both the banks is reflected palpably in meandering activities. The upper stretch of Brahmaputra encompassing the rivers Simen, Gai and Jiadhal is found to be the most active in terms of avulsions. High seasonal flow, large sedimentation and absence of distinct river bed in some stretches are presumably leading to these frequent avulsions. The river Simen, further, exhibited repeated confluence migration through avulsion near its confluence with Brahmaputra. The explicit picture of the morphological dynamics of rivers of Brahmaputra at basin scale presented in this work is a key aid in formulating riverine management programs which is conceivably among the most water-troubled region of the country.

TI  - Identification of suitable sites for groundwater recharge in Awaspi watershed using GIS and remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a valuable natural resource for drinking, domestic, livestock use, and irrigation, especially in arid and semi-arid regions like the Garmiyan belt in Kurdistan region. The Awaspi watershed is located 50 km east of Kirkuk city, south Kurdistan, Iraq; and covers an area of 2146 km(2). The paper presents result of a study aimed at: (1) mapping and preparing thematic layers of factors that control groundwater recharge areas, and (2) determination of sites suitable for groundwater recharge. We used available data such as geological map, groundwater depth map, digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat 8 imagery, and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) data for this study. These data, supplemented by slope features, lithology, land use land cover, rainfall, groundwater depth, drainage density, landform, lineament density, elevation and topographic position index, were utilized to create thematic maps to identify suitable areas of groundwater recharge, using GIS and remote sensing techniques. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was applied to weight, rank, and reclassify these maps in the ArcGIS 10.3 environment, to determine the suitable sites for groundwater recharge within the Awaspi watershed. Fifty-five percent of the total area of the watershed was found to be suitable for groundwater recharge; whereas 45% of the area was determined to have poor suitability for groundwater recharge, but can be used for surface water harvesting.

AB  - The theory of landscape ecology applied to the methods of spatial analysis helps to understand changes in the structure of forest remnants. In view of this theory, the objective of the present study was to analyze the structure of a fragmented area between the years 1979 and 2015 through calculation of landscape metrics for arboreal, shrubby and herbaceous vegetation classes. Vegetation classes were classified with visits to the field, interpretation of aerial photographs from 1979 and supervised classification of Landsat 8 from 2015. The metrics calculated for each class were area and total number of fragments, total edge and average connectivity among the fragments. The analysis of structure found that it changed negatively due to an increase in the number of small fragments, which increased the intensity of edge effects and reduced connectivity between fragments for all classes.

TI  - Modelling the Vertical Distribution of Phytoplankton Biomass in the Mediterranean Sea from Satellite Data: A Neural Network Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the vertical structure of the bio-chemical properties of the ocean is crucial for the estimation of primary production, phytoplankton distribution, and biological modelling. The vertical profiles of chlorophyll-a (Chla) are available via in situ measurements that are usually quite rare and not uniformly distributed in space and time. Therefore, obtaining estimates of the vertical profile of the Chla field from surface observations is a new challenge. In this study, we employed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reconstruct the 3-Dimensional (3D) Chla field in the Mediterranean Sea from surface satellite estimates. This technique is able to reproduce the highly nonlinear nature of the relationship between different input variables. A large in situ dataset of temperature and Chla calibrated fluorescence profiles, covering almost all Mediterranean Sea seasonal conditions, was used for the training and test of the network. To separate sources of errors due to surface Chla and temperature satellite estimates, from errors due to the ANN itself, the method was first applied using in situ surface data and then using satellite data. In both cases, the validation against in situ observations shows comparable statistical results with respect to the training, highlighting the feasibility of applying an ANN to infer the vertical Chla field from surface in situ and satellite estimates. We also analyzed the usefulness of our approach to resolve the Chla prediction at small temporal scales (e.g., day) by comparing it with the most widely used Mediterranean climatology (MEDATLAS). The results demonstrated that, generally, our method is able to reproduce the most reliable profile of Chla from synoptical satellite observations, thus resolving finer spatial and temporal scales with respect to climatology, which can be crucial for several marine applications. We demonstrated that our 3D reconstructed Chla field could represent a valid alternative to overcome the absence or discontinuity of in situ sampling.

TI  - Climate change beliefs in an agricultural context: what is the role of values held by farming and non-farming groups?
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change in many agricultural contexts will increase tensions between farming and non-farming populations over adaptations in land use and water conservation strategies. How adequately these future tensions may be mitigated will be partially determined by each groups' beliefs about climate change. A voluminous literature shows that climate change beliefs are crucial for understanding engagement with climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, and that values motivate climate change beliefs, but the role of values remains unclear, and comparisons of farming and non-farming populations are scant. We develop a model of climate change beliefs that integrates four main motivating factors - values, political ideology, knowledge, and worldview - and we explicitly compare members of farming and non-farming populations in an agricultural watershed in the Central Great Plains, USA. Our findings highlight the role of held values in motivating climate change beliefs and point to areas of potential consensus and tension within and among members of these two groups. The results provide an empirical basis for developing future climate change engagement strategies in contexts of growing divides and conflicts among farming and non-farming groups.

TI  - Forest stem volume estimation using C-band interferometric SAR coherence data of the ERS-1 mission 3-days repeat-interval phase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence datasets from the 3-days phase of the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1) mission during the winter months of 1992 have been analyzed to assess the capability to retrieve forest stem volume in boreal forests. For three test sites in Sweden and Finland, coherence decreased for increasing repeat-pass interval from 3- to 12-days due to increasing temporal decorrelation. Overall strong decorrelation was observed for images acquired under unfrozen conditions or thawing conditions. Coherence was best preserved under stable frozen conditions and, in addition, short perpendicular component of the interferometric baseline (i.e., < 300 m). Stem volume was estimated with the Interferometric Water Cloud Model (IWCM) and multi-temporal combination of single-image estimates. For the test site of Tuusula, Finland, data from eight 3-days image pairs yielded a relative RMSE of 28.2% for stem volumes ranging between 3 and 482 m(3)/ha. For the 6-days repeat-pass interval, the relative RMSE was only slightly worse (32.4%). For longer repeat-pass intervals, the relative RMSE was above 50%. This study suggests that C-band short-term coherence has potential to support retrieval of forest biomass but the prospects of Sentinel-1 coherence to estimate biomass appear to be limited to the 6-days coherence in areas characterized by stable frozen, or likewise stable dry, conditions.

TI  - Prevalence of <i>ALK</i> gene alterations among the spectrum of plexiform spitzoid lesions
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: ALK receptor tyrosine kinase gene (ALK) rearrangements have been described in spitzoid lesions with a plexiform growth pattern.Objective: To investigate the prevalence of ALK alterations in a large series of spitzoid lesions.Methods: ALK immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of 78 spitzoid plexiform lesions including 41 Spitz nevi, 29 atypical Spitz tumors (ASTs), and 8 spitzoid melanomas.Results: ALK immunohistochemical staining was observed in 14.6% of Spitz nevi (6 of 41) and 13.8% of ASTs (4 of 29); the spitzoid melanomas were ALK negative. Fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed ALK translocation in 9 cases and amplification in 1 case. In 2 of the translocated cases it was possible to determine the fusion partner gene (ie, tropomyosin 3 gene [TPM3] or dynactin 1 gene [DCTN1]). Of the 4 cases of AST examined, 2 carried the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase gene (BRAF) V600E mutation. The 10 patients had a mean age of 18.7 years (range, 1-39) and a female predominance (female-to-male ratio, 7: 3). Seven lesions arose on the extremities; the 2 lesions occurring in infants were located on the face. The lesions' mean diameter was 6.2 mm (range, 3-13), and their mean Breslow thickness was 1.83 mm (range, 0.6-3.6). The results of sentinel node biopsy were negative in 2 ASTs.Limitations: BRAF status was tested in only 4 of 10 samples because of the limited amount of material.Conclusion: ALK alterations characterize a significant subset of spitzoid lesions.

TI  - Effect of Diwali Firecrackers on Air Quality and Aerosol Optical Properties over Mega City (Delhi) in India
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the variations of aerosol properties due to crackers burning during Diwali event (11th-18th 2012) over mega city Delhi were investigated. The sky radiometer POM-2 aerosol optical property data from Skynet-India along with ambient air pollution data were critically analyzed. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm was 1.60 on 13th November, the Diwali day, and its value a maximum of 1.84 on 16th November. Due to stable atmosphere over Delhi during post Diwali, aerosols accumulate and remain in the atmosphere for longer time, which leads to higher AOD on 16th November. A lower value of single-scattering albedo (SSA) was observed at a longer wavelength (1020 nm) during the entire period that clearly indicates the dominance of absorbing-type black carbon aerosol. SSA showed a steep decrease after 16th November. Asymmetry parameter decreased to a maximum of 0.79 for the shorter wavelength at 340 nm and 0.632 is reported at the higher wavelength 1020 nm. Asymmetry parameter showed a decrease in value just after Diwali on 14th November, this suggesting the dominance of fine-mode aerosol from anthropogenic activities. The lowest value of the refractive index (1.4527) on 14th and 15th November indicates the higher loading of absorbing-type aerosol which may be associated with firecracker burning of Diwali festival. The significant correlation with the value of r=0.9 was observed between sky radiometer and MODIS AOD with a standard deviation of 0.31 and an RMSE of 0.17 during the event. Radiative forcing and heating rate were estimated using SBDART. The maximum average concentrations 2641 and 1876 mu g/m(3) of PM10 and PM2.5, respectively, were observed on the Diwali night. A highest of 109 ppb surface ozone was reported in the night at 23:00 IST, which can be attributed to burning of the firecrackers.

TI  - Assessing rangeland cover conversion in Jordan after the Arab spring using a remote sensing approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of population growth and Syrian refugee settlements on rangeland degradation in Jordan using remotely-sensed data was assessed. Eleven cloud-free Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Images that cover the study area were used. Maximum likelihood classifier was applied to estimate rangeland, cropland, urban, water and forest cover percentages over the study area for the period 2013-2015. Change detection analysis of both 2013 and 2015 images revealed a dramatic expansion of urban lands and a consequent reduction in rangelands, especially in north-western Jordan. Our analysis suggests that Jordanian rangeland area decreased by 9.6%, forests by 1.5% and water by 0.6% during the study period (2013-2015). Meanwhile, urban lands increased by 11.4% and croplands by 0.2%. We attributed this change mainly to Syrian civil war and refugee settlements. This settlement process increased the demand for food and water and accelerated desertification processes in Jordanian rangelands, especially those in the north-western region. Our study underscores the value of using remotely sensed data as a viable approach to quantify degradation in Middle Eastern rangelands. Overall, we suggest initiating rigorous urban settlement regulations and land conservation control programs to mitigate land degradation in Jordanian rangelands.

TI  - Towards a polyalgorithm for land use change detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One way of analyzing satellite images for land use and land cover change (LULCC) is time series analysis (TSA). Most of the many TSA based LULCC algorithms proposed in the remote sensing community perform well on datasets for which they were designed, but their performance on randomly chosen datasets from across the globe has not been studied. A polyalgorithm combines several basic algorithms, each meant to solve the same problem, producing a strategy that unites the strengths and circumvents the weaknesses of constituent algorithms. The foundation of the proposed TSA based `polyalgorithm' for LULCC is three algorithms (BFAST, EWMACD, and LandTrendR), precisely described mathematically, and chosen to be fundamentally distinct from each other in design and in the phenomena they capture. Analysis of results representing success, failure, and parameter sensitivity for each algorithm is presented. For a given pixel, Hausdorff distance is used to compare the distance between the change times (breakpoints) obtained from two different algorithms. Timesync validation data, a dataset that is based on human interpretation of Landsat time series in concert with historical aerial photography, is used for validation. The polyalgorithm yields more accurate results than EWMACD and LandTrendR alone, but counterintuitively not better than BFAST alone. This nascent work will be directly useful in land use and land cover change studies, of interest to terrestrial science research, especially regarding anthropogenic impacts on the environment.

TI  - Evaluation of OSEB and SEBAL models for energy balance of a crop area in a humid subtropical climate
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the adequacy of the One-Source Energy Balance (OSEB) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) models to estimate evapotranspiration in grain growing areas with humid subtropical climate in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. The dataset was obtained from a micrometeorological station (Eddy Covariance) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) products during 84 observation days between 2009 and 2011. The OSEB and SEBAL models were used to estimate the partition of net radiation (Rn) into the components latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H), and ground heat flux (G) estimated from the MODIS images while the experimental data measured in situ were used to compare the results. Analyses indicated that the Energy Balance (EB) components were estimated from the MODIS images satisfactorily despite the spatial resolution limitations. Furthermore, the SEBAL model estimated the EB components satisfactorily only for summer crops. There are uncertainties associated with determining the hot and cold pixels due to the region humid subtropical climate and the spatial resolution of the sensor used in the other periods. The OSEB model has the lowest errors and the most adequate partitioning of the EB components throughout the year, and therefore, it is the most suitable for the climatic conditions of Rio Grande do Sul.

TI  - "Purely for You": Inmates' Perceptions of Prison Visitation by Volunteers in the Netherlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OFFENDER THERAPY AND COMPARATIVE CRIMINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Research suggests that prison visitation by volunteers may significantly reduce the risk of recidivism. Community volunteers offer sustained, prosocial support to inmates which may account for these beneficial effects. However, the question of how inmates themselves evaluate volunteer visitation has hardly been studied. This study explores how inmates of Dutch prisons who receive one-on-one volunteer visits experience and value these visits. To that end, semistructured interviews were conducted with 21 inmates across six penitentiaries. These show that the value of volunteer visitation for inmates has to be understood in terms of a human-to-human encounter. Visits by volunteers provide inmates with rare opportunities to have a confidential conversation, away from the harshness of the usual prison life. Furthermore, inmates perceive volunteer visitation as beneficial beyond the actual visits. Inmates draw hope, strength, or self-respect from the conversations; they see volunteers as role models and develop a more positive view of the future. Two potential obstacles to beneficial volunteer visitation were detected: lack of chemistry between volunteer and inmate and imposition of worldview beliefs by volunteers.

TI  - The intertextual Jewish joke at the turn of the twentieth century and the poetics of a national renewal
T2  - HUMOR-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMOR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the role of the intertextual Jewish joke at the turn of the twentieth century, in its historical and cultural contexts. The case studies would be Alter Druyanow's popular anthology, Sefer Habediha Vehahiddud (The Book of Jokes and Witticisms, Frankfurt 1922), and his archived, unpublished collection of sexual jokes. The frequent use of quotations from sacred Jewish texts, characteristic of these collections, is discussed in light of the distinction between sub-genres of the intertextual joke: the allusive joke, the parodic joke, and the satiric joke. While most reflect the folklorist's ambition to bridge the gap between Hebrew as a holy language and Yiddish as a Jewish vernacular, a deeper examination of the jokes may discover Druyanow's subversive motivations as a national activist as well. Druyanow and his contemporaries engaged the biblical and rabbinical sources freely, as vessels capable of sanctifying the secular subject matter of the Jewish national revival. Moreover, the unpublished collection exposes satirical elements embodied in the intertextual Jewish joke of the time, potentially threatening the traditional Jewish worldview.

TI  - Validation of Sentinel-1A and AW3D30 DSMs for the Metropolitan Area of Istanbul, Turkey
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In space-borne remote sensing, one of the most significant tasks is the three-dimensional (3D) surface modelling performance of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite missions. In this study, the quality of Sentinel-1A (S-1A) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D 30m (AW3D30) Digital Surface Models (DSMs) was comprehensively analysed. In addition, 1arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) C-band DSM was validated for better interpretation of the results. A project area including various land cover classes was selected in Istanbul, where a reference airborne laser scanning DSM is available. Optimal S-1A interferometric wide (IW) swath SAR pairs were determined and a 15m gridded DSM was generated by interferometric processing. AW3D30 and SRTM DSMs were obtained from JAXA and NASA. In the analysis, the absolute and relative vertical accuracies of the DSMs were validated for all land cover classes with a model-to-model comparison to the reference. In addition, the influence of terrain tilt was investigated using a threshold terrain inclination of tan(-1)0.1 (5.7 degrees). Height differences from the reference were visualized by colour-coded height error maps. Vertical profiles and contour lines showed the morphologic character of the DSMs. The results demonstrated that the absolute vertical accuracies and morphologic details of AW3D30 are superior to those of S-1A and SRTM.

TI  - Fusion of SAR and Multispectral Images Using Random Forest Regression for Change Detection
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to overcome the insufficiency of single remote sensing data in change detection, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical image data can be used together for supplementation. However, conventional image fusion methods fail to address the differences in imaging mechanisms and cannot overcome some practical limitations such as usage in change detection or temporal requirement of the optical image. This study proposes a new method to fuse SAR and optical images, which is expected to be visually helpful and minimize the differences between two imaging mechanisms. The algorithm performs the fusion by establishing relationships between SAR and multispectral (MS) images by using a random forest (RF) regression, which creates a fused SAR image containing the surface roughness characteristics of the SAR image and the spectral characteristics of the MS image. The fused SAR image is evaluated by comparing it to those obtained using conventional image fusion methods and the proposed method shows that the spectral qualities and spatial qualities are improved significantly. Furthermore, for verification, other ensemble approaches such as stochastic gradient boosting regression and adaptive boosting regression are compared and overall it is confirmed that the performance of RF regression is superior. Then, change detection between the fused SAR and MS images is performed and compared with the results of change detection between MS images and between SAR images and the result using fused SAR images is similar to the result with MS images and is improved when compared to the result between SAR images. Lastly, the proposed method is confirmed to be applicable to change detection.

TI  - Monitoring Seasonal Pasture Quality Degradation in the Mediterranean Montado Ecosystem: Proximal versus Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Montado is an agro-forestry system occupying a large surface in countries of the Mediterranean region. In this system, the natural dryland pasture is the principal source for animal feed in extensive grazing. The climatic seasonality associated with the inter-annual irregularity of precipitation greatly influences the development of pasture and its vegetative cycle. The end of spring is a critical period in terms of animal feed due to the notable reduction in the nutritive value of the plants. The objective of this work was to evaluate, through the correlation between pasture quality indexes (Pasture Quality Degradation Index, PQDI and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI), two technological approaches for monitoring the evolution of the quality of a biodiverse pasture in the period of greatest vegetative development (between February and June). The technological approaches consisted of (i) proximal sensing (PS), with the use of an active optical sensor; and (ii) remote sensing (RS), using images captured by a Sentinel-2 satellite. The results of this study show strong and significant correlations between PQDI and NDVI (obtained by PS or RS). These two techniques (PS or RS) can, therefore, be used in a complementary way to identify and anticipate the food supplementation needs for animals and support farmers in decision making.

TI  - Comparison of Landscape Metrics for Three Different Level Land Cover/Land Use Maps
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This research aims to investigate how different landscape metrics are affected by the enhancement of the thematic classes in land cover/land use (LC/LU) maps. For this aim, three different LC/LU maps based on three different levels of CORINE (Coordination of Information on The Environment) nomenclature were created for the selected study area using GEOBIA (Geographic Object Based Image Analysis) techniques. First, second and third level LC/LU maps of the study area have five, thirteen and twenty-seven hierarchical thematic classes, respectively. High-resolution Spot 7 images with 1.5 m spatial resolution were used as the main Earth Observation data to create LC/LU maps. Additional geospatial data from open sources (OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia) were also integrated to the classification in order to identify some of the 2nd and 3rd level LC/LU classes. Classification procedure was initially conducted for Level 3 classes in which we developed decision trees to be used in object-based classification. Afterwards, Level 3 classes were merged to create Level 2 LC/LU map and then Level 2 classes were merged to create the Level 1 LC/LU map according to CORINE nomenclature. The accuracy of Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 maps are calculated as; 93.50%, 89.00%, 85.50% respectively. At the last stage, several landscape metrics such as Number of Patch (NP), Edge Density (ED), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Euclidean Nearest Neighbor Distance (ENN), Splitting Index (SPLIT) and Aggregation Index (AI) metrics and others were calculated for different level LC/LU maps and landscape metrics values were compared to analyze the impact of changing thematic details on landscape metrics. Our results show that, increasing the thematic detail allows landscape characteristics to be defined more precisely and ensure comprehensive assessment of cause and effect relationships between classes.

TI  - Mapping the Changes in Urban Greenness Based on Localized Spatial Association Analysis under Temporal Context Using MODIS Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays an irreplaceable role for urban ecosystem services. Urban greenness represents all vegetation cover in and around cities. Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of the changes in urban greenness (CUG) provides fundamental clues for urban planning. The impact on CUG can be roughly categorized as being climate-induced and human-induced. Methods for mapping human-induced CUG (H-CUG) are rare. In this paper, a new framework, known as Localized Spatial Association Analysis under Temporal Context (LSAA-TC), was proposed to explore H-CUG. Localized spatial association analysis (LSAA) was performed first to extract local spatial outliers (LSOs), or locations that differ significantly in urban greenness from those located in the neighborhood. LSOs were then analyzed under the temporal context to map their intertemporal variations known as spatiotemporal outliers. We applied LSAA-TC to mapping H-CUG in the Wuhan Metropolitan Area, China during 2000-2015 using the vegetation index from Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 13Q1 as the proxy for urban greenness. The computed H-CUG demonstrated apparent spatiotemporal patterns. The result is consistent with the fact that the traditional downtown area presents the lowest H-CUG, while it is found that the peripheral area in the circular belt within 14-20 km from the urban center demonstrates the most significant H-CUG. We conclude that LSAA-TC can be a widely applicable framework to understand H-CUG patterns and is a promising tool for informative urban planning.

TI  - Pattern of of distribution of 35 red cell antigens in regular voluntary blood donors of South Gujarat, India
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Extended phenotyping is one of the important method of reducing red cell alloimmunisation. Extended phenotyping of red cells from voluntary donors have many uses in addition to its application in population genetics. As there was very little data extended phenotyping on a cohort of Indian Voluntary blood donors this project was undertaken.Study design & methodology: 200 regular voluntary blood donors having 'O' blood group were included for red cell antigen typing of Rh (D,C,E,c,e), Kell (K, k, Kp(a), Kp(b)), Duffy (Fy(a), Fy(b)), Kidd (Jk(a), Jk(b)), Lewis(Le(a), Le(b)), P (P1), MNS (M, N,S,s), and Lutheran (Lu-a, Lu-b), Colton (Co-a, Co-b), Diago Wr(a)), V-w and Xg(a) antigens using conventional antisera provided by DIAGAST. Calculations of antigen and phenotypes frequencies were expressed as percentages.Results: Out of 200 'O' group blood donors, 96.5% were Rh D and 2.5% were K positive. Amongst Rh antigens, e was the most common (100%) followed by D, C (91.0%), c (50.5%) and E (16.5%) with DCe/DCe (R1R1, 48.0%) being the most common phenotype. In Kell blood group system, we found k antigen to be 100% and a rare phenotype Kp (a + b +) was found in 1% of the donors. For Kidd and Duffy blood group systems, Jk (a + b +) and Fy (a + b-) were the most common phenotypes (39.0% and 64.0%, respectively). In the MNS blood group system, M + N+ (67.5%) and S + s + (43.5%) were the most common phenotypes. There were antigens like C-w(3.5%), K(2.3%), Kp(a)(1.2%), In-a(1.0%), V-w(1.2%), COa(4.5%), Co-b(1%), Lu-a(1.75%), Di(a+) (1.2%), and Wr(a+) (0.6%) with frequency < 5% in the donor population.Conclusion: Extensively antigen phenotypes group 'O' red cells showed significant variation with other population from India as well as with Caucasian and black population. Extensive phenotyping 'O' group regular blood donors of red cell antigens is very useful to prepare in-house red cell panels for identification of alloantibodies.

TI  - Understanding the impacts of climate change and human activities on streamflow: a case study of the Soan River basin, Pakistan
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and land use change are the two main factors that can alter the catchment hydrological process. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relative contribution of climate change and land use change to runoff change of the Soan River basin. The Mann-Kendal and the Pettit tests are used to find out the trends and change point in hydroclimatic variables during the period 1983-2012. Two different approaches including the abcd hydrological model and the Budyko framework are then used to quantify the impact of climate change and land use change on streamflow. The results from both methods are consistent and show that annual runoff has significantly decreased with a change point around 1997. The decrease in precipitation and increases in potential evapotranspiration contribute 68% of the detected change while the rest of the detected change is due to land use change. The land use change acquired from Landsat shows that during post-change period, the agriculture has increased in the Soan basin, which is in line with the positive contribution of land use change to runoff decrease. This study concludes that aforementioned methods performed well in quantifying the relative contribution of land use change and climate change to runoff change.

TI  - Enhanced forest interior estimations utilizing lidar-assisted 3D forest cover map
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of forest interior is essential for large scale sustainable forest management. Conventional 2D forest cover maps only indicate the presence and absence of forests and may introduce quantity and allocation bias in the delineation of forest interior due to the inclusion of early successional/recently disturbed forests. We addressed this issue by utilizing both lidar data and National Land Cover Database (NLCD) to generate a 3D forest cover map in the forested region of western North Carolina, USA. We first classified forest cover as either early or late successional based on vertical structural information (using either a single-height threshold or a variable-height threshold by forest type). We then estimated forest interior based on these different forest cover classes and assessed disagreement in quantity and allocation of interior forests as determined using 2D forest cover maps. In addition, we determined spatial relationships between developed areas and forest interiors to evaluate the impact of landscape settings on the estimation of forest interior. Our results indicated that using a single-height threshold, the 3D forest cover map was able to distinguish early vs. late successional forests with a classification accuracy of 96.6%. A similar classification accuracy (94.6%) was achieved when applying variable height thresholds by forest type. Based on the single-height threshold method, excluding early successional forests (6.4% of all forested area) reduced estimates of forest interior by 10.3%, 9.6% and 10.4% at spatial resolutions of 4.4 ha, 39.7 ha and 234 ha, respectively. Using variable-height threshold by forest type, the estimates of forest interior were approximately 1% less than the estimates using the single-height threshold method due to the slightly decrease of the early successional forest classification (5.7% of all forest area). Our results indicated the forest interior may be overestimated without accounting for successional stage. Moreover, geospatial distance analysis revealed the overestimation of forest interior to be most pronounced in highly fragmented areas. Our study demonstrated the advantage of considering 3D structural information for the accurate estimation of forest interior, particularly in areas already having fragmented forests. This information can be relatively easily obtained from lidar data. This 3D method will allow for the creation of high-accuracy forest interior maps that can help to answer a variety of ecological questions and improve forest management and conservation.

TI  - THE ROLE OF SEARCHING FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE FROM THE STANDPOINT OF RELIGIOUS FAITH IN THE SPIRITUAL SELF-REALIZATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The self-realization of the individual has always belonged to a range of issues that, to some extent, have been fundamental for society, have determined the essence of any historical model of society. The individual is the most dynamic creator of social reality; he/she directly develops and establishes it every day by his/her needs, abilities, knowledge, skills, faculties, volitional and emotional potential, in short, his/her own essential forces. In the article, we demonstrate various approaches to the concept of self-realization of the individual, analyse the current state of the development of the problem of searching for the meaning of life of the individual, and consider religious faith as a condition for searching and finding the meaning of life.On the basis of an experimental study, we reveal the psychological specifics of the search for the meaning of life in adolescence in the context of religious faith. Based on the results of the study, we conclude that the search for the meaning of life plays a decisive role in the formation of life strategies, the hierarchy of values, and the spiritual self-realization of the individual. At the same time, religious faith has significant influence on the search for the meaning of life of the individual, determines the content of the process of mastering spiritual values and the formation of worldview, encourages the individual to activate the search for the meaning of life, becomes a foundation for the spiritual development of the individual, motivates the individual to self-perfection, the improvement of the world, and the augmentation of the goodness and wisdom.

TI  - Responding to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder in Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRICS AND CHILD HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a significant public health issue in Australia that is poorly diagnosed, chronic and costly. FASD is a diffuse acquired brain injury secondary to prenatal alcohol exposure. The prevalence rate of FASD among the general population in Australia is currently unknown; however, an Australian study in a selected high-risk population reported some of the highest rates of FASD in the world. A common misconception among clinicians is that a child must have the face' of FASD to have the disorder. This is incorrect. The three sentinel facial features only occur in the minority of individuals with FASD. FASD should be considered as a whole body' disorder as increased susceptibility to chronic health problems suggests suboptimal in utero environments places the individual at risk of later disease. Clinicians are reluctant to consider FASD as a possible diagnosis because of the concern of inducing stigma; however, this concern is neither supported by the evidence nor patient stories. The Australian Guide to the Diagnosis of FASD is now available to assist health professionals in providing timely and accurate diagnoses, which can lead to improved outcomes via evidence-based intervention and is an important first step in future prevention.

TI  - Vegetation changes in the Three-River Headwaters Region of the Tibetan Plateau of China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR), located in the hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau, is a key ecological region of China for its abundant natural resources and crucial ecological functions. In recent decades, severe vegetation degradation is observed due to its fragile ecosystems, global climate change and frequent human disturbance. To restrain the further degradation, the Chinese government initiated an ecological conservation project of TRHR in 2005 with a total investment of around 1 billion USD. Here, the vegetation changes during 2000-2015 as well as the effects of the ecological conservation project were investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and a generic approach for vegetation trend analysis, Detecting Breakpoints and Estimating Segments in Trend (DBEST). The results show that the vegetation of TRHR underwent an overall recovery with NDVI trend from around 0.24 in 2000 to 0.26 in 2015. The project was proved to have a positive but insignificant effect on the vegetation recovery based on the comparison of the vegetation changes inside and outside the reserve from 2005 to 2015. However, TRHR is still at a risk of further degradation because increasing fluctuations in trend were also observed. Significant degradation was found in reserves including Dongzhong, Aangsai, Baizha, Tongtian River and Nianbaoyuze. It is suggested that long-term vegetation and ecosystem conservation efforts remain to be continuously conducted particularly in the aforementioned areas. This study provides knowledge for future ecosystem conservation of TRHR, and also enriches the remotely sensed detection of the vegetation changes.

TI  - Spirituality in African-American Breast Cancer Patients: Implications for Clinical and Psychosocial Care
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spirituality has been shown to be important to many individuals dealing with a cancer diagnosis. While African-American breast cancer survivors have been reported to have higher levels of spirituality compared to White women, little is known about how levels of spirituality may vary among African-American breast cancer survivors. The aims of this study were to examine factors associated with spirituality among African-American survivors and test whether spirituality levels were associated with women's attitudes about treatment or health care. The primary outcome, spirituality, was nine-item scale (Cronbach's alpha = .99). Participants completed standardized telephone interviews that captured sociocultural, healthcare process, and treatment attitudes. Medical records were abstracted post-adjuvant therapy for treatment and clinical information. In bivariate analysis, age was not correlated with spirituality (p = .40). Married/living as married women had higher levels of spirituality (m = 32.1) than single women (m = 30.1). Contextual factors that were associated with higher levels spirituality were: collectivism (r = .44; p < 0.0001, Afrocentric worldview (r = .185; p = .01), and self-efficacy scale (r = .17; p = .02). In multivariable analysis, sociodemographic factors were not significant. Collectivism remained a robust predictor (p < 0.0001). Attitudes about the efficacy of cancer treatment were not associated with spirituality. The high levels of spirituality in African-American survivors suggest consideration of integrating spiritual care within the delivery of cancer treatment. Future studies should consider how spirituality may contribute to positive coping and/or behaviors in African-American women with high levels of spirituality.

TI  - Using Imaging Spectrometry to Study Changes in Crop Area in California's Central Valley during Drought
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In California, predicted climate warming increases the likelihood of extreme droughts. As irrigated agriculture accounts for 80% of the state's managed water supply, the response of the agricultural sector will play a large role in future drought impacts. This study examined one drought adaptation strategy, changes in planting decisions, using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) imagery from June 2013, 2014, and 2015 from the Central Valley of California. We used the random forest classifier to classify crops into categories of similar water use. Classification accuracy was assessed using the random forest out-of-bag accuracy, and an independently validated accuracy at both the pixel and field levels. These results were then compared to simulated Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and simulated Sentinel-2B results. The classification was further analyzed for method portability and band importance. The resultant crop maps were used to analyze changes in crop area as one measure of agricultural adaptation in times of drought. The results showed overall field-level accuracies of 94.4% with AVIRIS, as opposed to 90.4% with Landsat OLI and 91.7% with Sentinel, indicating that hyperspectral imagery has the potential to identify crops by water-use group at a single time step at higher accuracies than multispectral sensors. Crop maps produced using the random forest classifier indicated that the total crop area decreased as the drought persisted from 2013 to 2015. Changes in area by crop type revealed that decisions regarding which crop to grow and which to fallow in times of drought were not driven by the average water requirements of crop groups, but rather showed possible linkages to crop value and/or crop permanence.

TI  - A Comparison of SWAT Model Calibration Techniques for Hydrological Modeling in the Ganga River Watershed
T2  - ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ganga River, the longest river in India, is stressed by extreme anthropogenic activity and climate change, particularly in the Varanasi region. Anticipated climate changes and an expanding populace are expected to further impede the efficient use of water. In this study, hydrological modeling was applied to Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) modeling in the Ganga catchment, over a region of 15 621.612 km(2) in the southern part of Uttar Pradesh. The primary goals of this study are: (1) To test the execution and applicability of the SWAT model in anticipating runoff and sediment yield; and (2) to compare and determine the best calibration algorithm among three popular algorithms-sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 (SUFI-2), the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE), and parallel solution (ParaSol). The input data used in the SWAT were the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), Landsat-8 satellite imagery, soil data, and daily meteorological data. The watershed of the study area was delineated into 46 sub-watersheds, and a land use/land cover (LULC) map and soil map were used to create hydrological response units (HRUs). Models utilizing SUFI-2, GLUE, and ParaSol methods were constructed, and these algorithms were compared based on five categories: their objective functions, the concepts used, their performances, the values of P-factors, and the values of R-factors. As a result, it was observed that SUFI-2 is a better performer than the other two algorithms for use in calibrating Indian watersheds, as this method requires fewer runs for a computational model and yields the best results among the three algorithms. ParaSol is the worst performer among the three algorithms. After calibrating using SUFI-2, five parameters including the effective channel hydraulic conductivity (CH_K2), the universal soil-loss equation (USLE) support parameter (USLE_P), Manning's n value for the main channel (CH_N2), the surface runoff lag time (SURLAG), and the available water capacity of the soil layer (SOL_AWC) were observed to be the most sensitive parameters for modeling the present watershed. It was also found that the maximum runoff occurred in sub-watershed number 40 (SW#40), while the maximum sediment yield was 50 t.a(-1) for SW#36, which comprised barren land. The average evapotranspiration for the basin was 411.55 mm.a(-1). The calibrated model can be utilized in future to facilitate investigation of the impacts of LULC, climate change, and soil erosion.

TI  - Development of a Regression Model for Estimating Daily Radiative Forcing Due to Atmospheric Aerosols from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometers (MODIS) Data in the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP)
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of direct radiative forcing due to atmospheric aerosols (ADRF) in the Indo Gangetic Plain (IGP), which is a food basket of south Asia, is important for measuring the effect of atmospheric aerosols on the terrestrial ecosystem and for assessing the effect of aerosols on crop production in the region. Existing comprehensive analytical models to estimate ADRF require a large number of input parameters and high processing time. In this context, here, we develop a simple model to estimate daily ADRF at any location on the surface of the IGP through multiple regressions of AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and atmospheric water vapour using data from 2002 to 2015 at 10 stations in the IGP. The goodness of fit of the model is indicated by an adjusted R-2 value of 0.834. The Jackknife method of deleting one group (station data) was employed to cross validate and study the stability of the regression model. It was found to be robust with an adjusted R-2 fluctuating between 0.813 and 0.842. In order to use the year-round ADRF model for locations beyond the AERONET stations in the IGP, AOD, and atmospheric water vapour products from MODIS Aqua and Terra were compared against AERONET station data and they were found to be similar. Using MODIS Aqua and Terra products as input, the year-round ADRF regression was evaluated at the IGP AERONET stations and found to perform well with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.66 and 0.65, respectively. Using ADRF regression model with MODIS inputs allows for the estimation of ADRF across the IGP for assessing the aerosol impact on ecosystem and crop production.

AB  - Satellite-based particulate matter (PM) models provide spatially and temporally resolved estimations, allowing greater spatial-temporal coverage compared to sparse ground monitoring stations. The spatio-temporal resolution of these models can be improved using aerosol optical depth (AOD) products from various satellite platforms with different overpass times which can capture possible changes in diurnal aerosol concentrations. Israel is characterized by diverse geo-climatic regions and it is subjected to frequent dust storms events. Our goal was to estimate PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in Israel on daily and intra-daily (mean PM around the Aqua and Terra overpasses) temporal resolutions and to assess the differences between these time windows. A hybrid modeling approach that consists of three stages was used enabling spatially continuous PM estimations at 1 x 1 km spatial resolution. The model was calibrated on a daily basis applying a mixed modeling approach using MODIS-based MAIAC AOD and various spatial and temporal predictors. It was found that in certain urban areas the measured and estimated PM concentrations during the satellite overpass (Terra or Aqua) were higher than the mean daily PM. The models performed well showing cross-validated R-2 that ranged between 0.82 and 0.92. Mean estimated PM for the study period (2005-2015) during days with no dust events showed different spatial patterns for the daily and intra-daily estimations and revealed areas in Israel that are affected by high PM concentrations (mainly industrial or dense urban areas). Estimations from these models are useful for epidemiological research and might contribute to environmental regulatory purposes by focusing the efforts of PM pollution reduction at the identified polluted areas.

TI  - Modelling Groundwater Flow with MIKE SHE Using Conventional Climate Data and Satellite Data as Model Forcing in Haihe Plain, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In North China Plain, accurate spatial and temporal ET and precipitation pattern is very important in the groundwater resource assessment. This study demonstrated the potential for modelling ET and groundwater processes using remote sensing data for distributed hydrological modelling with MIKE SHE codes in the Haihe Plain, China. The model was successfully validated against independent groundwater level measurements following the calibration period and the model also provided a reasonable match of the lysimeter measurements of ET. The remote sensing data included ET derived from global radiation products of Fengyun-2C geostationary meteorological satellite (FY-2C) and FY-2C precipitation products. The comparisons show that precipitation is a critical factor for the hydrological response and for the spatial distribution of ET and groundwater flow. FY-2C precipitation products has a spatial resolution of about 11 km, which thus adds more spatial variability to the most important driving variable. The ET map based on FY-2C data has a higher spatial variability than that map based on conventional data, which are caused by higher resolution of ground information. The groundwater level changes in the aquifer system are shown in the quite different spatial patterns under two models, which is affected by the significant difference between two types of precipitation. In the Haihe Plain, accurate spatial and temporal ET pattern is very important in the groundwater resource assessment that determines the recharge to the saturated zone.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study acknowledges the problem of land cover demarcation in diverse vegetation condition. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is used for the preparation of base map. Further identification of mix and incorrect classes was done using ground truth. Radar data in combination with optical indices are used. In different NDVI classes, sigma degrees(RV) with additional criteria on Normalized Difference Water Index successfully demarcated waterlogged area, polarization ratio sigma degrees(RV)/sigma degrees(RH) and backscattering coefficient sigma degrees(RH) are found suitable to separate bare land from dry grass land, sparse and dense scrub could be separated by -(sigma degrees(RV)+sigma degrees(RH))/2 and NDVI is efficient to identify dense vegetation. The study area is taken as Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, India. Statistical similarity between ground truth and classified class has been assessed using Jaccard coefficient (JC), Jaccard distance (JD), Dice coefficient (DC) and F-score. High similarity values of JC, JD, DC and F-score are achieved for all land cover types except bare land. Although, dry grassland showed low value of F-score; the reason could be low precision of class. The overall accuracy (87.17%), producer's accuracy (86.39%), user's accuracy (85.81%) and Kappa Coefficient (0.84) are also utilized to analyze performance of classifier.

TI  - Regional Landslide Identification Based on Susceptibility Analysis and Change Detection
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide identification is an increasingly important research topic in remote sensing and the study of natural hazards. It is essential for hazard prevention, mitigation, and vulnerability assessments. Despite great efforts over the past few years, its accuracy and efficiency can be further improved. Thus, this study combines the two most popular approaches: susceptibility analysis and change detection thresholding, to derive a landslide identification method employing novel identification criteria. Through a quantitative evaluation of the proposed method and masked change detection thresholding method, the proposed method exhibits improved accuracy to some extent. Our susceptibility-based change detection thresholding method has the following benefits: (1) it is a semi-automatic landslide identification method that effectively integrates a pixel-based approach with an object-oriented image analysis approach to achieve more precise landslide identification; (2) integration of the change detection result with the susceptibility analysis result represents a novel approach in the landslide identification research field.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Evolution of Land Subsidence Induced by Groundwater Exploitation and Construction in the Eastern Chaoyang District, Beijing, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have a large impact on land subsidence in great metropolitan areas. In this study, the RADARSAT-2 observation data over a 4-year period (from November 2010 to September 2014) is used to investigate the trends of land subsidence in the eastern Chaoyang District in Beijing, China, and to analyze the impact of human activities on it. The observation results indicate that the temporal and spatial evolutions trend of land subsidence in this area is uneven, with deformation rates ranging from - 116.52 to 7.1 mm/year. There are two large subsidence areas located in the northern part of the study area, and we find that the groundwater exploitation and deformation rates are strongly linearly correlated. The effect of construction on land subsidence has also been investigated. Over time, land subsidence is generally increased in the study area, with an exception at the Longfor Changying Galleria area, which is under construction during the observation period. Based on the time-series analysis of permanent scattered points in the 200 m buffer area, construction activities are observed to cause both land subsidence and upheaval deformation of the surrounding soil. During the construction period, the displacement of the surrounding soil is disturbed. After completion, the initial displacement of surrounding soil is tended to involve the uplift of the surrounding soil, followed by a gradual subsidence with time.

TI  - Molecular genotyping of G6PD mutations and Duffy blood group in Afro-descendant communities from Brazilian Amazon
T2  - GENETICS AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PDd) and Duffy-negative blood group are two red blood cells variants that confer protection against malaria. In this study, the distribution of the most common G6PD variants (G6PD*A-, GGPD*A and G6PD Mediterranean) and the major alleles of the Duffy blood group (FY*A, FY*B and FY*B-ES) were investigated in an Afro-descendant population from state of Para, Brazilian Amazon. G6PD variants and Duffy blood group alleles were determined by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. Overall, molecular genotyping revealed the presence of G6PD variants in 126 (24%) of the individuals studied (5% male and 19% female), and frequencies of the G6PD*A- and G6PD*A alleles were 0.061 and 0.104, respectively. Duffy blood group genotyping showed that 24.3% of people were Duffy-negative and 41.3% were heterozygous for FY*B-ES. The frequency of allele FY*B-ES was 41.0%. The results emphasize the need to monitor G6PD deficiency for the use of primaquine in the routine care of the Afro-descendant communities of the Trombetas, Erepecuru and Cumna rivers, evaluating the risks of hemolytic crisis in case of recurrence of malaria in the region. In addition, the possible greater protection against malaria conferred by these erythrocyte polymorphisms deserves to be better investigated and explored among these Afro-descendants.

TI  - Citizen Support for Military Expenditure Post-9/11: Exploring the Role of Race, Ethnicity, and Place of Birth
T2  - ARMED FORCES & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Citizens adjust their perceptions of military expenditure based largely on their worldview, as defined by their race, ethnicity, ideology, gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and education. Worldview might also reasonably be impacted by nativity. We explore the relationship between nativity and public opinion about military expenditure. Native-born survey respondents are less likely to believe that military expenditures are excessive than those born abroad. Race, ethnicity, ideology, nativity, and confidence in the military are the most significant variables used in explaining attitudes about military expenditure. Interaction analysis carried out for this article and reported here demonstrates that Hispanic and Asian ethnicity impacts on public perception of military expenditure are significantly greater when factoring in the nativity of survey respondents. With a growing portion of non-native-born citizens joining the electorate, public opinion analyses regarding military expenditure should take into account nativity as well as SES, gender, race, ideology, education, and ethnicity when seeking to explain public opinion dynamics.

TI  - Snow cover variability in North-West Himalaya during last decade
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is an essential component of the cryosphere and spatio-temporal variability of snow cover over large Himalayan region is important for climate change studies, regional and global energy budget, aquatic cycles and managing water resources, etc. In the present paper, analysis of snow cover area (SCA) variation for more than a decade period from 2001 to 2016 in North-West Himalaya (NWH) and its climatic zones, i.e., lower Himalayan zone (LHZ), middle Himalayan zone (MHZ), and upper Himalayan zone (UHZ), has been presented. SCA has been estimated using 10-day maximum snow cover product derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor images. Large inter and intra-annual variation in snow cover of NWH and its climatic zones have been observed during the data period. SCA in NWH varied from similar to 13,180 km(2) (August, 2001) to similar to 2, 11,000 km(2) (February, 2004) during the data period. Mean of annual and seasonal SCA has been estimated for entire NWH and its climatic zones. Mean annual SCA of NWH, LHZ, MHZ, and UHZ were estimated to be similar to 92,482 km(2), similar to 8150 km(2), similar to 35,078 km(2), and similar to 21,190 km(2) respectively. SCA was observed to be decreasing in NWH, LHZ, and MHZ at the rate of 840 km(2) year(-1), 31 km(2) year(-1), and 74 km(2) year(-1) respectively during 2001-2010, although the trend was statistically non-significant. Statistically significant increasing trend in SCA has been observed in UHZ at the rate of 241 km(2) year(-1) during 2001-2016. The paper highlights a shift in SCA trends after 2010 in NWH, LHZ, and MHZ and slowdown in snow/ice cover shrinkage during recent years. Additionally, variation in snowline elevation, snow cover duration and effect of topography on snow cover has been explored during different seasons in the NWH and its climatic zones.

TI  - Model-Based Six-Component Scattering Matrix Power Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fully polarimetric model-based decompositions are developed by accounting for the physical scattering model and experimental polarimetric SAR data acquisition processes. These decompositions offer the promising straightforward interpretation and highly improved inversion models for visualizing images of scattering scenarios optimally. However, the attempts in existing decompositions to implement the split real and imaginary components of the T-13 element of the coherency matrix have been hampered by the absence of physical models to fit the coherency matrix. In this paper, two additional physical scattering submodels are derived. The real and imaginary parts of T-13 are accounted for by implementing two newly developed physical scattering models. (One is for oriented dipole scattering and the other is for oriented quarter-wave reflection.) Furthermore, this paper is extended by implementing these physical models into a six-component scattering power model-based decomposition. To this date, the developed novel decompositions account for the maximum elements of the coherency matrix in a physical manner compared to the existing model-based decompositions. The proposed novel decomposition is tested on L-band and X-band fully polarimetric SAR data sets of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2/Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 and the X-band TerraSAR-X, respectively. This new decomposition produces additional two scattering submatrix components. Such scattering components are prevalent in vegetation and urban areas and even dominant over highly oriented urban scenarios. The new method enhances the truly existing double-bounce scattering contributions and reduces the overrated volume scattering from double-bounce scatterers. By comparing the results, it is found that the proposed decomposition considerably enhances the SAR image quality and its more correct visualizing presentation compared to existing decompositions. It is also found to be more robust over the oriented urban areas than the existing decompositions, resulting from the utilization of both the real and imaginary components of T-13 polarimetric information in a physical scattering manner.

TI  - Impact of lateral boundary and initial conditions in the prediction of Bay of Bengal cyclones using WRF model and its 3D-VAR data assimilation system
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the impact of lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) and initial conditions (ICs) in the prediction of land-falling tropical cyclones (TCs) using Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational (3D-VAR) data assimilation system for the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region. The LBCs are derived from the National Centre for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final (FNL) analysis and GFS forecasted datasets at different horizontal and temporal resolutions. The assimilated datasets in the model comprises of NCEP PREBUFR (PILOT, SOUND, SYNOP, METAR, SONDE, BUOY, SHIP and QuikSCAT) and satellite radiances from Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU-A, AMSU-B), High Resolution Infra-Red Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) at different assimilation cycles. The impact of the LBCs with varying spatial and temporal resolutions are investigated in detail and the results indicate that the forecasted track during the first 48 h are not affected, however the subsequent forecasted track is significantly influenced by the 3 hourly GFS LBCs. The initial intensity, positional errors, and storm structure show improvements with the assimilation of NCEP PREBUFR and radiance observations at different assimilation cycles. Simulations carried out with improved initial conditions indicate that the forecast (in terms of track, intensity, and trends in the intensification and dissipation) of the cyclonic storm Sidr improved significantly. In addition, five severe land-falling BoB cyclones (Phailin, Lehar, Helen, Madi, and Hudhud) during 2013-2014 were studied using 3 hourly GFS LBCs and with assimilation of NCEP PREBUFR and satellite radiance observations. The results clearly signify the ability of the WRF modeling system in forecasting the track, intensity, and landfall of the storms. The forecasted mean track errors during 2013-2014 cyclones are 65 km, 58 km, 99 km, and 103 km from day-1 to day-4 respectively, while the initial positional errors was about 41 km. The mean landfall time and positional errors are about 3 h and 15 km respectively. The forecasted intensity of the storm in terms of maximum surface wind (MSW) is also reasonably well predicted, and these errors are 4 ms(-1),10 ms(-1), 6ms(-1), and 8 ms(-1) from day-1 to day-4 respectively.

TI  - Evaluating the ability of community-protected forests in Cambodia to prevent deforestation and degradation using temporal remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Community forests are known to play an important role in preserving forests in Cambodia, a country that has seen rapid deforestation in recent decades. The detailed evaluation of the ability of community-protected forests to retain forest cover and prevent degradation in Cambodia will help to guide future conservation management. In this study, a combination of remotely sensing data was used to compare the temporal variation in forest structure for six different community forests located in the Phnom Kulen National Park (PKNP) in Cambodia and to assess how these dynamics vary between community-protected forests and a wider study area. Medium-resolution Landsat, ALOS PALSAR data, and high-resolution LiDAR data were used to study the spatial distribution of forest degradation patterns and their impacts on above-ground biomass (AGB) changes. Analysis of the remotely sensing data acquired at different spatial resolutions revealed that between 2012 and 2015, the community forests had higher forest cover persistence and lower rates of forest cover loss compared to the entire study area. Furthermore, they faced lower encroachment from cashew plantations compared to the wider landscape. Four of the six community forests showed a recovery in canopy gap fractions and subsequently, an increase in the AGB stock. The levels of degradation decreased in forests that had an increase in AGB values. However, all community forests experienced an increase in understory damage as a result of selective tree removal, and the community forests with the sharpest increase in understory damage experienced AGB losses. This is the first time multitemporal high-resolution LiDAR data have been used to analyze the impact of human-induced forest degradation on forest structure and AGB. The findings of this work indicate that while community-protected forests can improve conservation outcomes to some extent, more interventions are needed to curb the illegal selective logging of valuable timber trees.

TI  - Study of Soil, Water, and Cropping Pattern in Danastar Wah (Manchar Lake) Command Area Using Geospatial Tools
T2  - MEHRAN UNIVERSITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effluent water brought by RBOD (Right Bank Outfall Drain) is not only threat to the aquatic life of Manchar Lake but also the fertile agricultural lands which are being cultivated by use of lake water through Danastar Wah are at risk of salinization. The farming community of the area is scary of continual use of irrigation waters received through the Danastar Wah; they are of the view that the constant use of this water will ruin their fertile lands into salt-affected soils. Thus, keeping in view the fears of the farmers of the command area of Danastar Wah, a study was carried out to investigate the water quality of the Manchar Lake, RBOD MNV (Main Nara Valley) drain and Danastar Wah, and to examine soil salinity status of the area using Geo-referenced field and satellite imagery data for Kharif season of the year 2015. The results of the study showed that the EC (Electrical Conductivity) of the Danastar Wah water was below 1.2 dS/m. Thus, the water was suitable for irrigation purpose. In all the water samples, Na+, Ca2+ + Mg2+ and CO3 concentrations were found within the permissible limits, while no concentration of HCO3 was found in any of the water samples. In the command area, clay texture was dominant down to a depth of 60 cm soil profile. In the area about 37, 28, and 30% of the soils were normal (non-saline), saline and sodic, respectively; while only 5% of soils were saline-sodic. The cotton crop was identified as the major Kharif crop, occupying about 13.76% (2,844 ha) of the total command area, followed by rice crop grown on about 5.21% (1,078 ha) of the command area. The overall accuracy of image classification was 90% with a kappa coefficient of 0.86. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the water of the Danastar Wah can be used for irrigation purpose during Kharif season only with the condition that adequate land drainage is maintained. It is also suggested that before using the water of Manchar Lake, RBOD and Danastar Wah for Rabi season, analysis for water quality be conducted. Geo-Informatics (GIS and RS) tools can be employed for spatial and temporal monitoring of water quality of the Manchar Lake.

TI  - Left in the Dark? Oil and Rural Poverty
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ECONOMISTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Do oil booms reduce rural poverty and inequality? To study this we measure rural poverty by counting people who live in darkness at night: combining high-resolution global satellite data on night-time lights and population from 2000 to 2013. We develop a measure that accurately identifies 74% of households as above or below the extreme poverty line when compared to over 600,000 household surveys. We find that both high oil prices and new discoveries increase illumination and GDP nationally. However, they also promote regional inequality because the increases are limited to towns and cities with no evidence that they benefit the rural poor.

TI  - Dalangtan Saline Playa in a Hyperarid Region of Tibet Plateau: III. Correlated Multiscale Surface Mineralogy and Geochemistry Survey
T2  - ASTROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first multiscale, systematic field-based testing of correlations between orbital scale advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer visible near-infrared (VNIR)/shortwave infrared (SWIR) reflectance and thermal infrared relative emissivity and outcrop scale Raman spectroscopy, VNIR reflectance, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) mineralogy and chemistry in a saline dry lakebed. This article is one of three reports describing the evolution of salt deposits, meteorological record, and surface and subsurface salt mineralogy in Dalangtan, Qaidam Basin, a hyperarid region of the Tibet Plateau, China, as potential environmental, mineralogical, and biogeochemical analogs to Mars. We have successfully bridged remote sensing data to fine scale mineralogy and chemistry data. We have defined spectral end-members in the northwestern Qaidam Basin and classified areas within the study area on the basis of their spectral similarity to the spectral end-members. Results of VNIR/SWIR classification reveal zonation of spectral units within three large anticlinal domes in the study area that can be correlated between the three structures. Laboratory Raman, VNIR reflectance, XRD, and LIBS data of surface mineral samples collected along a traverse over Xiaoliangshan (XLS) indicate that the surface is dominated by gypsum, Mg sulfates, Na sulfates, halite, and carbonates, with minor concentrations of illite present in most samples as well. Our results can be used as a first step toward better characterizing the potential of orbital reflectance spectroscopy as a method for mineral detection and quantification in salt-rich planetary environments, with the benefit that this technique can be validated on the ground using instruments onboard rovers.

TI  - Change Detection Based on Multi-Feature Clustering Using Differential Evolution for Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection (CD) of natural land cover is important for environmental protection and to maintain an ecological balance. The Landsat series of satellites provide continuous observation of the Earth's surface and is sensitive to reflection of water, soil and vegetation. It offers fine spatial resolutions (15-80 m) and short revisit times (16-18 days). Therefore, Landsat imagery is suitable for monitoring natural land cover changes. Clustering-based CD methods using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) can be applied to Landsat images to obtain optimal changed and unchanged clustering centers (clusters) with minimum clustering index. However, they directly analyze difference image (DI), which finds itself subject to interference by Gaussian noise and local brightness distortion in Landsat data, resulting in false alarms in detection results. In order to reduce image interferences and improve CD accuracy, we proposed an unsupervised CD method based on multi-feature clustering using the differential evolution algorithm (M-DECD) for Landsat Imagery. First, according to characteristics of Landsat data, a multi-feature space is constructed with three elements: Wiener de-noising, detail enhancement, and structural similarity. Then, a CD method based on differential evolution (DE) algorithm and fuzzy clustering is proposed to obtain global optimal clusters in the multi-feature space, and generate a binary change map (CM). In addition, the control parameters of the DE algorithm are adjusted to improve the robustness of M-DECD. The experimental results obtained with four Landsat datasets confirm the effectiveness of M-DECD. Compared with the results of conventional methods and the current state-of-the-art methods based on evolutionary clustering, the detection accuracies of the M-DECD on the Mexico dataset and the Sardinia dataset are very close to the best results. The accuracies of the M-DECD in the Alaska dataset and the large Canada dataset increased by about 3.3% and 11.9%, respectively. This indicates that multiple features are suitable for Landsat images and the DE algorithm is effective in searching for an optimal CD result.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice agriculture over China using AMSR-E time series data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the potential of AMSR-E surface soil moisture (SSM) time series data to distinctively identify paddy rice pixels and map paddy rice cultivated area at national scales. Taking China as the test site, we first established and applied a paddy rice planting index (PRPI) to each AMSR-E 25 km pixel over the entire country during the period 2003-2011. A mathematical model was then constructed for the retrieval of paddy rice cultivated area at the AMSR-E pixel scale using data obtained from PRPI as input, and a high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.86) was recorded at the national scale. Provincial scale validation of the modeled paddy rice fraction shows a high correlation coefficient (R) of up to 0.94. In a subsequent step, the inter-annual variations in AMSR-E retrieved paddy rice areas were evaluated with annual agricultural census data, and an R-value of 0.93 was recorded. A good performance of the proposed retrieval method was also recorded when validated against MODIS paddy rice distribution images, and in which, five out of the seven selected validation sub-regions, had R values larger than 0.85, while R-values of up to 0.70-0.75 were recorded in the other two. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in mapping paddy rice agriculture at national scales, and therefore, the applicability of the PRPI algorithm on mapping paddy rice at continental and global scales is worth investigating.

TI  - Implications of Whole-Disc DSCOVR EPIC Spectral Observations for Estimating Earth's Spectral Reflectivity Based on Low-Earth-Orbiting and Geostationary Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth's reflectivity is among the key parameters of climate research. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft provides spectral reflectance of the entire sunlit Earth in the near backscattering direction every 65 to 110 min. Unlike EPIC, sensors onboard the Earth Orbiting Satellites (EOS) sample reflectance over swaths at a specific local solar time (LST) or over a fixed area. Such intrinsic sampling limits result in an apparent Earth's reflectivity. We generated spectral reflectance over sampling areas using EPIC data. The difference between the EPIC and EOS estimates is an uncertainty in Earth's reflectivity. We developed an Earth Reflector Type Index (ERTI) to discriminate between major Earth atmosphere components: clouds, cloud-free ocean, bare and vegetated land. Temporal variations in Earth's reflectivity are mostly determined by clouds. The sampling area of EOS sensors may not be sufficient to represent cloud variability, resulting in biased estimates. Taking EPIC reflectivity as a reference, low-earth-orbiting-measurements at the sensor-specific LST tend to overestimate EPIC values by 0.8% to 8%. Biases in geostationary orbiting approximations due to a limited sampling area are between -0.7% and 12%. Analyses of ERTI-based Earth component reflectivity indicate that the disagreement between EPIC and EOS estimates depends on the sampling area, observation time and vary between -10% and 23%.

TI  - Designing a field sampling plan for landscape-pest ecological studies using VHR optical imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop an easily replicable sampling methodology using very high spatial resolution (VHSR) optical imagery to study the effect of landscape composition on crop pest incidence and biological control. The methodology was developed for the millet head miner (MHM), Heliocheilus albipunctella (de Joannis) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a key pest of millet in Senegal (West Africa). The sampling plan was developed according to two main hypotheses: (i) pest incidence increases with millet abundance in the landscape, and (ii) biological control increases with the abundance of semi-natural habitats in the landscape. VHSR satellite imagery ( < 1 m) provided from a Pleiades sensor was used to map and to quantify the landscape elements. Covering a square region of 20 x 20 km, a hierarchical, broad-scale land cover map focusing on crop (millet and peanut crops) and tree (tree vegetation) categories was produced and validated with ground truth data. Then, the landscape variables (tree density index and millet crop density index) were calculated based on a regular grid of 100 ha for each cell size covering the study area; the variables were then split into three density classes (low-medium-high) representative of the full landscape heterogeneity and combined into nine landscape patterns. Finally, according to sampling capacity, track accessibility, and statistical constraints, 45 field sites, including five replicates for each landscape pattern, were validated and selected for pest monitoring.

TI  - Chronic Pain After Breast Surgery: A Prospective, Observational Study
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic pain is an important complication of breast surgery, estimated to affect 20-30% of patients. We prospectively examined surgical, demographic, and psychosocial factors associated with chronic pain 6 months after breast surgery.Patients undergoing breast surgery for benign and malignant disease preoperatively completed validated questionnaires to assess baseline pain and psychosocial characteristics. Pain at 6 months was quantified as the Pain Burden Index (PBI), which encompasses pain locations, severity, and frequency. Surgical type was categorized as breast-conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, and mastectomy with reconstruction; axillary procedure was categorized as no axillary surgery, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and axillary dissection. PBI was compared between groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, and the relationship between baseline demographic and psychosocial factors and PBI was assessed using Spearman's Rank Correlation. p < 0.05 was considered significant.PBI was variable amongst patients reporting this endpoint (n = 216) at 6 months, but no difference was found between primary breast surgical types (BCS, mastectomy, and mastectomy with reconstruction) or with surgical duration. However, axillary dissection was associated with higher PBI than SLNB and no axillary procedure (p < 0.001). Younger age (< 0.001) and higher BMI (p = 0.010), as well as higher preoperative anxiety (p = 0.017), depression (p < 0.001), and catastrophizing scores (p = 0.005) correlated with higher 6-month PBI.Amongst surgical variables, only axillary dissection was associated with greater pain at 6 months after surgery. Patient characteristics that were associated with higher PBI included lower age and higher BMI, as well as higher baseline anxiety, depression, and catastrophizing.

TI  - Linking Phenological Indices from Digital Cameras in Idaho and Montana to MODIS NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital cameras can provide a consistent view of vegetation phenology at fine spatial and temporal scales that are impractical to collect manually and are currently unobtainable by satellite and most aerial based sensors. This study links greenness indices derived from digital images in a network of rangeland and forested sites in Montana and Idaho to 16-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Multiple digital cameras were placed along a transect at each site to increase the observational footprint and correlation with the coarser MODIS NDVI. Digital camera phenology indices were averaged across cameras on a site to derive phenological curves. The phenology curves, as well as green-up dates, and maximum growth dates, were highly correlated to the satellite derived MODIS composite NDVI 16-day data at homogeneous rangeland vegetation sites. Forested and mixed canopy sites had lower correlation and variable significance. This result suggests the use of MODIS NDVI in forested sites to evaluate understory phenology may not be suitable. This study demonstrates that data from digital camera networks with multiple cameras per site can be used to reliably estimate measures of vegetation phenology in rangelands and that those data are highly correlated to MODIS 16-day NDVI.

TI  - An Operational Tool for the Automatic Detection and Removal of Border Noise in Sentinel-1 GRD Products
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of border noise in Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) products is an undesired processing artifact that limits their full exploitation in a number of applications. All of the Sentinel-1 GRD products generated before March 2018more than 800,000are affected by this particular type of noise. In March 2018, an official fix was deployed that solved the problem for a large portion of the newly generated products, but it did not cover the entire range of products, hence the need for an operational tool that is able to effectively and consistently remove border noise in an automated way. Currently, a few solutions have been proposed that try to address the problem, but all of them have limitations. The scope of this paper is therefore to present a new method based on mathematical morphology for the automatic detection and masking of border noise in Sentinel-1 GRD products that is able to overcome the existing limitations. To evaluate the performance of the method, a detailed numerical assessment was carried out, using, as a benchmark, the Remove GRD Border Noise' module integrated in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform. The results showed that the proposed method is capable of very accurately removing the undesired noisy pixels from GRD images, regardless of their acquisition mode, polarization, or resolution and can cope with challenging features within the image scenes that typically affect other approaches.

TI  - Estimation of Above-Ground Biomass over Boreal Forests in Siberia Using Updated In Situ, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, and RADARSAT-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of above-ground biomass (AGB) in boreal forests is of special concern as it constitutes the highest carbon pool in the northern hemisphere. Particularly, monitoring of the forests in the Russian Federation is important as some regions have not been inventoried for many years. This study explores the combination of multi-frequency, multi-polarization, and multi-temporal radar data as one key approach to provide an accurate estimate of forest biomass. The data from L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR-2), together with C-band RADARSAT-2 data, were applied for AGB estimation. Backscatter coefficients from L- and C-band radar were used independently and in combination with a non-parametric model to retrieve AGB data for a boreal forest in Siberia (Krasnoyarskiy Kray). AGB estimation was performed using the random forests machine learning algorithm. The results demonstrated that high estimation accuracies can be achieved at a spatial resolution of 0.25 ha. When the L-band data alone were used for the retrieval, a corrected root-mean-square error (RMSEcor) of 29.4 t ha(-1) was calculated. A marginal decrease in RMSEcor was observed when only the filtered L-band backscatter data, without ratio and texture, were used (29.1 t ha(-1)). The inclusion of the C-band data reduced the over and underestimation; the bias was reduced from 5.5 t ha(-1) to 4.7 t ha(-1); and a RMSEcor of 30.2 t ha(-1) was calculated.

TI  - Prescription surveillance for early detection system of emerging and reemerging infectious disease outbreaks
T2  - BIOSCIENCE TRENDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on prescriptions filled at external pharmacies, prescription surveillance (PS) in Japan has been reporting the estimated numbers of influenza and aricella patients and people prescribed certain drugs since 2009. Every morning, this system estimates the numbers of patients from the numbers of prescriptions filled nationwide for neuraminidase inhibitors, anti-herpes virus drugs, antibiotic drugs, antipyretic analgesics, and multi-ingredient cold medications. Moreover, it can detect "unexplained" infectious diseases that are not explained as infectious diseases monitored by other surveillance systems. Such "unexplained" infectious diseases might be emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including bioterrorism attacks, which are reportedly difficult to diagnose, at least in early outbreak stages. To ascertain the system's potential benefits, this study examined schemes to detect "unexplained" infectious diseases using PS information. The numbers of patients prescribed the respective drugs are first regressed on the known infectious diseases, time trends, and dummies for day-of-the-week, holidays, and days following a holiday. Known infectious diseases are defined as covered by the National Official Sentinel Surveillance for Infectious Diseases under the Infection Control Law. After the numbers of patients from PS are compared with the predicted numbers of patients, their probabilities of occurrence are calculated. We examined the system's prospective operation from January 2017 through July 2018. The criterion we used to define aberrations varied, from 0.01 to 10(-7). For criteria of 0.01 and 10(-7) we found 254 and 15 aberrations, respectively. We confirmed its feasibility and effectiveness.

TI  - Automated Attitude Determination for Pushbroom Sensors Based on Robust Image Matching
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate attitude information from a satellite image sensor is essential for accurate map projection and reducing computational cost for post-processing of image registration, which enhance image usability, such as change detection. We propose a robust attitude-determination method for pushbroom sensors onboard spacecraft by matching land features in well registered base-map images and in observed images, which extends the current method that derives satellite attitude using an image taken with 2-D image sensors. Unlike 2-D image sensors, a pushbroom sensor observes the ground by changing its position and attitude according to the trajectory of a satellite. To address pushbroom-sensor observation, the proposed method can trace the temporal variation in the sensor attitude by combining the robust matching technique for a 2-D image sensor and a non-linear least squares approach, which can express gradual time evolution of the sensor attitude. Experimental results using images taken from a visible and near infrared pushbroom sensor of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) onboard Terra as test image and Landsat-8/OLI images as a base map show that the proposed method can determine satellite attitude with an accuracy of 0.003 degrees (corresponding to the 2-pixel scale of ASTER) in roll and pitch angles even for a scene in which there are many cloud patches, whereas the determination accuracy remains 0.05 degrees in the yaw angle that does not affect accuracy of image registration compared with the other two axes. In addition to the achieved attitude accuracy that was better than that using star trackers (0.01 degrees) regarding roll and pitch angles, the proposed method does not require any attitude information from onboard sensors. Therefore, the proposed method may contribute to validating and calibrating attitude sensors in space, at the same time better accuracy will contribute to reducing computational cost in post-processing for image registration.

TI  - Monitoring Temporal Change of River Islands in the Yangtze River by Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial extent and area of river islands are always changing due to the impact of hydrodynamic conditions, sediment supply and human activities. A catastrophic flood disaster was driven by sustained and heavy rainfall around the middle and lower Yangtze River in 18 June to 21 July 2016. The flood resulted in the most serious social-economic loss since 1954 and caused a larger-scale inundation for a short time. It is essential to continuously monitor the dynamics changes of river islands because this can avoid frequent field measurements in river islands before and after flood disasters, which are helpful for flood warning. This paper focuses on the temporal change of three river islands called Fenghuangzhou, Changshazhou, and one uninhabited island in the Yangtze River in 2016. In this study, GF-1 (GaoFen-1) WFV (wide field view) data was used for our study owing to its fine spatial and temporal resolution. A simple NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) method was used for the river island mapping. Human checking was then performed to ensure mapping accuracy. We estimated the relationship between the area of river islands and measured water levels using four models. Furthermore, we mapped the spatial pattern of inundation risk of river islands. The results indicate a good ability of the GF-1 WFV data with a 16-m spatial resolution to characterize the variation of river islands and to study the association between flood disaster and river islands. A significantly negative but nonlinear relationship between the water level and the area of the river island was observed. We also found that the cubic function fits best among three models (R-2 > 0.8, P < 0.001). The maximum of the inundated area at the river island appeared in the rainy season on 8 July 2016 and the minimum occurred in the dry season on 28 December 2016, which is consistent with the water level measured by the hydrological station. Our results derived from GF-1 data can provide a useful reference for decision-making of flood warning, disaster assessment, and post-disaster reconstruction.

TI  - <i>A Priori</i> Surface Reflectance-Based Cloud Shadow Detection Algorithm for Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior knowledge of the background land surface reflectance (LSR) constitutes one of the most important factors affecting the precision of cloud shadow detection. To resolve this problem, a surface reflectance-based cloud shadow detection (SRCSD) algorithm is proposed for multitemporal Landsat images. Monthly surface reflectance data sets constructed from MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) were used to provide the background LSR for cloud shadow detection. Based on the background LSR, the possible variation in the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance for each clear pixel can be estimated using the radiative transfer equation under different atmospheric conditions. If a pixel has a smaller TOA reflectance than the minimum value of the possible range under clear conditions, it is identified as being shadow covered. One hundred and twenty-five Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager scenes covered by various surface types were selected to evaluate the feasibility of the algorithm. A validation using manual cloud shadow masks showed that the average producer's accuracy and user's accuracy were approximately 0.805 and 0.893, respectively. A comparison of the results of the SRCSD algorithm with those of an object-based cloud shadow detection algorithm (Fmask) recently developed for Landsat images revealed that SRCSD generally detects cloud shadows better than Fmask. The most significant improvement of the SRCSD algorithm is the better detection capability for thin and broken cloud shadows, and this algorithm can be extended to multiple types of satellite data after proper modification.

TI  - A New Cloud Detection Method Supported by GlobeLand30 Data Set
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of traditional threshold methods, uniform thresholds are used for cloud detection based on remote sensing images; however, due to complex surface structures and cloud conditions, such an approach is typically difficult to effectively implement for high-precision cloud detection. To solve this problem, a new cloud detection algorithm is proposed based on global land cover data. Specifically, a high spatial-resolution at 30-m Global Land Cover Data set with global coverage was employed as background data for image inversions, which further supported cloud detection in remote sensing images. Notably, threshold settings can be varied for different land cover types. Such an algorithm can effectively improve the accuracy of cloud pixel identification for thin and broken clouds, even over bright areas. Moreover, Landsat 5 data are used to perform cloud detection experiments based on this algorithm. The thresholds are considering land cover variations. The thresholds of land cover types spatiotemporally vary, such as vegetation, differed by latitude and over time. In addition, six common land cover types are selected for cloud detection experiments. Then, validations analyses are conducted through visual interpretation and the results indicated that the algorithm is capable of achieving a high cloud detection accuracy. Specifically, the overall RMSE of cloud cover is 4.44%, and the accuracies of cloud and clear-sky pixel identifications is 86.5% and 98.7%, respectively.

TI  - A landscape connectivity model to quantify contributions of heat sources and sinks in urban regions
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of landscape configuration on urban temperatures is always an important issue in landscape planning and mitigation of urban heat islands. However, landscape indices used in previous studies did not focus on thermal processes. We proposed a landscape source-sink distance (LSSD) index used to quantify the landscape connectivity and investigate its contribution to variations in land surface temperature (LST) in Beijing. Monthly LST was derived from MODIS remote sensing products in 2002 and 2012. Landscape composition and connectivity was calculated based on QuickBird and IKONOS images. The LSSD of each LST grid was calculated according to the accumulative shortest distance between green-impervious, water-impervious, and green-water types. The contributions of landscape composition and connectivity to variations in LST were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model. Heat sources and sinks were designated as having positive and negative effects on the LST, respectively. Results showed that (1) green spaces served as heat sinks both day and night. Water areas served as daytime heat sinks and nighttime heat sources; (2) the influence of green and water types on daytime LST varied in different months while their influence on nighttime LST was stable seasonally; and (3) a large distance between green and impervious land increased variations in day-night LST while a large distance for water-impervious connectivity might mitigate diurnal variations in LST. This study shows that landscape planners need to rationally use landscape connectivity among different landscape types and should focus on specific time and season for the effective mitigation of urban heating.

TI  - Calibration Changes to Terra MODIS Collection-5 Radiances for CERES Edition 4 Cloud Retrievals
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has revealed inconsistencies between the Collection 5 (C5) calibrations of certain channels common to the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODISs). To achieve consistency between the Terra and Aqua MODIS radiances used in the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) Edition 4 (Ed4) cloud property retrieval system, adjustments were developed and applied to the Terra C5 calibrations for channels 1-5, 7, 20, and 26. These calibration corrections, developed independently of those used for the later MODIS Collection 6 (C6), ranged from -3.0% for channel 5 to +4.3% for channel 26. For channel 20, the Terra C5 brightness temperatures were decreased nonlinearly by 0.55 K at 300-10 K or more at 220 K. The corrections were applied to the Terra C5 data for CERES Ed4 and resulted in Terra-Aqua radiance consistency that is as good as or better than that of the C6 data sets. The C5 adjustments led to more consistent Aqua and Terra cloud property retrievals than seen in the previous CERES edition. After Ed4 began processing, other calibration artifacts were found in some corrected channels and in some of the uncorrected thermal channels. Because no corrections were developed or applied for those artifacts, some anomalies or false trends could have been introduced into the Ed4 cloud property record. Thus, despite the much improved consistency achieved for the Terra and Aqua data sets in Ed4, the CERES Ed4 cloud property data sets should be used cautiously for cloud trend studies due to those remaining calibration artifacts.

TI  - Coastal wetland change detection using high spatial resolution KOMPSAT-2 imagery
T2  - TERRESTRIAL ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands store terrestrial carbon and conserve biodiversity, thus playing an essential ecological role. Reliable regional-scale assessments of wetland dynamics, such as analysis of land use and land cover (LULC), and coastal monitoring, provide important hydrographical and socio-geographical information. Remote sensing images, such as Earth Observation satellite data, are useful for examining temporal LULC changes and providing environmental monitoring data. This study presents a method of mapping and monitoring changes in coastal LULC using classified multispectral images acquired by the Korea Multi-Purpose Satellite-2 (KOMPSAT-2). Wetland changes are monitored in three different protected tidal flats areas on the coastal boundary of the Korean Peninsula with the Yellow Sea, for the period of 2008 - 2015. High overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient values for the accuracy assessment indicate the suitability of LULC classification using high spatial resolution KOMPSAT imagery, even when an unsupervised classification approach is adopted. The LULC maps were analyzed and evaluated using post-classification change detection methods. Results showed spatial decreases of 6 and 20% for mixed forest and wetlands in the Gyeonggi area, respectively, but no significant changes over time for Jeonbuk and Jeonnam. There was a 12% increase in developed areas for Gyeonggi but only 1.9 and 6% for Jeonbuk and Jeonnam, respectively. LULC change is thus easily identified through a pixel-based analysis of multispectral KOMPSAT-2 images over time. Such data are useful for environmental and policy managers when developing advanced coastal management strategies.

TI  - Axillary Nodal Evaluation in Elderly Breast Cancer Patients: Potential Effects on Treatment Decisions and Survival
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies suggest that surgical lymph node (LN) evaluation may be omitted in select elderly breast cancer patients as it may not influence adjuvant therapy decisions. To evaluate differences in adjuvant therapy receipt and overall survival (OS), we compared clinically node-negative (cN0) elderly patients who did and did not undergo axillary surgery.Patients aged >= 70 years in the National Cancer Database (2004-2014) with cT1-3, cN0 breast cancer were divided into two cohorts-those with surgical LN evaluation (one or more nodes removed) and those without (no nodes removed). Propensity scores were used to match patients based on age, year of diagnosis, tumor grade, cT stage, estrogen receptor status, and Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the effect of LN surgery on OS.Overall, 133,778 patients were matched, of whom 102,247 patients (76.4%) underwent nodal surgery. Patients undergoing nodal surgery were more likely to receive chemotherapy (pN1-3: 22.2%; pN0: 5.8%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 2.8%; p < 0.001), radiation (pN1-3: 49.7%; pN0: 47.5%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 26%; p < 0.001), and endocrine therapy (pN1-3: 72%; pN0: 58.5%; cN0-no nodal surgery: 46.5%; p < 0.001). After adjustment for known covariates, patients who did not undergo nodal surgery had a worse OS (hazard ratio 1.66, 95% confidence interval 1.61-1.70).For elderly cN0 breast cancer patients, axillary surgery was associated with higher rates of adjuvant therapy and improved OS. A selective approach to omitting nodal surgery should be considered in elderly patients with cN0 breast cancer as axillary staging may influence subsequent treatment decisions and long-term outcomes.

TI  - Mesoscale rainfall patterns observed around wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are dynamic components of the landscape, responding to local and upstream rainfall, river flow and groundwater variability, and to water management. At the same time, in regions of strong evaporative demand, wetlands can present very strong land surface heterogeneity to the atmosphere, driving marked gradients in sensible and latent heat fluxes. At certain times of year, wetlands can therefore potentially provide a land surface feedback on rainfall. Here we assess the influence of wetlands on rainfall across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Using a well-established multi-satellite based product of wetland extent with monthly temporal resolution, we find significant wetland coverage (>10%) occurs at some point in the 15-year dataset for about 22% of SSA. We analyse rainfall patterns in the vicinity of major wetlands using satellite data, and find a consistent signal across SSA of locally suppressed rainfall over the wetlands as compared to nearby drier areas. This signal contrasts with a simple atmospheric water balance perspective which would suggest increased rain in response to increased local evaporation. The observed signal is strongest during the afternoon and weakens overnight. Using cloud-top temperature data from the Sahel, we find that afternoon convective initiation is favoured close to wetlands, consistent with forcing by a thermally induced circulation from gradients in sensible heat fluxes. We also find that in this region, where the vast majority of rainfall is associated with remotely triggered Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCS), convection weakens when these systems pass over wetlands. From this study, we conclude that wetlands across the range of climate zones spanning SSA influence rainfall patterns locally, and where MCS are an important component of rainfall, this influence can extend over a larger region, associated with the tracks of long-lived MCS.

TI  - A 30-m landsat-derived cropland extent product of Australia and China using random forest machine learning algorithm on Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping high resolution (30-m or better) cropland extent over very large areas such as continents or large countries or regions accurately, precisely, repeatedly, and rapidly is of great importance for addressing the global food and water security challenges. Such cropland extent products capture individual farm fields, small or large, and are crucial for developing accurate higher-level cropland products such as cropping intensities, crop types, crop watering methods (irrigated or rainfed), crop productivity, and crop water productivity. It also brings many challenges that include handling massively large data volumes, computing power, and collecting resource intensive reference training and validation data over complex geographic and political boundaries. Thereby, this study developed a precise and accurate Landsat 30-m derived cropland extent product for two very important, distinct, diverse, and large countries: Australia and China. The study used of eight bands (blue, green, red, NIR, SWIR1, SWIR2, TIR1, and NDVI) of Landsat-8 every 16-day Operational Land Imager (OLI) data for the years 2013-2015. The classification was performed by using a pixel-based supervised random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm (MLA) executed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. Each band was time-composited over 4-6 time-periods over a year using median value for various agro-ecological zones (AEZs) of Australia and China. This resulted in a 32-48-layer mega-file data-cube (MFDC) for each of the AEZs. Reference training and validation data were gathered from: (a) field visits, (b) sub-meter to 5-m very high spatial resolution imagery (VHRI) data, and (c) ancillary sources such as from the National agriculture bureaus. Croplands versus non-croplands knowledge base for training the RF algorithm were derived from MFDC using 958 reference-training samples for Australia and 2130 reference-training samples for China. The resulting 30-m cropland extent product was assessed for accuracies using independent validation samples: 900 for Australia and 1972 for China. The 30-m cropland extent product of Australia showed an overall accuracy of 97.6% with a producer's accuracy of 98.8% (errors of omissions = 1.2%), and user's accuracy of 79% (errors of commissions = 21%) for the cropland class. For China, overall accuracies were 94% with a producer's accuracy of 80% (errors of omissions = 20%), and user's accuracy of 84.2% (errors of commissions = 15.8%) for cropland class. Total cropland areas of Australia were estimated as 35.1 million hectares and 165.2 million hectares for China. These estimates were higher by 8.6% for Australia and 3.9% for China when compared with the traditionally derived national statistics. The cropland extent product further demonstrated the ability to estimate sub-national cropland areas accurately by providing an R-2 value of 0.85 when compared with province-wise cropland areas of China. The study provides a paradigm-shift on how cropland maps are produced using multi-date remote sensing.

TI  - Spatiotemporal monitoring of surface motions using DInSAR techniques integrated with geological information: a case study of an iron mine in the Amazon region using TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Instabilities are extremely common in the iron open-pit mines located in the Carajas mineral province, the worldA ' s largest iron reserves located in the Brazilian Amazon. Due to deep excavations in rock products of low geomechanical quality, heavy precipitation, and blasting practices, mining operations in the area present surface displacements that potentially lead to slope instabilities with several risks (personnel, equipment, mining infrastructure, etc.). This paper presents the results related to the N5E mine based on DInSAR Time Series (DTS) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) using a temporal series of 33 StripMap TerraSAR-X (SM TSX) images, and geological information provided from a 3D photointerpretation of an SM TSX and Ultra-Fine RADARSAT-2 (UF RST) stereo-pair, calibrated with field data. Measurement point (DTS, PSI) results were compared with in situ geodetic survey information (total station/prism measurements) and showed good agreement indicating that most of the mine can be considered stable during the period of the TSX coverage. The highest accumulated displacements were spatially related to a thematic unit mapped as a landfill. For other sectors of the mine, lower deformation rates were related to photointerpreted lineaments related to the Carajas fault system suggesting that geological structures can play a key role in controlling some surface displacements. The investigation demonstrated that the strategy based on the use of DTS and PSI techniques integrated with geological data provided a synoptic view of the deformation process that affected the mine. The approach was relevant for ground displacements monitoring of the study area with DInSAR results compared with in situ geodetic measurements showing good statistical correlation.

TI  - A Geospatial Approach to Understand the Dynamics of Shifting Cultivation in Champhai District of Mizoram, North-East India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of crop-fallow rotation cycles of shifting cultivation has been poorly understood in northeastern part of the country although it is one of the major land use systems in the hilly states of this region. The present study was conducted to understand the dynamics of shifting cultivation through the use of Landsat time-series data from 1999 to 2016 in Champhai district of Mizoram. We mapped the current jhum fields and abandoned areas of each imagery of the study period and performed a post classification comparison to assess the crop-fallow rotation cycle/jhum cycle. The chrono-sequential change of slash and burn area over the past 17 years showed a decreasing trend with the greater part of the shifting cultivation area being occupied by 2nd year crop fields, covering 48.81% of total jhum land. On average, 114.46 km(2) area were annually slashed for current jhum, out of which 33.41% continued with current jhum 2nd year cropping and only 3.27% of jhumias continued with 3rd year cropping. The shifting cultivation patches were mostly confined to moderately steep slopes (15A degrees-30A degrees). East facing aspect was mostly preferred and North facing aspect was least preferred. During the study period, 10 years jhum cycle covered the maximum area followed by 9 years and 11 years jhum cycle. The end result of this study proved that the prevalent jhum cycle in Champhai district is 8-11 years with a fallow period of 6-9 years.

TI  - <i>NAMATJIRA</i>: BEYOND THE SCRIPT - VISUAL AND PERFORMATIVE AESTHETICS AS CONDUITS FOR THE COMMUNICATION OF WESTERN ARANDA ONTOLOGY
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN DRAMA STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the performative configuration and staging of a Western Aranda 'place to stand' in the inter-culturally produced biographical play Namatjira (2010-13; written by Scott Rankin with and for the Namatjira Family). The author leverages her comprehensive insight into the play's devising and production processes, garnered from extended co-locations and touring with the producing company Big hART. She explores how both verbal and visual expression combine in the play to articulate a culturally coded Western Aranda worldview, ontology (theory of being-in-the-world) and identity. The critical elucidation of the postmodern frameworks that dominate the written script is juxtaposed with an analysis of the visual aesthetics of the play, which convey a distinctly Western Aranda perspective on Country, place-making and holding. The performative influence of these aesthetics is then illustrated in a comparison of three different stagings of Namatjira: a 'default' metropolitan staging; a full-scale open-air production for community on Country in the Hermannsburg Historic Precinct in 2012; and a staged play-reading at Parramatta Riverside Theatres in 2018 that aptly confirmed the significant bearing of visuality on the overall assertion of an Indigenous 'place to stand' in Namatjira.

TI  - A Novel Index for Impervious Surface Area Mapping: Development and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The distribution and dynamic changes in impervious surface areas (ISAs) are crucial to understanding urbanization and its impact on urban heat islands, earth surface energy balance, hydrological cycles, and biodiversity. Remotely sensed data play an essential role in ISA mapping, and numerous methods have been developed and successfully applied for ISA extraction. However, the heterogeneity of ISA spectra and the high similarity of the spectra between ISA and soil have not been effectively addressed. In this study, we selected data from the US Geological Survey (USGS) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spectral libraries as samples and used blue and near-infrared bands as characteristic bands based on spectral analysis to propose a novel index, the perpendicular impervious surface index (PISI). Landsat 8 operational land imager data in four provincial capital cities of China (Wuhan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, and Xining) were selected as test data to examine the performance of the proposed PISI in four different environments. Threshold analysis results show that there is a significant positive correlation between PISI and the proportion of ISA, and threshold can be adjusted according to different needs with different accuracy. Furthermore, comparative analyses, which involved separability analysis and extraction precision analysis, were conducted among PISI, biophysical composition index (BCI), and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). Results indicate that PISI is more accurate and has better separability for ISA and soil as well as ISA and vegetation in the ISA extraction than the BCI and NDBI under different conditions. The accuracy of PISI in the four cities is 94.13%, 96.50%, 89.51%, and 93.46% respectively, while BCI and NDBI showed accuracy of 77.53%, 93.49%, 78.02%, and 84.03% and 58.25%, 57.53%, 77.77%, and 64.83%, respectively. In general, the proposed PISI is a convenient index to extract ISA with higher accuracy and better separability for ISA and soil as well as ISA and vegetation. Meanwhile, as PISI only uses blue and near-infrared bands, it can be used in a wider variety of remote sensing images.

TI  - Classification of hyperspectral images via weighted spatial correlation representation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Superpixel segmentation has been widely applied in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. In this letter, a weighted spatial correlation representation (WSCR) method for HSI classification is proposed where an effective metric spatial correlation representation (SCR) that measures the correlation coefficient (CC) among different pixels in the superpixels is described, which fully utilizes the spatial information and structural features of superpixels. In addition, considering that the contribution of each SCR is different, the Gaussian weighted is considered. The proposed method includes the following steps: First, a super pixels image is obtained from HSI based on the entropy rate superpixel (ERS) algorithm. Second, the WSCRs for the training and test samples are calculated. Then, a joint sparse representation (JSR) classification is used to obtain the representation residuals of different pixels. Finally, the class label of each pixel is determined by the defined decision function that combines the WSCR and JSR. Experimental results obtained on two real HSI datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods compared to other widely used methods in terms of classification accuracy.

TI  - Coseismic Deformation Field of the M<sub>w</sub> 7.3 12 November 2017 Sarpol-e Zahab (Iran) Earthquake: A Decoupling Horizon in the Northern Zagros Mountains Inferred from InSAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of crustal deformation fields caused by earthquakes is important for a better understanding of seismic hazard and growth of geological structures in tectonically active areas. In this study, we present, using interferometric measurements constructed from Sentinel-1 Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan (TOPS) data and ALOS-2 ScanSAR, coseismic deformation and source model of the M-w 7.3, 12 November 2017 earthquake that hit northwest of the Zagros Mountains in the region between Iran-Iraq border. This was one of the strongest seismic events to hit this region in the past century, and it resulted in an uplift area of about 3500 km(2) between the High Zagros Fault (HZF) and Mountain Front Fault (MFF) with a maximum amount of 70 cm south of Miringe fault. A subsidence over an area of 1200 km(2) with a maximum amount of 35 cm occurred near Vanisar village at the hanging wall of the HZF. Bayesian inversion of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations suggests a source model at a depth between 14 and 20 km that is consistent with the existence of a decoupling horizon southwest edge of the northern portion of the Zagros Mountains near the MFF. Moreover, we present evidence for a number of coseismically induced rockslides and landslides, the majority of them which occurred along or close to pre-existing faults, causing decorrelation in differential interferograms. Exploiting the offset-tracking technique, we estimated surface motion by up to 34 and 10 m in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively, due to lateral spreading on a big coseismic-induced landslide near Mela-Kabod. Field observations also revealed several zones of en echelon fractures and crack zones developed along a pre-existing fault passing through Qasr-e Shirin City, which exhibited secondary surface slip by up to 14 cm along its strike.

TI  - Synergistic Use of Radar Sentinel-1 and Optical Sentinel-2 Imagery for Crop Mapping: A Case Study for Belgium
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely inventory of agricultural areas and crop types is an essential requirement for ensuring global food security and allowing early crop monitoring practices. Satellite remote sensing has proven to be an increasingly more reliable tool to identify crop types. With the Copernicus program and its Sentinel satellites, a growing source of satellite remote sensing data is publicly available at no charge. Here, we used joint Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical imagery to create a crop map for Belgium. To ensure homogenous radar and optical inputs across the country, Sentinel-1 12-day backscatter mosaics were created after incidence angle normalization, and Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images were smoothed to yield 10-daily cloud-free mosaics. An optimized random forest classifier predicted the eight crop types with a maximum accuracy of 82% and a kappa coefficient of 0.77. We found that a combination of radar and optical imagery always outperformed a classification based on single-sensor inputs, and that classification performance increased throughout the season until July, when differences between crop types were largest. Furthermore, we showed that the concept of classification confidence derived from the random forest classifier provided insight into the reliability of the predicted class for each pixel, clearly showing that parcel borders have a lower classification confidence. We concluded that the synergistic use of radar and optical data for crop classification led to richer information increasing classification accuracies compared to optical-only classification. Further work should focus on object-level classification and crop monitoring to exploit the rich potential of combined radar and optical observations.

TI  - Atmospheric correction of metre-scale optical satellite data for inland and coastal water applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new atmospheric correction (AC) method for aquatic application of metre-scale resolution (MR) optical satellite imagery is presented in this article, and demonstrated using images from the Pleiades constellation. MR satellites are typically operated privately and imagery can be costly. However in recent years, the price of individual acquisitions has dropped and their revisit times have improved, making them promising tools for remote sensing of inland and coastal waters. Due to the spatial resolution requirements of these satellites, the bands on the sensors are relatively wide (60-140 nm on Pleiades) in order to achieve an acceptable signal to noise ratio. This bandwidth and the limited number of bands can pose problems for the AC as the water signal may not be negligible in any band, especially over turbid waters. Since the MR sensors have a relatively narrow swath (20 km for Pleiades) the atmosphere can generally be assumed to be homogeneous over a scene or subscene. This assumption allows the atmospheric path reflectance (rho(path)) to be estimated from multiple targets in the scene, which are selected according to the lowest observed top-of-atmosphere reflectances (rho(TO)(A)) in all bands. Rather than using pre-defined "dark" bands (e.g. in the NIR and SWIR) such as is common in other water-focused AC methods, the best band is selected automatically, i.e. the one yielding the lowest rho(path). This criterion avoids unrealistic negative ("overcorrected") reflectances after the AC. Furthermore, for inland waters the NIR bands are usually affected by scattering from adjacent land and vegetation pixels, resulting in unrealistic rho(path) when used in the AC. The spatial resolution of the sensors is used as an advantage here, since ground-level object shadows (e.g. from trees and buildings) can be spatially resolved and are usually the pixels selected by the automated procedure for the determination of rho(path). In fact, it is proposed that using these shadow pixels gives better performance than using any kind of water pixel for these broad-band MR sensors. The method is demonstrated using several Pleiades images, showing good performance in retrieval of the aerosol optical thickness (tau(a)) for an urban (Brussels) and a coastal (Zeebrugge) site. Match-ups with water reflectances measured at the Zeebrugge AERONET-OC station show promising performance, although there is a significant spectral mismatch between the bands on the satellites and the CIMEL radiometer. Pleiades imagery of Zeebrugge reveals a turbid wake associated with the MOW1 measurement station, which opens perspectives of using MR satellites for the characterisation of monitoring and validation sites. Future work includes the application to other MR satellites (e.g. WorldView) and the evaluation for mass processing of open access high resolution (10-60 m) satellite data from Landsat and Sentinel-2.

TI  - Parasites in two coexisting bivalves of the Patagonia coast, southwestern Atlantic Ocean: The Puelche oyster (<i>Ostrea puelchana</i>) and false oyster (<i>Pododesmus rudis</i>)
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the parasites of two coexisting bivalves, the edible Puelche oyster (Ostrea puelchana) and the false oyster (Pododesmus rudis) that lives attached to O. puelchana shells, and to investigate their host specificity. Samples from wild populations, 465 O. puelchana and 131 P. rudis, were collected seasonally during two years in the San Jose Gulf (northern Patagonia, Argentina) and were processed using standard histological techniques. To increase the natural low prevalences of Boncunia spp. and Perkinsus spp. that are present in wild populations, an in situ experiment was performed by maintaining captive sentinel bivalves at high densities inside a plastic mesh bag to enhance parasite transmission. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were used to test for apparent Bonamia sp. infections among captive sentinel O. puelchana specimens (n = 80), and Ray's fluid thioglycollate medium (RFTM) assays and histological immunoassays tested for apparent Perkinsus sp. infections among captive sentinel P. rudis specimens (n = 100). Despite histological observations that revealed the presence of microcells resembling Bonamia sp. infecting hemocytes of some Puelche oysters, PCR assays did not confirm that parasite identification. Among captive sentinel P. rudis that showed histological evidence of Perkinsus sp. infections, neither RFTM nor immunoassays confirmed such parasites. Ostrea puelchana from wild populations were occasional hosts for both Rickettsia-like organism (RLOs) and Urastoma-like turbellarians. In contrast, six parasite taxa infected P. rudis from coexisting populations, including RLOs, Urastoma-like turbellarians, an intracellular gregarine species, Nematopsis-like oocysts, an unidentified coccidian and a Perkinsus qugwadi-like protozoan. These results demonstrated specific infection patterns of the identified parasites in relation to their hosts.

TI  - Vegetation changes and formation of small-scale urban heat islands in three populated districts of Kerala State, India
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, more than half of the world's population is living in cities. Rapid and unplanned urbanization became a common scenario in rapidly developing countries such as those in Asia. Decline in vegetation coverage and increase in local air and land surface temperatures are among the adverse effects of unplanned urban growth. We used Landsat data for the period 1991-2017 to estimate the expansion of urban areas in terms of vegetation loss and the development of small-scale urban heat islands in developing cities in Kerala state of India. For the last 27 years, unplanned urbanization in Kerala state has increased and this resulted in the enhanced loss of vegetation and, possibly, resulted in the increase in land surface temperature (LST). Our results indicate that vegetation coverage, particularly near the urban areas, has been decreased by 5.8%, 10.4%, and 9.6% in Ernakulam, Trichur, and Kozhikode districts, respectively. The land surface temperatures also have been increased during the study period. It is interesting to note that higher increase in LST and higher reduction in vegetation coverage were observed in Trichur and Kozhikode districts compared with highly populated and urbanized Ernakulam district.

TI  - Prevalence of cognitive impairment in Spain: The Gomez de Caso study in health sentinel networks
T2  - NEUROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Cognitive impairment, a clinical entity causing complete or partial intellectual dysfunction, is a major public health concern that poses a challenge for health and social services. The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of this disorder in people aged 65 and older visiting the primary care physician in 5 health sentinel networks.Method: A sample of patients visiting their primary care doctor on 4 randomly selected days completed the Mini-Cog screening test. Diagnosis of cognitive impairment was confirmed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Alzheimer's Questionnaire. We estimated raw and adjusted rates using demographic and social variables.Results: We included 4,624 patients from 5 autonomous communities and representing a population of 1,723,216 inhabitants. The adjusted prevalence rate was 18.5% (95% CI 17.3-19.7], with differences between sentinel networks. Women showed higher adjusted rates than men: 18.5 vs. 14.3%. The highest prevalence rate was observed in people aged 85 and older (45.3%); prevalence rates vary depending on education level and marital status.Conclusions: Cognitive impairment is a frequent reason for consultations in primary care. Its prevalence is higher in women and increases exponentially with age. A number of sensitive, validated tools have been proven useful in screening for and confirming cognitive impairment. Using these tools in primary care settings enables early treatment of these patients. (c) 2016 Sociedad Espanola de Neurologia. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

TI  - Gamma probe and ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the sentinel node (GULF) trial
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeSentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was introduced as a minimally invasive technique for nodal staging. Since associated morbidity is not negligible, it is highly relevant to pursue a more minimally invasive alternative. The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate the sensitivity of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) with combined gamma probe and ultrasound (US) guidance in comparison with the gold standard histology of the sentinel node (SN) after SLNB for detecting metastasis.MethodsThe study was designed as a prospective, multicentre, open-label, single-arm trial enrolling patients with newly diagnosed cutaneous melanoma or breast cancer between May 2015 and August 2017. Sample radioactivity was measured using a Mini 900 scintillation monitor. After FNAC, all patients underwent SLNB. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were estimated.ResultsAccrual was terminated early following an unplanned interim analysis indicating that a FNAC sensitivity of at least 80% could not be achieved. In total 58 patients of the originally planned 116 patients underwent FNAC with gamma probe and US guidance. There were no true-positive FNAC results, 14 false-negative results and one false-positive result, and thus the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of FNAC were 0%, 98%, 0% and 75%, respectively. At least 75% of the FNAC samples had a radioactivity signal higher than the background signal.ConclusionFNAC with gamma probe and US guidance is not able to correctly detect metastases in the SN and is therefore not able to replace SLNB. Gamma probe-guided US is a highly accurate method for correctly identifying the SN, which offers possibilities for future research.

TI  - Evaluation of a comprehensive, integrated, medical service-based pharmacy practice model
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CLINICAL PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposePrior to 2008, the pharmacy practice model utilized by the University of North Carolina (UNC) Medical Center was a traditional central pharmacist and clinical specialist model. The department of pharmacy implemented a unique and innovative pharmacy practice model in 2008 organized around medical services. Through this medical service-based model, all patients are now covered by a pharmacist. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the sustainability of the improvements associated with the medical service-based pharmacy practice model at UNC Medical Center, which included pharmacist turnover, employee satisfaction and workforce engagement, resident and student involvement in patient care, and inpatient drug costs. MethodsThis retrospective analysis focused on data spanning fiscal year (FY) 2004 to 2016. Internal data reporting sources were analyzed to evaluate the outcomes of this practice model. ResultsIn FY 2016, 67% of work groups were tier 1 (highest satisfaction tier) and 4% were tier 3 (lowest satisfaction tier) and inpatient pharmacist turnover rate was only 7% compared with a 17% hospital turnover rate. Prior to 2008, the average difference between actual and expected drug expenditures was $2.8 million per year, and post-implementation, the average difference improved to $3.3 million per year. In FY 2017, the department had 35 residents, representing a 169% increase in number of residency positions available compared with FY 2008. In FY 2016, 134 months of early immersion experiences were offered, 29 months of Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs), and 417 months of Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs), which represents a 263% increase in IPPE months and a 369% increase in APPE months from FY 2008. ConclusionThis practice model, along with other factors, has had a continued sustained positive impact on employee engagement, inpatient drug costs, and patient care in our health system. In addition, this practice model is organized around pharmacist responsibilities that support continued growth of pharmacy learners.

TI  - Assessing macrophyte seasonal dynamics using dense time series of medium resolution satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The improved spatial and temporal resolution of latest-generation Earth Observation missions, such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, has increased the potential of remote sensing for mapping land surface phenology in inland water systems.The ability of a time series of medium-resolution satellite data to generate quantitative information on macrophyte phenology was examined, focusing on three temperate shallow lakes with connected wetlands in Italy, France, and Romania.Leaf area index (LAI) maps for floating and emergent macrophyte growth forms were derived from a semiempirical regression model based on the best-performing spectral index, with an error level of 0.11 m(2) m(-2). Phenology metrics were computed from LAI time series using TIMESAT to analyze the seasonal dynamics of macrophyte spatial distribution patterns and species-dependent variability. Particular seasonal patterns seen in the autochthonous and allochthonous species across the three study areas related to local ecological and hydrological conditions.How characteristics of the satellite dataset (cloud cover threshold, temporal resolution, and missing acquisitions) influenced the phenology metrics obtained was also assessed. Our results indicate that, with a full-resolution time series (5-day revisit time), cloud cover introduced a bias in the phenology metrics of less than 2 days. Even when the temporal resolution was reduced to 15 days (like the Landsat revisit time) the timing of the start and the peak of macrophyte growth could still be mapped with an error of no more than 2-3 days.

TI  - Hydrodynamic simulation of a cloudburst event in Asi Ganga Valley of Indian Himalayan region using MIKE11 and GIS techniques
T2  - MAUSAM
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloudburst is one of the most devastating and frequently occurring natural hazardous events in Indian Himalayan region. Localized deep cumulus convective clouds have a capability of giving enormous amount of rainfall over a limited horizontal area, within a short span of time. Whenever, such events occur, lead to flash floods causing landslides, house collapses, dislocation of traffic and human casualties on a large scale. Therefore, it is necessary to predict the cloudburst inundation zones accurately to avoid damage associated with them. For this, high resolution Digital Elevation Model generated from CartoSat-1 (Stereo pair) were integrated in MIKE 11 Hydrodynamic 1D model to generate longitudinal profile of the study area and to find water level, peak discharge, flow velocity, flow width at different reaches along the Asi ganga and Bhagirathi river, to know the Cloudburst flood inundation scenario. On 3rd August, 2012 one of the major Cloudburst event occurred in Asi Ganga Valley in Indian Himalayan region which was considered for simulation of hydrodynamic model. For a Cloudburst event, 100 mm/hr rainfall was considered for the simulation of the hydrodynamic model. It is observed that the discharge rise from 50 m(3)/s to 549.164 m(3)/s (an abrupt increase of about 10 times) within 1 hr at Sangamchetty in Asi Ganga river and at Joshiyara area rise from 600 m(3)/s to 3378.69 m(3)/s (an abrupt increase of about 5 times) within 4 hr in Bhagirathi river. Similarly, the water level rises around 3 m and 6 m in Asi Ganga and Bhagirathi rivers respectively. Flash Flood inundation areas due to Cloudburst on 3rd August, 2012 were demarcated from the simulation results in GIS environment.

TI  - How much does multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data improve crop type classification?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 mission of the ESA's Copernicus programme is generating unprecedented volumes of data at high spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. The objective of this short communication is to assess the value of multi-temporal information for crop type classification using Sentinel-2 data. The analysis is carried out in an agricultural region in Austria and considers nine crop types during two years (2016 and 2017). To assess the impact of multi-temporal information, we applied a Random Forest (RF) classifier and analysed the results by using the RF out-of-bag error to calculate the overall accuracy (OA) and Fl score. The models were also validated using an independent reference dataset. Results show how the addition of multi-temporal information increases the crop type classification accuracy with similar trends for 2016 and 2017. At the very beginning of the crop growing season (March-April), the classification achieves relatively low accuracies (OA: similar to 0.50). Significant increases in OA can be obtained between May and June, until the OA reaches its highest value in July. The final RF model was able to predict with very high confidence nine crop types for both years (OA: 0.95-0.96 and Fl score: 0.83-1.00). The independent validation dataset with more than 5000 reference plots showed comparable results (OA: 91-95% and Fl score: 0.74-0.99). We conclude that the multi-temporal crop type classification efficiently mitigates negative effects observed when using single-date acquisition within sub-optimal temporal windows.

M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th Triennial World Melanoma Congress / 14th Annual Congress of the Society-for-Melanoma-Research (SMR)
CL  - Brisbane, AUSTRALIA
AB  - In the peripheral blood, the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) change in response to malignancy. These biomarkers are associated with adverse outcomes in numerous cancers, but the evidence is limited in relation to melanoma. This study sought to investigate the association between these biomarkers and survival in Stages I-III cutaneous melanoma.This multicenter cohort study investigated a consecutive series of patients who underwent wide excision of biopsy-proven cutaneous melanoma and sentinel lymph node biopsy during a 10-year period. The baseline NLR and PLR were calculated immediately before sentinel lymph node biopsy. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and melanoma-specific survival were generated.Overall, 1351 patients were included in the study. During surveillance, 184 of these patients died (14%), with 141 of the deaths (77%) attributable to melanoma. Worse overall survival was associated with a baseline NLR lower than 2.5 [HR 2.2; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0 to 2.3; p < 0.001] and a baseline PLR lower than 100 (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.7 to 1.8; p < 0.001). Melanoma-specific survival also was worse, with a baseline NLR lower than 2.5 (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.2; p < 0.001) and a baseline PLR lower than 100 (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.7 to 2.2; p < 0.001). The 5-year survival for patients with sentinel lymph node metastases and a low NLR and PLR was approximately 50%.This study provides important new data on biomarkers in early-stage melanoma, which contrast with biomarker profiles in advanced disease. These biomarkers may represent the host inflammatory response to melanoma and therefore could help select patients for adjuvant therapy and enhanced surveillance.

TI  - Mangrove Species Discrimination from Very High Resolution Imagery Using Gaussian Markov Random Field Model
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are the most productive ecosystem for tropical and subtropical flora, but they are experiencing serious loss. Urgent measures should be taken for conservation and restoration, including investigation of mangrove species constitution using satellite imagery in which texture provides effective information. However, differentiation by texture for various species of mangroves is underexplored. The Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) has proved to be a common approach to describing texture in most previous studies, while other textural measurements such as the Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) have seldom been tested and applied. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment and comparison of textures using GLCM and GMRF to offer a better understanding of their roles in mangrove species discrimination using very high-resolution satellite data. The experiments were designed to highlight two aspects of textural features - local pattern and textured region size - to assess their effect on mangrove species discrimination based on texture definition. The results indicated that adjusting the textured region size can easily improve texture extraction, and GMRF outperformed GLCM in texture representation of mangrove forest using the same parameters, with an increase in overall accuracy (1.54%, 6.47% and 10.66% on average at three different local pattern sizes).

TI  - Long-Term Surface Water Dynamics Analysis Based on Landsat Imagery and the Google Earth Engine Platform: A Case Study in the Middle Yangtze River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dynamics of surface water is of great significance to understand the impacts of global changes and human activities on water resources. Remote sensing provides many advantages in monitoring surface water; however, in large scale, the efficiency of traditional remote sensing methods is extremely low because these methods consume a high amount of manpower, storage, and computing resources. In this paper, we propose a new method for quickly determining what the annual maximal and minimal surface water extent is. The maximal and minimal water extent in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2017 in the Middle Yangtze River Basin in China were calculated on the Google Earth Engine platform. This approach takes full advantage of the data and computing advantages of the Google Earth Engine's cloud platform, processed 2343 scenes of Landsat images. Firstly, based on the estimated value of cloud cover for each pixel, the high cloud covered pixels were removed to eliminate the cloud interference and improve the calculation efficiency. Secondly, the annual greenest and wettest images were mosaiced based on vegetation index and surface water index, then the minimum and maximum surface water extents were obtained by the Random Forest Classification. Results showed that (1) the yearly minimal surface water extents were 14,751.23 km(2), 14,403.48 km(2), 13,601.48 km(2), and 15,697.42 km(2), in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. (2) The yearly maximal surface water extents were 18,174.76 km(2), 20,671.83 km(2), 19,097.73 km(2), and 18,235.95 km(2), in the year of 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2017, respectively. (3) The accuracies of surface water classification ranged from 86% to 93%. Additionally, the causes of these changes were analyzed. The accuracy evaluation and comparison with other research results show that this method is reliable, novel, and fast in terms of calculating the maximal and minimal surface water extent. In addition, the proposed method can easily be implemented in other regions worldwide.

TI  - Permafrost Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Multi-Temporal TerraSAR-X Data in Beiluhe of Northern Tibet, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change has significant impact on permafrost region in the Tibet Plateau. Soil moisture (SM) of permafrost is one of the most important factors influencing the energy flux, ecosystem, and hydrologic process. The objectives of this paper are to retrieve the permafrost SM using time-series SAR images, without the need of auxiliary survey data, and reveal its variation patterns. After analyzing the characteristics of time-series radar backscattering coefficients of different landcover types, a two-component SM retrieval model is proposed. For the alpine meadow area, a linear retrieving model is proposed using the TerraSAR-X time-series images based on the assumption that the lowest backscattering coefficient is measured when the soil moisture is at its wilting point and the highest backscattering coefficient represents the water-saturated soil state. For the alpine desert area, the surface roughness contribution is eliminated using the dual SAR images acquired in the winter season with different incidence angles when retrieving soil moisture from the radar signal. Before the model implementation, landcover types are classified based on their backscattering features. 22 TerraSAR-X images are used to derive the soil moisture in Beiluhe, Northern Tibet with different incidence angles. The results obtained from the proposed method have been validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements, thus obtaining RMSE and Bias of 0.062 cm(3)/cm(3) and 4.7%, respectively. The retrieved time-series SM maps of the study area point out the spatial and temporal SM variation patterns of various landcover types.

TI  - On board adaptation of temperature of the FY-4 meteorological satellite radiation imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4 is a geostationary three-axis stable platform meteorological satellite. The radiation imager loaded on it is affected by the dramatic daily and periodic changes of the external heat flow. The temperature of key components such as the scanning mechanism and the main optical system fluctuates over 40 degrees C per day. How the optical and supporting structures adapt to severe environmental temperature changes and ensure good image quality is an international problem in the design of remote sensing instrument systems for geostationary triaxial stabilization platforms. The matching design of various materials and the adoption of appropriate supporting structure forms are good strategies to avoid and reduce the deformation of the optical machine and the degradation of imaging quality caused by large temperature fluctuations. The on-orbit data indicates that the radiation imager overcomes the adverse effects of large temperature difference between day and night. The diffuse plaques of sensitive stars cover only one pixel, and the noon and midnight results are not much different.

The satellite-derived whitecap coverage data in the westerly wind zone is used to validate the improved theory. The comparison between the results from theory and observations displays a better performance from the improved theory relative to the other methods tested.

TI  - QUALITATIVE SURVEY OF A COASTAL REGION FROM A POLARIMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SYNTHETIC APERTURE RADAR IMAGES
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-TAIWAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study applied a time series of fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images using RADARSAT-2 to analyze the polarimetric responses of the west coast of Taiwan. A total of seven images were acquired from 2009 and 2012, covering the low, high, and similar tide levels. A four-component target decomposition algorithm was used to investigate the tidal effects and dynamic ocean interactions of sandbanks near the coast. The experimental results showed that the Yamaguchi four component decomposition can extract different features in the coastal area efficiently and effectively. From the target decomposition image constructed using the Yamaguchi four-component model, strong double-bounce scattering and weak volume scattering were favorable indicators of oyster farms, whether they were densely arranged or rugged, and surface scattering delineated the water boundaries of sandbanks. Using the extracted water boundaries and tidal-level information from different times, a sandbank elevation model was estimated. The experimental results also revealed that a small offshore sandbank had a displacement of approximately 1.5 km under a tidal level of -1.14 m. Furthermore, large sandbanks had a counterclockwise displacement on the west coast and moved eastward on the eastern coast.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that the state-of-the-art geometric calibration methods have a long update period and low efficiency, a real-time calibration method that applies the optical auto-collimation principle to on-orbit monitoring is proposed. By installing collimated light sources, area-array CCDs, prisms, and other devices inside the satellite load system, changes in the camera parameters are converted into changes in the spot images. By extracting and processing the spot images, the variation of the camera parameters can be solved to achieve a fast and efficient on-orbit monitoring. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified by building an experimental platform, and the monitoring accuracy of parameters in the pitch and roll directionsis are less than 1 '', and the measurement error is better than 0.1 ''.

TI  - Embedded GPU implementation of sensor correction for on-board real-time stream computing of high-resolution optical satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the data generation rate of high-resolution optical satellites is increasing rapidly, and this situation brings massive stress to the data downloading link and data processing system. To relieve downloading link stress and enhance the time efficiency of information acquisition, on-board processing needs to be introduced. Current on-board solutions are mostly based on digital signal processing and field-programmable gate array, which are obturated, lack flexibility, and are highly costly to implement. This paper takes sensor correction, the prerequisite geometric step of high-resolution optical satellite data processing, as an example, using a simulation prototype made of a double-module data parallel pipeline system based on NVIDIA embedded graphics processing unit platform, and proposes a feasible stream computing approach for low power consumption, flexible, and expandable on-board real-time processing. The experiments use a short strip of GaoFen-9 satellite data that contain 4.5 standard scenes to validate the performance and correctness of this approach. Compared to the same algorithms on the Dell PowerEdge T630 Server, the on-board version demonstrates an obvious performance advantage. When considering the contrast of power consumption for each platform, the advantage becomes even more significant. With statistics and analysis of experimental results, the timeline of processing demonstrates that this approach could meet the on-board real-time sensor correction requirement. And correctness is also verified by the root-mean-square error of pixel-by-pixel image comparison experiments.

TI  - Potential of texture metrics derived from high-resolution PLEIADES satellite data for quantifying aboveground carbon of <i>Kandelia candel</i> mangrove forests in Southeast China
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating accurate aboveground carbon (AGC) of mangrove forests is a challenging task owing to the complex canopy structure of mangroves and physiographic features. This study thoroughly assessed the potential ability of high-resolution PLEIADES texture metrics at different window sizes for quantifying AGC of mangrove forests in Jiulong River Estuary. Field measurements of AGC were obtained in 31 plots (10x10m), and the data ranged from 78.747 to 143.393 t C ha(-1), with an average of 102.233 t C ha(-1) per plot. Various possibilities were examined, including spectrals bands, band ratios and various types of texture metrics, and regression modeling was applied in a five-step framework. To ensure good performance of model during the calibration process, we determined coefficients of determination (R-2), p value of analysis of variance and root mean square errors (RMSE). Additionally, variable inflation factor was used to avoid the problem of multi-collinearity among the independent variables. Results showed that the spectral-based model only predicted AGC with an uncertainty (RMSE) of 9.14 t C ha(-1), and R-2 of 0.631. The texture-based model had a much better potential for AGC estimation with a higher R-2 value of 0.934, and a lower RMSE of 3.76 t C ha(-1). With increasing of window size for the texture calculations, the R-2 values increased and the RMSEs decreased. Additionally, we observed negative effects for AGC predictions, when spectral variables were added to texture variables during model development. Based on the calibrations, four texture-based models were selected and validated using another set of field data. Indicators including R-2, relative error, Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (E-NS), and RMSE were examined to measure for deviations between estimated and observed data. Model 7 with an R-2 value of 0.878 was finally chosen for relatively accurate quantification of AGC. The AGC values at a selected site derived from the model ranged from 1 to 153 t C ha(-1).

TI  - Estimation of chlorophyll a content in inland turbidity waters using WorldView-2 imagery: a case study of the Guanting Reservoir, Beijing, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex optical properties, such as non-pigment suspension and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), make it difficult to achieve accurate estimations of remotely sensed chlorophyll a (Chla) content of inland turbidity. Recent attempts have been made to estimate Chla based on red and near-infrared regions where non-pigment suspension and CDOM have little effect on water reflectance. The objective of this study is to validate the applicability of WV-2 imagery with existing effective estimation methods from MERIS when estimating Chla content in inland turbidity waters. The correlation analysis of measured Chla content and WV-2 imagery bands shows that the Chla sensitive bands of WV-2 are red edge, NIR 1, and NIR 2. The coastal band is designed for seawater Chla detection. However, the high correlation with turbidity data and low correlation with Chla made coastal band unsuitable for estimating Chla in inland waters. The high-resolution water body images were extracted by combining the spectral products (NDWI) with the spatial morphological products (sobel edge detection). The estimation results show that the accuracy of the single band and NDCI is not as good as the two-band method, three-band method, stepwise regression algorithm (SRA) and support vector machines (SVM). The SVM estimation accuracy was the highest with an R-2, RMSE, and URMSE of 0.8387, 0.4714, and 19.11%, respectively. This study demonstrates that the two-band and three-band methods are effective for estimating Chla in inland water for WV-2 imagery. As a high-precision estimation method, SVM has great potential for inland turbidity water Chla estimation.

CL  - Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space has important application in quantitative soil remote sensing inversion and drought monitoring, water resources management, such as soil water content, evapotranspiration. However, the study of its feature space construction method is still relatively lacking. In this study, we take the Oklahoma state of the United States as an example, the fitting method of the dry and wet edges of the land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space is carried out, and the linear and index, logarithm, polynomial, and power functions are used to fit the dry and wet edges, respectively, and the fitting results were evaluated by the measured soil water content data. We found that the results by polynomial function fitting, r-squared is the highest in the five fitting modes, and r-squared is more than 0.66 in the dry and wet edges of the feature space; and the water content of soil surface was compared with that of soil moisture content, and the root mean square error value is the smallest. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that the polynomial function fitting the dry and the wet edges is the best way to construct the land surface temperature/vegetation index feature space.

TI  - Rupture process of the 2015 Pishan earthquake from joint inversion of InSAR, teleseismic data and GPS
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake of M(w)6.4 occurred in Pishan County in Xinjiang Province, northwestern Tibetan Plateau, on July 3, 2015. The epicenter was located on an active blind thrust system located at the northern margin of the Western Kunlun Mountain Orogenic Belt southwest of the Tarim Basin. We constructed a shovel-shaped fault model based on the layered-crust model with reference to the seismic reflection profile, and obtained the rupture process of the earthquake from the joint inversion of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) measurements, far-field waveform data, and Global Positioning System (GPS) data. The results show that the seismic fault dips southward with a strike of 109 degrees, and the rupture direction was essentially northward. The fault plane rupture distribution is concentrated, with a maximum recorded slip of 73 cm. The main features of the fault are as follows: low inclination angle (25 degrees-10 degrees), thrust slip at a depth of 9-13 km, rupture propagation time of about 12 s, no significant slip in soft or hard sedimentary layers at 0-4 km depth and propagation from the initial rupture point to the surrounding area with no obvious directionality. The InSAR time-series analysis method is used to determine the deformation rate in the source region within 2 years after the earthquake, and the maximum value is similar to 17 mm yr(-1) in the radar line-of-sight direction. Obvious post-earthquake deformation is evident in the hanging wall, with a similar trend to the coseismic displacement field. These results suggest that the Pishan earthquake has not completely released the accumulated energy of the region, given that the multilayer fold structure above the blind fault is still in a process of slow uplift since the earthquake. Post-earthquake adjustment models and aftershock risk analysis require further study using more independent data.

TI  - Multi-Spectral Water Index (MuWI): A Native 10-m Multi-Spectral Water Index for Accurate Water Mapping on Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate water mapping depends largely on the water index. However, most previously widely-adopted water index methods are developed from 30-m resolution Landsat imagery, with low-albedo commission error (e.g., shadow misclassified as water) and threshold instability being identified as the primary issues. Besides, since the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectral band (band 11) on Sentinel-2 is 20 m spatial resolution, current SWIR-included water index methods usually produce water maps at 20 m resolution instead of the highest 10 m resolution of Sentinel-2 bands, which limits the ability of Sentinel-2 to detect surface water at finer scales. This study aims to develop a water index from Sentinel-2 that improves native resolution and accuracy of water mapping at the same time. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to exploit the 10-m spectral bands among Sentinel-2 bands of three resolutions (10-m; 20-m; 60-m). The new Multi-Spectral Water Index (MuWI), consisting of the complete version and the revised version (MuWI-C and MuWI-R), is designed as the combination of normalized differences for threshold stability. The proposed method is assessed on coincident Sentinel-2 and sub-meter images covering a variety of water types. When compared to previous water indexes, results show that both versions of MuWI enable to produce native 10-m resolution water maps with higher classification accuracies (p-value < 0.01). Commission and omission errors are also significantly reduced particularly in terms of shadow and sunglint. Consistent accuracy over complex water mapping scenarios is obtained by MuWI due to high threshold stability. Overall, the proposed MuWI method is applicable to accurate water mapping with improved spatial resolution and accuracy, which possibly facilitates water mapping and its related studies and applications on growing Sentinel-2 images.

TI  - Performance of fish-habitat classifiers based on derived predictors from a coupled biophysical model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fish habitat models based on remotely-sensed data may be limited by satellite coverage and availability. We compared the fit and predictive power of Random Forest habitat classifiers that were developed using predictors derived from a coupled biophysical model (i.e., modeled predictors) versus similar classifiers that used remotely-sensed satellite data for two data sets (eggs and adults) and four species that occur widely in the California Current system. When tested on independent data, classifiers of spawning habitat that used derived predictors (derived classifiers) had nearly identical accuracies (0-2% difference) to similar classifiers based on satellite data (satellite classifiers). Accuracies of derived classifiers of adult habitat were within - 8% to + 7% of comparable satellite classifiers. Accuracies of both types of classifiers on test data were much greater for Northern anchovy Engraulis mordax and Pacific hake Merluccius productus (0.75-0.97) than for jack mackerel Trachurus symmetricus and Pacific sardine Sardinops sagax (0.61-0.72), and generally were greater for classifiers of spawning habitat than for adult habitat. Specificity was very good for both types of classifiers, but sensitivity was poor, because classifiers identified potential habitat which was not fully occupied. Adults of all species used a broader range of habitat conditions during summer than during the spring spawning period. Derived classifiers have some advantages over satellite classifiers; they are not limited by cloud cover and they can make predictions in near real-time or the short-term future. However, there was no consistent improvement in the accuracy of derived predictors that included modeled zooplankton concentrations over comparable satellite classifiers that included reflectance/chlorophyll concentration.

TI  - Desertification Information Extraction Based on Feature Space Combinations on the Mongolian Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian plateau is a hotspot of global desertification because it is heavily affected by climate change, and has a large diversity of vegetation cover across various regions and seasons. Within this arid region, it is difficult to distinguish desertified land from other land cover types using low-quality vegetation information. To address this, we analyze both the effects and the applicability of different feature space models for the extraction of desertification information with the goal of finding appropriate approaches to extract desertification data on the Mongolian plateau. First, we used Landsat 8 remote sensing images to invert NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), MSAVI (modified soil adjusted vegetation index), TGSI (topsoil grain size index), and albedo (land surface albedo) data. Then, we constructed the feature space models of Albedo-NDVI, Albedo-MSAVI, and Albedo-TGSI, and compared their extraction accuracies. Our results show that the overall classification accuracies of the three models were 84.53%, 85.60%, and 88.27%, respectively, indicating that the three feature space models are feasible for extracting information relating to desertification on the Mongolian plateau. Further analysis indicates that the Albedo-NDVI model is suitable for areas with a high vegetation cover or a high forest ratio, whilst the Albedo-MSAVI model is suitable for areas with relatively low vegetation cover, and the Albedo-TGSI model is suitable for areas with extremely low vegetation cover, including the widely distributed Gobi Desert and other barren areas. This study provides a technical selection reference for the investigation of desertification of different zones on the Mongolian plateau.

TI  - Evaluation on dynamic change and interrelations of ecosystem services in a typical mountain-oasis-desert region
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the historical dynamics, interactions and driving factors of multiple ecosystem services (ES) is crucial to realize ES sustainability. The mountain-oasis-desert system (MODS) is a coupled socio-ecological system, and the Manas River Basin is a typical representative of the MODS and faces a sharp conflict between socioeconomic development and ecological conservation. Based on historical documents, meteorological data, hydrological data and remote sensing data, we identified long temporal variations (approximately 60 years) and relationships of eight ES in the study area. A gray relational analysis (GRA) was applied to quantify the influence of climate and anthropogenic factors on eight ES. The results showed, since the large-scale reclamation of the study area in 1949, that the provisioning services (i.e., grain, cotton and livestock) and most regulating services (i.e., sandstorm control and climate regulation) improved markedly, but the supporting services (i.e., soil conservation and habitats) had declined. The linear fit charts indicated the synergies between the provisioning services and most regulating services but tradeoffs between provisioning services and supporting services (especially the habitats service). The dramatic population growth and intensified human activities (e.g., large-scale reclamation and the deforestation) were the main drivers of most ES, while climate fluctuation (e.g., temperature and strong wind days) was the main factor affecting certain regulating services (e.g., hydrological regulation and sandstorm control). The declines in supporting services and ES tradeoffs caused by the intensified human activities threatened the sustainability of other ES and should attract close attention. Investigating the ES historical dynamic in the Manas River Basin can help us further understand the socio-ecological system development of the typical mountain-oasis-desert region and provide valuable information for ES management.

TI  - Confirmation of post-harvest spectral recovery from Landsat time series using measures of forest cover and height derived from airborne laser scanning data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series (LTS) enable the characterization of forest recovery post-disturbance over large areas; however, there is a gap in our current knowledge concerning the linkage between spectral measures of recovery derived from LTS and actual manifestations of forest structure in regenerating stands. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data provide useful measures of forest structure that can be used to corroborate spectral measures of forest recovery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a spectral index of recovery based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR): the years to recovery, or Y2R metric, as an indicator of the return of forest vegetation following forest harvest (clearcutting). The Y2R metric has previously been defined as the number of years required for a pixel to return to 80% of its pre-disturbance NBR (NBRpre) value. In this study, the Composite2Change (C2C) algorithm was used to generate a time series of gap-free, cloud-free Landsat surface reflectance composites (1985-2012), associated change metrics, and a spatially-explicit dataset of detected changes for an actively managed forest area in southern Finland (5.3 Mha). The overall accuracy of change detection, determined using independent validation data, was 89%. Areas of forest harvesting in 1991 were then used to evaluate the Y2R metric. Four alternative recovery scenarios were evaluated, representing variations in the spectral threshold used to define Y2R: 60%, 80%, and 100% of NBRpre, and a critical value of z (i.e. the year in which the pixel's NBR value is no longer significantly different from NBRpre). The Y2R for each scenario were classified into five groups: recovery within < 10 years, 10-13 years, 14-17 years, > 17 years, and not recovered. Measures of forest structure (canopy height and cover) were obtained from ALS data. Benchmarks for height (> 5 m) and canopy cover ( > 10%) were applied to each recovery scenario, and the percentage of pixels that attained both of these benchmarks for each recovery group, was determined for each Y2R scenario. Our results indicated that the Y2R metric using the 80% threshold provided the most realistic assessment of forest recovery: all pixels considered in our analysis were spectrally recovered within the analysis period, with 88.88% of recovered pixels attaining the benchmarks for both cover and height. Moreover, false positives (pixels that had recovered spectrally, but not structurally) and false negatives (pixels that had recovered structurally, but not spectrally) were minimized with the 80% threshold. This research demonstrates the efficacy of LTS-derived assessments of recovery, which can be spatially exhaustive and retrospective, providing important baseline data for forest monitoring.

TI  - Validating the use of MODIS time series for salinity assessment over agricultural soils in California, USA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Testing soil salinity assessment methodologies over different regions is important for future continental and global scale applications. A novel regional-scale soil salinity modeling approach using plant-performance metrics was proposed by Zhang et al. (2015) for farmland in the Yellow River Delta, China, a region with a humid continental/subtropical climate. The one-year integral of temporally interpolated MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series data was proposed as an explanatory variable for agricultural soil salinity modeling. Here, we test such a methodology in California's Central Valley, USA, a region with a semi-arid Mediterranean climate. Time series of EVI, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Canopy Response Salinity Index (CRSI) were created for the 2007-2013 period. Seventy-three MODIS pixels surveyed for 0-1.2-m soil salinity in 2013 were used as the ground-truth dataset. Our results validate the tested approach: the 2013 integral of CRSI (best performing index) had a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of -0.699 with salinity. Results obtained using temporally integrated data were almost always better than those obtained using individual data. Furthermore, we show that the methodology can be improved by the use of multi-year data. Further research is needed to improve spatial resolution and the selection of vegetation indices.

TI  - Intraoperative Injection of 99m-Tc Sulfur Colloid for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy: Can the Preoperative Injection Procedure be Eliminated?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) historically involves a separate appointment in the Radiology Department to undergo injection of the radiocolloid tracer (RT) the day of, or prior to, surgery, which can lead to disruptions in scheduling. Furthermore, the patient must endure an additional procedure. In a pilot study, intraoperative injection of the RT was previously shown to be equally as effective as preoperative injection. This study evaluates the efficacy of this method in a large cohort and examines factors associated with failure of the RT to reach the axilla.A retrospective review of patients who underwent SLNB between June 2010 and June 2017 was performed. All patients were injected immediately following intubation with sulfur colloid and blue dye, unless contraindicated. Operative records were reviewed to determine whether sentinel nodes were identified and if gamma counts were detected. Patient and tumor characteristics were examined to identify factors related to failed RT uptake in the axilla.In 7 years, 453 SLNBs were performed, with sentinel nodes being detected in 447 (98.7%) of these SLNBs. In the six cases where no nodes were detected, all had a prior ipsilateral axillary procedure. Sentinel nodes were undetectable with the gamma probe in 16 (3.5%) cases; a prior axillary procedure was the only statistically significant independent variable associated with this failure.Intraoperative injection of the RT is highly effective in the detection of sentinel nodes in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients. Eliminating the need for a preoperative injection of RT can avoid scheduling conflicts and decrease patient morbidity.

TI  - Surfzone State Estimation, with Applications to Quadcopter-Based Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A one-dimensional variational data assimilation (1DVar) method is presented based on the depth- and time-averaged alongshore-uniform surfzone wave and current equations, for simultaneous estimation of three uncertain variables: bathymetry, incident wave boundary conditions, and bed roughness. The method is validated using twin tests and in situ field observations, and its results are shown to be comparable to those of an existing ensemble-based bathymetry inversion technique. Unlike existing techniques, the ability to simultaneously estimate boundary conditions and bed roughness along with bathymetry also means the 1DVar method can produce full state estimates without the requirement for additional supporting measurements (e.g., direct measurements of the incident waves). A proof-of-concept field application is shown using observations collected from an unmanned quadcopter sensor package that measures surfzone wave height from a fixed-beam lidar range finder, and time-averaged longshore current from particle image velocimetry of drifting surface foam.

M3  - Article
AB  - The management of isolated in-breast tumor recurrence is complex, requiring careful consideration of prior local therapies to plan future multimodality treatment. Options for surgical management have evolved from standard salvage mastectomy with axillary clearance and now include repeat breast conservation with axillary staging in select patients. Reattempting sentinel lymph node biopsy may avoid the morbidity of extensive axillary surgery and has been shown to be feasible in clinically node-negative patients with oncologically safe outcomes. In the adjuvant setting, partial breast irradiation has emerged as a valuable means to improve local control rates with limited associated toxicity and acceptable overall cosmesis. Furthermore, results from prospective trials are now available to support the use of chemotherapy in hormone-receptor negative subgroups, which is associated with improvements in long-term, disease-free, and overall survival.

TI  - CO-RIP: A Riparian Vegetation and Corridor Extent Dataset for Colorado River Basin Streams and Rivers
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we present "CO-RIP", a novel spatial dataset delineating riparian corridors and riparian vegetation along large streams and rivers in the United States (US) portion of the Colorado River Basin. The consistent delineation of riparian areas across large areas using remote sensing has been a historically complicated process partially due to differing definitions in the scientific and management communities regarding what a "riparian corridor" or "riparian vegetation" represents. We use valley-bottoms to define the riparian corridor and establish a riparian vegetation definition interpretable from aerial imagery for efficient, consistent, and broad-scale mapping. Riparian vegetation presence and absence data were collected using a systematic, flexible image interpretation process applicable wherever high resolution imagery is available. We implemented a two-step approach using existing valley bottom delineation methods and random forests classification models that integrate Landsat spectral information to delineate riparian corridors and vegetation across the 12 ecoregions of the Colorado River Basin. Riparian vegetation model accuracy was generally strong (median kappa of 0.80), however it varied across ecoregions (kappa range of 0.42-0.90). We offer suggestions for improvement in our current image interpretation and modelling frameworks, particularly encouraging additional research in mapping riparian vegetation in moist coniferous forest and deep canyon environments. The CO-RIP dataset created through this research is publicly available and can be utilized in a wide range of ecological applications.

TI  - Intraoperative Touch Imprint Cytology in Targeted Axillary Dissection After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer Patients with Initial Axillary Metastasis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For breast cancer patients, a false-negative rate lower than 10% can be achieved if targeted axillary dissection (TAD) is performed, which includes the excision of both biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes (BxLNs) and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, little evidence exists on the accuracy of intraoperative touch imprint cytology (ITPC) applied in TAD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for breast cancer patients with initial axillary metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of ITPC in TAD after NAC.Breast cancer patients with biopsy-confirmed nodal metastasis were prospectively enrolled in the study. After completion of NAC, all patients underwent TAD followed by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Then ITPC was performed to evaluate BxLNs and SLNs. The accuracy of TAD and ITPC was calculated in comparison with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of ALNs. The results of ITPC during 6 months at our center in the adjuvant setting were used for comparison .Overall, the false-negative rate of TAD was 10.8%. In a test with 92 patients, ITPC had an accuracy of 92.4%, a sensitivity of 87.9%, and a specificity of 94.9%. In the non-NAC group, ITPC showed similar accuracy (91.2%) and specificity (97.9%) but significantly lower sensitivity (68.9%; P = 0.03).The use of ITPC was feasible for TAD among breast cancer patients with biopsy-confirmed axillary metastasis who were treated with NAC. All the misses in the ITPC involved patients with micrometastases or isolated tumor cells. Use of ITPC can help decrease the number of second operations for patients with residual disease in ALNs after NAC.

TI  - A Spectral-Temporal Patch-Based Missing Area Reconstruction for Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds, cloud shadows (CCS), and numerous other factors will cause a missing data problem in passive remote sensing images. A well-known reconstruction method is the selection of a similar pixel (with an additional clear reference image) from the remaining clear part of an image to replace the missing pixel. Due to the merit of filling the missing value using a pixel acquired on the same image with the same sensor and the same date, this method is suitable for time-series applications when a time-series profile-based similar measure is utilized for selecting the similar pixel. Since the similar pixel is independently selected, the improper reference pixel or various accuracies obtained by different land covers causes the problem of salt-and-pepper noise in the reconstructed part of an image. To overcome these problems, this paper presents a spectral-temporal patch (STP)-based missing area reconstruction method for time-series images. First, the STP, the pixels of which have similar spectral and temporal evolution characteristics, is extracted using multi-temporal image segmentation. However, some STP have Missing Observations (STPMO) in the time series, which should be reconstructed. Next, for an STPMO, the most similar STP is selected as the reference STP; then, the mean and standard deviation of the STPMO is predicted using a linear regression method with the reference STP. Finally, the textural information, which is denoted by the spatial configuration of color or intensities of neighboring pixels, is extracted from the clear temporal-adjacent STP and injected into the missing area to obtain synthetic cloud-free images. We performed an STP-based missing area reconstruction experiment in Jiangzhou, Chongzuo, Guangxi with time-series images acquired by wide field view (WFV) onboard Chinese Gao Fen 1 on 12 different dates. The results indicate that the proposed method can effectively recover the missing information without salt-and-pepper noise in the reconstructed area; also, the reconstructed part of the image is consistent with the clear part without a false edge. The results confirm that the spectral information from the remaining clear part of the same image and textural information from the temporal-adjacent image can create seamless time-series images.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Consistency of Four Gross Primary Production Products and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence in Response to Climate Extremes Across CONUS in 2012
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large spatial-scale effects of climate extremes on gross primary production (GPP), the largest terrestrial carbon flux, are highly uncertain even as these extremes increase in frequency and extent. Here we report the impacts of spring warming and summer drought in 2012 on GPP across the contiguous United States (CONUS) using estimates from four GPP models: Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM), MOD17A2H V006, Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach, and Simple Biosphere/Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach. VPM simulations are driven by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, North American Regional Reanalysis climate data, and C-3 and C-4 cropland maps from the United States Department of Agriculture Cropland Data Layer data set. Across 25 eddy covariance flux tower sites, GPP estimates from VPM (GPP(VPM)) showed better accuracy in terms of cross-site variability and interannual variability (R-2=0.84 and 0.46, respectively) when compared to MOD17 GPP. We further assessed the spatial and temporal (seasonal) consistency between GPP products and the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence over CONUS during 2008-2014. The results suggested that GPP(VPM) agrees best with solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence across space and time, capturing seasonal dynamics and interannual variations. Anomaly analyses showed that increased GPP during the spring compensated for the reduced GPP during the summer, resulting in near-neutral changes in annual GPP for the CONUS. This study demonstrates the importance of assessing the impacts of different types and timing of climate extremes on GPP and the need to improve light use efficiency models by incorporating C-3 and C-4 plant functional types.

TI  - Suppression of Azimuth Ambiguities in Spaceborne SAR Images Using Spectral Selection and Extrapolation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Azimuth ambiguity may introduce false targets into synthetic aperture radar images, particularly likely in inshore and oceanic observation. To suppress the azimuth ambiguities for any acquisition mode, a new model is developed to describe the impact of spatially variant azimuth antenna pattern weighting on azimuth ambiguities. By accurately estimating the ratio of ambiguous to main zone energy based on the model, the proposed algorithm selects the subspectra with less ambiguous disturbance, and adopts extrapolation with weighted energy measure to obtain a full spectrum. Due to spectral selection and extrapolation, the novel algorithm achieves superior performance in azimuth ambiguity suppression and resolution preservation, which is compared with the classical algorithm, and validated by applying TerraSAR-X and RADARSAT-2 images.

TI  - A National Assessment of Wetland Status and Trends for Canada's Forested Ecosystems Using 33 Years of Earth Observation Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are important globally for supplying clean water and unique habitat, and for storing vast amounts of carbon and nutrients. The geographic extent and state of wetlands vary over time and represent a dynamic land condition rather than a permanent land cover state. Herein, we combined a time series of land cover maps derived from Landsat data at 30-m resolution to inform on spatial and temporal changes to non-treed and treed wetland extents over Canada's forested ecosystems (>650 million ha) from 1984 to 2016. Overall, for the period, 1984 to 2016, we found the extent of wetlands (non-treed and treed combined) in Canada's forested ecosystems to be stable, with some regional variability, often resulting from offsetting decreases and increases within a given ecozone. Notwithstanding difficulties in using optical satellite data for mapping a land condition, by accumulating wetland evidence via earth observations consistently through multiple decades, our results capture the trends in wetland cover over a previously unmapped, national extent at a level of spatial detail and temporal reach suitable for further focused interpretations of wetlands and drivers and projections of wetland dynamics.

TI  - Extracellular vesicles in cancer - implications for future improvements in cancer care
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The sustained growth, invasion, and metastasis of cancer cells depend upon bidirectional cell-cell communication within complex tissue environments. Such communication predominantly involves the secretion of soluble factors by cancer cells and/or stromal cells within the tumour microenvironment (TME), although these cell types have also been shown to export membrane-encapsulated particles containing regulatory molecules that contribute to cell-cell communication. These particles are known as extracellular vesicles (EVs) and include species of exosomes and shed microvesicles. EVs carry molecules such as oncoproteins and oncopeptides, RNA species (for example, microRNAs, mRNAs, and long non-coding RNAs), lipids, and DNA fragments from donor to recipient cells, initiating profound phenotypic changes in the TME. Emerging evidence suggests that EVs have crucial roles in cancer development, including pre-metastatic niche formation and metastasis. Cancer cells are now recognized to secrete more EVs than their nonmalignant counterparts, and these particles can be isolated from bodily fluids. Thus, EVs have strong potential as blood-based or urine-based biomarkers for the diagnosis, prognostication, and surveillance of cancer. In this Review, we discuss the biophysical properties and physiological functions of EVs, particularly their pro-metastatic effects, and highlight the utility of EVs for the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.

TI  - <i>In vivo</i> Imaging of a Novel Strain of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> via Metabolic Labeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-toxigenic Bacteroides fragilis is regarded as a potential candidate for probiotic owing to its various advantages. We previously isolated a new strain of B. fragilis (ZY-312) and verified its biosafety and capability of inhibiting the growth of pathogens in vivo. However, the colonization of ZY-312 in gastrointestinal (GI) tract remains to be determined. To track the colonization of ZY-312, mice were gavaged with ZY-312 labeled by means of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry or given AF647-dibenzocyclooctyne (DIBO) directly. Then the fluorescence was detected in GI tract, spleen and kidneys. Results showed that ZY-312 could be labeled by metabolic oligosaccharide engineering, and the optimal incubation time with AF647-DIBO was 5 h in vitro. Following oral gavage with AF647-DIBO labeled ZY-312 or AF647-DIBO alone, mice were subjected to in vivo imaging and the fluorescence intensity was similar in both groups 3 h, 6 h, and 12 h post the gavage. The fluorescence of AF647-DIBO group disappeared 24 h post gavage which was probably due to the excretion via GI tract. While the fluorescence of AF647-DIBO labeled ZY-312 retained in the cecum for as long as 48 h. Immunofluorescence assay further confirmed that labeled ZY-312 transiently colonized not only in cecum but also in stomach, ileum and colon of mice 48 h post-gavage and that no massive accumulation of ZY-312 was detected in other organs such as kidneys and spleen. In conclusion, ZY-312 could transiently colonize in GI tract, mainly in cecum, for at least 48 h, and it hardly disseminate to other organs, which shed new light on the future development of B. fragilis as a probiotic product.

TI  - Evaluation of mineral dust aerosol optical depth and related components from the CHIMERE-DUST model using satellite remote sensing and ground-based observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosol optical depth (AOD) simulated by the CHIMERE-DUST model over North Africa during 2006-2008 was evaluated by the SeaWiFS Deep Blue satellite data and AERONET ground based remote sensing measurements. The simulations were conducted using two meteorological inputs, ECMWF and CFSR forecast data, downscaled by the WRF model. The two simulations generated similar AODs and PM10 surface concentrations, which are highly correlated to dust emissions. The comparison of the simulated daily value of AOD with the satellite data showed good correlations (0.6-0.8) between them. A slightly better correlation was achieved using WRF-CFSR data. The regression coefficients fluctuated around 1.0 in cold months and decreased in summer, with minimums in August. The biases had similar seasonal cycles. This is consistent with the comparison against AERONET hourly AOD data that the model underestimated AODs in warm months at most stations. The comparison of PM10 surface concentration and dry deposition also showed negative biases in warm months at stations in the Sahel. The significant underestimation of wet deposition was found in monsoon season due to the unrealistic simulation of mesoscale convective system. It indicates that the low dust emission in August is partly associated with cold pools generated by the convective precipitation. Frequent overestimations of AOD were found in the northwest mostly because of the high dust emission produced by the overestimated winds near the Atlas Mountains. The dust emissions resulted from the two simulations were similar in terms of intra annual variations but differed in terms of annul dust emission. The estimated annual emission using WRF-CFSR data could be about 200 Tg more than the estimation using WRF-ECMWF data.

TI  - A 3D convolutional neural network method for land cover classification using LiDAR and multi-temporal Landsat imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial landscape has complex three-dimensional (3D) features that are difficult to extract using traditional methods based on 2D representations. These methods often relegate such features to raster or metric-based (two-dimensional) representations based on Digital Surface Models (DSM) or Digital Elevation Models (DEM), and thus are not suitable for resolving morphological and intensity features for fine-scale land cover mapping. Small footprint LiDAR provides an ideal way for capturing these 3D features. This research develops a novel method of integrating airborne LiDAR derived features and multi-temporal Landsat images to classify land cover types. We tested our approach in Williamson County, Illinois, which has diverse and mixed landscape features. Specifically, our method applied a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to extract features from LiDAR point clouds by (1) creating an occupancy grid, an intensity grid at 1-meter resolution, and then (2) normalizing and incorporating data into the 3D CNN. The extracted features (e.g., morphological and intensity features) from the 3D CNN were finally combined with multi-temporal spectral data to enhance the performance of land cover classification based on a Support Vector Machine classifier. Visual interpretation from both hyper-resolution photos and point clouds was used for training and preparation of testing data. The classification results show that our method outperforms a traditional method by 2.65% (from 81.52% to 84.17%) when solely using LiDAR and 2.19% (from 90.20% to 92.57%) when combining all available imageries. We demonstrate that our method can effectively extract LiDAR features and improve fine-scale land cover mapping through fusion of complementary types of remote sensing data.

TI  - Assimilating multi-source remotely sensed data into a light use efficiency model for net primary productivity estimation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution satellite data are necessary for the retrieval of vegetation indexes, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), to be assimilated into the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model for net primary productivity (NPP) estimation, especially in the growing season. However, current remotely sensed data cannot accurately monitor vegetation changes at high spatiotemporal resolution. To consider both temporal and spatial information, spatiotemporal fusion models have been developed to obtain the temporal information from high temporal resolution data (e.g., MODIS) together with the spatial information from high spatial resolution data (e.g., Landsat). In this paper, synthetic NDVI images with the spatial resolution of Landsat data and the temporal resolution of MODIS data were first produced using spatiotemporal fusion models. Next, phenological features were extracted from synthetic NDVI time series data to improve land cover classification accuracy. Finally, we evaluated the approach of assimilating the synthetic NDVI and land cover classification map into the CASA model for synthetic NPP estimation. The results revealed that the accuracy of the synthetic NPP was better than NPP estimation from non-fusion NDVI data, and improving the land cover classification accuracy could improve the accuracy of the synthetic NPP estimation. Furthermore, the monthly synthetic NPP showed a significant exponential relationship with the temperature, rainfall, and solar radiation of the current and previous month.

TI  - Influence of Leaf Specular Reflection on Canopy Radiative Regime Using an Improved Version of the Stochastic Radiative Transfer Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interpreting remotely-sensed data requires realistic, but simple, models of radiative transfer that occurs within a vegetation canopy. In this paper, an improved version of the stochastic radiative transfer model (SRTM) is proposed by assuming that all photons that have not been specularly reflected enter the leaf interior. The contribution of leaf specular reflection is considered by modifying leaf scattering phase function using Fresnel reflectance. The canopy bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) estimated from this model is evaluated through comparisons with field-measured maize BRF. The result shows that accounting for leaf specular reflection can provide better performance than that when leaf specular reflection is neglected over a wide range of view zenith angles. The improved version of the SRTM is further adopted to investigate the influence of leaf specular reflection on the canopy radiative regime, with emphases on vertical profiles of mean radiation flux density, canopy absorptance, BRF, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). It is demonstrated that accounting for leaf specular reflection can increase leaf albedo, which consequently increases canopy mean upward/downward mean radiation flux density and canopy nadir BRF and decreases canopy absorptance and canopy nadir NDVI when leaf angles are spherically distributed. The influence is greater for downward/upward radiation flux densities and canopy nadir BRF than that for canopy absorptance and NDVI. The results provide knowledge of leaf specular reflection and canopy radiative regime, and are helpful for forward reflectance simulations and backward inversions. Moreover, polarization measurements are suggested for studies of leaf specular reflection, as leaf specular reflection is closely related to the canopy polarization.

TI  - Effects of precipitation and topography on vegetation recovery at landslide sites after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An important form of land degradation is that induced by landslides. Vegetation recovery at coseismic landslide sites not only plays an important role in reducing soil erosion and increasing land stability but also records the transformation of loose, exposed landslide surfaces into stable hillslopes during the post-seismic years. However, little is known about the vegetation recovery process or its influencing factors. In this study, we use the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset, Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 daily precipitation data, and a digital elevation model (DEM) to study the impacts of precipitation and topographic parameters on vegetation recovery after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. Our results reveal significant NDVI decreases during the 2008 earthquake and strong recovery in the following years at the coseismic landslide sites. We also found significant negative correlations between precipitation and derivative of the NDVI trend (NDVIDT) in 2010 and 2011 and significant positive correlations in 2009 and 2013 at the regional scale. These significant negative correlations indicate that precipitation may trigger landslides to remobilize, depressing the recovery of vegetation at coseismic landslide sites during the first few years following a major earthquake. The results further show that site-specific vegetation recovery is determined by topographic parameters at the local scale. In general, vegetation recovery is weaker at low elevations (<1,300m) and high elevations (>3,300m), and it is also weaker on gentler slopes (<35 degrees) than on steeper slopes (>35 degrees).

AB  - Channel selection experiments for the retrieval of temperature have been carried out using the data obtained by GIIRS (the hyperspectral vertical detector equipped on the FY-4A geostationary satellite). According to information capacity, using line-by-line radiative transfer model, channels are selected by step-by-step iterative method. Finally, sensitive channels using for retrieval of temperature profile are selected, 56 channels in global and 58 in FY-4A' s detection range. The selected channels have small correlation with each other, and they have higher information capacity, which can be used as the representative channel set for temperature profile retrieval research and data assimilation.

TI  - Classicism 2.0: The Vitality of Classicist Poetry Online in Contemporary China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF LITERARY STUDIES IN CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we examine the various approaches toward literary classicism among contemporary Chinese poets. If "poetry of the establishment" features ideological conservatism and aesthetic populism, then its opposite is the online scene of classicist poetry which represents an innovative continuation of the poetic tradition. Here such innovations are discussed in terms of theme, language, and form. Thematic innovations include further that of ideology, worldview, and urbanity. In particular, we argue that a major distinction between contemporary online classicist poets and their premodern predecessors is in their cultural identity. Unlike a traditional literatus who is a poet, scholar, and bureaucrat, contemporary poets often endure economic, intellectual, or political marginalization; or at the very least, writing in the marginalized genre of classicist poetry is a skill that can no longer be readily translated into career success. This new type of poetic identity, in addition to their modern education, has given rise to fresh interpretations of our living world unseen in premodern poetry. Despite their broad spectrum of intellectual persuasions and aesthetic preferences, most of the poets have demonstrated an audacity to experiment, which, coupled with full versatility and virtuosity in the classical poetry tradition, creates outstanding poems. The highly original works of a few leading classicist poets like Lizilizilizi (Zeng Shaoli), Xutang (Duan Xiaosong), and Dugu Shiroushou (Zeng Zheng) will be examined in depth.

TI  - Changes in land-use and ecosystem services in the Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, China from 1990 to 2010: Implications for sustainability under rapid urbanization
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is resulting in large-scale land-use conversion and the impact on ecosystem services value is a key issue for sustainability particularly in China a global urbanization hotspot. Impacts of land-use change on ecosystem services value in China have been varied, ranging from strong decreases to modest increases, suggesting that bespoke analyses are required to support local and regional planning for sustainability. We quantified land-use change and valued the impact on ecosystem services from 1990 to 2010 in the rapidly urbanizing Guangzhou-Foshan Metropolitan Area, southern China. We quantified land-use change from Landsat satellite imagery and calculated the value of ecosystem services using the well-established unit-value transfer method. Over one quarter of the study area changed land-use between 1990 and 2010 with Built-up, Orchard, and Waterbody land-uses expanding, and Cropland and Forestland contracting. However, the net decline in ecosystem services value was only 4.4% (US$201.5 million). This modest overall decline masked more complex and extreme dynamics in the value of individual ecosystem services. Substantial declines occurred in the value of gas regulation (US$115.4 million, -28%), soil formation and retention (US$90.5 million, -16%), and climate regulation (US$44.6 million, -8%), while waste treatment (US$68.5 million, + 10%) and recreation and culture (US$45.7 million, + 12%) increased in value. Decision analysis is required to support land-use planning to ensure the sustainability of ecosystem services for the wellbeing of the people of Guangzhou-Foshan and other rapidly urbanizing areas in China and globally.

TI  - Analysis of forty years long changes in coastal land use and land cover of the Yellow Sea: The gains or losses in ecosystem services
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The drastic land cover change and its impacts in the Yellow Sea have long been significant issues in terms of coastal vulnerabilities, but holistic data analysis is limited. The present study first reports 40 years long geographical changes of the Yellow Sea coasts including all three neighboring countries of China, North Korea, and South Korea. We delineated tidal flats by analysis of Landsat series satellite imageries (662 scenes) between 1981 and 2016. A total area of the Yellow Sea tidal flats has been considerably reducing for the past 36 years, from similar to 10,500 km(2) (1980s) to similar to 6700 km(2) (2010s), say similar to 1% annual loss. A majority loss of tidal flats was mainly due to the grand reclamations that conducted in almost entire coast of the Yellow Sea, particularly concentrated in the 1990s-2000s. Coastal reclaimed area during the past four decades reached similar to 9700 km(2), including ongoing and planned projects, which corresponds to over half the area of precedent natural tidal flats of the Yellow Sea. The potential carbon stocks in the eight representative regions with large scale reclamation indicated significant loss in carbon sink capacity in the South Korea's coast (similar to 99%), while evidenced a lesser loss from the China's coast (similar to 31%). It was noteworthy that the progradation of tidal flats after the reclamation in China's coast significantly reduced the loss of carbon sequestration. According to the ecosystem services valuation for the Yellow Sea, a total loss was estimated as similar to 8 billion USD yr(-1) with relatively high proportional loss (up to 25%) of climate regulating services (viz., carbon sequestration). Overall, huge losses in ecosystem services being provided by the Yellow Sea natural tidal flats need immediate action to prevent or at least alleviate accelerating ecological deteriorations. Finally, future conservative policy direction on coastal wetlands management has been proposed towards enhancement of marine ecosystem services. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Accelerating the image processing by the optimization strategy for deep learning algorithm DBN
T2  - EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, image processing especially for remote sensing technology has developed rapidly. In the field of remote sensing, the efficiency of processing remote sensing images has been a research hotspot in this field. However, the remote sensing data has some problems when processing by a distributed framework, such as Spark, and the key problems to improve execution efficiency are data skew and data reused. Therefore, in this paper, a parallel acceleration strategy based on a typical deep learning algorithm, deep belief network (DBN), is proposed to improve the execution efficiency of the DBN algorithm in Spark. First, the re-partition algorithm based on the tag set is proposed to the relief data skew problem. Second, the cache replacement algorithm on the basis of characteristics is proposed to automatic cache the frequently used resilient distributed dataset (RDD). By caching RDD, the re-computation time of frequently reused RDD is reduced, which lead to the decrease of total computation time of the job. The numerical and analysis verify the effectiveness of the strategy.

TI  - Sparsity-Based Spatiotemporal Fusion via Adaptive Multi-Band Constraints
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important means to monitor the dynamics of the earth surface. It is still challenging for single-sensor systems to provide spatially high resolution images with high revisit frequency because of the technological limitations. Spatiotemporal fusion is an effective approach to obtain remote sensing images high in both spatial and temporal resolutions. Though dictionary learning fusion methods appear to be promising for spatiotemporal fusion, they do not consider the structure similarity between spectral bands in the fusion task. To capitalize on the significance of this feature, a novel fusion model, named the adaptive multi-band constraints fusion model (AMCFM), is formulated to produce better fusion images in this paper. This model considers structure similarity between spectral bands and uses the edge information to improve the fusion results by adopting adaptive multi-band constraints. Moreover, to address the shortcomings of the norm which only considers the sparsity structure of dictionaries, our model uses the nuclear norm which balances sparsity and correlation by producing an appropriate coefficient in the reconstruction step. We perform experiments on real-life images to substantiate our conceptual augments. In the empirical study, the near-infrared (NIR), red and green bands of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are fused and the prediction accuracy is assessed by both metrics and visual effects. The experiments show that our proposed method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. It also sheds light on future research.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variability of warm rain events over southern West Africa from geostationary satellite observations for climate monitoring and model evaluation
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the spatio-temporal variability of warm rain events over southern West Africa (SWA) during the summer monsoon season for the first time, using Spinning Enhanced Visible Infrared Radiometer (SEVIRI) observations on the Meteosat geostationary satellites. The delineation of warm rain events is based on the principle that precipitating low-level clouds are associated with either sufficient water content or large cloud droplet size. Capitalising on the ability of space-borne radar to resolve vertical cloud structures and detect the presence of precipitation, the delineation is trained by collocated SEVIRI and CloudSat observations. The resulting 12 years of observations from SEVIRI are used to examine the spatial, diurnal, seasonal and interannual variability of warm rain events over SWA. Warm rain events predominate during the monsoon in August, with little interannual variability, and persist over orography in the morning and the coasts after midday, likely enhanced by orographic lifting and land-sea breeze effects. Warm clouds have a much higher probability of precipitation along the coastlines of Liberia and Nigeria compared to the central SWA coastline and further inland. Finally, when evaluating an 8-day yet high-spatial resolution model simulation, we find that warm rain frequencies from the simulation agree well with SEVIRI near the coast but simulated warm cloud cover and thus warm rain frequencies are too low over the Gulf of Guinea. The probability of precipitation of warm clouds is also too low inland. The newly developed observations of warm rain create opportunities to further investigate the diurnal cycle of warm rain, study aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions, and assess the role of warm rain in the water cycle across Africa and beyond.

TI  - Generic Atmospheric Correction Model for Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - For mapping Earth surface movements at larger scale and smaller amplitudes, many new synthetic aperture radar instruments (Sentinel-1A/B, Gaofen-3, ALOS-2) have been developed and launched from 2014-2017, and this trend is set to continue with Sentinel-1C/D, Gaofen-3B/C, RADARSAT Constellation planned for launch during 2018-2025. This poses more challenges for correcting interferograms for atmospheric effects since the spatial-temporal variations of tropospheric delay may dominate over large scales and completely mask the actual displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. To overcome this, we have developed a generic interferometric synthetic aperture radar atmospheric correction model whose notable features comprise (i) global coverage, (ii) all-weather, all-time useability, (iii) correction maps available in near real time, and (iv) indicators to assess the correction performance and feasibility. The model integrates operational high-resolution European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (0.125 degrees grid, 137 vertical levels, and 6-hr interval) and continuous GPS tropospheric delay estimates (every 5 min) using an iterative tropospheric decomposition model. The model's performance was tested using eight globally distributed Sentinel-1 interferograms, encompassing both flat and mountainous topographies, midlatitude and near polar regions, and monsoon and oceanic climate systems, achieving a phase standard deviation and displacement root-mean-square (RMS) of similar to 1 cm against GPS over wide regions (250 by 250 km). Indicators describing the model's performance including (i) GPS network and ECMWF cross RMS, (ii) phase versus estimated atmospheric delay correlations, (iii) ECMWF time differences, and (iv) topography variations were developed to provide quality control for subsequent automatic processing and provide insights of the confidence level with which the generated atmospheric correction maps may be applied.

TI  - Monitoring surface mining belts using multiple remote sensing datasets: A global perspective
T2  - ORE GEOLOGY REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the spatiotemporal change of land cover and understanding their ecological, environmental, and socioeconomic impacts are important for sustainable development. Surface mining by the minerals industry is one driver of the changes in land cover, leading to loss of natural vegetation and top soils, and interruption of ecosystem service flows. This study investigates the effectiveness of remote sensing datasets to identify and map land cover changes, with the specific goal of understanding the impact of surface mining activities on land cover globally from 1980s to 2013. Diverse remote sensing datasets with long term observations are analyzed, including high-resolution images in Google Earth, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM +)/Operational Land Imager (OLI), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Index (VI) product and Defense Meteorological Satellites Program (DMSP)/Operational Linescan System (OLS) stable night-time light. The results indicated that after entering 21st century, North America (e.g., the United States and Canada) was the only continent to have more surface mining spots categorized as Shrink type (rehabilitated) rather than Expand type. South America (e.g., Chile and Brazil) and Asia (e.g., India and China) had the highest proportions of Expand Type of surface mining spots. Detailed demonstrations on how those remote sensing datasets could help in mining spot monitoring are presented.

TI  - A new algorithm predicting the end of growth at five evergreen conifer forests based on nighttime temperature and the enhanced vegetation index
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of vegetation phenology (the start/end of growing season, SOS/EOS) is important to understand the feedbacks of vegetation to meteorological circumstances. Because the evergreen forests have limited change in greenness, there are relatively less study to predict evergreen conifer forests phenology, especially for EOS in autumn. Using 11-year (2000-2010) records of MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), together with gross primary production (GPP) and temperature data at five evergreen conifer forests flux sites in Canada, we comprehensively evaluated the performances of several variables in modeling flux-derived EOS. Results showed that neither NDVI nor EVI can be used to predict EOS as they had no significant correlation with ground observations. In comparison, temperature had a better predictive strength for EOS, and R-2 between EOS and mean temperature (T-mean), the maximum temperature (T-max, daytime temperature) and the minimum temperature (T-min, nighttime temperature) were 0.45 (RMSE = 5.1 days), 0.32 (RMSE = 5.7 days) and 0.58 (RMSE = 4.6 days), respectively. These results suggest an unreported role of nighttime temperature in regulating EOS of evergreen forests, in comparison with previous study showing leaf-out in spring by daytime temperature. Furthermore, we demonstrated that it may be because nighttime temperature has a higher relationship with soil temperature (T-s) (R-2 = 0.67, p < 0.05). We then developed a new model combining T-min and EVI, which improved EOS modeling greatly both for these five flux sites and also for data collected at nine PhenoCam sites. Our results imply that the accuracy of current remote sensing VI estimated EOS should be used cautiously. In particular, we revealed the usefulness of nighttime temperature in modeling EOS of evergreen forests, which may be of potential importance for future ecosystem models.

TI  - Practical Model of Sea Ice Thickness of Bohai Sea Based on MODIS Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice thickness is one of the most important input parameters in the studies on sea ice disaster prevention and mitigation. It is also the most important content in remote sensing monitoring of sea ice. In this study, a practical model of sea ice thickness (PMSIT) was proposed based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. In the proposed model, the MODIS data of the first band were used to estimate sea ice thickness and the difference between the second-band reflectance and the fifth-band reflectance in the MODIS data was calculated to obtain the difference attenuation index (DAI) of each pixel. The obtained DAI was used to estimate the integrated attenuation coefficient of the first band of the MODIS at the pixel level. Then the model was used to estimate sea ice thickness in the Bohai Sea with the MODIS data and then validated with the actual sea ice survey data. The validation results showed that the proposed model and corresponding parameterization scheme could largely avoid the estimation error of sea ice thickness caused by the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of sea ice extinction and allowed the error of 18.7% compared with the measured sea ice thickness.

TI  - Spatial analysis of dengue fever and exploration of its environmental and socio-economic risk factors using ordinary least squares: A case study in five districts of Guangzhou City, China, 2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Spatial patterns and environmental and socio-economic risk factors of dengue fever have been studied widely on a coarse scale; however, there are few such quantitative studies on a fine scale. There is a need to investigate these factors on a fine scale for dengue fever.Methods: In this study, a dataset of dengue fever cases and environmental and socio-economic factors was constructed at 1-km spatial resolution, in particular 'land types' (LT), obtained from the first high resolution remote sensing satellite launched from China (GF-1 satellite), and 'land surface temperature', obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Spatial analysis methods, including point density, average nearest neighbor, spatial autocorrelation, and hot spot analysis, were used to analyze spatial patterns of dengue fever. Spearman rank correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) were used to explore associated environmental and socio-economic risk factors of dengue fever in five districts of Guangzhou City, China in 2014.Results: Atotal of 30 553 dengue fevercaseswere reported in the districtsof Baiyun, Haizhu, Yuexiu, Liwan, and Tianhe of Guangzhou, China in 2014. Dengue fever cases showed strong seasonal variation. The cases from August to October accounted for 96.3% of the total cases in 2014. The top three districts for dengue fever morbidity were Baiyun (1.32%), Liwan (0.62%), and Haizhu (0.60%). Strong spatial clusters of dengue fever cases were observed. Areas of high density for dengue fever were located at the district junctions. The dengue fever outbreak was significantly correlated with LT, normalized difference water index (NDWI), land surface temperature of daytime (LSTD), land surface temperature of nighttime (LSTN), population density (PD), and gross domestic product (GDP) (correlation coefficients of 0.483, 0.456, 0.612, 0.699, 0.705, and 0.205, respectively). The OLS equation was built with dengue fever cases as the dependent variable and LT, LSTN, and PD as explanatoryvariables. The residuals were not spatiallyautocorrelated. The adjusted R-squared was 0.320.Conclusions: The findings of spatio-temporal patterns and risk factors of dengue fever canprovide scientific information for public health practitioners to formulate targeted, strategic plans and implement effective public health prevention and control measures.

TI  - On the geomagnetic secular variation in the Pacific region
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely believed that in the Pacific region the geomagnetic secular variation is low and that the non-dipole field is weak. This is also known as hemispherical asymmetry between the Pacific and the Atlantic hemispheres, representing the low secular variation in the Pacific hemisphere. With this characteristic feature, a question has been left unsolved whether it is a permanent feature or a transient one.Reexamination of the geomagnetic field for the past 400 years indicates that in the early 17th century the non-dipole field was not weak, nor the secular variation was low in the Pacific region, implying that the hemispherical asymmetry is not a permanent phenomenon. This paper examines the secular variation for the past 400 years from viewpoint of drifting and standing field model. It has been found that the low secular variation in the Pacific region is mainly caused by the drift of the drifting field. At the Earth's surface the drifting field is dominated by spherical harmonics Y-2(2) (theta, phi) with two pairs of ridges and troughs with their axes aligned in the meridional direction. The two pairs are not equal; one pair is stronger than the other. Movements of the different magnitude of the pairs are considered to have caused the hemispherical asymmetry of the secular variation for recent years, giving rise to the non-weak field in the Pacific region in the early 17th century.

AB  - Particulate matter with diameter less than 1 mu m (PM1) has been found to be closely associated with air quality, climate changes, and even adverse human health. However, a large gap in our knowledge concerning the large-scale distribution and variability of PM1 remains, which is expected to be bridged with advanced remote-sensing techniques. In this study, a hybrid model called principal component analysis-general regression neural network (PCA-GRNN) is developed to estimate hourly PM1 concentrations from Himawari-8 aerosol optical depth in combination with coincident ground-based PM1 measurements in China. Results indicate that the hourly estimated PM1 concentrations from satellite agree well with the measured values at national scale, with R-2 of 0.65, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 22.0 mu g/m(3) and mean absolute error (MAE) of 13.8 mu g/m(3). On daily and monthly time scales, R-2 increases to 0.70 and 0.81, respectively. Spatially, highly polluted regions of PM1 are largely located in the North China Plain and Northeast China, in accordance with the distribution of industrialisation and urbanisation. In terms of diurnal variability, PM1 concentration tends to peak in rush hours during the daytime. PM1 exhibits distinct seasonality with winter having the largest concentration (31.5 +/- 13.5 mu g/m(3)), largely due to peak combustion emissions. We further attempt to estimate PM2.5 and Photo with the proposed method and find that the accuracies of the proposed model for PM1 and PM2.5 estimation are significantly higher than that of PM10. Our findings suggest that geostationary data is one of the promising data to estimate fine particle concentration on large spatial scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Combined laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (less) and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) in gynaecologic oncology using conventional equipment
T2  - CLINICA E INVESTIGACION EN GINECOLOGIA Y OBSTETRICIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To describe and assess the feasibility of combining natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and laparoendoscopic single-site surgery in gynaecological cancer using only conventional laparoscopic equipment.Material and methods: A retrospective review of 30 patients with gynaecological cancer, managed by either laparoendoscopic single-site surgery or hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery technique, from June 2012 to June 2014. Only conventional trocars, grasping forceps and sealing devices were used, similar to multiport laparoscopic surgery.Results: Twenty-one (70%) patients were managed by umbilical laparoendoscopic single-site surgery, while 8 (30%) patients underwent a hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery. One patient underwent a double retroperitoneal and transperitoneal single-site approach. Hysterectomy was performed in 10 cases of endometrial cancer and 2 of cervical cancer, while hysterectomy plus pelvic lymphadenectomy or sentinel node biopsy was conducted in 6 cases of endometrial cancer. Hysterectomy plus pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in 3 patients with endometrial cancer. Transperitoneal pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy was conducted in one case for cervical cancer staging. Staging was also performed in 3 patients with borderline ovarian cancer and in 2 cases of infiltrating cervical carcinoma. Single-port laparoscopic debulking surgery was performed in the remaining 3 cases. Additional 5-mm ports were used in 5 (16.66%) cases to perform para-aortic lymphadenectomy, but no conversion to laparotomy was needed. There were no intraoperative complications, with minor postoperative complications observed in only 5 cases. There was one postoperative major complication: Heart failure in a 72-year-old female patient with clear cell endometrial cancer stage IAG3, who needed to be referred to the cardiology department during her hospitalisation.Conclusion: Combined laparoendoscopic single-site surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery is a safe and feasible procedure in the surgical treatment of gynaecological cancer.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Hourly PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using a Vertical-Humidity Correction Method from Himawari-AOD in Hebei
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 m (PM2.5) is related to various adverse health effects. Ground measurements can yield highly accurate PM2.5 concentrations but have certain limitations in the discussion of spatial-temporal variations in PM2.5. Satellite remote sensing can obtain continuous and long-term coverage data, and many previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between PM2.5 and AOD (aerosol optical depth) from theoretical analysis and observation. In this study, a new aerosol product with a high spatial-temporal resolution retrieved from the AHI (the Advance Himawari Imager) was obtained using a vertical-humidity correction method to estimate hourly PM2.5 concentrations in Hebei. The hygroscopic growth factor was fitted at each site (in a total of 137 matched sites). Meanwhile, assuming that there was little change in f(RH)at a certain scale, the neares f(RH)of each pixel was determined to calculate PM2.5 concentrations. Compared to the correlation between AOD and PM2.5, the relationship between the dry mass extinction efficiency obtained by vertical-humidity correction and the ground-measured PM2.5 significantly improved, with r coefficient values increasing from 0.19-0.47 to 0.61-0.76. The satellite-estimated hourly PM2.5 concentrations were consistent with the ground-measured PM2.5, with a high r (0.8 +/- 0.07) and a low RMSE (root mean square error, 30.4 +/- 5.5 g/m(3)) values, and the accuracy in the afternoon (13:00-16:00) was higher than that in the morning (09:00-12:00). Meanwhile, in a comparison of the daily average PM2.5 concentrations of 11 sites from different cities, the r values were approximately 0.91 +/- 0.03, and the RMSEs were between 13.94 and 31.44 g/m(3). Lastly, pollution processes were analyzed, and the analysis indicated that the high spatial-temporal resolution of the PM2.5 data could continuously and intuitively reflect the characteristics of regional pollutants (such as diffusion and accumulation), which is of great significance for the assessment of regional air quality.

TI  - Estimation of Sunflower Seed Yield Using Partial Least Squares Regression and Artificial Neural Network Models
T2  - PEDOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Statistical models can efficiently establish the relationships between crop growth and environmental conditions while explicitly quantifying uncertainties. This study aimed to test the efficiency of statistical models established using partial least squares regression (PLSR) and artificial neural network (ANN) in predicting seed yields of sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Two-year field trial data on sunflower growth under different salinity levels and nitrogen (N) application rates in the Yichang Experimental Station in Hetao Irrigation District, Inner Mongolia, China, were used to calibrate and validate the statistical models. The variable importance in projection score was calculated in order to select the sensitive crop indices for seed yield prediction. We found that when the most sensitive indices were used as inputs for seed yield estimation, the PLSR could attain a comparable accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.93 t ha(-1), coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.69) to that when using all measured indices (RMSE = 0.81 t ha(-1), R-2 = 0.77). The ANN model outperformed the PLSR for yield prediction with different combinations of inputs of both microplots and field data. The results indicated that sunflower seed yield could be reasonably estimated by using a small number of crop characteristic indices under complex environmental conditions and management options (e.g., saline soils and N application). Since leaf area index and plant height were found to be the most sensitive crop indices for sunflower seed yield prediction, remotely sensed data and the ANN model may be joined for regional crop yield simulation.

TI  - Habitat suitability modelling for a key small pelagic fish species (<i>Sardinella aurita</i>) in the central Mediterranean sea
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study presents the biomass and spatial distribution of Sardinella aurita in the Libyan, Maltese and southern Sicily waters, estimated during four acoustic surveys in summer 2008 and 2010. Strong differences in terms of both spatial distribution and total biomass between years and areas were found, with higher total biomass in 2010 than in 2008 in both southern and northern areas of the central Mediterranean. Habitat suitability and changes in the spatial dynamics of round sardinella among areas and years are then explored in relation to total biomass variation and environmental factors. The area of presence of S. aurita increased in the Maltese and Sicilian waters in 2010 with respect to 2008, while most of the total biomass observed in the two years occupied the same proportion of the continental shelf in Libyan waters. The link between environmental conditions and S. aurita area of presence and aggregation was investigated by means of generalized additive models (GAM). The application of GAM singled out the key role of depth and temperature in driving higher round sardinella aggregations, as they were able to explain in both years about the 48% of total deviance in the case of strictly positive values. Favourable habitat for round sardinella was found in waters shallower than 60 m depths, with a clear peak around 40 m depth. Favourable temperature values were above 22A degrees C for presence/absence case and above 24A degrees C when GAM was applied on strictly positive values. Overall S. aurita biomass and distribution were discussed in the light of the classical models proposed to describe the fish spatial dynamics in relation to an increase in total biomass.

TI  - Cloud/shadow detection based on spectral indices for multi/hyperspectral optical remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection is a necessary preprocessing step for optical remote sensing applications because of the huge negative influence cloud and cloud shadow can have on data analysis. However, most of the existing cloud/shadow detection methods are designed based on specific band configurations of certain sensors, and their working mechanisms are relatively complex and computationally complicated, which limits their application. In view of this, in this paper, a unified cloud/shadow detection algorithm based on spectral indices (CSD-SI) is proposed for most of the widely used multi/hyperspectral optical remote sensing sensors with both visible and infrared spectral channels. On the one hand, the cloud index (CI) and cloud shadow index (CSI) are proposed to indicate the potential clouds and cloud shadows based on their physical reflective characteristics. In addition, considering the spatial coexistence of cloud and cloud shadow, a spatial matching strategy is utilized to remove the pseudo cloud shadows. The effectiveness of the proposed CSD-SI algorithm is demonstrated on eight different types of widely used multi/hyperspectral optical sensors, with different spectral and spatial resolution levels. Overall, in the experiments undertaken in this study, CSD-SI achieved a mean overall accuracy of 98.52% for cloud, with a mean producer's accuracy of 93.13% and a mean user's accuracy of 98.13%. For cloud shadow, CSD-SI achieved a means producer's accuracy of 84.33% and a mean user's accuracy of 89.12%. The experimental results show that the proposed CSD-SI method based on spectral indices can obtain a comparable cloud/shadow detection performance to that of the other state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Hyperspectral Classification via Superpixel Kernel Learning-Based Low Rank Representation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High dimensional image classification is a fundamental technique for information retrieval from hyperspectral remote sensing data. However, data quality is readily affected by the atmosphere and noise in the imaging process, which makes it difficult to achieve good classification performance. In this paper, multiple kernel learning-based low rank representation at superpixel level (Sp_MKL_LRR) is proposed to improve the classification accuracy for hyperspectral images. Superpixels are generated first from the hyperspectral image to reduce noise effect and form homogeneous regions. An optimal superpixel kernel parameter is then selected by the kernel matrix using a multiple kernel learning framework. Finally, a kernel low rank representation is applied to classify the hyperspectral image. The proposed method offers two advantages. (1) The global correlation constraint is exploited by the low rank representation, while the local neighborhood information is extracted as the superpixel kernel adaptively learns the high-dimensional manifold features of the samples in each class; (2) It can meet the challenges of multiscale feature learning and adaptive parameter determination in the conventional kernel methods. Experimental results on several hyperspectral image datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art classifiers tested in terms of overall accuracy, average accuracy, and kappa statistic.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network-Based Remote Sensing Images Segmentation Method for Extracting Winter Wheat Spatial Distribution
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - When extracting winter wheat spatial distribution by using convolutional neural network (CNN) from Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing images, accurate identification of edge pixel is the key to improving the result accuracy. In this paper, an approach for extracting accurate winter wheat spatial distribution based on CNN is proposed. A hybrid structure convolutional neural network (HSCNN) was first constructed, which consists of two independent sub-networks of different depths. The deeper sub-network was used to extract the pixels present in the interior of the winter wheat field, whereas the shallower sub-network extracts the pixels at the edge of the field. The model was trained by classification-based learning and used in image segmentation for obtaining the distribution of winter wheat. Experiments were performed on 39 GF-2 images of Shandong province captured during 2017-2018, with SegNet and DeepLab as comparison models. As shown by the results, the average accuracy of SegNet, DeepLab, and HSCNN was 0.765, 0.853, and 0.912, respectively. HSCNN was equally as accurate as DeepLab and superior to SegNet for identifying interior pixels, and its identification of the edge pixels was significantly better than the two comparison models, which showed the superiority of HSCNN in the identification of winter wheat spatial distribution.

TI  - Automatic Identification of Center Pivot Irrigation Systems from Landsat Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Being hailed as the greatest mechanical innovation in agriculture since the replacement of draft animals by the tractor, center pivot irrigation systems irrigate crops with a significant reduction in both labor and water needs compared to traditional irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation. In the last few decades, the deployment of center pivot irrigation systems has increased dramatically throughout the United States. Monitoring the installment and operation of the center pivot systems can help: (i) Water resource management agencies to objectively assess water consumption and properly allocate water resources, (ii) Agro-businesses to locate potential customers, and (iii) Researchers to investigate land use change. However, few studies have been carried out on the automatic identification and location of center pivot irrigation systems from satellite images. Growing rapidly in recent years, machine learning techniques have been widely applied on image recognition, and they provide a possible solution for identification of center pivot systems. In this study, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) approach was proposed for identification of center pivot irrigation systems. CNNs with different structures were constructed and compared for the task. A sampling approach was presented for training data augmentation. The CNN with the best performance and less training time was used in the testing area. A variance-based approach was proposed to further locate the center of each center pivot system. The experiment was applied to a 30-m resolution Landsat image, covering an area of 20,000 km(2) in North Colorado. A precision of 95.85% and a recall of 93.33% of the identification results indicated that the proposed approach performed well in the center pivot irrigation systems identification task.

TI  - Quantifying the Reflectance Anisotropy Effect on Albedo Retrieval from Remotely Sensed Observations Using Archetypal BRDFs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflectance anisotropy effect on albedo retrieval was evaluated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) product, and archetypal BRDFs. Shortwave-band archetypal BRDFs were established, and validated, based on the Anisotropy Flat indeX (AFX) and time series MODIS BRDF over tile h11v03. To generate surface albedo, archetypal BRDFs were used to fit simulated reflectance, based on the least squares method. Albedo was also retrieved based on the least root-mean-square-error (RMSE) method or normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based prior BRDF knowledge. The difference between those albedos and the MODIS albedo was used to quantify the reflectance anisotropy effect. The albedo over tile h11v03 for day 185 in 2009 was retrieved from single directional reflectance and the third archetypal BRDF. The results show that six archetypal BRDFs are sufficient to represent the reflectance anisotropy for albedo estimation. For the data used in this study, the relative uncertainty caused by reflectance anisotropy can reach up to 7.4%, 16.2%, and 20.2% for sufficient, insufficient multi-angular and single directional observations. The intermediate archetypal BRDFs may be used to improve the albedo retrieval accuracy from insufficient or single observations with a relative uncertainty range of 8-15%.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major gases that contribute to the global warming. Therefore, studying the distribution of CO2 can help people understand the carbon cycle. Based on the GOSAT retrieved CO2 products, the temporal and spatial distribution and seasonal variation of CO2 concentration were analyzed from 2011 to 2015. CO2 concentration has obvious seasonal variation. It was low in summer, and was high in spring, and the annual increase was about 2 ppm. Nevertheless, the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration in summer was higher than that in spring, it was 0.5425% in summer and was 0.46% in spring. CO2 concentration was low in the northwest and was high in the southeast. The growth rate of CO2 was 2.8 ppm in the northwest and was 3.42 ppm in the southeast. More human's activities made CO2 concentration higher in the southeast than that in other regions.

TI  - Typhoon/Hurricane-Generated Wind Waves Inferred from SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The wide-swath mode of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a good way of detecting typhoon/hurricane winds with a cross-polarization mode. However, its ability to detect wind waves is restricted because of its spatial resolution and nonlinear imaging mechanisms. In this study, we use the SAR-retrieved wind speed, Sentinel-1 SAR wave mode and buoy data to examine fetch- and duration-limited parametric models (denoted H-models), to estimate the wave parameters (significant wave height H-s, dominant wave period T-p) generated by hurricanes or typhoons. Three sets of H-models, in total 6 models, are involved: The H-3Sec model simulates the wave parameters in 3 sections of a given storm (right, left and back); H-LUT models, including the H-LUTI model and H-LUTB model, provide a better resolution of the azimuthal estimation of wind waves inside the storm by analyzing the dataset from Bonnie 1998 and Ivan 2004; and the third set of models is called the H-Harm models, which consider the effects of the radius of the maximum wind speed r(m) on the wave simulation. In the case of typhoon Krovanh, the comparison with wave-mode measurements shows that the duration-limited models underestimate the high values for the wind-wave H-s, while the fetch models' results are more accurate, especially for the H-LUTI model. By analyzing 86 SAR wave mode images, it is found that the H-LUTI model is the best among the 6 H-models, and can effectively simulate the wind-wave H-s, except in the center area of the typhoon; root mean square errors (rmse) can reach 0.88 m, and the coefficient correlation (R-2) is 0.86. The H-Harm models add r(m) as an additional factor to be considered, but this does not add significant improvement in performance compared to the others. This limitation is probably due to the fact that the data sets used to develop the H-Harm models have only a limited coverage range, with respect to r(m). Applying H-models to RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR mode data, we compare the retrieved wave parameters to collected buoy measurements, showing good consistency. The H-LUTI model, using a fetch-limited function, does the best among these 6 H-models, whose rmse and R-2 are 0.86 m and 0.77 for H-s, and 1.06 s and 0.76 for T-p, respectively. Results indicate the potential for H-models to simulate waves generated by typhoons/hurricanes.

TI  - Comparison of two atmospheric correction approaches applied to MODIS measurements over North American waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using in situ data of spectral remote sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) collected over North American oceanic, coastal and estuarine waters between 2002 and 2016 (N = 942), we evaluate two atmospheric correction approaches applied to MODIS measurements. One is the POLYnomial based approach originally designed for MERIS (POLYMER) but adopted and implemented for MODIS, and the other is the traditional Gordon and Wang (1994b) near-infrared (NIR) approach with iteration to account for non-negligible NIR water-leaving radiance, which is currently embedded in the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) software package and used operationally by NASA for processing MODIS data (termed as NASA standard atmospheric correction or NSAC). The approaches are evaluated for both quality and quantity of their retrieved R-rs in the visible domain. The quality is gauged through three statistical measures between in situ and MODIS-retrieved R-rs: root mean square error (RMSE, sr(-1)), unbiased root mean square (uRMS), and mean bias (delta, sr(-1)). For common points where both approaches yield valid R-rs retrievals, POLYMER shows worse performance than NSAC for blue bands (< 488 nm) and comparable performance for green and red bands. However, POLYMER shows the ability to retrieve more valid R-rs data points (2-3 folds) than NSAC for this evaluation dataset primarily because the latter fails over strong sun glint regions where the MODIS NIR bands saturate but the former is designed to work over sun glint regions using non-saturation MODIS bands. For those data points where only POLYMER yield valid R-rs retrievals, data quality is slightly worse than from the common data points. Although these results may vary slightly among individual subregions, it is generally true that POLYMER may be used as a surrogate of NSAC for atmospheric correction of MODIS when data quantity is significantly limited due to perturbations of sun glint and thin clouds that are typical for subtropical and tropical regions.

TI  - Estimation of ultrahigh resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in urban areas using 160 m Gaofen-1 AOD retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been widely used to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations due to its spatially continuous observation. However, the coarse spatial resolutions (e.g., 3 km, 6 km, or 10 km) of the primary satellite AOD products have weakness to capture the characteristics of urban-scale PM2.5 patterns. Moreover, high-resolution (e.g., 1 km) PM2.5 estimations are still unable to be related to the urban landscape or to small geographical units, which is crucial for analyzing the urban pollution structure. In this study, the daily PM2.5 concentrations were estimated using the new AOD data with a 160 m spatial resolution retrieved by the Gaofen-1 (GF) wide field of view (WFV) along with the nested linear mixed effects model and ancillary variables from the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) meteorological simulation data. The experiment was conducted in Wuhan, Beijing, and Shanghai, which suffers from severe atmospheric fine particle pollution in recent years. The proposed model performed well for both GF and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with slight over-fitting and little spatial autocorrelation. Regarding to the GF PM2.5 estimation, model fitting yielded R-2 values of 0.96, 0.91 and 0.95 and mean prediction error (MPE) of 10.13, 11.89 and 7.34 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The site-based cross validation achieved R-2 values of 0.92, 0.88 and 0.89, and MPE of 13.69, 16.76 and 12.59 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. The day-of-years based cross validation resulted in R-2 of 0.54, 0.58 and 0.50, and MPE of 30.46, 27.12 and 31.58 mu g/m(3) for Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, respectively, indicating that it was practicable to estimate the GF PM2.5 in the days without enough AOD-PM2.5 matchups. The ultrahigh resolution PM2.5 estimations offer substantial advantages for providing finer spatially resolved PM2.5 trends. Additionally, it offers new approaches to locate main PM2.5 emission sources, evaluate the local PM2.5 contribution proportion, and quantify the daily PM2.5 emission level via remote sensing techniques. Along with the joint observations via other high-resolution satellites, the temporal resolution of GF PM(2.5)will be further improved. In all, this study not only provides possibilities for further applications in the precise analysis of urban inner PM2.5 pollution patterns but also establishes a foundation for constructing a high-resolution satellite air monitoring network in China.

TI  - Factor analysis for aerosol optical depth and its prediction from the perspective of land-use change
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the non-stationarity and autocorrelation (with a Moran's I index score of 0.75) of the MODIS-retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) of the Wuhan agglomeration (WHA) in Central China, using geographically weighted regression (GWR) to identify the spatial relationships between AOD and its impact factors. In addition to the socio-economic factors, i.e., GDP and population, vegetation cover, elevation, land-use density and landscape metrics are also considered. Faced with the rapid process of urbanization and the impact of land use change on AOD, which has been confirmed in previous studies, we propose an AOD prediction method, combining a land-use change simulation model, a cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and spatial relationships built by GWR to represent the spatial distribution of AOD in 2030. The results suggest that the GWR model is able to address the spatially varying relationships, with an R-squared value, corrected Akaike's information criterion (AICc), and standard residual better than those of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. Land-use simulation, with an accuracy of 89.76%, indicates that an increase in the built-up area and a decrease in the forest area will be the major trends of land-use change and will lead to increased AOD. The AOD simulation results indicate that the most developed areas, i.e., the cities of Wuhan and Huangshi, will be the AOD increase hot spots in the WHA. This study provides an alternative method to identify the varying spatial relationships between AOD and its impact factors. A spatial prediction method for AOD is developed from the perspective of land-use change, which will help land-use planners in decision making.

TI  - Geospatial sensor web: A cyber-physical infrastructure for geoscience research and application
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last half-century, geoscience research has advanced due to multidisciplinary technologies, among which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has played a vital role. However, scientifically organizing these ICTs toward improving geoscience measurements, data processing, and information services has encountered tremendous challenges. This paper reviews a profound revolution in geoscience that has resulted from the Geospatial Sensor Web (GSW), serving as a new cyber-physical spatio-temporal information infrastructure for geoscience on the World Wide Web (WWW). In contrast to previous experiment-based and sensor-based paradigms, the GSW-based paradigm is able to accomplish the following: (1) achieve integrated and sharable management of diverse sensing resources, (2) obtain real-time or near real-time and spatiotemporal continuous data, (3) conduct interoperable and online geoscience data processing and analysis, and (4) provide focusing services with web-based geoscience information and knowledge. As a benefit of the GSW, increasingly more geoscience disciplines are enjoying the value of real-time data, multi-source monitoring, online processing, and intelligence services. This paper reviews the evolution of geoscience research paradigm to demonstrate the scientific background of GSW. Then, we elaborates on four key methods provided by GSW, namely, integrated management, collaborative observation, scalable processing and fusion, and focusing service web capacity. Furthermore, current GSW prototypes and applications for environmental, hydrological, and natural disaster analysis are also reviewed. Moreover, four challenges to the future GSW in geoscience research are identified and analyzed, including integration with the Model Web initiative for sophisticated geo-processing, integration with humans for pervasive sensing, integration with Internet of Things (IoT) to achieve high-quality performance and data mining, and integration with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide smart geoservices. We have concluded that GSW has become an indispensable cyber-physical infrastructure, and will play a greater role in geoscience research and application.

TI  - Complementary relationship estimation of actual evapotranspiration in extreme cold and arid areas: a case study of the Hotan River Basin, northwest China
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of complementary relationship (CR) approaches using only routine meteorological data is a very convenient method of estimating actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Reanalysis datasets and remote sensing data provide good tools to overcome the difficulties in obtaining observation data. This study of the Hotan River Basin (HRB) in northwest China serves as a prime example for estimation of ETa during 2006-2014 by using the modified generalized CR. Based on comparison and analysis, the maximum potential evaporation calculated by the Penman-based equation was adopted. The estimated ETa rates were verified using a regional water balance method at annual time scales because of the limited available data. The calibration parameter sigma was calibrated based on the elevation and underlying surface types. The mean annual ETa ranged from 2.3 mm to 800 mm during 2006-2014. ETa rates in the plains regions were higher than those in the mountainous regions. Most of ETa was concentrated in the months of May to September. A water deficit occurred in the middle and lower regions, while a water surplus occurred in the upper regions. This study not only provided a new concept for calibration, but also a potential solution for different underlying surfaces and time scales.

TI  - Generation and evaluation of the VIIRS land surface phenology product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is widely acknowledged to be a sensitive indicator of the response of ecosystems to climate change, and phonological shifts have been shown to exert substantial impacts on ecosystem function, biodiversity, and carbon budgets at multiple scales. Therefore, long-term records of the phenology of the vegetated land surface are critical in exploring the biological response to environmental change at regional to global scales. Land surface phenology (LSP) from satellite observations has been extensively used to monitor the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems in the face of a changing climate. Here we introduce and describe the global land surface phonology (GLSP) product derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data at a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m. This new product will provide continuity for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GLSP product that has been produced on an operational basis since 2001. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm uses daily VIIRS Nadir BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data as the primary input to calculate the two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) at each 500 m pixel. The temporal EVI2 trajectory is modeled using a hybrid piecewise logistic function to track the seasonal vegetation development, detect phenological transition dates, calculate the magnitude of vegetation greenness development, and characterize the confidence of phonology detections. The VIIRS GLSP algorithm has been implemented across the contiguous United States, and the resulting phenological metrics have been evaluated through comparisons with species-specific field phenological observations, Landsat phenology retrievals, and the MODIS phenology detections. The results demonstrate that the VIIRS GLSP metrics are of high quality and are in a good agreement with the other independent satellite and field observations. The results also indicate that the uncertainty in the VIIRS GLSP retrievals is primarily associated with missing high quality observations in VIIRS EVI2 time series.

TI  - Nonpoint Pollution Source-Sink Landscape Pattern Change Analysis in a Coastal River Basin in Southeast China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics of source-sink landscape pattern change in river basins is crucial for managing and controlling nonpoint source pollution. This study investigated the landscape pattern changes in Jiulong River basin from 1990 to 2015. A random forest classifier combined with texture and spectral information was applied to interpret the multi-temporal Landsat images. Landscape metrics were calculated to quantify the landscape at the patch level. Transition matrixes were derived for analyzing the conversion among different landscape types. It is notable that the largest values of the number of patches and patch density of residential land appeared in 2005, indicating the highest degree of fragmentation over this time period. The percentage of landscape for forestland was always higher than 71%, and the percentage of residential land increased from 7.42% to 14.55% during the last three decades, while unused land decreased from 5.3% to 2.8%. The downward trend of DO and the upward trend of NH3-N and TP indicate the deterioration of water quality during 2005-2015. The quantitative monitoring data of water quality indicators in Hua'an and Xiamen sites in Jiulong River basin are shown. The percentage of landscape of cultivated land increased during 2005-2010, which was consistent with the change tendency of NH3-N. Transition matrixes showed that the main changes occurred when forestland and unused land were transformed to residential land and cultivated land over the last three decades. Analysis results demonstrated a higher extent of landscape fragmentation and an unsustainable transition among source-sink landscapes.

TI  - Source Model of the 2016 Kumamoto, Japan, Earthquake Constrained by InSAR, GPS, and Strong-Motion Data: Fault Slip under Extensional Stress
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE SEISMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 Kumamoto earthquake is the largest event that ever happened since 1900 in the central part of Kyushu Island, Japan. It involves the Futagawa and Hinagu fault zones that contain some offsets and are controlled by extensional stress, providing a good opportunity to gain insights into rupture propagation under extensional stress. The coseismic deformation fields were derived from two types of Sentinel-1A imagery, Global Positioning System (GPS), and strong-motion data. A three-segment source model was constructed to fit the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), GPS, and strong-motion data. The best-fitting model indicates that the rupture is dominated by right-lateral slip, with some normal component but at depth greater than 15 km, and a previously unmapped, high-dipping fault north of the Aso Volcano that ruptured during the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. The source model yields a peak slip of 7.4 m, resulting in a geodetic moment of 4: 8 x 10(19) N . m, corresponding to M-w 7.0. We used the inferred source model to calculate the Coulomb stress change to discuss the triggering effects. The analysis of the finite-fault slip model and surface rupture trace suggests that, although the rupture can easily overcome a single bend or gap, the combination of bends and gaps put stronger constraint to inhibit rupture propagation. The analysis of the Kumamoto earthquake also reveals that the geologic structures play a critical role in arresting rupture propagation. In addition, the influence of fault geometry is important but not fully understood.

TI  - Multi-sensor land data assimilation: Toward a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003-2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.

TI  - Estimating Forest Canopy Cover in Black Locust (<i>Robinia pseudoacacia</i> L.) Plantations on the Loess Plateau Using Random Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest canopy is the medium for energy and mass exchange between forest ecosystems and the atmosphere. Remote sensing techniques are more efficient and appropriate for estimating forest canopy cover (CC) than traditional methods, especially at large scales. In this study, we evaluated the CC of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau using random forest (RF) regression models. The models were established using the relationships between digital hemispherical photograph (DHP) field data and variables that were calculated from satellite images. Three types of variables were calculated from the satellite data: spectral variables calculated from a multispectral image, textural variables calculated from a panchromatic image (T-pan) with a 15 x 15 window size, and textural variables calculated from spectral variables (TB+VIs) with a 9 x 9 window size. We compared different mtry and ntree values to find the most suitable parameters for the RF models. The results indicated that the RF model of spectral variables explained 57% (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.06) of the variability in the field CC data. The soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) were more important than other spectral variables. The RF model of T-pan obtained higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.69, RMSE = 0.05) than the spectral variables, and the grey level co-occurrence matrix-based texture measureCorrelation (COR) was the most important variable for T-pan. The most accurate model was obtained from the TB+VIs (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 0.05), which combined spectral and textural information, thus providing a significant improvement in estimating CC. This model provided an effective approach for detecting the CC of black locust plantations on the Loess Plateau.

TI  - Radiometric Cross-Calibration of Landsat-8/OLI and GF-1/PMS Sensors Using an Instrumented Sand Site
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The panchromatic and multispectral (PMS1/PMS2) sensors designed with one panchromatic band and four multispectral bands are two optical cameras on-board the Gao Fen 1 (GF-1) satellite launched on April 26, 2013. The spatial resolution of PMS1/PMS2are 2 and 8 m of pan and multispectral, respectively. The vicarious calibration of GF-1/PMS was performed by China Centre for Resource Satellite Data and Application, and the calibration coefficients were released once a year. Due to the lack of on-board calibrator, the on-orbit radiometric performance evaluation of the PMS sensors is very important for the further quantitative application of the data. To evaluate the radiometric performance of PMS1 sensor on-board GF-1 satellite, this paper attempts to calibrate PMS1 sensor against the well-calibrated OLI sensor on-board Landsat-8. An instrumented sand site was used, which is located in the national high resolution remote sensing comprehensive calibration site, Baotou, China. The cross-calibration coefficients of PMS1 on October 5, 2015 and August 20, 2016 are calculated and compared with the official calibration coefficients published in 2015 and 2016. The results show that the cross-calibration of PMS sensor using other sensors is necessary, due to the low updating frequency of calibration coefficient for GF-1/PMS sensor. The uncertainty estimation results show that the total uncertainties associated with the cross-calibration of Landsat-8/OLI and GF-1/PMS sensors over a desert site are within 5.5%.

TI  - Adaptive Ship Detection for Single-Look Complex SAR Images Based on SVWIE-Noncircularity Decomposition
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present an adaptive ship detection method for single-look complex synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. First, noncircularity is analyzed and adopted in ship detection task; besides, similarity variance weighted information entropy (SVWIE) is proposed for clutter reduction and target enhancement. According to the analysis of scattering of SVWIE and noncircularity, SVWIE-noncircularity (SN) decomposition is developed. Based on the decomposition, two components, the high-noncircularity SVWIE amplitude (h) and the low-noncircularity SVWIE amplitude (l), are obtained. We demonstrate that ships and clutter in SAR images are different for h detector and h detector can be effectively used for ship detection. Finally, to extract ships from the background, the generalized Gamma distribution (G Gamma D) is used to fit h statistics of clutter and the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) is utilized to choose an adaptive threshold. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on HH polarization of Alos-2 images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect ships in complex background, i.e., ships are close to small islands or with strong noise.

TI  - Mapping Burn Severity of Forest Fires in Small Sample Size Scenarios
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping burn severity of forest fires can contribute significantly to understanding, quantifying and monitoring of forest fire severity and its impacts on ecosystems. In recent years, several remote sensing-based methods for mapping burn severity have been reported in the literature, of which the implementations are mainly dependent on several field plots. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop alternative method of mapping burn severity using limited number of field plots. In this study, we proposed a support vector regression based method using multi-temporal satellite data to map the burn severity, evaluated its performance by calculating correlations between the predicted and the observed Composite Burn Index, and compared the performance with that of the regression analysis method (based on dNBR). The results show that the performance of support vector regression based mapping method is more accurate (RMSE = 0.46-0.57) than that of regression analysis method (RMSE = 0.53-0.68). Even with fewer training sets, it can map the detailed distribution of burn severity of forest fires and can achieve relatively better generalization, compared to regression analysis burn severity mapping methods. It could be concluded that the proposed support vector regression based mapping method is an alternative to the regression analysis method in small sample size scenarios. This method with excellent generalization performance should be recommended for future studies on burn severity of forest fires.

TI  - Spatial Pattern Evolution and Optimization of Urban System in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China, Based on DMSP-OLS Night Light Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is of great significance to research the spatial pattern of the urban system of the Yangtze River economic belt to analyze the characteristics and laws of the spatial structure of the Yangtze River economic belt and to promote the optimal development of the urban system of the Yangtze River economic zone. In this paper, the time data of the Yangtze River economic zone are corrected using Landsat satellite data and the clustering analysis method. The threshold of the urban built area is obtained by comparing the auxiliary data with other auxiliary data. Based on this threshold, a total of eight typical landscape pattern indicatorsincluding the total area of the landscape, the total patch number, and the aggregation indexare used, and then FRAG-STATS 4.2 software is used to analyze the spatial pattern of urban development in the Yangtze River economic zone from 1992 to 2013. The results show the following: (1) During the period from 1992 to 2013, the urbanization of the Yangtze River economic zone expanded rapidly; the area of urban built-up area increased by a factor of 9.68, the number of patches increased by a factor of 2.39, and the patch density increased greatly, indicating that the Yangtze River economic zone, with an increasing number of towns and urban areas, continues to expand. (2) The complexity of the landscape patch shape gradually increased, the small and medium-sized cities continued to grow, more small towns emerged, and the total length of the border and the average density had average annual growth rates of 21.56% and 21.58%; the degree of aggregation and the mutual influence are increasing. (3) The maximum plaque index and the aggregation index show an overall declining trend. However, there are some fluctuations and disorder in the process of evolution, such as the total area of the landscape, the total patch number and the total patch density, which reflects that the Yangtze River economic zone is in the process of urbanization and has irregular and disordered characteristics.

TI  - Drought Impacts on Vegetation Indices and Productivity of Terrestrial Ecosystems in Southwestern China During 2001-2012
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought, as a recurring extreme climate event, affects the structure, function, and process of terrestrial ecosystems. Despite the increasing occurrence and intensity of the drought in the past decade in Southwestern China, the impacts of continuous drought events on vegetation in this region remain unclear. During 2001-2012, Southwestern China experienced the severe drought events from 2009 to 2011. Our aim is to characterize drought conditions in the Southwestern China and explore the impacts on the vegetation condition and terrestrial ecosystem productivity. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was used to characterize drought area and intensity and a light-use efficiency model was used to explore the effect of drought on the terrestrial ecosystem productivity with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data. The SPI captured the major drought events in Southwestern China during the study period, indicated that the 12-year period of this study included both normal' precipitation years and two severe drought events in 2009-2010 and 2011. Results showed that vegetation greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI and Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) both declined in 2009/2010 drought, but the 2011 drought resulted in less declines of vegetation greenness and productivity due to shorten drought duration and rising temperature. Meanwhile, it was about 5 months lapse between drought events and maximum declines in vegetation greenness for 2009/2010 drought events. In addition, forest, grassland and cropland revealed significant different ecosystem responses to drought. It indicated that grassland showed an early sensitivity to drought, while cropland was the most sensitive to water deficit and forest was more resilient to drought. This study suggests that it is necessary to detect the difference responses of ecosystem to drought in a regional area with satellite data and ecosystem model.

TI  - Atmospheric CO and CH<sub>4</sub> time series and seasonal variations on Reunion Island from ground-based in situ and FTIR (NDACC and TCCON) measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) and methane (CH4) mole fractions are measured by ground-based in situ cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) analyzers and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers at two sites (St Denis and Maido) on Reunion Island (21 degrees S, 55 degrees E) in the Indian Ocean. Currently, the FTIR Bruker IFS 125HR at St Denis records the direct solar spectra in the near-infrared range, contributing to the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). The FTIR Bruker IFS 125HR at Maido records the direct solar spectra in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, contributing to the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). In order to understand the atmospheric CO and CH4 variability on Reunion Island, the time series and seasonal cycles of CO and CH4 from in situ and FTIR (NDACC and TCCON) measurements are analyzed. Meanwhile, the difference between the in situ and FTIR measurements are discussed.The CO seasonal cycles observed from the in situ measurements at Maldo and FTIR retrievals at both St Denis and Maldo are in good agreement with a peak in September-November, primarily driven by the emissions from biomass burning in Africa and South America. The dry-air column averaged mole fraction of CO (X-CO) derived from the FTIR MIR spectra (NDACC) is about 15.7 ppb larger than the CO mole fraction near the surface at Maido, because the air in the lower troposphere mainly comes from the Indian Ocean while the air in the middle and upper troposphere mainly comes from Africa and South America. The trend for CO on Reunion Island is unclear during the 2011-2017 period, and more data need to be collected to get a robust result.A very good agreement is observed in the tropospheric and stratospheric CH4 seasonal cycles between FTIR (NDACC and TCCON) measurements, and in situ and the Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) satellite measurements, respectively. In the troposphere, the CH4 mole fraction is high in August-September and low in December-January, which is due to the OH seasonal variation. In the stratosphere, the CH4 mole fraction has its maximum in March-April and its minimum in August-October, which is dominated by vertical transport. In addition, the different CH4 mole fractions between the in situ, NDACC and TCCON CH4 measurements in the troposphere are discussed, and all measurements are in good agreement with the GEOS-Chem model simulation. The trend of X-CH4 is 7.6 +/- 0.4 ppb yr(-1) from the TCCON measurements over the 2011 to 2017 time period, which is consistent with the CH4 trend of 7.4 +/- 0.5 ppb yr(-1) from the in situ measurements for the same time period at St Denis.

TI  - Spatial and temporal changes of human disturbances and their effects on landscape patterns in the Jiangsu coastal zone, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Human disturbance is one of the essential forces affecting changes in landscape patterns. Studying the relationship between human disturbances and landscape patterns is of significance for regional conservation and ecosystem management. An understanding of this relationship is also crucial for the mitigation of conflicts between socioeconomic development and environmental protection. In this study, using remote sensing data and geographical information system technology, we created a quantitative method to assess the intensity of human disturbance on the landscape by introducing the concept of hemeroby. By means of the measurement of hemeroby and statistical approaches, we quantitatively analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of human disturbances and their effects on landscape patterns in the Jiangsu coastal zone, China, from 1995 to 2013. The results showed that the intensity of human disturbance gradually increased from 1995 to 2013. While the increasing rate of intensity of human disturbance has slowed down from early period (1995-2002) to later period (2002-2013) because of differences in exploitation activities and regional development policies. Spatially, the hemeroby increased most obviously in the southern counties and northern Ganyu County, resulting from port construction and tidal flat reclamation. Depending on the different degrees of human disturbance, landscape patterns showed obvious differences. Compared with low-level and high-level human disturbance, high-level human disturbance contributed to more fragmented landscape, more complex patch shape, lower connectivity, and higher diversity. A correlation analysis between landscape indices and hemeroby suggested that the landscape patterns in regions with high-level human disturbance were relatively sensitive to changes in the intensity of human activities. The findings in this paper provide additional spatial information and theoretical guidance for regional conservation and ecosystem management in the Jiangsu coastal zone, China.

TI  - Landscape variation in canopy nitrogen and carbon assimilation in a temperate mixed forest
T2  - OECOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy nitrogen (N) is a key factor regulating carbon cycling in forest ecosystems through linkages among foliar N and photosynthesis, decomposition, and N cycling. This analysis examined landscape variation in canopy nitrogen and carbon assimilation in a temperate mixed forest surrounding Harvard Forest in central Massachusetts, USA by integration of canopy nitrogen mapping with ecosystem modeling, and spatial data from soils, stand characteristics and disturbance history. Canopy %N was mapped using high spectral resolution remote sensing from NASA's AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) instrument and linked to an ecosystem model, PnET-II, to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP). Predicted GPP was validated with estimates derived from eddy covariance towers. Estimated canopy %N ranged from 0.5 to 2.9% with a mean of 1.75% across the study region. Predicted GPP ranged from 797 to 1622 g C m(-2) year(-1) with a mean of 1324 g C m(-2) year(-1). The prediction that spatial patterns in forest growth are associated with spatial patterns in estimated canopy %N was supported by a strong, positive relationship between field-measured canopy %N and aboveground net primary production. Estimated canopy %N and GPP were related to forest composition, land-use history, and soil drainage. At the landscape scale, PnET-II GPP was compared with predicted GPP from the BigFoot project and from NASA's MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data products. Estimated canopy %N explained much of the difference between MODIS GPP and PnET-II GPP, suggesting that global MODIS GPP estimates may be improved if broad-scale estimates of foliar N were available.

TI  - The important but weakening maize yield benefit of grain filling prolongation in the US Midwest
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of recent crop yield trends is necessary for improving the yield and maintaining food security. Several possible mechanisms have been investigated recently in order to explain the steady growth in maize yield over the US Corn-Belt, but a substantial fraction of the increasing trend remains elusive. In this study, trends in grain filling period (GFP) were identified and their relations with maize yield increase were further analyzed. Using satellite data from 2000 to 2015, an average lengthening of GFP of 0.37days per year was found over the region, which probably results from variety renewal. Statistical analysis suggests that longer GFP accounted for roughly one-quarter (23%) of the yield increase trend by promoting kernel dry matter accumulation, yet had less yield benefit in hotter counties. Both official survey data and crop model simulations estimated a similar contribution of GFP trend to yield. If growing degree days that determines the GFP continues to prolong at the current rate for the next 50years, yield reduction will be lessened with 25% and 18% longer GFP under Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP 2.6) and RCP 6.0, respectively. However, this level of progress is insufficient to offset yield losses in future climates, because drought and heat stress during the GFP will become more prevalent and severe. This study highlights the need to devise multiple effective adaptation strategies to withstand the upcoming challenges in food security.

TI  - Monitoring Spatio-temporal Variance of an Extreme Heat Event Using Multiple-source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - defined scorching temperature proportion index increase from northern to middle, to southern p Extreme heat events have serious effects on human daily life. Accurately capturing the dynamic variance of extreme high-temperature distributions in a timely manner is the basis for analyzing the potential impacts of extreme heat, thereby informing risk prevention strategies. This paper demonstrates the potential application of multiple source remote sensing data in mapping and monitoring the extreme heat events that occurred on Aug. 8, 2013 in Jiangsu Province, China. In combination with MODIS products, the thermal sharpening (TsHARP) method and a binary linear model are compared to downscale the original daytime FengYun 2F (FY-2F) land surface temperature (LST) imagery, with a temporal resolution of 60 min, from 5 km to 1 km. Using the meteorological measurement data from Nanjing station as the reference, the research then estimates the instantaneous air temperature by using an iterative computation based on the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), which is used to analyze the spatio-temporal air temperature variance. The results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the LST downscaled from the binary linear model is 1.30 degrees C compared to the synchronous MODIS LST, and on this basis the estimated air temperature has the RMSE of 1.78 degrees C. The spatial and temporal distribution of air temperature variance at each geographical location from 06:30 to 18:30 can be accurately determined, and indicates that the high temperature gradually increases and expands from the city center. For the spatial distribution, the air temperature and theart of Jiangsu, and are slightly lower in the eastern area near the Yellow Sea. In terms of temporal characteristics, the percentage of area with air temperature above 37 degrees C in each city increase with time after 10:30 and reach the peak value at 14:30 or 15:30. Then, they decrease gradually, and the rising and falling trends become smaller from the southern cities to the northern regions. Moreover, there is a distinct positive relationship between the percentage of area above 37 degrees C and the population density. The above results show that the spatio-temporal distributions of heat waves and their influencing factors can be determined by combining multiple sources of remotely sensed image data.

TI  - Reconstruction of the Water Cultivation Paleoenvironment Dating Back to the Han and Tang Dynasties Surrounding the Yangguan Frontier Pass Using X- and L-Band SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supported by a shallow groundwater wetland ecosystem, the Nanhu oasis, which is the location of the Yangguan frontier pass, represents an important supply and defence station for the ancient Silk Road. The reconstruction of the evolution of the water cultivation environment is helpful for archaeological surveys and the protection of this well-known heritage site. This study proposes a workflow for reconstructing the water cultivation paleoenvironment-based primarily on X- and L-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. First, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X (TSX/TDX)-generated Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were used for microrelief analyses, including a watershed analysis and drainage network extraction. Several dried-up paleochannels and the range of the Daze (a wetland dating back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.)) were identified. Second, based on the hydrological sensitivity analysis of the multi-temporal L-band SAR data, arid land vegetation accompanying the emergence of groundwater was extracted to locate ancient arable areas using backscattering and coherence characteristics. Finally, reconstruction of the water cultivation paleoenvironment surrounding the Nanhu oasis dating back to the Han and Tang dynasties (202 B.C.-907 A.D.) was performed, referring to historical documents. New discoveries were validated by field campaigns, and the results of the SAR archaeological investigations conducted in this study indicated that the ancient arable area in the Nanhu oasis was nearly double the current dimensions.

TI  - Real-time image recognition using weighted spatial pyramid networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF REAL-TIME IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The latest-generation earth observation instruments on airborne and satellite platforms are currently producing an almost continuous high-dimensional data stream. This exponentially growing data poses a new challenge for real-time image processing and recognition. Making full and effective use of the spectral information and spatial structure information of high-resolution remote sensing image is the key to the processing and recognition of high-resolution remote sensing data. In this paper, the adaptive multipoint moment estimation (AMME) stochastic optimization algorithm is proposed for the first time by using the finite lower-order moments and adding the estimating points. This algorithm not only reduces the probability of local optimum in the learning process, but also improves the convergence rate of the convolutional neural network (Lee Cun et al. in Advances in neural information processing systems, 1990). Second, according to the remote sensing image with characteristics of complex background and small sensitive targets, and by automatic discovery, locating small targets, and giving high weights, we proposed a feature extraction method named weighted pooling to further improve the performance of real-time image recognition. We combine the AMME and weighted pooling with the spatial pyramid representation (Harada et al. in Comput Vis Pattern Recognit 1617-1624, 2011) algorithm to form a new, multiscale, and multilevel real-time image recognition model and name it weighted spatial pyramid networks (WspNet). At the end, we use the MNIST, ImageNet, and natural disasters under remote sensing data sets to test WspNet. Compared with other real-time image recognition models, WspNet achieve a new state of the art in terms of convergence rate and image feature extraction compared with conventional stochastic gradient descent method [like AdaGrad, AdaDelta and Adam (Zeiler in Comput Sci, 2012; Kingma and Ba in Comput Sci, 2014; Duchi et al. in J Mach Learn Res 12(7):2121-2159, 2011] and pooling method [like max-pooling, avg-pooling and stochastic-pooling (Zeiler and Fergus in stochastic-pooling for regularization of deep convolutional neural networks, 2013)].

AB  - This letter summarizes a regional assessment of radiometric data products from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument operated onboard Sentinel-3A. The assessment is supported by in situ reference measurements from the Ocean Colour component of the Aerosol Robotic Network and the Bio-optical mapping of Marine Properties Program. Results indicate a systematic underestimate of the water-leaving radiance at the blue and red spectral bands. Conversely, the aerosol optical depth at 865 nm exhibits overestimate, while the Angstrom exponent shows a narrow distribution of values confined below a maximum of approximately 1.7. These findings suggest difficulty in separating water and atmospheric radiance contributions, which results in a poor determination of aerosol load and type and, consequently, an overestimate of atmospheric effects.

TI  - Auriferous shear zones in the central Allaqi-Heiani belt: Orogenic gold in post-accretionary structures, SE Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The East-West Gondwana collision (0.75-0.5 Ga), by oblique convergence, was likely accompanied by high hydrothermal fluid flux and dispersed orogenic gold in the Arabian-Nubian Shield. Gold-bearing quartz veins along steep-dipping shear zones bordering or cutting through the ophiolitic and island arc rocks in the central Allaqi-Heiani belt in Wadi Defeit area deserved the interest of ancient miners. Field and remote sensing data revealed the structural and lithological controls of gold-bearing quartz veins, providing means of exploration for new targets in the larger Wadi Allaqi environ. The auriferous shear zones are attributed to D-3 (a non-coaxial continuation of early NE-SW compression regime), and 04 (slip reactivation by E-W compression and transcurrent deformation). Microscopic investigations of quartz veins reveal the association of gold blebs and specks with fissure-filling galena-spahleritetetrahedrite assemblage and deformed Fe-As-sulfides (pyrite and arsenopyrite). As a gold-only province with abundant, variably deformed and carbonated metabasic rocks, metamorphic devolatilization is suggested to explain the discrete gold occurrences by fluid focusing in complex shear intersections. The available fluid inclusion data affirm the low salinity aqueous-carbonic composition of the ore fluids and mesothermal conditions of ore deposition, consistent with metamorphic devolatilization. Structures related to late ductile deformation in the post-accretionary stages of the evolution of the shield are, therefore, considered high priority zones for future exploration programs.

TI  - The Integration of VHR Satellite Imagery, GPR Survey and Boring for Archaeological Prospection at the Longcheng Site in Anhui Province, China
T2  - ARCHAEOMETRY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is focused on the joint use of non-invasive and minimal intervention techniques for supporting archaeological prospection. Very high resolution (VHR) satellite imagery analysis and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and boring surveys were integrated for the study of the Longcheng site, located near Hefei city in Anhui Province, China, to test their effectiveness and efficiency in prospecting archaeological remains and evaluating their degree of preservation. First, target locations of potential archaeological structures were identified on a WorldView-2 (WV-2) satellite image through spatial and radiometric enhancement, interpretation and object-oriented classification. Second, archaeological features extracted from the WV-2 imagery were further investigated by a GPR survey that provided detailed cross-checking information about buried remains. Finally, a subsequent boring survey was conducted across those prospective archaeological structures in order to map the stratigraphic sequences on the basis of colour, compactness and the inclusions contained in the soil, and then to test their correspondence with the GPR data. The boring led to detailed confirmation of the results produced by the remote sensing analyses and GPR surveys, as well as the discovery of datable artefacts. On the basis of all the integrated data, the preliminary layout and structure of the Longcheng site was reconstructed in GIS. Furthermore, the widths, lengths, heights and burial depths of these buried archaeological structures were estimated in detail.

TI  - Spatial downscaling of MODIS Chlorophyll-a using Landsat 8 images for complex coastal water monitoring
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an indicator for monitoring the trophic status of coastal water. However, its sampling and analysing in situ can be time consuming and spatially limited. With high temporal resolution and global coverage, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Level 3 products are reliable and widely used for ocean ecosystem monitoring. The Landsat images can provide detailed spatial information for regional scale land cover and land change studies. The purpose of this study is to combine the 4 km resolution MODIS Chia data with 30 m resolution Landsat data to obtain high spatial resolution Chl-a maps for complex coastal water quality monitoring. A data fusion model of MODIS Chl-a and Landsat 8 OLI sensor data was built up for the east coast of the Laizhou Bay, China. The model is an optimal regression model of the band ratio OLI + 2/011+ 5 and MODIS Chl-a. With residual correction, it managed to downscale the MODIS Chl-a data from resolution 4 km to 30 m. Validation were provided from in situ Chl-a measured in spring and autumn of 2013 and 2014. The model yields satisfactory results and the derived Chl-a map presents detailed information of coastal trophic status, which will be useful for regional water quality monitoring.

TI  - Estimating net irrigation requirement of winter wheat using model- and satellite-based single and basal crop coefficients
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the key parameters in water and energy balance equation. According to FAO 56, crop evapotranspiration (ETc) is calculated from multiplying reference evapotranspiration (ET0) by crop coefficient (K-c). But, due to excessive simplification of K-c curve in the FAO approach, potential evapotranspiration (ETp) would be miscalculated. Therefore, accurate estimates of ETp entail improving K-c, estimates. In this study, K-c curves of early- and late-planted winter wheat were obtained based on two main satellite-based methods: (1) ratio approach (2) vegetation indices (VIs) approach. In the ratio approach, basal crop coefficient (K-cb) and single crop coefficient (K-c) was directly calculated from the ratio of potential transpiration (T-p) to ET0 (using SWAP) and ETp to ET0 (using SWAP and the Priestly-Taylor equation), respectively. The VI approach makes use of Landsat 7 (ETM +) and 8 (OLI) and also MODIS imagery in order to extract soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI). The K-cb curves were evaluated against field measured leaf area index (LAI) in 2014-15 growing season. After each Kc curve was modeled, net irrigation requirement (NIR) was calculated on daily and season basis. Results showed that the SWAP approach was weak in estimating the K-cb and K-c curves especially at the late-season stage. The VI approach could properly detect changes in vegetation cover during an entire growing season. But, when it came to K-c curve modelling, the VI approach was limited to the values given in FAO 56. However, the Priestly-Taylor approach compensated for this limitation therefore yielded more sensible trends in Kc curves. Results indicated that the VI approach reduced estimates of NIR of late-planted winter wheat compared with the FAO-recommended approach by 5.37%. The Priestly-Taylor approach resulted 21.72 and 0.32% lower NIR compared with the FAO-recommended approach respectively for early- and late-planted winter wheat. The decrease in NIR from satellite-based approaches derived from more realistic Kc curves during the entire growing season. Overall, making use of the satellite-based approaches could improve water management on regional scales.

TI  - A baseline regional evapotranspiration (ET) and change hotspots over Indian sub-tropics using satellite remote sensing data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The annual water loss through evapotranspiration (ET) is an uncertain but significant component of India's water budget. The present study generated independent estimates of baseline annual ET, calibrated with in situ micrometeorological data over Indian sub-continent, using surface energy balance framework and satellite-based long-term thermal remote sensing, visible and near-infrared observations as the primary data sources. Thirty years' (1981-2010) of satellite-based ET estimates at 0.08 degrees grid resolution were used to assess trend in regional ET, to find out change hot-spots and probable causes. Long-term collateral data, influencing ET, such as gridded (0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees) annual rainfall (RF), annual mean surface soil moisture (SSM) at 25 km resolution from ESA scatterometers and annual mean incoming shortwave radiation from MERRA-2D reanalysis were also analyzed. Mean annual ET loss was found to be the highest for Indian cropland (890 Cubic Km) than forest (575 Cubic Km). Annual water consumption pattern over vegetation systems showed declining ET trend at the rate of -16 Cubic Km yr(-1) upto 1995 during 30 years which might be due to declining rainfall and solar dimming. This was followed by increasing ET trend (34 Cubic Km yr(-1)). During 2001-2010, irrigated cropland showed a steep increase in water consumption pattern with an average rate of 4 Cubic Km yr(-1) while grassland and forest showed declining consumption patterns since 2003 and 2007, respectively thus showing crossover points of their consumption patterns with irrigated cropland. Four agriculturally important Indian eastern, central, western and southern states showed significantly increasing ET trend with S-score of 15-25 and Z-score of 1.09-2.9 during this period. Increasing ET in western and southern states was found to be coupled with increase in annual rainfall and SSM. But in eastern and central states, no significant trend in rainfall was observed though significant increase in ET was noticed. Region-specific correlation of annual ET with natural forcing variables was higher for incoming shortwave radiation as compared to rainfall. The increase in ET over irrigated croplands as well as over some of the Indian states could be due to increase in anthropogenic factors which need more detailed investigations in future.

TI  - Potential ecosystem service values of mangrove forests in southeastern China using high-resolution satellite data
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests provide a large number of important ecological, economic, and social benefits. This study proposes a pixel-based method for estimating the spatial variability of mangrove ecosystem services (coastal protection, carbon sequestration, nutrient retention and heavy metal retention) in the Jiulong River Estuary using a combination of high-resolution satellite data with market price and replacement cost approaches. The results indicated that there was a considerable variability in the ecosystem service values caused by the distance of mangroves to the coast and the different growth phases of mangrove forests. The total estimated value of the four selected ecosystem services was US$ 287,993/year for 174.58 ha (approximately US$ 1650/ha/year). Coastal protection was estimated to provide the highest value (US$ 239,683/year), amounting to 83.23% of the total value of the ecosystem services, followed by nutrient retention (US$ 25,283/year), contributing 8.78% of the total value of the ecosystem services and accounting for up to 52.33% of the total value of regulating services. Heavy metals retention (US$ 10,289/year) and carbon sequestration (US$ 12,738 in 2015/year) had relatively low values in comparison to those of coastal protection and nutrient retention. However, there was an underestimation of mangrove ecosystem services because we did not consider other services, such as fisheries, biodiversity, recreation, education and tourism, mainly due to the lack of primary data. Nevertheless, the estimated economic value of mangrove ecosystem services in this area is meaningful to raise awareness of the benefits provided by mangroves to local communities and policy makers.

TI  - Estimating water consumption based on meta-analysis and MODIS data for an oasis region in northwestern China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A severe water shortage in arid and semiarid regions in China has triggered regulations limiting the use of irrigation water in desert-oasis agricultural systems. To determine the actual water demand of agricultural systems and to develop standards for a rational use of water resources, maize evapotranspiration rates was simulated using meta-analysis of published data, determined land-use and soil properties in Zhangye oasis area and then estimated water consumption with MODIS for arid northwestern China for the 2014 growing season. Farmland in Zhangye oasis totaled 2189.88 km(2) and accounted for 25.41% of the total oasis area; crop-protecting forestland totaled 8.56 km(2) and accounted for 0.10% of the total oasis area, grassland and unutilized land accounted for 1.85%, 71.48% of the total oasis area, respectively. Soil moisture capacity at saturation ranged from 21.0 to 33.0% and at field capacity from 21.0 to 31.5%. Soil bulk density ranged from 1.36 to 1.58 g cm(-3). Using meta-analysis, the simulated maize evapotranspiration rate was 655.91 +/- 20.53 mm. During 2014 growing season, minimum, optimum and maximum water consumption used for agricultural yields and oasis stability was 1.14 x 10 9 m(3), 1.46 x 10 9 m(3) and 1.75 x 10 9 m(3), respectively. In future research, increased big picture and high frequency data will allow operational monitoring of water use and requirements and irrigation at a regional scale.

TI  - Warming From Recent Marine Heatwave Lingers in Deep British Columbia Fjord
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - While satellite data indicate that the surface expression of the North Pacific marine heatwave, nicknamed "The Blob," disappeared in late 2016, Argo float and ship-based conductivity-temperature-depth data show that warm conditions persisted below the surface mixed layer through at least March 2018. We trace this anomalously warm subsurface water from the open ocean through Queen Charlotte Sound to Rivers Inlet, on British Columbia's central coast. In Rivers Inlet, deep water below the sill depth continues to be 0.3 degrees to 0.6 degrees C warmer than the monthly average, suggesting that impacts of this marine heatwave have persisted in coastal waters at least 4 years after its onset, with potentially substantial effects on coastal ecosystems.Plain Language Summary The Northeast Pacific Ocean was affected by two warm water events, the first was the 2013 to 2015 marine heatwave, nicknamed The Blob, and the second was the 2015 to 2016 El Nino. Surface satellite data have shown that the warm water was gone by 2016. Using temperature data collected by ship and by autonomous robots, we find that abnormally warm water continues to exist in the open ocean below the surface, at about 140-m depth. In the coastal ocean, we find that deep waters in Rivers Inlet are still 0.3 degrees to 0.6 degrees C warmer than normal, at least 4 years after The Blob was first observed. This warm water could have a big impact on the Rivers Inlet ecosystem.

TI  - Epidemiology of circulating human influenza viruses from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2015
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe establishment of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in Kinshasa, Bas Congo, Maniema, Katanga, and Kasai Provinces allowed generation of important data on the molecular epidemiology of human influenza viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, some challenges still exist, including the need for extending the influenza surveillance to more provinces. This study describes the pattern of influenza virus circulating in DRC during 2015.MethodologyNasopharyngeal swabs were collected from January to December 2015 from outpatients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and in all hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). Molecular analysis was done to determine influenza type and subtype at the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) in Kinshasa using real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Analysis of antiviral resistance by enzyme inhibition assay and nucleotide sequencing was performed by the Collaborating center in the USA (CDC, Atlanta).ResultsOut of 2,376 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from patients, 218 (9.1%) were positive for influenza virus. Among the positive samples, 149 were characterized as influenza virus type A (Flu A), 67 as type B (Flu B) and 2 mixed infections (Flu A and B). Flu A subtypes detected were H3N2 and H1N1. The Yamagata strain of Flu B was detected among patients in the country. Individuals aged between 5 and 14 years accounted for the largest age group affected by influenza virus. All influenza viruses detected were found to be sensitive to antiviral drugs such as oseltamivar, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivar.ConclusionThe present study documented the possible involvement of both circulation of Flu A and B viruses in human respiratory infection in certain DRC provinces during 2015. This study emphasises the need to extend the influenza surveillance to other provinces for a better understanding of the epidemiology of influenza in DRC. It is envisioned that such a system would lead to improved disease control and patient management.

TI  - Revisiting the Mystery of Recent Stratospheric Temperature Trends
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulated stratospheric temperatures over the period 1979-2016 in models from the Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative are compared with recently updated and extended satellite data sets. The multimodel mean global temperature trends over 1979-2005 are -0.88 +/- 0.23, -0.70 +/- 0.16, and -0.50 +/- 0.12K/decade for the Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) channels 3 (similar to 40-50 km), 2 (similar to 35-45 km), and 1 (similar to 25-35 km), respectively (with 95% confidence intervals). These are within the uncertainty bounds of the observed temperature trends from two reprocessed SSU data sets. In the lower stratosphere, the multimodel mean trend in global temperature for the Microwave Sounding Unit channel 4 (similar to 13-22 km) is -0.25 +/- 0.12 K/decade over 1979-2005, consistent with observed estimates from three versions of this satellite record. The models and an extended satellite data set comprised of SSU with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A show weaker global stratospheric cooling over 1998-2016 compared to the period of intensive ozone depletion (1979-1997). This is due to the reduction in ozone-induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the late 1990s. In summary, the results show much better consistency between simulated and satellite-observed stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) for the previous versions of the SSU record and chemistry-climate models. The improved agreement mainly comes from updates to the satellite records; the range of stratospheric temperature trends over 1979-2005 simulated in Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative models is comparable to the previous generation of chemistry-climate models.Plain Language Summary A previous analysis by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579) showed substantial differences between satellite-observed and model-simulated stratospheric cooling trends since the late 1970s. Here we compare recently revised and extended satellite temperature records with new simulations from 14 chemistry-climate models. The results show much better agreement in the magnitude of stratospheric cooling over 1979-2005 between models and observations. This cooling was predominantly driven by increasing greenhouse gases and declining stratospheric ozone levels. An extended satellite temperature record and the chemistry-climate models show weaker global stratospheric cooling over 1998-2016 compared to 1979-1997. This is due to the reduction in ozone-induced cooling from the slowdown of ozone trends and the onset of ozone recovery since the late 1990s. There are larger differences in the latitudinal structure of past stratospheric temperature trends due to the effects of unforced atmospheric variability. In summary, the results show much better consistency between simulated and satellite-observed stratospheric temperature trends than was reported by Thompson et al. (2012, https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11579 ) for the previous versions of the satellite record and last generation of chemistry-climate models. The improved agreement mainly comes from updates to the satellite records, while the range of simulated trends is comparable to the previous generation of models.

TI  - Benefits of Seasonal Climate Prediction and Satellite Data for Forecasting US Maize Yield
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal agricultural production forecasting is essential for agricultural supply chain and economic prediction. However, to what extent seasonal climate prediction and remote sensing observations can improve crop yield forecasting at regional scale remains unknown. Using a statistical seasonal forecasting framework for U.S. county-level maize yield, we demonstrated that (1) incorporating satellite-based enhanced vegetation index (EVI) significantly improved the yield forecasting performance, compared with other climate-only models using monthly air temperature (T), precipitation (P), and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). (2) The bias-corrected climate prediction from the Coupled Forecast System model version 2 (CFSv2) showed better yield forecasting performance than the historical climate ensemble. (3) Using the "T + P + VPD + EVI" model with climate prediction from bias-corrected climate prediction from CFSv2 outperformed the yield forecast in the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates reports released by the United States Department of Agriculture, with root-mean-square error of 4.37 bushels per acre (2.79% of multiyear averaged yield) by early August.Plain Language Summary Given the significant advances in both seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing, these data have not been fully used in crop yield forecasting at regional scale, and their benefits are to be quantified compared to survey-based approaches. Here we evaluated the benefits of using seasonal climate prediction and satellite remote sensing data in forecasting U.S. maize yield at both national and county levels. To achieve this goal, we built a seasonal forecasting system for U.S. maize yield by bridging the most advanced seasonal climate prediction products from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) with a statistical crop modeling framework. We found we could not achieve a better forecasting performance than the official survey-based forecast from United States Department of Agriculture until we used both climate and remote sensing observations in our model. Compared with using historical climate information for the unknown future in each growing season, using climate prediction from NCEP gave better forecasting performance once we corrected the bias in the seasonal climate prediction products. Using our climate-remote sensing combined model and bias-corrected climate prediction from NCEP, we achieved a better forecasting performance than the United States Department of Agriculture forecast. Our system will be useful for the stakeholders in the agriculture industry and commodity market.

TI  - Sand Mineralogy Within the Bagnold Dunes, Gale Crater, as Observed In Situ and From Orbit
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Curiosity investigated active eolian sands near linear dunes during Phase 2 of the Bagnold Dunes campaign in Gale crater, Mars. Ogunquit Beach, a sample scooped from a large-ripple trough within the Mount Desert Island ripple field and delivered to the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) X-ray diffraction instrument, is dominated by basaltic igneous minerals and X-ray amorphous materials. CheMin mineralogy of the Gobabeb sample acquired at a large-ripple crest on the Namib barchan dune during Phase 1 is similar to Ogunquit Beach. Ogunquit Beach, however, contains more plagioclase and Gobabeb contains more olivine. Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM)-based estimates of mineralogy at the optical surface of Namib Dune and Mount Desert Island demonstrate that surface sands are enriched in olivine and depleted in plagioclase over Mount Desert Island relative to Namib Dune. Differences between CheMin-derived and CRISM-derived mineralogies suggest sorting by grain size on bedform to dune field scales. Crystal chemistry from CheMin suggests contributions from multiple igneous sources and the local bedrock.Plain Language Summary Remote sensing data from orbit indicate that wind-blown sands in the Bagnold Dune Field in Gale crater, Mars, are sorted by their composition. The Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover studied the Bagnold Dune Field at two locations to investigate the chemical and mineral composition of the sands and why they are sorted across the dune field. Data from Curiosity show distinct differences between the minerals in the upwind portion of the dune field compared to the downwind portion, but these differences are not the same as those observed from orbit. The scale and location of the sampling by Curiosity compared to orbiters explains the discrepancy between the two techniques. Results from both techniques suggest subtle differences in mineralogy within a single dune and across the dune field that can be explained by sorting from wind and contribution from the erosion of local bedrock.

TI  - Parameter uncertainty analysis for an operational hydrological model using residual-based and limits of acceptability approaches
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Parameter uncertainty estimation is one of the major challenges in hydrological modeling. Here we present parameter uncertainty analysis of a recently released distributed conceptual hydrological model applied in the Nea catchment, Norway. Two variants of the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) methodologies, one based on the residuals and the other on the limits of acceptability, were employed. Streamflow and remote sensing snow cover data were used in conditioning model parameters and in model validation. When using the GLUE limit of acceptability (GLUE LOA) approach, a streamflow observation error of 25% was assumed. Neither the original limits nor relaxing the limits up to a physically meaningful value yielded a behavioral model capable of predicting streamflow within the limits in 100% of the observations. As an alternative to relaxing the limits, the requirement for the percentage of model predictions falling within the original limits was relaxed. An empirical approach was introduced to define the degree of relaxation. The result shows that snow- and water-balance-related parameters induce relatively higher streamflow uncertainty than catchment response parameters. Comparable results were obtained from behavioral models selected using the two GLUE methodologies.

TI  - The 2013-2014 vegetation structure map of Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, produced using free satellite images and software
T2  - KOEDOE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation mapping of protected areas is a cornerstone of conservation worldwide. Established in 1928 and covering over 1.4 million hectares, Hwange National Park (HNP) is the largest natural reserve in Zimbabwe. In 1993, the sole comprehensive map of its vegetation to date was produced and since then it has been used in numerous research and conservation endeavours. Over the last two decades, however, the park's vegetation changed, safari areas and forest reserves were created at its edge and high-positional accuracy data on a suite of species were collected. To tend to contemporary mapping needs, in this article, we present the 2013-2014 vegetation structure map of HNP and its surroundings. It was produced by supervised classification of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images, indices derived from these and the Landsat Tree Cover Continuous Field product. Its accuracy was assessed statistically using samples collected from high-resolution satellite imagery and basic ancillary field data. Of its total pixels, 83.2% were correctly classified. Mean omission and commission error were, respectively, 0.82 (0.74-0.90) and 0.82 (0.72-0.89), and this similarity held on a per class basis, indicating reliable area estimates. It was produced using only freely available imagery and software.Conservation implications: In addition to providing researchers and conservationists working within and around HNP with an updated vegetation map, aiming at an even broader audience, we provide a step-by-step approach for using modern freely available imagery and software for cost-effectively mapping HNP in future or other protected savannas across Africa.

TI  - Cloud Microphysical Factors Affecting Simulations of Deep Convection During the Presummer Rainy Season in Southern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The sensitivity of subtropical deep convection to the parameterization of cloud microphysics is elucidated through high-resolution modeling of extreme presummer rainfall over southern China. An ensemble of physics configuration experiments is used to identify several drivers of model errors in comparison to radar observations from the South China Monsoon Rainfall Experiment (SCMREX) and remotely sensed estimates of cloud, precipitation, and radiation from satellites in the A-train constellation. The benefits of increasing the number of prognostic variables in the microphysics scheme is assessed, relative to the effects of the parameterization of cloud microphysical properties and cloud fraction diagnosis. By matching individual parameterizations between the microphysical configurations, it is shown that a small subset of the parameterization changes can reproduce most of the dependence of model performance on physics configuration. In particular, biases that are due to the low-level clouds and rain are strongly influenced by cloud fraction diagnosis and raindrop size distribution, whereas variations in the effects of high clouds are strongly influenced by differences in the parameterization of ice crystal sedimentation. Hence, for the case studied here, these parameterizations give more insight into the causes of variability in model performance than does the number of model prognostics per se.

TI  - Cloud Top Phase Distributions of Simulated Deep Convective Clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based observations of the thermodynamic cloud phase are frequently used for the analysis of aerosol indirect effects and other regional and temporal trends of cloud properties; yet they are mostly limited to the cloud top layers. This study addresses the information content in cloud top phase distributions of deep convective clouds during their growing stage. A cloud-resolving model with grid spacings of 300 m and lower is used in two different setups, simulating idealized and semiidealized isolated convective clouds of different strengths. It is found that the cloud top phase distribution is systematically shifted to higher temperatures compared to the in-cloud phase distribution due to lower vertical velocities and a resultingly stronger Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process at the cloud top. Sensitivity studies show that heterogeneous freezing can modify the cloud top glaciation temperature (where the ice pixel fraction reaches 50%) and ice multiplication via rime splintering is visible in an early ice onset at temperatures around -10 degrees C. However, if the analyses are repeated with a coarsened horizontal resolution (above 1 km, similar to many satellite data sets), a significant part of this signal is lost, which limits the detectability of these microphysical fingerprints in the observable cloud top phase distribution. In addition, variation in the cloud dynamics also impacts the cloud phase distribution but cannot be quantified easily.

TI  - High Summertime Aerosol Loadings Over the Arabian Sea and Their Transport Pathways
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations show high aerosol loadings over the Arabian Sea in boreal summer, which have great impacts on the Indian monsoon due to absorbing dust aerosols. However, the compositions, origins, transport pathways, and decadal trends of these aerosols have not been well studied. In this study, using multiple satellite retrievals, a back trajectory model, and reanalysis data, we found that (1) aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Arabian Sea and Arabian Peninsula have a summer peak and dust aerosols dominate the AOD; aerosol reanalysis data tend to considerably underestimate dust AOD compared to satellite data, indicating challenges of extracting dust from total AOD; (2) aerosols over the Arabian Sea are largely transported from South and East Arabian Peninsula by cyclonic winds in the lower troposphere (850 hPa) and from Iran-Afghanistan-Pakistan by anticyclonic winds in the middle troposphere (500 hPa); (3) both case studies and composite analyses show that extremely high aerosol loadings over the Arabian Sea is associated with an abnormally low pressure over the Arabian Sea and the Middle East; and (4) significant positive trends in AOD over the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea exist during 2000-2011 but disappear during 2000-2016, indicating a strong interdecadal variability of dust activities. This study revealed pathways linking dust emissions in the Middle East to high summertime AOD over the Arabian Sea and identified the atmospheric conditions favorable for dust emissions and transport.Plain Language Summary Tiny particles in air are of great importance in climate system by changing the Earth's radiation balance and clouds. Satellites observe very high concentrations of particles over the Arabian Sea and the Middle East in the boreal summer. This study examined the chemical compositions of these particles over the Arabian Sea and their origins, transport pathways, and long-term changes using multiple satellite products, numerical simulations, and statistical methods. It is found that dust aerosols dominate the particles over the Arabian Sea in the summer. These dust aerosols are lifted from the dry deserts over the Arabian Peninsula to the air and transported to the Arabian Sea under favorable wind patterns. The findings here can benefit future studies on interactions between the Middle East dust particles and regional climate.

TI  - Application of an LAI Inversion Algorithm Based on the Unified Model of Canopy Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function to the Heihe River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important parameters of vegetation canopy structure, which can represent the growth conditions of vegetation effectively. The accuracy, availability, and timeliness of LAI data can be improved greatly, which is of great importance to vegetation-related research. There are various types of vegetation and terrain conditions in the Heihe River Basin, the second largest inland river basin in northwest China. It is not only helpful to evaluate the accuracy of LAI retrieval algorithms for the complex land surface but also useful to understand the fragile ecological status of the Heihe River Basin. In contrast to previous LAI inversion models, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function unified model can be applied for both continuous and discrete vegetation, and it is appropriate for analyzing heterogeneous vegetation distributions. In this work, we produced 30-m LAI products once a month in the growing season of 2012. Results show that the algorithm can effectively retrieve LAIs. We verified the LAI product using field measurement data. The mean absolute errors in forest, farmland, and sparse grassland are 0.44, 0.56, and 0.38 respectively, and the R-2 is 0.8736. Further analysis shows that main errors come from three parts: errors in the parameters, mistakes in the vegetation classification, and interval of the look-up table. Mixed pixel is also a problem for this model. Despite this, high resolution and applicability means this algorithm can be a good approach for LAI retrieval.

TI  - The shift in rabies epidemiology in France: time to adjust rabies post-exposure risk assessment
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The epidemiology of rabies in France and western Europe has changed during the past 22 years. In France, rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals was declared to be eliminated in 2001, and the risk of rabies is now limited to contact with bats, rabid animals illegally imported from rabies-enzootic countries and traveller exposure in enzootic areas. We analysed the epidemiology of rabies in France from 1995 to 2016, describing and analysing data on human rabies surveillance as well as data on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) collected from the network of French antirabies clinics. Over the study period, seven individuals were diagnosed with rabies in France, all of whom were infected outside mainland France. PEP data analysis revealed an expected overall decrease in PEP administration for individuals exposed in mainland France, but there was still overuse of anti-rabies drugs, given the very low epidemiological risk. On the other hand, a significant increase in PEP delivered to individuals exposed abroad was evidenced. These epidemiological trends indicate that clear guidelines should be provided to support physicians' efforts to adjust rabies risk assessment to the evolution of the epidemiological situation.

TI  - Uptake and effectiveness of influenza vaccine in those aged 65 years and older in the United Kingdom, influenza seasons 2010/11 to 2016/17
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2016/17, seasonal influenza vaccine was less effective in those aged 65 years and older in the United Kingdom. We describe the uptake, influenza-associated mortality and adjusted vaccine effectiveness (aVE) in this age group over influenza seasons 2010/11-2016/17. Methods: Vaccine uptake in 2016/17 and five previous seasons were measured using a sentinel general practitioners cohort in England; the test-negative case-control design was used to estimate pooled aVE by subtype and age group against laboratory-confirmed influenza in primary care from 2010-2017. Results: Vaccine uptake was 64% in 65-69-year-olds, 74% in 70-74-year-olds and 80% in those aged 75 and older. Overall aVE was 32.5% (95% CI: 11.6 to 48.5); aVE by sub-type was 60.8% (95% CI: 33.9 to 76.7) and 50.0% (95% CI: 21.6 to 68.1) against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and influenza B, respectively, but only 5.6% (95% CI: -39.2 to 35.9) against A(H3N2). Against all laboratory-confirmed influenza aVE was 45.2% (95% CI: 25.1 to 60.0) in 65-74 year olds; -26.2% (95% CI: -149.3 to 36.0) in 75-84 year olds and -3.2% (95% CI: -237.8 to 68.5) in those aged 85 years and older. Influenza-attributable mortality was highest in seasons dominated by A(H3N2). Conclusions: Vaccine uptake with non-adjuvanted, normal-dose vaccines remained high, with evidence of effectiveness against influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 and B, though poor against A(H3N2), particularly in those aged 75 years and older. Forthcoming availability of newly licensed vaccines with wider use of antivirals can potentially further improve prevention and control of influenza in this group.

TI  - Lymph Node Cellular Dynamics in Cancer and HIV: What Can We Learn for the Follicular CD4 (Tfh) Cells?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph nodes (LNs) are central in the generation of adaptive immune responses. Follicular helper CD4 T (Tfh) cells, a highly differentiated CD4 population, provide critical help for the development of antigen-specific B cell responses within the germinal center. Throughout the past decade, numerous studies have revealed the important role of Tfh cells in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) pathogenesis as well as in the development of neutralizing antibodies post-infection and post-vaccination. It has also been established that tumors influence various immune cell subsets not only in their proximity, but also in draining lymph nodes. The role of local or tumor associated lymph node Tfh cells in disease progression is emerging. Comparative studies of Tfh cells in chronic infections and cancer could therefore provide novel information with regards to their differentiation plasticity and to the mechanisms regulating their development.

TI  - Global 5km resolution estimates of secondary evaporation including irrigation through satellite data assimilation
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A portion of globally generated surface and groundwater resources evaporates from wetlands, waterbodies and irrigated areas. This secondary evaporation of "blue" water directly affects the remaining water resources available for ecosystems and human use. At the global scale, a lack of detailed water balance studies and direct observations limits our understanding of the magnitude and spatial and temporal distribution of secondary evaporation. Here, we propose a methodology to assimilate satellite-derived information into the landscape hydrological model W3 at an unprecedented 0.05 degrees, or ca. 5 km resolution globally. The assimilated data are all derived from MODIS observations, including surface water extent, surface albedo, vegetation cover, leaf area index, canopy conductance and land surface temperature (LST). The information from these products is imparted on the model in a simple but efficient manner, through a combination of direct insertion of the surface water extent, an evaporation flux adjustment based on LST and parameter nudging for the other observations. The resulting water balance estimates were evaluated against river basin discharge records and the water balance of closed basins and demonstrably improved water balance estimates compared to ignoring secondary evaporation (e.g., bias improved from +38 to +2 mm yr(-1)). The evaporation estimates derived from assimilation were combined with global mapping of irrigation crops to derive a minimum estimate of irrigation water requirements (I-0), representative of optimal irrigation efficiency. Our I-0 estimates were lower than published country-level estimates of irrigation water use produced by alternative estimation methods, for reasons that are discussed. We estimate that 16% of globally generated water resources evaporate before reaching the oceans, enhancing total terrestrial evaporation by 6.1 x 10(12) m(3) yr(-1) or 8.8 %. Of this volume, 5% is evaporated from irrigation areas, 58% from terrestrial waterbodies and 37% from other surfaces. Model-data assimilation at even higher spatial resolutions can achieve a further reduction in uncertainty but will require more accurate and detailed mapping of surface water dynamics and areas equipped for irrigation.

TI  - Cause-specific mortality as a sentinel indicator of current socioeconomic conditions in Italy
T2  - DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDIn the last few years the need for disaggregated statistics at small territorial levels to monitor the social and economic conditions of the various areas of a country has increased considerably. The question of how to define these indicators has been the topic of a recent international debate.OBJECTIVEThis study aims to assess whether simple, widely available demographic indexes, like mortality measures, may serve as sentinel indicators of economic development and social wellbeing in Italy.METHODSWe analyse and compare the geographical patterns of the infant mortality rate and of the mortality rates for leading causes of death with the spatial pattern found for a more complex index, the vulnerability index, recently introduced by the Italian National Institute for Statistics at the provincial level in contemporary Italy.RESULTSMortality from leading causes of death such as diseases of the circulatory system, and mortality from increasingly emergent causes of death such as diabetes, may offer a valid statistic to grasp economic development and social wellbeing in Italy today.CONCLUSIONSOur findings are important because policymakers need to rely on indicators with the following fundamental properties: easy availability, clear definition, temporal continuity, and spatial comparability.CONTRIBUTIONThis study contributes to the literature by showing that mortality data is a straightforward and powerful tool to help policymakers plan appropriate interventions.

TI  - Erythrocyte-binding assays reveal higher binding of <i>Plasmodium knowlesi</i> Duffy binding protein to human Fy<SUP>a+/b+</SUP> erythrocytes than to Fy<SUP>a+/b-</SUP> erythrocytes
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The merozoite of the zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi invades human erythrocytes via the binding of its Duffy binding protein (PkDBPaII) to the Duffy antigen on the eythrocytes. The Duffy antigen has two immunologically distinct forms, Fy(a) and Fy(b). In this study, the erythrocyte-binding assay was used to quantitatively determine and compare the binding level of PkDBPaII to Fy(a+/b+) and Fy(a+/b-) human erythrocytes.Results: In the erythrocyte-binding assay, binding level was determined by scoring the number of rosettes that were formed by erythrocytes surrounding transfected mammalian COS-7 cells which expressed PkDBPaII. The assay result revealed a significant difference in the binding level. The number of rosettes scored for Fy(a+/b+) was 1.64-fold higher than that of Fy(a+/b-) (155.50 +/- 34.32 and 94.75 +/- 23.16 rosettes, respectively; t((6)) = -2.935, P = 0.026).Conclusions: The erythrocyte-binding assay provided a simple approach to quantitatively determine the binding level of PkDBPaII to the erythrocyte Duffy antigen. Using this assay, PkDBPaII was found to display higher binding to Fy(a+/b+) erythrocytes than to Fy(a+/b-) erythrocytes.

TI  - Dual-satellite (Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8) remote sensing of supraglacial lakes in Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is commonly used to monitor supraglacial lakes on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS); however, most satellite records must trade off higher spatial resolution for higher temporal resolution (e.g. MODIS) or vice versa (e.g. Landsat). Here, we overcome this issue by developing and applying a dual-sensor method that can monitor changes to lake areas and volumes at high spatial resolution (10-30 m) with a frequent revisit time (similar to 3 days). We achieve this by mosaicking imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) with imagery from the recently launched Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) for a similar to 12 000 km(2) area of West Greenland in the 2016 melt season. First, we validate a physically based method for calculating lake depths with Sentinel-2 by comparing measurements against those derived from the available contemporaneous Landsat 8 imagery; we find close correspondence between the two sets of values (R-2 = 0.841; RMSE = 0.555 m). This provides us with the methodological basis for automatically calculating lake areas, depths, and volumes from all available Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. These automatic methods are incorporated into an algorithm for Fully Automated Supraglacial lake Tracking at Enhanced Resolution (FASTER). The FASTER algorithm produces time series showing lake evolution during the 2016 melt season, including automated rapid (<= 4 day) lake-drainage identification. With the dual Sentinel-2-Landsat 8 record, we identify 184 rapidly draining lakes, many more than identified with either imagery collection alone (93 with Sentinel-2; 66 with Landsat 8), due to their inferior temporal resolution, or would be possible with MODIS, due to its omission of small lakes < 0.125 km(2). Finally, we estimate the water volumes drained into the GrIS during rapid-lake-drainage events and, by analysing downscaled regional climate-model (RACMO2.3p(2)) run-off data, the water quantity that enters the GrIS via the moulins opened by such events. We find that during the lake-drainage events alone, the water drained by small lakes (< 0.125 km(2)) is only 5.1% of the total water volume drained by all lakes. However, considering the total water volume entering the GrIS after lake drainage, the moulins opened by small lakes deliver 61.5% of the total water volume delivered via the moulins opened by large and small lakes; this is because there are more small lakes, allowing more moulins to open, and because small lakes are found at lower elevations than large lakes, where run-off is higher. These findings suggest that small lakes should be included in future remote-sensing and modelling work.

TI  - Ecological Vulnerability Assessment in Beijing Based on GIS Spatial Analysis
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of urbanization and industrialization, ecological environment problems have been increasing imminently. Ecological vulnerability has become a hot spot study area of global change and land use/ cover change. This paper demonstrates an illustrative analytical framework for assessing ecological vulnerability in Beijing City by spatial principal component analysis resolutions. And ecological vulnerability index system for multiple spatial variables, based on remote sensing data of the year of 2013 and other aspects of spatial ecological environment data, was established from ecological sensitivity index (ESI) , ecological elasticity index (EEI) and ecological pressure index (EPI). The results are as follows : (1) Beijing's overall ecological vulnerability is at medium level, but the urban vulnerability index is higher than other districts ( extremely high and highly vulnerable areas account for 34% of the total area of Beijing) , and the vulnerability index of mountain forest areas are relatively lower ( general vulnerability areas account for 11% of total areas). (2) The weight coefficients of ecology sensitivity, elasticity and pressure are 0. 196, 0. 526 and 0. 278. (3) EVI, ESI, EEI, EPI are closely related to LUCC for significant correlations, and the correlation between construction land and EVI is the largest (Pearson correlation coefficient is 0. 80) . In short, ecological protection measures have good effects on ecological restoration, and some effective measures should be carried out for urban ecological protection.

TI  - Partial randomness hashing applied to remote sensing object classification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, object classification of remote sensing images has attracted more and more research interests due to the development of satellite and aerial vehicle technologies. Hashing learning is an efficient method to handle the huge amount of the remote sensing data. We proposed a hashing learning method named partial randomness supervised discrete hashing (PRSDH), which combines data-dependent methods and data-independent methods. It jointly learns a discrete binary codes generation and partial random constraint optimization model. By random projection, the computation complexity is reduced effectively. With the weight matrix derived from the training data, the semantic similarity between the data can be well preserved while generating the hashing codes. For the discrete constraint problem, this paper adopts the discrete cyclic coordinate descent algorithm to optimize the codes bit by bit. The experimental results show that PRSDH outperforms other comparative methods and demonstrate that PRSDH has good adaptability to the characteristic of remote sensing object.

TI  - Descriptive epidemiology of varicella based on national surveillance data before and after the introduction of routine varicella vaccination with two doses in Japan, 2000-2017
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Routine childhood immunization using two doses of the varicella vaccine was introduced in Japan in October 2014. In this study, we analyzed the data extracted from national varicella surveillance, including pediatric sentinel surveillance from 2000 to 2017 and hospitalized varicella surveillance from the 38th week of 2014 to the 37th week of 2017. Compared with the 2000-2011 baseline data, the number of varicella cases per sentinel decreased substantially by 76.6% overall and by 88.2% among children aged 1-4 years in 2017. Of 997 hospitalized patients, we found a decreasing trend in the number of cases among children aged <5 years. We also found a decreasing trend in the number of cases with complications among children aged 1-4 years. Data on the self-reported transmission sites in 35.5% (354/997) of the hospitalized varicella patients showed that transmission of varicella zoster virus (VZV) occurred frequently in household, at school for young children, in the workplace for adults, and at hospital for all age groups. Data from 29.0% (289/997) of the hospitalized patients with a self-reported source of infection showed that transmission of VZV occurred from a patient with herpes zoster (HZ) in 30.4% (88/289) of cases. Our data demonstrate a substantial decrease in the number of varicella cases in young children following introduction of routine childhood vaccination program with two-dose varicella vaccination in Japan. These data highlight the unique aspects of transmission sites across age groups and the important role of HZ cases in disease circulation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Exploring the stability and residual response versus scan angle effects in SNPP VIIRS sensor data record reflectance products using deep convective clouds
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflective solar bands (RSB) of the Visible and Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite are calibrated using solar diffuser and lunar observations. To evaluate the performance of the VIIRS RSB calibration, the deep convective clouds (DCC) are utilized as invariant targets to assess the stability of NASA's VIIRS sensor data record (SDR) reflectance product for 10 moderate resolution bands (M-bands, M1 to M5 and M7 to M11) and three imagery resolution bands (I-bands, I1 to I3). All the frames along with each scan are divided into six aggregation zones for the scan angle. An empirical bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction is performed to SDR reflectances over DCC to reduce the scattering anisotropy in view and solar angles. The BRDF-corrected reflectances are used to assess the stability and to explore the residual RVS effects for selected bands. Results of this study show that after more than 6 years of on-orbit operation, the use of the prelaunch-based RVS still meets the radiometric requirement for the VIIRS RSB. Examination of the small but noticeable RVS residuals indicates they occur in a few shortest wavelength bands based on a time-dependent quadratic fit of the reflectance trends obtained at all scan angle zones. As the mission continues, continuing monitoring of on-orbit RVS stability and its effects on VIIRS SDR reflectance products are necessary with the DCC technique in the future VIIRS calibrations to ensure the quality of the RSB SDR products.

TI  - Monitoring of seasonal variability and movement of suspended sediment concentrations along the Thiruvananthapuram coast, southern India, using the Landsat OLI sensor
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on suspended sediment concentrations at a seasonal scale play a vital role in understanding coastal hydrodynamic processes in an area. Assessment of spatio-temporal changes in suspended sediments in nearshore areas has gained complexity due to the utilization of conventional methods; this issue can be successfully solved nowadays using multi-temporal remotely sensed images with the help of advanced image processing techniques. The present study is an attempt to demonstrate the model algorithm used to extract suspended sediment concentrations using Landsat 8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensor images. The study was executed in a near-offshore area of the Thiruvananthapuram coast, southern India, and focused on the extraction of suspended sediment concentrations and their seasonal variability during pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The OLI images were pre-processed to obtain the actual reflectance using the FLASSH module of the ENVI v5.5 software. The generic model developed herein is designed to compute the spectral reflectance variability between coastal water and suspended sediments and to differentiate the spatial accumulation of the suspended sediment concentrations from the coastal water at the pixel scale. Maximum (0.8 % in near-infrared bands) and minimum (0.6 % in blue bands) spectral reflectance indicates the occurrence of suspended sediments in the coastal water. The model-derived results revealed that the suspended sediment concentration gradually decreased with increasing depth and distance from the shoreline. Higher sediment concentrations accumulated at lower depths in coastal water due to wave and current action that seasonally circulated the sediments. This higher concentration of the suspended sediment load was estimated to be 0.92 mg L-1 at the shallow depths (< 10m) of the coastal waters and 0.30 mg L-1 at a depth of 30 m. Seasonal variability of suspended sediments was observed in a north-south direction during the pre-monsoon; the reverse was noted during the post-monsoon period. The spatial variability of suspended sediments was indirectly proportional to the depth and distance from the shoreline, and directly proportional to offshore wave and littoral current activity. This study proves that the developed model coupled with the provided computational algorithm can be used as an effective tool for the estimation of suspended sediment concentrations using multi-temporal OLI images; furthermore, the output may be helpful for coastal zone management and conservation planning and development.

TI  - [Pattern of lymph node metastasis and choice of lymphadenectomy in patients with thoracic esophageal squamous cancer].
T2  - Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Esophageal squamous cancer is a malignancy with high incidence and mortality. Surgery currently remains the most important part of the comprehensive treatments. The number of metastatic lymph node has great influence on the prognosis of esophageal cancer, so thorough lymphadenectomy also becomes a key factor. Meanwhile, the choice of lymphadenectomy procedure during surgery has always been controversial. In current article, we summarized the pattern in lymph node metastasis in thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by analyzing relevant literatures, and discovered that the longitudinal lymphatic network of the submucosa and the horizontal lymphatic pathways of the muscularis propria are the anatomical foundation of the lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer. Then, we evaluated the impact of lymph node metastasis on the prognosis in terms of number of metastatic lymph node, distant metastasis, positive lymph node ratio, solitary metastasis, micrometastasis and extracapsular lymph node involvement. During surgery, should we choose two-field lymphadenectomy (2-FL) or three-field lymphadenectomy (3-FL)? The clinical efficacy was compared between 2-FL and 3-FL in this paper. The results showed that compared with patients who underwent 2-FL, those who underwent 3-FL had significantly higher 5-year survival rate, significantly longer operative time, and more dissected lymph nodes, while blood loss during surgery was not significantly different. As for complication, some studies indicated that patients after 3-FL had a significantly higher risk of anastomotic leakage, recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, and tracheal ischemia, while no significant differences in pulmonary infection and chylothorax were found. At last, we introduced the application of sentinel lymph node technique and relevant research evidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve lymph node as predictive markers for cervical lymph node metastasis.

TI  - Rapid Antagonistic Coevolution in an Emerging Pathogen and Its Vertebrate Host
T2  - CURRENT BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Host-pathogen coevolution is assumed to play a key role in eco-evolutionary processes, including epidemiological dynamics and the evolution of sexual reproduction [1-4]. Despite this, direct evidence for host-pathogen coevolution is exceptional [5-7], particularly in vertebrate hosts. Indeed, although vertebrate hosts have been shown to evolve in response to pathogens or vice versa [8-12], there is little evidence for the necessary reciprocal changes in the success of both antagonists over time [13]. Here, we generate a time-shift experiment to demonstrate adaptive, reciprocal changes in North American house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) and their emerging bacterial pathogen, Mycoplasma gallisepticum [14-16]. Our experimental design is made possible by the existence of disease-exposed and unexposed finch populations, which were known to exhibit equivalent responses to experimental inoculation until the recent spread of genetic resistance in the former [14, 17]. Whereas inoculations with pathogen isolates from epidemic outbreak caused comparable sub-lethal eye swelling in hosts from exposed (hereafter adapted) and unexposed (hereafter ancestral) populations, inoculations with isolates sampled after the spread of resistance were threefold more likely to cause lethal symptoms in hosts from ancestral populations. Similarly, the probability that pathogens successfully established an infection in the primary host and, before inducing death, transmitted to an uninfected sentinel was highest when recent isolates were inoculated in hosts from ancestral populations and lowest when early isolates were inoculated in hosts from adapted populations. Our results demonstrate antagonistic host-pathogen coevolution, with hosts and pathogens displaying increased resistance and virulence in response to each other over time.

TI  - Spectral-temporal modelling of bamboo-dominated forest succession in the Atlantic Forest of Southern Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - With access to collections of continuous satellite imagery over a 40-year period, spectral-temporal patterns extracted from multi-temporal imagery offer a potential new tool to model mechanisms of forest succession and monitor changes in forested landscapes. Specifically, spectral-temporal trajectories associated with successional forest change occurring over prolonged periods of time may enhance periodic 'snapshot' monitoring methods, especially for species that exhibit complex and non-linear dynamics. In this paper, Landsat time-series are used to examine the spectral-temporal signatures of bamboo-dominated forest succession occurring within the critically threatened Araucaria Forest, a pine-dominated subtype of the Atlantic Forest in southern Brazil. Alteration of canopy structure through ongoing anthropogenic disturbance has increased understorey light climate and given opportunity for native invasive bamboos to flourish, resulting in drastic reduction of tree regeneration and loss of biodiversity. We aimed to evaluate how spectral-temporal signatures could be used to (1) characterize stages of bamboo-dominated forest succession, (2) identify synchrony of bamboo lifecycle dynamics and (3) classify regions of bamboo-dominated forest. Changepoint analysis was performed using an extracted sample spectral-temporal signature and trajectories were fit to the resulting segments using linear regression. Based on slope values of the fitted segments, a novel description incorporating temporal information of bamboo-dominated forest succession was developed which identified four broad phases: pioneer predominance, mature bamboo, dieback and pioneer regeneration. To determine the spatial and temporal synchrony of bamboo-dominated forest succession, a hybrid model was developed by combining the modelled segments and compared to a 32-year Landsat time-series of vegetation indices by calculating root-mean square error between each pixel in the study area. The hybrid model proficiently classified regions of bamboo-dominance, achieving between 77% and 90% accuracy, which also indicated lifecycle synchrony of bamboo populations within the study area. To further assess the performance of the hybrid model, a time-weighted dynamic time warping model approach was used to determine synchrony and classify regions of bamboo. The time weighted dynamic time warping classifier had lower overall accuracy (68%-82%), but is still considered a useful tool for automated classification purposes that take advantage of multi-temporal imagery. To compare classification performance between 'snapshot' and multi-temporal imagery classifiers, a maximum-likelihood classification was performed, which attained lower overall accuracies than the hybrid model (75%-84%). Overall, the use of spectral-temporal signatures offers a novel and effective approach to both describing and modelling bamboo-dominated forest succession (and forest successional processes more generally) on a landscape-scale.

TI  - Developing an integrated index based on phenological metrics for evaluating cadmium stress in rice using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effectively assessing cadmium (Cd) contamination in crops is crucial for the sustainable development of an agricultural ecosystem and for environmental security. We developed an integrated stress index (SI) based on two phenological metrics to effectively evaluate Cd stress in rice crops. The selected four experimental areas are located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province, China. Six Sentinel-2 images were acquired in 2017, and heavy metal concentrations in soil were measured. The change rate of CIre (CRCIre) and the time-integrated CIre (TICIre) were obtained from daily red-edge chlorophyll index (CIre) time-series using Sentinel-2 data. The CRCIre and TICIre were used to characterize the photosynthetic rate and biomass, respectively. SI was calculated by Fisher discriminant analysis based on CRCIre and TICIre from two experimental areas, and it was verified using another two experimental areas. The results were the following: (i) when SI >= 0, rice was under mild stress and when SI < 0, rice was under severe stress. (ii) The SI effectively evaluated Cd stress levels with an overall discriminatory accuracy of 86.02%. This research provides a potential new method to evaluate Cd stress in rice by remote sensing through phenology. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Precipitation instruments at Rothera Station, Antarctic Peninsula: a comparative study
T2  - POLAR RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Direct measurement of precipitation in the Antarctic using ground-based instruments is important to validate the results from climate models, reanalyses and satellite observations. Quantifying precipitation in Antarctica faces many unique challenges such as wind and other technical difficulties due to the harsh environment. This study compares a variety of precipitation measurements in Antarctica, including satellite data and reanalysis fields atRothera Station, Antarctica Peninsula. The tipping bucket gauges (TBGs) were less sensitive than laser-based sensors (LBSs). The most sensitive LBS (Visibility and Present Weather Sensor, VPF-730) registered 276 precipitation days, while the most sensitive TBG (Universal Precipitation Gauge, UPG-1000) detected 152 precipitation days. Case studies of the precipitation and seasonal accumulation results show the VPF-730 to be the most reliable precipitation sensor of the evaluated instruments. The precipitation amounts given by the reanalyses were positively correlated with wind speed. The precipitation from the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis was most affected by wind speed. Case studies also show that during low wind periods, precipitation measurements from the instruments were very close to the precipitation measurement given by the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) 1-degree-daily (1DD) data. During strong wind events, the GPCP 1DD did not fully capture the effect of wind, accounting for the relatively small precipitation amount. The Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM) and Campbell Scientific-700 (CS700H) experienced instrumental errors during the study, which caused the precipitation readings to become exceedingly high and low, respectively. Installing multiple LBSs in different locations (in close proximity) can help identify inconsistency in the readings.

TI  - Diel light cycle as a key factor for modelling phytoplankton biogeography and diversity
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the mechanisms driving species biogeography and biodiversity remains a major challenge in phytoplankton ecology. Using a model of two phytoplankton species with a gleaner-opportunist trade-off and competing for light and a limiting nutrient, we show that the diel light cycle may be an essential factor to explain large-scale ecological patterns. When only the seasonal light cycle is considered (control scenario) the model predicts that, independently of the nutrient supply, gleaners should dominate across all latitudes and opportunists can obtain a temporal niche only at high latitudes. However, the diel light cycle makes the competition outcome also a function of nutrient supply by affecting the amplitude of diel nutrient oscillations, with gleaners dominating when nutrient supply is low, opportunists when nutrient supply is high, and both species coexisting at intermediate levels of nutrient supply. The combined effects of seasonal and diel light cycles (diel scenario) shape a latitudinal diversity gradient with decreasing diversity towards higher latitudes and a unimodal dependence of diversity on nutrient supply and, therefore, on ecosystem productivity. The proposed mechanism can help interpret the biogeography of major phytoplankton functional groups in the global ocean and link them with large-scale biodiversity patterns.

TI  - Filling method for soil moisture based on BP neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture data obtained by inversion of Fengyun 3B remote sensing data, are widely used in drought monitoring and global climate change research, however, some regional data are missing in this data set, which reduces the application effect. Based on backpropagation neural network (BPNN), we established a filling method and filled the missing area with moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) inversion products, including land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and albedo. We named it the multilayer BPNN filling algorithm. The algorithm consists of two neural network layers. The first network layer is used for the spatial scaling of MODIS inversion products, and the second network layer uses the scaling products to further generate soil moisture values. We compared the proposed method to a discrete cosine transform and partial least square (DCT-PLS) and a kriging using the same data set. The experiments demonstrate that our method could obtain good filling results in both homogeneous areas and areas with high data variations, whereas DCT-PLS and kriging could only get good filling results in homogeneous areas.

TI  - Subpixel mapping and confusion matrix analysis of plant functional types in peatlands using MESMA applied to AISA Eagle imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the spatial distribution of fractional cover of plant functional types is important for peatland ecosystems analysis. Using a crisp classification to produce a map of the spatial patterns of plant functional types in peatlands is difficult due to their complex and heterogeneous characteristics. We applied multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) on Airborne Imaging Spectrometer for Applications Eagle data to generate fractional covers of peatland plant functional types and further to assess the accuracy of soft classification at the subpixel scale. This was achieved by constructing the spectral library and selecting the optimal endmembers models (two-, three-, and four-endmember MESMA models) to derive the peatland plant functional types (shrub, graminoid, moss, and forbs) fractional covers. The final fractional cover pattern in each case was produced by joining the results from the multiendmembers models as judged by the root mean squared error thresholds to select the best-fit model for each pixel by minimization of pixel-scale fraction errors. Based on the thresholds, the three- and four-endmember MESMA models and their combination were further tested for their performance using an independent in situ dataset of the four-plant functional types. Their accuracy performance was quantified by a subpixel confusion matrix and residual analysis. The results showed that the combined MESMA model was most accurate in deriving the patterns of fractional cover for shrub, graminoid, and moss compared with the performance of the three- and four-endmember MESMA models. However, all models performed poorly in predicting the fractional cover of the sparsely distributed forbs. The results demonstrate the superiority of MESMA models in extracting the patterns of different plant functional types in peatlands as judged by the accuracy of subpixel fractional extraction.

TI  - Genome-wide analysis of polymorphism x sodium interaction effect on blood pressure identifies a novel 3′-<i>BCL11B</i> gene desert locus
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Excessive sodium intake is a global risk factor for hypertension. Sodium effects on blood pressure vary from person to person; hence, high-risk group targeting based on personal genetic information can play a complementary role to ongoing population preventive approaches to reduce sodium consumption. To identify genetic factors that modulate sodium effects on blood pressure, we conducted a population-based genome-wide interaction analysis in 8,768 Japanese subjects, which was >3 times larger than a similar previous study. We tested 7,135,436 polymorphisms in the discovery cohort, and loci that met suggestive significance were further examined in an independent replication cohort. We found that an interaction between a novel 3' -BCL118 gene desert locus and daily sodium consumption was significantly associated with systolic blood pressure in both discovery and replication cohorts under the recessive model. Further statistical analysis of rs8022678, the sentinel variant of the 3' - BCL118 gene desert locus, showed that differences in mean systolic blood pressure between high and low sodium consumption subgroups were 5.9 mm Hg (P = 8.8 x 10(-12)) in rs8022678 A carriers and -0.3 mm Hg (P = 0.27) in rs8022678 A non-carriers, suggesting that the rs8022678 genotype can classify persons into sodium-sensitive (A carriers) and sodium-insensitive (A non-carriers) subgroups. Our results implied that rs8022678 A carriers may receive a greater benefit from sodium-lowering interventions than non-carriers.

TI  - A weekly, continually updated dataset of the probability of large wildfires across western US forests and woodlands
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - There is broad consensus that wildfire activity is likely to increase in western US forests and woodlands over the next century. Therefore, spatial predictions of the potential for large wildfires have immediate and growing relevance to near- and long-term research, planning, and management objectives. Fuels, climate, weather, and the landscape all exert controls on wildfire occurrence and spread, but the dynamics of these controls vary from daily to decadal timescales. Accurate spatial predictions of large wildfires should therefore strive to integrate across these variables and timescales. Here, we describe a high spatial resolution dataset (250m pixel) of the probability of large wildfires ( > 405 ha) across forests and woodlands in the contiguous western US, from 2005 to the present. The dataset is automatically updated on a weekly basis using Google Earth Engine and a "continuous integration" pipeline. Each image in the dataset is the output of a random forest machine-learning algorithm, trained on random samples of historic small and large wildfires and represents the predicted conditional probability of an individual pixel burning in a large fire, given an ignition or fire spread to that pixel. This novel workflow is able to integrate the near- term dynamics of fuels and weather into weekly predictions while also integrating longer-term dynamics of fuels, the climate, and the landscape. As a continually updated product, the dataset can provide operational fire managers with contemporary, onthe- ground information to closely monitor the changing potential for large wildfire occurrence and spread. It can also serve as a foundational dataset for longer-term planning and research, such as the strategic targeting of fuels management, fire-smart development at the wildland-urban interface, and the analysis of trends in wildfire potential over time. Weekly large fire probability GeoTiff products from 2005 to 2017 are archived on the Figshare online digital repository with the DOI https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5765967 (available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5765967.v1). Weekly GeoTiff products and the entire dataset from 2005 onwards are also continually uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket at https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/wffr-preds/V1 (last access: 14 September 2018) and are available free of charge with a Google account. Continually updated products and the long-term archive are also available to registered Google Earth Engine (GEE) users as public GEE assets and can be accessed with the image collection ID "users/mgray/wffr-preds" within GEE.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy mapped with methylene blue dye alone in patients with breast cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundMethylene blue dye is easy to obtain in developing countries and can be used in sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer. However, the accuracy of methylene blue alone for sentinel lymph node mapping in breast cancer has not been well defined. In this study, we collected data to assess the feasibility and accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy mapped with methylene blue alone in patients with breast cancer.MethodsWe searched the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases from January 1, 1993, to March 31, 2018. Selected studies had to have a defined group of patients with breast cancer in which MBD alone was used as the mapping technique for SNB.Results18 studies were included in this study. The combined identification rate was 91% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88%-94%, I-2 = 68.3%], and the false negative rate was 13% (95% CI: 9%-18%, I-2 = 36.7%). The pooled sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy rate were 87% (95% CI: 82%-91%, I-2 = 37.5%), 91% (95% CI: 87%-93%, I-2 = 32.4%) and 94% (95% CI: 92%-96%, I-2 = 29%), respectively.ConclusionsThis meta-analysis found that mapping sentinel lymph node locations with methylene blue dye alone results in an acceptable identification rate but an excessive false negative rate according to the American Society of Breast Surgeons' recommendations. Caution is warranted when using methylene blue dye alone as the mapping method for sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - UAV-based hyperspectral analysis and spectral indices constructing for quantitatively monitoring leaf nitrogen content of winter wheat
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In flag leaf and flowering stages of winter wheat, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based and ground-measured hyperspectral data were collected simultaneously, and leaf nitrogen content (LNC) data were then measured in a laboratory. First, the accuracy of UAV-based hyperspectral data was analyzed using ground-measured hyperspectral data, and the analysis showed that the effectiveness and spectrum sampling precision of the UAV-based hyperspectral data are reliable. Hyperspectral characteristic analysis of winter wheat canopies of different LNCs was also conducted. Second, representative spectrum bands that are sensitive to the LNC of winter wheat were extracted through first-order differential spectral, continuum-removed reflectance, and band correlation prediction threshold methods. The optimal band combination that is sensitive to the LNC of winter wheat was obtained by comparing and analyzing the representative spectrum band results. Thus, several LNC spectral indices (LNCSI) were established through ratio, difference, and normalization methods, and linear regression statistical models for quantitatively simulating LNCs were established using the LNCSIs. Finally, comprehensive and comparative analyses of the LNCSIs and the inversion values of the LNC using the LNCSIs confirmed that the LNCSIs are effective in quantitatively inversing the LNC of winter wheat.

TI  - Now you see it, now you don't: a case study of ephemeral snowpacks and soil moisture response in the Great Basin, USA
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral snowpacks, or those that persist for < 60 continuous days, are challenging to observe and model because snow accumulation and ablation occur during the same season. This has left ephemeral snow understudied, despite its widespread extent. Using 328 site years from the Great Basin, we show that ephemeral snowmelt causes a 70days-earlier soil moisture response than seasonal snowmelt. In addition, deep soil moisture response was more variable in areas with seasonal snowmelt. To understand Great Basin snow distribution, we used MODIS and Snow Data Assimilation System (SNODAS) data to map snow extent. Estimates of maximum continuous snow cover duration from SNODAS consistently overestimated MODIS observations by > 25 days in the lowest (< 1500 m) and highest (> 2500 m) elevations. During this time period snowpack was highly variable. The maximum seasonal snow cover during water years 2005-2014 was 64 % in 2010 and at a minimum of 24 % in 2014. We found that elevation had a strong control on snow ephemerality, and nearly all snow-packs over 2500 m were seasonal except those on south-facing slopes. Additionally, we used SNODAS-derived estimates of solid and liquid precipitation, melt, sublimation, and blowing snow sublimation to define snow ephemerality mechanisms. In warm years, the Great Basin shifts to ephemerally dominant as the rain-snow transition increases in elevation. Given that snow ephemerality is expected to increase as a consequence of climate change, physics-based modeling is needed that can account for the complex energetics of shallow snow-packs in complex terrain. These modeling efforts will need to be supported by field observations of mass and energy and linked to finer remote sensing snow products in order to track ephemeral snow dynamics.

TI  - Near-Infrared II Dye-Protein Complex for Biomedical Imaging and Imaging-Guided Photothermal Therapy
T2  - ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of novel biodegradable and nontoxic fluorophores that integrate diagnosis and therapy for effective cancer treatment has obtained tremendous attention in the past decades. In this report, water-soluble and biocompatible small-molecule near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescent dye H2a-4T complexed with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and Cetuximab proteins with excellent optical properties and targeting ability is prepared. High spatial and temporal resolution imaging of hind limb vasculature and the lymphatic system of living mice using H2a-4T@FBS complex is demonstrated in precise NIR-II imaging-guided sentinel lymph node surgery. More importantly, H2a-4T@Cetuximab complex not only exhibits a remarkable cell-killing ability but also achieves highly active tumor targeting efficiency for epidermal growth factor receptor, overexpressing colorectal cancer which is beneficial to in vivo NIR-II fluorescent imaging-guided photothermal therapy of colon tumors. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the concept of light-harvesting complex is exploited for enhancing the NIR-II signals and photothermal energy conversion in molecule-protein complex theranostic agent, making them a promising candidate for future clinical applications in cancer theranostics.

TI  - Incidence and aetiology of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1-59 months in South Asia: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Bacterial meningitis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide among children aged 1-59 months. We aimed to describe its burden in South Asia, focusing on vaccine-preventable aetiologies.Methods: We searched five databases for studies published from January 1, 1990, to April 25, 2017. We estimated incidence and aetiology-specific proportions using random-effects meta-analysis. In secondary analyses, we described vaccine impact and pneumococcal meningitis serotypes.Results: We included 48 articles cumulatively reporting 20,707 cases from 1987 to 2013. Mean annual incidence was 105 (95% confidence interval [CI], 53-173) cases per 100,000 children. On average, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) accounted for 13% (95% CI, 8-19%) of cases, pneumococcus for 10% (95% CI, 6-15%), and meningococcus for 1% (95% CI, 0-2%). These meta-analyses had substantial between-study heterogeneity (I-2 > 78%, P < 0.0001). Among studies reporting only confirmed cases, these three bacteria caused a median of 78% cases (IQR, 50-87%). Hib meningitis incidence declined by 72-83% at sentinel hospitals in Pakistan and Bangladesh, respectively, within two years of implementing nationwide vaccination. On average, PCV10 covered 49% (95% CI, 39-58%), PCV13 covered 51% (95% CI, 40-61%), and PPSV23 covered 74% (95% CI, 67-80%) of pneumococcal meningitis serotypes. Lower PCV10 and PCV13 serotype coverage in Bangladesh was associated with higher prevalence of serotype 2, compared to India and Pakistan.Conclusions: South Asia has relatively high incidence of bacterial meningitis among children aged 1-59 months, with vaccine-preventable bacteria causing a substantial proportion. These estimates are likely underestimates due to multiple epidemiological and microbiological factors. Further research on vaccine impact and distribution of pneumococcal serotypes will inform vaccine policymaking and implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment: review of in-flight performance and new reprocessed 1995-2011 level 1 product
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) on-board the second European Remote Sensing satellite provided measurements of atmospheric constituents such as ozone and other trace gases for the 16-year period from 1995 to 2011. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the long-term performance of the sensor and introduce the new homogenised and fully calibrated level 1 product that has been generated using the recently developed GOME Data Processor level-0-to-1b (GDP-L1) Version 5.1. By means of the various in-flight calibration parameters, we monitor the behaviour and stability of the instrument during the entire mission. Severe degradation of the optical components has led to a significant decrease in intensity, in particular in channels 1 and 2, which cover the spectral ranges of 240-316 and 311-405 nm, respectively. Thus, a soft correction based on using the Sun as a stable calibration source is applied. Revision and optimisation of other calibration algorithms such as the wavelength assignment, polarisation correction, and dark current correction resulted in an improved and homogeneous level 1 product that can be regarded as the European satellite reference data for successor atmospheric composition sensors and that provides an excellent prerequisite for further exploitation of GOME measurements.

TI  - Comparison of the indocyanine green dye method versus the combined method of indigo carmine blue dye with indocyanine green fluorescence imaging for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast conservative therapy for stage ≤IIA breast cancer
T2  - BMC WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fluorescence imaging (FI) is one of the methods to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, the procedure is technically complicated and requires procedural skills, as SLN biopsy must be conducted in dim light conditions. As an improved version of this method, we introduced a combined method (Combined mixed dye and fluorescence; CMF) consisting of indigo carmine blue dye and FI. The direct visualization of SLNs under shadowless surgical light conditions is facilitated by the addition of the blue dye. We compared the SLN detection rates of CMF with that of the indocyanine green (ICG) dye method (ICG-D).Methods: A total of 202 patients with stage <= IIA breast cancer who underwent breast conservative therapy with separate incision from January 2004 to February 2017 were reviewed. Details of the two methods are as follows: (1) ICG-D: 10 mg of ICG was used and the green-stained SLNs were resected via a 3-4 cm axillary incision; (2) CMF: A combination of 5 mg of ICG and 4-8 mg of indigo carmine was used. After a 1.5-2 cm incision was made near the point of disappearance of the fluorescence using Photodynamic Eye (PDE), the blue-stained SLNs were resected under shadowless surgical light conditions.Results: There were 92 ICG-D and 110 CMF cases. CMF resulted in a significantly higher SLN detection rate than ICG-D (96.4% vs. 83.7%; p = 0.003). This difference was particularly notable in those aged >= 60 years (98.3% vs. 74.3%) and individuals with body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2) (90.3% vs. 58.3%).Conclusion: CMF is an effective method to identify SLNs which is safe and efficient. CMF achieves a high SLN identification rate and most of this procedure is feasible under shadowless surgical light conditions. CMF can reliably perform SLN biopsy even in those aged >= 60 years and individuals with BMI >= 25 kg/m(2).

T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Little is known about inactivated influenza vaccine effectiveness (WE) in preventing very severe disease, including influenza-associated intensive care unit (ICU) admissions.Methods: The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project enrolled adults (aged >= 18 years) with acute respiratory illness (ARI) in general ward (GW) hospital settings (n = 3034) and ICUs (n = 101) during 2012-2015. IVE was assessed using a test-negative design comparing the odds of influenza vaccination among influenza positives vs. negatives (confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction). All models were adjusted for season, weeks from season peak, and a vaccination propensity score.Results: Influenza virus infection was confirmed in 28% of GW hospital and 41% of ICU patients; influenza vaccination was documented for 56% and 41%, respectively. Across seasons, IVE was 37% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 23-48%) among GW patients and 82% (95% CI = 45-94%) among ICU patients. IVE point estimates were > 70% against ICU influenza and consistently higher than IVE against GW influenza when stratified by season, by virus (sub)types, and for adults with or without chronic medical conditions and for both adults aged <65 and >= 65 years old. Among hospitalized influenza positives, influenza vaccination was associated with a 59% reduction in the odds of ICU admission (aOR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.18-0.96) and with shorter ICU lengths of stay (LOS), but not with radiograph-confirmed pneumonia or GW hospital LOS.Conclusion: Inactivated influenza vaccines prevented influenza-associated ICU admissions, may have higher effectiveness in ICU than GW hospital settings, and appeared to reduce the risk of severe disease among those who are infected despite vaccination.

TI  - POLLAR: Impact of air POLLution on Asthma and Rhinitis; a European Institute of Innovation and Technology Health (EIT Health) project
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL ALLERGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Allergic rhinitis (AR) is impacted by allergens and air pollution but interactions between air pollution, sleep and allergic diseases are insufficiently understood. POLLAR (Impact of air POLLution on sleep, Asthma and Rhinitis) is a project of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT Health). It will use a freely-existing application for AR monitoring that has been tested in 23 countries (the Allergy Diary, iOS and Android, 17,000 users, TLR8). The Allergy Diary will be combined with a new tool allowing queries on allergen, pollen (TLR2), sleep quality and disorders (TRL2) as well as existing longitudinal and geolocalized pollution data. Machine learning will be used to assess the relationship between air pollution, sleep and AR comparing polluted and non-polluted areas in 6 EU countries. Data generated in 2018 will be confirmed in 2019 and extended by the individual prospective assessment of pollution (portable sensor, TLR7) in AR. Sleep apnea patients will be used as a demonstrator of sleep disorder that can be modulated in terms of symptoms and severity by air pollution and AR. The geographic information system GIS will map the results. Consequences on quality of life (EQ-5D), asthma, school, work and sleep will be monitored and disseminated towards the population. The impacts of POLLAR will be (1) to propose novel care pathways integrating pollution, sleep and patients' literacy, (2) to study sleep consequences of pollution and its impact on frequent chronic diseases, (3) to improve work productivity, (4) to propose the basis for a sentinel network at the EU level for pollution and allergy, (5) to assess the societal implications of the interaction.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice Melt Onset Timing From Passive Microwave-Based and Surface Air Temperature-Based Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Melt onset (MO) on Arctic sea ice has been monitored using satellite-based passive microwave (PMW) observations since 1979. In this work, surface air temperatures from the International Arctic Buoy Programme/Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface and NASA's Atmospheric Infrared Sounder are used to derive MO date estimates using three threshold methods which are then compared with a record of PMW-based MO dates. Results from the PMW data indicate a shift toward increasingly early MO timing, with significant trends as large as -9.45days/decade in the E. Siberian Sea and -5.69days/decade for the entire Arctic, consistent with other studies highlighting the overall decline of Arctic sea ice. Results indicate that the surface air temperature-based MO date estimates produced using a -1 degrees C threshold are similar to 11days later than the PMW-based MO date estimates Arctic wide. A statistical comparison of the Polar Exchange at the Sea Surface and PMW-based MO dates indicate that despite the similar to 11-day bias, correlations between the MO date time series are generally good (0.6) for most of the Arctic Ocean while the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and PMW-based MO dates are generally better at capturing the statistically similar long-term trends in MO dates for the Arctic and several Arctic subregions. Application of these results can contribute to the development of new methods to monitor the sea ice melting state.Plain Language Summary The time of year when sea ice first begins melting is an important indicator of ongoing climate change in the Arctic. In this work, satellite data are used to identify the day of the year that melting begins on sea ice in the Arctic, known as the melt onset date. The satellite-based melt onset dates are compared with melt onset dates estimated from surface air temperature data. The temperature data used in this research come from two sources: (1) drifting ocean buoys and (2) atmospheric temperatures measured by satellite. A statistical analysis is used to compare the satellite-based melt onset dates with the temperature-based melt onset estimates from each source. The results show that melting of Arctic sea ice is beginning earlier in the year, changing at a rate of 5.69days/decade since 1979. Results also show that the best method to estimate melt onset from the temperature data used in this study indicate that melt onset begins similar to 11days later than the satellite-based melt onset dates. Despite the differences between the temperature-based and satellite-based melt onset methods, these results can be used to develop improved methods to monitor summer sea ice melting in the future.

TI  - On the Upward Extension of the Polar Vortices Into the Mesosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The polar vortices play a central role in vertically coupling the atmosphere from the ground to geospace by shaping the background wind field through which atmospheric waves propagate. This work extends the vertical range of previous polar vortex climatologies into the upper mesosphere. The mesospheric polar vortices are defined using the CO gradient method with Microwave Limb Sounder satellite data; the stratospheric polar vortices are defined using a stream function-based algorithm with data from meteorological reanalyses. Strengths and weaknesses of the two vortex definitions are given, as well as recommendations for when, where, and why to use each definition. Midwinter mean vortex geometry in the mesosphere is funnel shaped in the Arctic, with a wide top and narrow bottom. The Antarctic mesospheric vortex tapers with height in early winter and broadens with height in late winter. The seasonal evolution of mesospheric vortex frequency of occurrence, size, and zonal symmetry in both hemispheres is presented. Unexpected behavior above 60km includes late season vortex broadening in both hemispheres, especially following winters without sudden stratospheric warmings. Following extreme stratospheric disturbances the polar night jet in the mesosphere strengthens and shifts poleward, resulting in a mesospheric vortex that contracts. Overall, the mesospheric polar vortices are more similar between the two hemispheres than their stratospheric counterparts. The vortex climatology presented here serves as an observational benchmark to which the mesospheric polar vortices in high-top climate models can be evaluated.

TI  - Controls on Open-Ocean North Atlantic <i>p</i>CO<sub>2</sub> at Seasonal and Interannual Time Scales Are Different
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The North Atlantic is a substantial sink for anthropogenic CO2. Understanding the mechanisms driving the sink's variability is key to assessing its current state and predicting its potential response to global climate change. Here we apply a time series decomposition technique to satellite and in situ data to examine separately the factors (both biological and nonbiological) that affect the sea-air CO2 difference (pCO(2)) on seasonal and interannual time scales. We demonstrate that on seasonal time scales, the subpolar North Atlantic pCO(2) signal is predominantly correlated with biological processes, whereas seawater temperature dominates in the subtropics. However, the same factors do not necessarily control pCO(2) on interannual time scales. Our results imply that the mechanisms driving seasonal variability in pCO(2) cannot necessarily be extrapolated to predict how pCO(2), and thus the North Atlantic CO2 sink, may respond to increases in anthropogenic CO2 over longer time scales.Plain Language Summary As atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations rise due to anthropogenic emissions, the ocean is taking up more CO2, a process known as the oceanic CO2 sink. The North Atlantic is a major anthropogenic CO2 sink; however, factors that drive variability in the sink are still under investigation. In order to assess the sink's current state and future with continued climate change, we need to understand what affects the North Atlantic CO2 sink. Often, the factors that affect oceanic uptake of CO2 are explored on a seasonal time scale. Here we take a longer view, examining the factors that may affect ocean uptake on interannual time scales. We find that the factors are different, depending on whether we assess the short or long term. In building models of ocean response to future climate change, we cannot extrapolate the response of ocean CO2 uptake to seasonal variability out to longer time scales.

TI  - The Seasonal Cycle of the South Indian Ocean Subtropical Gyre Circulation as Revealed by Argo and Satellite Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal variability in volume transport of the South Indian Ocean subtropical gyre is characterized for the first time. Only three complete hydrographic crossings of the gyre have been conducted over a 22-year period, with an upcoming repeat in 2019. Changes to geostrophic transport and thermocline properties imply a strengthening of the gyre from 1987 to 2002. However, some of this strengthening could result from aliasing of seasonal variability. We use data from Argo, satellite altimetry, and an Agulhas Current transport proxy at 34S to quantify the seasonal variability of the upper 2,000-m volume transport. A semiannual cycle is revealed, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 6.43.1Sv(1Sv = 10(6) m(3)s(-1)) and dominated by annual anomalies in quadrature near the eastern and western boundaries. Seasonal aliasing does not account for the observed gyre strengthening.Plain Language Summary To predict climate, we need to understand how the ocean is changing, which requires separating observed changes from variability at shorter time scales. On the basis of only three transoceanic sections, between 1987 and 2009, it was concluded that the circulation of the South Indian Ocean has undergone multidecadal strengthening, but unknown seasonal variability could account for some of this signal. Here we use a decade of data from profiling floats and satellites, together with a new time series of Agulhas Current transport at 34S, to characterize the seasonal variability of the South Indian Ocean circulation for the first time. We find a semiannual cycle, of peak-to-peak amplitude 6.4Sv(1Sv = 10(6) m(3)s(-1)), that is dominated by annual anomalies in quadrature near each boundary. This seasonal variability does not explain the gyre strengthening, which is therefore part of a longer-term change. The observed semiannual cycle corresponds well with mass balance between the Agulhas Current and the Indonesian Throughflow.

TI  - Global Estimates of Changes in Shortwave Low-Cloud Albedo and Fluxes Due to Variations in Cloud Droplet Number Concentration Derived From CERES-MODIS Satellite Sensors
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fifteen years of Aqua Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy Systems ( CERES) and MOderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) observations are combined to derive nearly global maps of shortwave albedo ( A) and flux ( F) response to changes in cloud droplet number concentration ( Nd). Absolute ( Sa 1/4. A. Nd) and relative ( Sr 1/4. A. ln Nd o thorn) albedo susceptibilities are computed by exploiting the linear relationship between A and ln ( Nd) for shallow liquid clouds. Subtropical stratiform clouds over the eastern Pacific, eastern Atlantic, and off the coast of eastern Asia yield the highest Sr, followed by the extratropical oceans during their hemispheric summer. When Sr is cast in terms of F, the eastern Pacific clouds dominate Sr. Sa is mainly governed by Nd, with offshore clouds producing high Sa. While both Sa and Sr are advantageous for understanding radiative aspects of the aerosol indirect effect, Sr is more suitable for calculating changes in A and F due to the linearity of the A- ln ( Nd) relationship.Plain Language Summary The amount of solar radiation reflected back to space is strongly controlled by liquid clouds. These clouds are highly sensitive to changes in the environmental conditions due to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Atmospheric aerosols can regulate the cloud microstructure by modifying the number of droplets in the cloud. These changes can lead to an enhancement of the solar energy reflected by clouds. Here satellite data from two sensors are combined to quantify the amount of reflected solar radiation associated with changes in the cloud droplet number concentration. Results are shown globally, with an emphasis in the nonpolar oceanic regions, where liquids clouds tend to be more frequent. The results presented in this study can help shed light into the processes that modulate the cloud radiative response due to aerosol-cloud interactions.

TI  - Spatial Heterogeneity of the Temporal Dynamics of Arctic Tundra Vegetation
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra vegetation has largely been greening in recent decades, resulting in major changes to terrestrial ecosystems, with implications for surface energy balance, permafrost, carbon and water cycling, herbivore populations, and human land use. While general greening trends have been well-studied, more specific vegetation-temperature dynamics are spatially and temporally heterogeneous and currently not well understood. This study uses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Summer Warmth Index (SWI) data to investigate patterns of arctic tundra vegetation and temperature dynamics over North American and Eurasian continents and by Arctic bioclimate subzones (essentially latitudinal-based). Relative vegetation increases in northern subzones were muted compared to temperature increases, whereas relative vegetation increases in southern subzones were consistent with, or greater than, relative temperature changes. Detrended, interannual NDVI variances were greatest in middle and southern subzones, whereas interannual SWI variances were greatest in southern subzones. Annual SWI and NDVI relationships were strongest in midlatitude subzones.Plain Language Summary Arctic tundra vegetation has generally been increasing in biomass and productivity in recent decades. This paper uses 34years of satellite data to investigate more thoroughly the relationships between temperature and vegetation in the tundra over time and space. We found that in the southern part of the tundra biome, the vegetation (as indicated by the satellite data) increased at the same rate as, or faster than, temperature, whereas northern tundra vegetation increased more slowly than temperature. The variation in tundra vegetation from year to year was greatest in the middle and southern parts of the Arctic tundra biome, whereas temperature variation from year to year increased from north to south. On an annual basis, the strongest relationships between temperature and vegetation occurred in the midlatitudes of the tundra biome.

TI  - Distinguishing Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions From Different Energy Intensive Industrial Sources Using OCO-2 Observations: A Case Study in Northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy intensive industries, such as iron and steel industry and coal-processing industry, are one of the major anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emission sources, especially in China. Monitoring the localized CO2 emissions from these industrial point sources is valuable to improve emission estimates and inform on policy discussion. However, spatiotemporally explicit information on CO2 emissions from different energy intensive industrial sources is still limited. In this study, we use remote sensing data sets with high spatial resolution to detect the patterns of CO2 enhancements of carbon emission intensive industries, taking northern China as the case study area. CO2 anomalies are derived from spaceborne column-averaged CO2 mixing ratio (XCO2) data measured by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2). The Gaussian plume model is used to select the XCO2 data when the CO2 emissions from plants are localized, which allows us to distinguish CO2 emissions from different industrial point sources. We demonstrate that high-emission areas with industrial plants are detectable by CO2 anomalies compared to natural background area and the average enhancement is about 1.8ppm. The XCO2 data also show a higher CO2 emission from a cluster of iron and steel plants than that of coal-processing plants, which is consistent with emission inventories. Furthermore, anthropogenic CO2 emission hotspots are possible to be identified from surrounding natural background. Our results suggest the potential of satellite data for characterizing strong localized carbon emission from different industrial sources both in space and time.

TI  - An Accurate Method for Correcting Spectral Convolution Errors in Intercalibration of Broadband and Hyperspectral Sensors
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The intercalibration between a broadband and a hyperspectral satellite Earth observation system requires the convolution of the hyperspectral data with the spectral response functions (SRFs) of the corresponding broadband channels. There are two potential issues associated with the convolution procedure. First, the finite resolution of a hyperspectral spectrum, that is, the deviation from the highly accurate line-by-line monochromatic radiances, will contribute to convolution errors. The magnitude of the errors depends on the spectral resolution and the SRF shape of the hyperspectral instrument. This type of the convolution error has not been well recognized, and there is a lack of corresponding discussion in most published papers. Although it is small as compared with the instrument accuracy of existing hyperspectral sounders, the error is deemed to be significant when it is compared with the stringent calibration requirement imposed by future climate missions like the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory. Second, some broadband channels are insufficiently covered by the hyperspectral data, causing spectral gaps that lead to convolution errors. Although several methods have been developed to fill the spectral gaps and hence compensate for the second type of convolution error, the correction accuracy may still need improvement especially when a large spectral gap needs to be filled. This paper presents a methodology to accurately quantify and compensate for both types of convolution errors. This methodology utilizes the available hyperspectral information to correct the scene-dependent convolution errors due to either the limited spectral resolution or spectral gaps. We use simulations to characterize the intercalibration errors between the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and current operational infrared sounders. We demonstrate that convolution errors can be effectively removed to meet the highly accurate intersatellite calibration requirement proposed by the Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory. Our methodology is also validated using real satellite data for the intercalibration between Aqua MODIS and Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounders (AIRS). Our study demonstrates that the accurate characterization and correction for the convolution errors greatly reduces the scene-dependent and spectrally dependent errors, being critical to the consistency check between Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and AIRS using the double-difference method. The convolution correction also facilitates the evaluation for other intercalibration errors (e.g., the drift of MODIS SRFs). Our derived SRF shift values from MODIS-AIRS (after convolution error corrections) and from MODIS-IASI intercalibration are consistent with each other. We further extend the methodology to study the calibration of a broadband channel which is either completely or largely uncovered by a hyperspectral measurement. The large spectral gap filling methodology is validated by demonstrating the accurate prediction of the MODIS radiance of band 29 using the Cross-track Infrared Sounder spectra, with the real IASI spectral data being used as the reference.

TI  - Optical Properties and Spatial Variation of Tropical Cyclone Cloud Systems From TRMM and MODIS in the East Asia Region: 2010-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical cyclone (TC) in East Asia varies strongly each year, indicating the different spectral characteristics of the TC cloud systems (TCCSs) with the distance from the center of TC. We report a new perspective of optical properties of TCCS by using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission data over the years from 2010 to 2014 for the 35 TCs in East Asia. We investigate the spatial distribution of the cloud-top height, radar reflectivity, polarization corrected temperature in 85.5GHz (PCT85.5), hydrometeor vertical profile, cloud water path, cloud optical thickness, and cloud particle effective radius of TCCS in the development, maturity, and decay stages of TC. The results indicate the significant differences of cloud characteristics in the maturity stage in comparison to other two stages, showing the higher radar reflectivity up to 30dBZ and the PCT85.5 as low as 232.98K in the TC eye wall. Meanwhile, the mean hydrometeor profile indicates more ice particles accumulating above the height of 10km but less liquid droplets near 3km. The peak of cloud water path and cloud optical thickness in the maturity stage can reach to 1,300g/m(2) and 75, respectively. The mean cloud particle effective radius and precipitation in the three stages could be influenced by aerosols. Based on these quantified results, several ideal fitting equations and the models are constructed to denote the properties of TCCS. Two cases are analyzed to examine the accuracy of the quantified mean state for different stages of TCCS and the relationship between aerosols and clouds.

TI  - Atomic Oxygen Abundance Retrieved From SCIAMACHY Hydroxyl Nightglow Measurements
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new atomic oxygen data set based on Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) hydroxyl short-wave infrared data. The OH spectra stem from the OH(9-6) ro-vibrational transition. These data and atomic oxygen obtained from SCIAMACHY O(S-1) green line measurements, which is an independent data set in terms of methodology and radiometry, typically agree within 10-20%. This confirms the corresponding models of OH and O(S-1), in particular, the relevance of the reaction between atomic oxygen and ozone in the photochemical model. The agreement between the SCIAMACHY data and the most recent Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) atomic oxygen data set of Mlynczak et al. (2018, ) is significantly better than for the previous SABER data set of Mlynczak et al. (2013, ). The agreement decreases if the SCIAMACHY forward model parameters are applied to SABER data. A similar agreement is achieved with the data of Panka et al. (2018, ), which was retrieved from SABER data using a principally different retrieval approach.Plain Language Summary The latest model and laboratory findings on the relaxation of vibrationally excited OH and the wide distribution of recent satellite data have sparked debate on the abundance of atomic oxygen and its impact on the energy balance of the mesopause region. The debate began with the large values originally derived from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) OH measurements in 2013 and significantly smaller values obtained from Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) O(S-1) observations in 2014. This confused our understanding of the energy balance of the upper atmosphere and affects the retrieval of several other constituents (temperature, CO2, O-3, etc.), which rely on atomic oxygen a priori data. In this work we present a new atomic oxygen data set based on SCIAMACHY hydroxyl short-wave infrared data. These data and atomic oxygen obtained from SCIAMACHY O(S-1) green line measurements, which is an independent data set in terms of methodology and radiometry, typically agree within 10-20%. This confirms the corresponding models of OH and O(S-1), in particular, the relevance of the reaction between atomic oxygen and ozone in the photochemical model.The agreement between the SCIAMACHY and the most recent SABER atomic oxygen data sets of Mlynczak et al. (2018, ) and Panka et al. (2018, ) is significantly better than for the previous SABER data set.

TI  - Illness among US resident student travellers after return to the USA: a GeoSentinel analysis, 2007-17
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The number of US students studying abroad more than tripled during the past 20 years. As study abroad programmes' destinations diversify, students increasingly travel to resource-limited countries, placing them at risk for infectious diseases. Data describing infections acquired by US students while travelling internationally are limited. We describe illnesses among students who returned from international travel and suggest how to prevent illness among these travellers.Methods: GeoSentinel is a global surveillance network of travel and tropical medicine providers that monitors travel-related morbidity. This study included the records of US resident student international travellers, 17-24 years old, who returned to the USA, had a confirmed travel-related illness at one of 15 US GeoSentinel sites during 2007-17 and had a documented exposure region. Records were analysed to describe demographic and travel characteristics and diagnoses.Results: The study included 432 students. The median age was 21 years; 69% were female. More than 70% had a pre-travel consultation with a healthcare provider. The most common exposure region was sub-Saharan Africa (112; 26%). Students were most commonly exposed in India (44; 11%), Ecuador (28; 7%), Ghana (25; 6%) and China (24; 6%). The median duration of travel abroad was 40 days (range: 1-469) and presented to a GeoSentinel site a median of 8 days (range: 0-181) after travel; 98% were outpatients. Of 581 confirmed diagnoses, the most common diagnosis category was gastrointestinal (45%). Acute diarrhoea was the most common gastrointestinal diagnosis (113 of 261; 43%). Thirty-one (7%) students had vector-borne diseases [14 (41%) malaria and 11 (32%) dengue]. Three had vaccine-preventable diseases (two typhoid; one hepatitis A); two had acute human immunodeficiency virus infection.Conclusions: Students experienced travel-related infections, despite the majority having a pre-travel consultation. US students should receive pre-travel advice, vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis to prevent gastrointestinal, vector-borne, sexually transmitted and vaccine-preventable infections.

TI  - A climatological assessment of drought impact on vegetation health index
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) has been widely used for monitoring and characterising droughts. This index takes into account ecosystem features in terms of fluctuations between prescribed maxima and minima of NDVI (Vegetation Condition Index, VCI) and of Land Surface Temperature (LST; Thermal Condition Index, TCI), and is estimated as the weighted sum of these two contributions. Since there is no a priori knowledge about vegetation and temperature contributions, VHI is typically taken as the average of both contributions, i.e., a weight of 0.5 is assumed. In this work climatologies of NDVI and LST - spanning the period between 1982 and 2009 - are used to estimate VCI, TCI and VHI on a Mediterranean geographic window, which are then correlated with the multi scalar drought indicator SPEI (Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) with the aim of assessing the effect of drought on each contribution. Results of the correlations between VCI-SPEI and TCI-SPEI show that the relative contributions of VCI and TCI to vegetation health depend on vegetation cover: the effect of drought is more evident in the case of VCI in semiarid climate classes (regions where the limiting factor to vegetation growth is water); while the effect of drought is more obvious in TCI for moistier climate classes (regions where the limiting factor is solar radiation). This leads to the conclusion that by maximising the correlations between VHI and SPEI, over a climatological period, it is possible to evaluate the relative roles of VCI and TCI to VHI for different climate regions.

TI  - Exploring the physiological information of Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence through radiative transfer model inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel approach to characterize the physiological conditions of plants from hyperspectral remote sensing data through the numerical inversion of a light version of the SCOPE model is proposed. The combined retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters and Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) was investigated exploiting high resolution spectral measurements in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. First, the retrieval scheme was evaluated against a synthetic dataset. Then, it was applied to very high resolution (sub-nanometer) canopy level spectral measurements collected over a lawn treated with different doses of a herbicide (Chlorotoluron) known to instantaneously inhibit both Photochemical and Non-Photochemical Quenching (PQ and NPQ, respectively). For the first time the full spectrum of canopy F, the fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)), as well as the main vegetation parameters that control light absorption and reabsorption, were retrieved concurrently using canopy-level high resolution apparent reflectance (rho*) spectra. The effects of pigment content, leaf/canopy structural properties and physiology were effectively discriminated. Their combined observation over time led to the recognition of dynamic patterns of stress adaptation and stress recovery. As a reference, F values obtained with the model inversion were compared to those retrieved with state of the art Spectral Fitting Methods (SFM) and SpecFit retrieval algorithms applied on field data. Phi(F) retrieved from rho* was eventually compared with an independent biophysical model of photosynthesis and fluorescence. These results foster the use of repeated hyperspectral remote sensing observations together with radiative transfer and biochemical models for plant status monitoring.

TI  - The importance of carbon-nitrogen biogeochemistry on water vapor and carbon fluxes as elucidated by a multiple canopy layer higher order closure land surface model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon-nitrogen (CN) biogeochemistry and the prognostic canopy structure scheme used in the Community Land Model version 45 (CLM4.5) are integrated into the multiple canopy layer higher order closure Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil Algorithm (ACASA). The ACASA-CN model inherits the advantages from ACASA and CLM4.5, and it is the first model that represents fully prognostic terrestrial feedbacks with a higher order closure turbulence scheme and vertically resolved canopy structure. The simulations are evaluated in terms of ecological, biogeophysical and biogeochemical aspects at six AmeriFlux eddy covariance sites encompassing a variety of vegetation types and microclimatic conditions across the continental United States. Our model evaluation shows that ACASA-CN reasonably simulates surface layer properties, such as vegetation structure and plant phenology. Our results indicate that the use of a higher order closure turbulence scheme with multiple canopy layer representation is critical to land carbon cycle simulation. Based on our simulations, water vapor exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere is primarily through plant transpiration (78-88%), and canopy evapotranspiration is enhanced with the use of CN biogeochemistry. Our results indicate that the ratio of transpiration to evapotranspiration exhibits a two-stage variation pattern, and the transpiration fraction decreases in dense canopies.

TI  - A machine learning method to estimate PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations across China with remote sensing, meteorological and land use information
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Machine learning algorithms have very high predictive ability. However, no study has used machine learning to estimate historical concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) at daily time scale in China at a national level.Objectives: To estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China during 2005-2016.Methods: Daily ground-level PM2.5 data were obtained from 1479 stations across China during 2014-2016. Data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological conditions and other predictors were downloaded. A random forests model (non-parametric machine learning algorithms) and two traditional regression models were developed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The best-fit model was then utilized to estimate the daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China with a resolution of 0.1 degrees (approximate to 10 km) during 2005-2016.Results: The daily random forests model showed much higher predictive accuracy than the other two traditional regression models, explaining the majority of spatial variability in daily PM2.5 [10-fold cross-validation (CV) R-2 = 83%, root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) = 28.1 mu g/m(3)]. At the monthly and annual time-scale, the explained variability of average PM2.5 increased up to 86% (RMSE = 10.7 mu g/m(3) and 6.9 mu g/m(3), respectively).Conclusions: Taking advantage of a novel application of modeling framework and the most recent ground-level PM2.5 observations, the machine learning method showed higher predictive ability than previous studies. Capsule: Random forests approach can be used to estimate historical exposure to PM2.5 in China with high accuracy. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Developing a composite daily snow cover extent record over the Tibetan Plateau from 1981 to 2016 using multisource data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover condition across the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is not only a significant indicator of climate change but also a vital variable in water availability because of its water storage function in high-mountain regions of Southwest China and the surrounding Asian countries. Limited by low spatial resolution, incomplete spatial coverage, and short time span of the current snow cover products, the long-term snow cover change across the TP under the climate change background remains unclear. To resolve this issue, a composite long-term gap-filled TP daily 5-km snow cover extent (SCE) record (TPSCE) is generated by integrating SCE from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) surface reflectance climate data record (CDR) and several existing snow cover data sets, with the help of a decision tree snow cover mapping algorithm, for the period 1981-2016. A snow discrimination process was used to classify the land surface into snow (pre-TPSCE) and non-snow using AVHRR surface reflectance CDR. To fill gaps caused by invalid observations and cloud contamination in pre-TPSCE, several existing daily SCE products, including MOD10C1, MYD10C1, IMS, JASMES, and a passive microwave snow depth data set are employed in the composition process. The daily snow discrimination accuracy, tested by ground snow-depth observations during 2000-2014, shows that the TPSCE captures the distribution of snow duration days (R-2 = 0.80, bias = 3.93 days) effectively. The comparison between the TPSCE and fineresolution snow cover maps (MCD10A1-TP) indicates high comparability between the TPSCE and MCD10A1-TP. In addition, cross-comparisons with changes in temperature, precipitation, and land surface albedo indicate that the TPSCE is reliable in climate change studies. In summary, the TPSCE is spatially complete and covers the longest period among all current snow cover products from satellite observations. The TPSCE seamlessly records changes in snow cover across the TP over the past 36 years, thereby providing valuable snow information for climate change and hydrological studies.

TI  - Dynamics of forest fires in the southwestern Amazon
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergism between climatic change and human action has provided conditions for the occurrence of forest fires in the Amazon. We used annual mapping to reconstruct the history of fire in Brazil's state of Acre to understand the forest-fire regime over a period of 33 years (1984-2016). The bum-scar index (BSI) derived from the fractions of soil and of photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic material was generated by CLASlite (c) software using Landsat-TM and OLI satellite images. The area of forest-fire scars totaled 525,130 ha in the period analyzed. This total includes forests that fire affected only once (388,350 ha), twice (59,800 ha) and three times (5727 ha). The years 2005 and 2010 represent 90% of the total area of forest fires in Acre, coinciding with severe droughts caused by the anomalous warming of the tropical North Atlantic Ocean. The most heavily impacted portion of Acre was in the eastern part of the state, which has the greatest forest fragmentation, consolidation of agricultural activity and presence of settlement projects. In 2005, the municipalities of Acrelandia, Placid de Castro and Senador Guiomard accounted for more than 50% of the forest remnants impacted by fire. Of the total extent of forest fires in Acre, 43% occurred in settlement projects administered by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and 16% in conservation units administered by the Ministry of Environment (MMA). The area of forest fires was 36 times greater in the 16 years after 2000, compared to the 16 years before 2000. The frequency of fires increased dramatically from one fire episode roughly every ten years (period from 1984 to 2004), to one fire every five years (period from 2005 to 2016). With the projections of warmer climate and advancing deforestation, the forest fires in Acre will tend be more intense and frequent.

TI  - Towards operational SAR-based flood mapping using neuro-fuzzy texture-based approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are currently the most reliable resource for flood monitoring, though still subject to various uncertainties, which can be objectively represented with probabilistic flood maps. Moreover, the growing number of SAR satellites has increased the likelihood of observing a flood event from space through at least a single SAR image, but generalized methods for flood classification independent of sensor characteristics need to be developed, to fully utilize these images for disaster management. Consequently, a neuro-fuzzy flood mapping technique is proposed for texture-enhanced single SAR images. Accordingly, any SAR image is first processed to generate second-order statistical textures, which are subsequently optimized using a dimensionality reduction technique. The flood and non-flood classes are then modelled within a fuzzy inference system using Gaussian curves. Parameterization is achieved by training a neural network on the image through user-defined polygons. The results of the optimized texture-based neuro-fuzzy classification were compared against the performance of the SAR image alone and that of SAR enhanced with randomly selected texture features. This approach was tested for a COSMO-SkyMed SAR image at two validation sites, for which high resolution aerial photographs were available. An overall accuracy assessment using reliability diagrams demonstrated a reduction of 54.2% in the Weighted Root Mean Squared Error (WRMSE) values compared to the stand-alone use of SAR. WRMSE values estimated for the proposed method varied from 0.027 to 0.196. A fuzzy validation exercise was also proposed to account for the uncertainty in manual flood identification from aerial photography, resulting in fuzzy spatial similarity values ranging from 0.67 to 0.92, with higher values representing better performance. Results suggest that the proposed approach has demonstrated potential to improve operational SAR-based flood mapping.

TI  - Generalized space-time classifiers for monitoring sugarcane areas in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and temporally accurate information on crop areas is a prerequisite for monitoring the multiannual dynamics of crop production. Satellite images have proven their high potential for mapping crop areas at large scales, even at the crop-species level, when a classifier is calibrated on the same image with reference data corresponding to the same period. For operational monitoring purposes, however, it is critical to develop generalized classification methodologies applicable to large scales and different years. Generalized classifiers were presented in this study as follows: a) simple cross-year calibration and application (M1); b) multiyear calibrations (M2); and c) map updating through change detection with multiyear calibrations (M3). These three methods were developed in a classical frame of object-based classifications for a time series of Landsat images with the Random Forest machine learning algorithm. Therein, we tested these methods for sugarcane classification in Sao Paulo state, Brazil, as sugarcane is an economically important crop that has developed substantially in the past decades. Eight years of sugarcane reference maps were used to calibrate and validate the classifiers at four different sites. The cross-year application of M1 provided a low average accuracy Dice coefficient (DC) of 0.84, while it was, on average, 0.94 for the classical same-year calibration. When the classifier was trained on a multiyear dataset (M2), the accuracies achieved average values of 0.91 in independent years. The map updating method M3 showed promising results but was not able to reach the accuracy of visual interpretation methods for detecting annual sugarcane land use change. The multiyear classifier M2 was applied to four contrasting sites and provided reliable results for new sites and years for sugarcane classification. Calibration of the machine learning algorithm on a multiyear dataset of standardized and gap-filled satellite images and reference data proved to give an accurate and space-time generalized classifier, reducing the time, cost and resources for mapping sugarcane areas at large scales.

TI  - Mussel digestive gland as a model tissue for assessing xenobiotics: An overview
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Control strategies and routine biomonitoring programs arc commonly performed worldwide using sentinel marine invertebrates, such as mussels of the genus Mytilus, for assessing the "health status" of the aquatic environment. Those species can accumulate and tolerate xenobiotics at levels higher than those being present into the aquatic environment, thus providing accurate and reliable biological endpoints (e.g. physiological, behavioral, cellular, biochemical and molecular indices) that can be measured in their tissues. Taking under consideration the significance of bivalves for assessing the environmental hazard of xenobiotics being present into the water medium, as well as the key role of digestive gland as a target-tissue for the compounds ingested in the organism, the present study aimed to summarize available data on the effects of different categories of xenobiotic compounds, previously characterized as a potential threat for the marine ecosystems. In this context, different types of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), biocides, microplastics (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs), currently investigated in mussels' digestive gland, using a battery of experimental approaches and analytical methods, as well as stress indices evaluation, are briefly described and further discussed in order to elucidate not only the presence and the toxic mode of action of xenobiotics, but also the important role of the digestive gland as a reliable target-tissue for investigating the effects of xenobiotics at cellular, biochemical, and molecular levels.

TI  - Relating foliage and crown projective cover in Australian tree stands
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree cover is quantified using a variety of structural metrics that relate to canopy density, which are often modelled from remotely sensed data. Comparing different metrics, and maps of such metrics, is difficult due to a poor understanding as to how they relate to each other. Two commonly used metrics in Australia are crown projective cover (CPC) and foliage projective cover (FPC). CPC and FPC are the proportion of ground area covered by the vertical projection of tree crowns, and the foliage of tree crowns, respectively. They are dimensionless proportions that vary between zero and one. The relationship between CPC and FPC is a function of the plant area index (PAI), the foliage clumping factor at a zenith angle of zero, the foliage projection function at a zenith angle of zero, tree stand density, mean crown radii, and the proportion of wood to all canopy elements (alpha). The non-linear relationship was investigated using a dataset of 745 field sites across Australia, for which 1003 coincident CPC and FPC measurements had been made. As measurements of LAI and the other variables were not available, the parameter k was introduced to simplify the equations, which then had only two unknowns: a and k. Best-fit values of a and k were determined using non-linear weighted least-squares regression across all the field sites. Using these values to predict FPC from CPC, and vice versa, achieved low root mean square errors (0.05-0.07) across the field data. The models allow different mapping products to be compared, and also have the potential to facilitate the derivation of FPC from airborne lidar data when field measurements of FPC are not available for calibration. This was demonstrated using a lidar dataset and 12 coincident field sites, across which FPC was derived from a lidar fractional cover metric with an RMSE of 0.08. Further research is required to investigate the stability of this method across different areas and lidar systems.

One of the most elaborated and widespread algorithms, namely Fmask, was initially developed for the Landsat suite of satellites. Despite their similarity, application to Sentinel-2 imagery is currently hampered by the unavailability of a thermal band, and although results can be improved when taking the cirrus band into account, Sentinel-2 cloud detections are unsatisfactory in two points. (1) Low altitude clouds can be undetectable in the cirrus band, and (2) bright land surfaces - especially built-up structures - are often misclassified as clouds when only considering spectral information. In this paper, we present the Cloud Displacement Index (CDI), which makes use of the three highly correlated near infrared bands that are observed with different view angles. Hence, elevated objects like clouds are observed under a parallax and can be reliably separated from bright ground objects. We compare CDI with the currently used cloud probabilities, and propose how to integrate this new functionality into the Fmask algorithm. We validate the approach using test images over metropolitan areas covering a wide variety of global environments and climates, indicating the successful separation of clouds and built-up structures (overall accuracy 95%, i.e. an improvement in overall accuracy of 0.29-0.39 compared to the previous Fmask versions over the 20 test sites), and hence a full compensation for a missing thermal band.

TI  - Quantification of last glacial-Holocene net primary productivity and upwelling activity in the equatorial eastern Atlantic with a revised modern dinocyst database
T2  - PALAEOGEOGRAPHY PALAEOCLIMATOLOGY PALAEOECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to better explore quantitative reconstructions of net primary productivity (NPP) conditions using a dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst)-based transfer function method, we revised the tropical Atlantic modern dinocyst database n = 208 (Marret et al., 2008). Modern assemblages from the worldwide dinocyst atlas (Zonneveld et al., 2013) were added to provide a better geographical coverage of the South Atlantic Ocean. The environmental dataset was updated using the World Ocean Atlas 2013 for sea-surface temperature (SST) and sea-surface salinity (SSS) data, as well as for 1997-2017 mean NPP values recorded during SeaWifs and MODIS spatial programs. New environmental datasets were tested using anomalies regarding mean latitudinal SST as a potential index to track past upwelling activity. Finally, preindustrial NPP values, simulated with the IPSL-CM5A-LR model developed at the Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (IPSL) have been added to the dinocyst environmental database to provide NPP values consistent with the mean age of "modern" dinocyst assemblages. The transfer function method using the updated modern database was then applied to fossil dinocyst assemblages of core KZAI-01, retrieved off the Congo River mouth and covering the last 43.2 kyr. Our results indicate a dominant orbital forcing, with higher primary productivity values reconstructed during precession minima (MIS 3 and the last deglaciation) and enhanced by a maximum of obliquity during the last deglaciation and the Holocene. The synchronicity between high upwelling intensity and high terrigenous inputs during high NPP period (e.g. during the last Deglaciation) highlighted the prevalent role of river-induced upwelling activity, which is specific to the Congo River. These results have improved our understanding of the environmental forcing leading to major trophic changes in the intertropical area.

TI  - Estimating aboveground carbon density across forest landscapes of Hawaii: Combining FIA plot-derived estimates and airborne LiDAR
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data have increasingly been employed in combination with field plot data to estimate aboveground carbon (C) stocks across heterogeneous forested landscapes around the world. The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program of the US Forest Service offers a gridded network of field plots which potentially can be linked to airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data to estimate forest aboveground carbon density (ACD; units of Mg C ha(-1)). Here we utilized FIA plot and airborne LiDAR data sets collected across two contrasting landscapes known as Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a on Hawai'i Island to explore strengths and weaknesses of linking those two data sets to estimate ACD. We varied FIA plot sample designs with respect to sampling density (i.e., the number of plots across landscape) and intensity (i.e., the structural detail within inventory plots) to test the capability of the mapping approach. Results indicated that Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscapes supported an estimated 545 Gg C and 157 Gg C aboveground, respectively, and mean ACD values of the wet windward Laupahoehoe landscape (109 Mg ha(-1)) were an order of magnitude greater than those of the leeward dry Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscape (9.7 Mg ha(-1)). Patterns of ACD were largely determined by combined factors of precipitation, lava substrate, prior land use, and presence of non-native, often invasive, species. Results demonstrated the relative importance of sample plot density over sample plot intensity, and showed that FIA inventory plots, even at their lowest sample intensity design, can be linked with LiDAR data to accurately estimate ACD across spatially heterogeneous landscapes. We also developed and applied a straightforward, statistically-robust approach to provide error estimates for the 100 million pixels that characterize the Laupahoehoe and Pu'u Wa'awa'a landscapes as well as for any sub-units of those landscapes. We contend that augmenting existing FIA forest plot data with airborne LiDAR coverage, even if that requires an increase in plot density somewhat above the FIA standard 1X or 2X approaches, is a feasible, cost-effective, scientifically sound approach from which to obtain accurate landscape- to regional-scale ACD measures across the extensive and heterogeneous forests of the United States.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with thin melanomas: Frequency and predictors of metastasis based on analysis of two large international cohorts
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with thin melanomas (1mm) is uncommon but adverse prognostic factors may indicate an increased risk. We sought to determine how often SLN biopsy (SLNB) was performed in patients with thin melanomas, establish the frequency of SLN metastasis and evaluate the predictive value of ulceration, tumor mitotic rate, and thickness for SLN involvement.MethodsMelanoma patients with a Breslow thicknessgreater than or equal to 0.5 to less than or equal to 1mm, diagnosed 2009-2016, were identified in the Swedish Melanoma Register (SMR) and the Melanoma Institute Australia (MIA) Database.ResultsIn total 8165 patients were included from the SMR and 1603 from MIA. SLNB was performed in 9.5% and 16.2% of patients, respectively. Corresponding figures for T1b (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] 7th Edition) were 19.5% and 24.6%. The SLN positivity rate were 4.4% (Sweden) and 5.8% (MIA). SLN metastasis was more frequent in tumors with ulceration, mitoses, and Breslow thickness greater than or equal to 0.9mm but none were statistically significant. Younger age was identified as a significant risk factor for SLN positivity at MIA.ConclusionsA minority of patients with thin melanomas had SLNB performed and the SLN positivity rate was low. This study did not confirm tumor ulceration, mitoses, or thickness as statistically significant predictors for SLN metastasis.

TI  - The influence of spatial resolution on the angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiangle remote sensing plays a central role in the development of algorithms for the retrieval of various surface biophysical parameters that are influenced by the reflectance anisotropy. Surface reflectance anisotropy is characterized by the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Within the past decade, spaceborne multiangle observations acquired by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor (which has a gridded spatial resolution of 500 m) and by the POLarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances (POLDER) sensor (which has a spatial resolution of 6 x 7 km) have been used for a wide variety of global applications. However, it is necessary to fully understand the variability inherent in the surface BRDF information as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER at these two spatial resolutions to optimize their use. In this study, we make use of extensive POLDER Bidirectional Reflectance Factors (BRFs) selected from the entire archive of the POLDER BRDF database and standard MODIS BRDF parameter products (MCD43A1, Collection V005) that were geolocated within the same spatial extents as the POLDER data. The variability in surface BRDF is characterized by investigation of three BRDF model parameters as retrieved from MODIS and POLDER and a comprehensive index indicating the variations in the primary dome-bowl BRDF patterns (the anisotropic flat index (AFX)). The principal information content contained in these BRDF data is characterized by the general BRDF shapes (the BRDF archetypes) that account for > 90% of the total variance in these BRDF data. A hotspotrevised BRDF model is used directly on top of the retrieved model BRDF parameters to capture the hotspot effect associated with these BRDF parameters. The main findings of this study show that the variability in surface BRDF, as extracted from the MODIS and POLDER datasets, shares six reciprocal BRDF archetypes. However, the 500-m MODIS BRDF data can uniquely capture some additional extreme BRDF shapes mainly due to the data's finer pixel scales. These original findings are very important, because subsequent albedo retrievals can be significantly impacted by the use of BRDFs of different resolutions. This study provides evidence concerning the influence of spatial resolution on angular variation patterns of optical reflectance as retrieved from the MODIS and POLDER BRDF products.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-2 images for the detection of precursory motions before landslide failures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-2 optical satellites provide a global coverage of land surfaces with a 5-day revisit time at the Equator. We investigate the ability of these freely available optical images to detect precursory motions before rapid landslides. A 9-month time-series of displacement is derived from Sentinel-2 data over a major landslide in the French Alps, which exhibited a sudden reactivation in June 2016. This analysis reveals a 7-month period of low activity (<= 1 m), followed by a sudden acceleration of 3.2 +/- 1.2 m in 3 days, before the failure of a mass of about 2 to 3.6 10(6) m(3). The location of this precursory motion is consistent with that of the slow motions occurring since 2001 (about 1 m/year), as revealed by aerial photographs and LiDAR analysis. This change in activity over a very short period of time (days) emphasizes the value of the frequent revisit time of Sentinel-2, despite its medium resolution of 10 m. We finally simulate the ability of Sentinel-2 for detecting these precursory patterns before a rapid landslide occurs, based on typical Voight's laws for creeping materials, characterized by a power law exponent a. Based on this analysis and on global cloud cover maps, we compute the probability to detect pre-failure motions of landslides using the Sentinel-2 constellation. This probability is highly heterogeneous at the global scale, affected by the revisit time of the satellite and the cloud cover. However the main factors controlling this detection ability are the properties of the landslide itself (its size and the alpha parameter), with almost 100% of detection probability for alpha = 1.3 and 0% for alpha = 1.8. Despite all these limitations, probability to detect a motion before a landslide failure often reaches 50% for classical landslide parameters. These results open new perspectives for the early warning of large landslide motion from global and open source remote sensing data.

TI  - Developing a 1 km resolution daily air temperature dataset for urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatiotemporal resolution air temperature (Ta) datasets are increasingly needed for assessing the impact of temperature change on people, ecosystems, and energy system, especially in the urban domains. However, such datasets are not widely available because of the large spatiotemporal heterogeneity of Ta caused by complex biophysical and socioeconomic factors such as built infrastructure and human activities. In this study, we developed a 1 km gridded dataset of daily minimum Ta (Tmin) and maximum Ta (Tmax), and the associated uncertainties, in urban and surrounding areas in the conterminous U.S. for the 2003-2016 period. Daily geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were developed and used to interpolate Ta using 1 km daily land surface temperature and elevation as explanatory variables. The leave-one-out cross-validation approach indicates that our method performs reasonably well, with root mean square errors of 2.1 degrees C and 1.9 degrees C, mean absolute errors of 1.5 degrees C and 1.3 degrees C, and R 2 of 0.95 and 0.97, for Tmin and Tmax, respectively. The resulting dataset captures reasonably the spatial heterogeneity of Ta in the urban areas, and also captures effectively the urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon that Ta rises with the increase of urban development (i.e., impervious surface area). The new dataset is valuable for studying environmental impacts of urbanization such as UHI and other related effects (e.g., on building energy consumption and human health). The proposed methodology also shows a potential to build a long-term record of Ta worldwide, to fill the data gap that currently exists for studies of urban systems.

TI  - Analysis of spatiotemporal land cover changes in Inner Mongolia using self-organizing map neural network and grid cells method
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use has changed dramatically in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region because of rapid economic growth and human disturbances. However, little information is available about the medium-and long-term land use changes in this region. The effects of ecological recovery policies have also been evaluated rarely. In this study, we employed the self-organizing map neural network method to identify the land cover changes in Inner Mongolia between 2000 and 2014. MOD13Q1, Landsat, and DMSP/OLS night-time light data were used as the data resources. The dynamic change map was characterized using the grid cell method. The results showed that urban area of Inner Mongolia increased by more than five times during the 15-year study period, while the mining area also increased. In addition, 35.3% of the farmland was changed into grassland, which may have been caused by the "Grain to Green" policy. The most significant environmental issue in Inner Mongolia is the loss of wetland. >40% of the wetland was converted into other land use types between 2000 and 2014. Grassland increased by 6.05%, but areas of open water and woodland remained about the same. In terms of the geographical distribution, cropland increased in the eastern and middle parts of the region. The transformation from wetland to grassland mainly occurred in the north. Grassland degradation occurred in the west. Thus, environmental policy has resulted in some ecological improvements in Inner Mongolia. However, new environmental problems associated with rapid economic development should be addressed in a timely manner. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Component FBG-Based Force Sensing Systems by Comparison With Other Sensing Technologies: A Review
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - A multi-component force sensing system, capable of monitoring multiple components of force terms along x-, y-, and z-axis (F-x, F-y, and F-z) and the moments terms about x-, y-, and z-axis (M-x, M-y, and M-z) simultaneously, has been utilized in a huge variety of automation systems since 1970s. Fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based sensing systems offer a significant viable with numerous competitive advantages over traditional force sensing systems such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, high sensitivity, larger sensing range, light weight, small size, intrinsically safe in the explosive environments, and multiplexing capabilities. Recently, a number of applications, such as robotic manipulation and robot-assisted surgery, have benefited from the developments in FBG-based force sensing systems. This paper presents a comprehensive review of different force transduction principles, state-of-the-art designs, and development methods, as well as their significances and limitations. Meanwhile, some of the significant developments in an FBG-based force sensing technology during the last few decades are surveyed, and current challenges in implementing the FBG-based force sensing technology is highlighted.

TI  - Genomic Surveillance Reveals Diversity of Multidrug-Resistant Organism Colonization and Infection: A Prospective Cohort Study in Liver Transplant Recipients
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality after solid organ transplantation. We aimed to characterize MDRO colonization dynamics and infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients through innovative use of active surveillance and whole-genome sequencing (WGS).Methods. We prospectively enrolled consecutive adult patients undergoing LT from March 2014 to March 2016. Fecal samples were collected at multiple timepoints from time of enrollment to 12 months posttransplant. Samples were screened for carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), Enterobacteriaceae resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (Ceph-RE), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. We performed WGS of CRE and selected Ceph-RE isolates. We also collected clinical data including demographics, transplant characteristics, and infection data.Results. We collected 998 stool samples and 119 rectal swabs from 128 patients. MDRO colonization was detected in 86 (67%) patients at least once and was significantly associated with subsequent MDRO infection (0 vs 19.8%, P = .002). Child-Turcotte-Pugh score at LT and duration of post-LT hospitalization were independent predictors of both MDRO colonization and infection. Temporal dynamics differed between MDROs with respect to onset of colonization, clearance, and infections. We detected an unexpected diversity of CRE colonizing isolates and previously unrecognized transmission that spanned Ceph-RE and CRE phenotypes, as well as a cluster of mcr-1-producing isolates.Conclusions. Active surveillance and WGS showed that MDRO colonization is a highly dynamic and complex process after LT. Understanding that complexity is crucial for informing decisions regarding MDRO infection control, use of therapeutic decolonization, and empiric treatment regimens.

TI  - Evaluation of the precision of different Delay-Doppler Processor (DDP) algorithms using CryoSat-2 data over open ocean
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the modification and inclusion of different algorithms within an in-house Delay-Doppler Processor (DDP) chain in order to understand their potentiality and the related impact in terms of geophysical retrievals' precision, when operating the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mode of CryoSat-2 mission over open ocean. To do so, a flexible and tunable processing chain has been developed by isardSAT, being able to accommodate the different algorithms/options. Two different levels of analysis have been carried out. On one hand, the CryoSat-2 nominal SAR processing baseline is compared against the one considered in the state of the art Sentinel-3 ocean topographic mission, and then, against a modified version of CS-2, where the samples set to zero by the processor on the stack are not included in the incoherent averaging. On the other, the integration of an advanced processing at stack level and based on the amplitude compensation and dilation compensation (ACDC) is evaluated within the CryoSat-2 DDP. A comparative study of the different DDP configurations is presented exploiting SAR full bit rate (FBR) data from CryoSat-2 over two regions in the central Pacific Ocean and the Agulhas box. Ad-hoc SAR ocean retrackers are exploited to derive the geophysical parameters (sea surface height-SSH and significant wave height-SWH), such that the performance of the different baselines can be quantified in terms of precision, i.e., estimation noise.

TI  - The retrieval of ice cloud parameters from multi-spectral satellite observations of reflectance using a modified XBAER algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of ice cloud properties from passive remote satellite instruments using multispectral observations of the upwelling radiance at the top of atmosphere is challenging. This requires an accurate separation of the surface spectral reflectance below the cloud and that coming from the ice cloud particle. In this paper, a weighting-function based method is described, which retrieves ice cloud optical thickness (COT) and ice cloud crystal effective radius (CER). The retrieval algorithm belongs to the newly developed eXtensible Bremen Aerosol Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm family, and is called XBAER-ice. The XBAER-ice retrieval uses a surface reflectance parameterization minimizing the impact of surface scattering on the retrieval of optically thin ice cloud properties. A fractal model is used to describe the ice cloud optical properties. The comparison of COT and CER between XBAER-ice and latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud products shows good agreement. We note that ice cloud property retrievals are particularly sensitive to assumptions about the ice particle shape. The comparison between satellite derived COTs using both the MODIS C6 product and XBAER-ice algorithm agree well with Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) in-situ measurements (with correlation coefficient above 0.9) whereas CERs show poorer agreement (similar to 0.6). The global spatial distribution patterns and values of COT from ice clouds retrieved by using the MODIS C6 and XBAER-ice algorithms show a high degree of consistency. The XBAER-ice derived ice cloud CER values are systematically smaller than the MODIS C6 product, but both products have similar spatial distribution patterns. The XBAER-ice offers a potential alternative algorithm for the synergistic operational retrieval of ice cloud properties from the observations of Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) onboard Sentinel-3.

TI  - Mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects at the individual tree level using bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Defoliation by herbivorous insects is a widespread forest disturbance driver, affecting global forest health and ecosystem dynamics. Compared with time- and labor-intensive field surveys, remote sensing provides the only realistic approach to mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects over large spatial and temporal scales. However, the spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by insects at the individual tree level have not been well studied. Additionally, the predictive power of spectral and structural metrics for mapping canopy defoliation has seldom been compared. These critical knowledge gaps prevent us from consistently detecting and mapping canopy defoliation by herbivorous insects across multiple scales. During the peak of a gypsy moth outbreak in Long Island, New York in summer 2016, we leveraged bi-temporal airborne imaging spectroscopy (IS, i.e., hyperspectral imaging) and LiDAR measurements at 1 m spatial resolution to explore the spectral and structural signatures of canopy defoliation in a mixed oak-pine forest. We determined that red edge and near-infrared spectral regions within the IS data were most sensitive to crown-scale defoliation severity. LiDAR measurements including B70 (i.e., 70th bincentile height), intensity skewness, and kurtosis were effectively able to detect structural changes caused by herbivorous insects. In addition to canopy leaf loss, increased exposure of understory and non-photosynthetic materials contributed to the detected spectral and structural signatures. Comparing the ability of individual sensors to map canopy defoliation, the LiDAR-only Ordinary Least-Square (OLS) model performed better than the IS-only model (Adj. R-squared = 0.77, RMSE = 15.37% vs. Adj. Rsquared = 0.63, RMSE = 19.11%). The IS + LiDAR model improved on performance of the individual sensors (Adj. R-squared = 0.81, RMSE = 14.46%). Our study improves our understanding of spectral and structural signatures of defoliation by herbivorous insects and presents a novel approach for mapping insect defoliation at the individual tree level. Additionally, with the current and next generation of spaceborne sensors (e.g., WorldView-3, Landsat, Sentinel-2, HyspIRI, and GEDI), higher accuracy and frequent monitoring of insect defoliation may become more feasible across a range of spatial scales, which are critical for ecological research and management of forest resources including the economic consequences of forest insect infestations (e.g., reduced growth and increased mortality), as well as for informing and testing of carbon cycle models.

TI  - Impact of long ocean waves on wave height retrieval from SAR altimetry data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - SAR altimetry is a new high-resolution operation mode exploited in new-generation altimeter missions, such as Sentinel-3. It takes advantage of its enhanced along-track resolution to make measurements of sea surface height variations in much greater detail than what can be achieved with conventional low resolution instruments (e.g. the Jason-3 altimeter). However, contrary to what is observed for conventional altimetry, long-wavelength ocean waves of a few hundred meters (swell and extreme wind waves) are no longer fully imaged in the instrument ground cells, and SAR waveforms have distorted shapes in such wave conditions. This affects the final retrieval of significant wave height-(SWH). This paper analyzes the impact of long ocean waves on SAR mode data by using both Cryosat-2 measurements and simulated data. Results from these two approaches are in good agreement and show that the estimated parameters from SAR-altimetry waveforms are particularly noisy under long-wave conditions and also biased when compared with conventional altimetry data. Additionally, we found evidence that these impacts are different between the two directions (along and cross-track directions) due to the asymmetry of the SAR-altimetry footprint. Simulations indicate that statistics of sea surface elevations within the SAR-altimetry footprint deviate from Gaussian behavior. The assumption commonly used for ocean retracking algorithms is therefore inaccurate. The sensitivity of SAR-mode altimetry data to long waves is a key issue for the ocean altimetry community, which is concerned to ensure the continuity of high-quality time series of the global sea-surface topography in future years. This is not only an issue for these new-generation radar altimeters (Sentinel-3 and Sentinel-6) but also for all innovative techniques or processing methodologies capable of providing higher spatial resolution of the ocean surface.

TI  - Predicting bird species richness and micro-habitat diversity using satellite data
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective biodiversity management in forest ecosystems relies on the assessment of environmental indicators (surrogates) when attempting to measure total biodiversity. Bird species (BS) richness and micro-habitat (MH) diversity are two key features that are easily measured and can be utilized as biodiversity surrogates. Remote sensing technologies may be employed as a cost-efficient measure as well as accurately mapping diversity features across broad geographical areas. This study examined the possibilities of predicting BS richness and MH diversity using variables derived from satellite data in a brutian pine (Pinus brutia Ten.) forest ecosystem located in the Southwestern Mediterranean Region of Turkey. The study utilized 40 (90 x 90 m, 0.81 ha) sample plots. We used first, and second-order image texture measures calculated from RapidEye, SPOT-5 and Aster Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as explanatory variables for predicting these biodiversity surrogates at alpha (alpha) level. Stepwise linear regression analyses showed that BS richness and MH diversity can be estimated using image texture measures. According to the cross-validation test; BS richness was best predicted using standard deviation of Gray levels (STD) and Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) Homogeneity of RapidEye NDVI (R-CV(2) = 0.73, STEcT = 4.321), while MH diversity was best predicted using STD and GLCM Correlation of SPOT NDVI (R-CV(2) = 0.73, STECV = 0.148). In conclusion, the satellite-based diversity maps produced in this study can provide valuable data for forest managers and assist in formulating adaptive management plans for the ecologically sustainable management of brutian pine forest ecosystems.

TI  - Lead detection using Cryosat-2 delay-doppler processing and Sentinel-1 SAR images
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Arctic and Antarctic Ocean, where part of the sea surface is seasonally or continuously covered by sea ice, the sea level monitoring from satellite altimetry relies on the localisation of open water areas, especially on the detection of leads: long and narrow fractures in the sea ice, which dominate the radar echoes even if hundreds of meters away from nadir.The Cryosat-2 altimetry mission is based on the Delay-Doppler processing, in which the averaged waveform is formed by summing up several looks acquired at different look angles and stacked together. This imaging technique and the resulting improved along-track resolution are here exploited to evaluate different lead identification schemes.In particular, stack and power statistics of Cryosat-2 waveforms are used to classify leads on a subset of 12 tracks in which the altimetry-based classification is compared to a classification based on Sentinel-1A SAR images. For this scope, a dedicated SAR-image automated processing is proposed to avoid the manual classification.Results show that the adoption of a single new stack parameter (the Stack Peakiness) can perform equally well as the use of multiple stack parameters currently available. Moreover, a multi-waveform analysis of the Stack Peakiness helps to isolate the point where narrow leads cross the tracks at nadir.For all the tested strategies, the number of altimetry-detected leads that are unidentified by SAR is comparable to the number of detections from both sensors. This could be due to presence of narrow leads, not detected by SAR due to resolution limits, but still dominant in the radar altimeter return due to the high backscatter. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

TI  - Data synergy between leaf area index and clumping index Earth Observation products using photon recollision probability theory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clumping index (CI) is a measure of foliage aggregation relative to a random distribution of leaves in space. The CI can help with estimating fractions of sunlit and shaded leaves for a given leaf area index (LAI) value. Both the CI and LAI can be obtained from global Earth Observation data from sensors such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS). Here, the synergy between a MODIS-based CI and a MODIS LAI product is examined using the theory of spectral invariants, also referred to as photon recollision probability ('p-theory'), along with raw LAI-2000/2200 Plant Canopy Analyzer data from 75 sites distributed across a range of plant functional types. The p-theory describes the probability (p-value) that a photon, having intercepted an element in the canopy, will recollide with another canopy element rather than escape the canopy. We show that empirically-based CI maps can be integrated with the MODIS LAI product. Our results indicate that it is feasible to derive approximate p-values for any location solely from Earth Observation data. This approximation is relevant for future applications of the photon recollision probability concept for global and local monitoring of vegetation using Earth Observation data.

TI  - From conventional to Delay Doppler altimetry: A demonstration of continuity and improvements with the Cryosat-2 mission
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cryosat-2 is the first satellite that embarks an altimeter able to operate in several modes. Among them, the Synthetic Aperture Radar mode (SARM) also referred to as Delay Doppler mode is expected to improve the measurement resolution and precision. Based on a two year time series, this paper presents the SARM assessment over ocean. It demonstrates the seamless transition, below the centimeter level, between conventional pulse-limited and Delay Doppler altimetry at long wavelength for the sea level. Nevertheless, the SARM retrieved Significant Wave Height (SWH) is biased by 20 cm and depends on the sea state. This paper also confirms that, thanks to the better signal to noise ratio-and along track resolution brought by the SARM, the small scales observability is significantly improved with respect to the Low Resolution Mode (LRM). The SARM Sea Level reveals a spectral slope never observed for wavelength below 30 km that is not yet explained. Further analyses at global scales using the Sentinel-3A dataset will certainly help to characterize the source of this signal. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Surface albedo and toc-r 300 m products from PROBA-V instrument in the framework of Copernicus Global Land Service
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PROBA-V instrument launched in 2013 is offering a global daily coverage at pixel resolutions of 333 m and 1 km in three spectral bands (BLUE, RED, NIR) and 600 m for shortwave infrared (SWIR). The PROBA-V mission is the follow-on of the VEGETATION program started in 2000, which allowed generating long-term series at 1 km pixel resolution. The PROBA-V products belong to the Copernicus Global Land Service portfolio (http://land. copernicus.eu/global/). The sensor design of PROBA-V with oriented cameras offers a wide field of view (FOV) for sampling the BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function). This paper details the methodology implemented at the premises of VITO (Flemish Institute for Technological Research) with the aim to disseminate routinely from PROBA-V daily observations for both surface albedo (SA) and top-of-canopy corrected reflectance (TOC-R) products. The method classically operates a selection of cloudless scenes, performs atmospheric corrections, and finally applies a correction of directional effects on a pixel per pixel basis. The synthesis period is the decade and the composite period is 20 days. Such choice is a pointwise sampling as being a trade-off between the availability of clear scenes and the timescale for phenology. Regarding the albedo catalogue, a narrow-band to broadband conversion is stipulated. A recurrent technique serves for gap-filling based on the spread of weighed a priori data. Additional information concerns the quality flag and the age of the product. Preliminary accuracy assessment is performed through a comparison with the Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6. Dependable spatial consistency is reached except for wintertime with deviations in terms of rmse (root mean square errors) about 0.03 for visible and shortwave domains, and 0.04 for near infrared. Besides, both PROBA-V and MODIS C6 exhibit close time profiles, marked by smoothness or rapid transitions. Results over 10 confidence sites reveals rmse values of 0.032 and bias of 0.01 over the 2014 full annual cycle.

TI  - Integrated remote sensing approach to global agricultural drought monitoring
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explores the use of the Soil Moisture Agricultural Drought Index (SMADI) as a global estimator of agricultural drought. Previous research presented SMADI as a novel index based on the joint use of remotely sensed datasets of land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) together with the surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. This study presents the results of applying SMADI at the global scale with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees every 15 days. The period of the study spanned from 2010 to 2015. Three spatial scales (local, regional and global) were used to compare the agricultural drought events captured by SMADI against existing agricultural drought indices, as well as reported occurrences of drought events from dedicated databases.Results show that SMADI had good consistency with two agricultural indices in the center of the Iberian Peninsula at the local and regional scales, depicting 2012 and 2014 as the driest years in the area. A comparison of SMADI across the United States of America with the impact and intensity maps of drought from the US Drought Monitor (USDM) revealed a reasonable match with the temporal and spatial extent of the affected areas, detecting the most intense drought events. Finally, a comparison at the global scale with documented events of drought world-wide showed that SMADI was able to recognize more than 80% of these events for more than 50% of their duration.The calculation of the SMADI is simple and fast, and it relies on data that are readily available, thereby providing a rapid overview of drought-prone conditions that could enhance the present capabilities of early warning systems.

TI  - Imaging spectrometer emulates Landsat: A case study with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data are most useful if they are available with sufficient precision, accuracy, spatiotemporal and spectral sampling, as well as continuity across decades. The Landsat and Sentinel series, as well other satellites are currently covering significant parts of this observational trade space. It can be expected that growing demands and budget constraints will require new capabilities in orbit that can address as many observables as possible with a single instrument. Recent optical performance improvements of imaging spectrometers make them true alternatives to traditional multispectral imagers. However, they are much more adaptable to a wide range of Earth observation needs due to the combination of continuous high spectral sampling with spatial sampling consistent with previous sensors (e.g., Landsat). Unfortunately, there is a knowledge gap in demonstrating that imaging spectroscopy data can substitute for multi-spectral data while sustaining the long-term record. Thus, the objective of this analysis is to test the hypothesis that imaging spectroscopy data compare radiometrically with multi-spectral data to within 5%. Using a coincident Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight with over-passing Operational Land Imager (OLI) data on Landsat 8, we document a procedure for simulating OLI multi-spectral bands from AVIRIS data, evaluate influencing factors on the observed radiance, and assess the difference in top-of-atmosphere radiance as compared to OLI. The procedure for simulating OLI data include spectral convolution, accounting for the minimal atmospheric effects between the two sensors, and spatial resampling. The remaining differences between the simulated and the real OLI data result mainly from differences in sensor calibration, surface bi-directional reflectance, and spatial sampling. The median relative radiometric difference for each band ranges from - 8.3% to 0.6%. After bias-correction to minimize potential calibration discrepancies, we find no more than a 1.2% relative difference. This analysis therefore successfully demonstrates that imaging spectrometer data can contribute to Landsat-type or other multi-spectral data records. It also shows that cross-calibration from a spectrometer to a radiometer can be easily performed as a result of the imaging spectrometer high spectral sampling and its ability to recreate multi-spectral response functions.

TI  - Annual forest aboveground biomass changes mapped using ICESat/GLAS measurements, historical inventory data, and time-series optical and radar imagery for Guangdong province, China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) assessments are essential for accurate understanding of carbon accounting under forest disturbance effects and climate change. We mapped AGB data (from 1986 to 2016) by combining the forest inventories and multisource remotely sensed data, including the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite data and Landsat dense time series imagery, and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) mosaic data in Guangdong, China. We used random forest (RF) and stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) algorithms to determine the optimal variables of statistical models for mapping and validation of the AGB purpose. Our results showed that the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS)-based AGB correlated well (R-adj(2), = 0.89, n = 277, p < 0.001, RMSE = 21.24t/ha) with those obtained using the field-based method that used an RF-based approach, although inevitably, there is a saturation problem. The combined remotely sensed optical and radar imagery and ancillary data sets for mapping AGB using the RF algorithm yielded a stronger (R-adj(2), = 0.86, n = 558, p < 0.001, RMSE = 11.35t/ha) linear correlation with those produced using the GLAS waveform data than that produced using the SGB algorithm. The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of mapping forests based on the PALSAR-forest/non-forest Landsat-based phenology for AGB masking were approximately 92.1% and 0.83, respectively. Additionally, the total amount of AGB had increased from 1986 to 2016 by 55.9%. The same increasing trend was observed for total AGB in both mid-subtropical (from 42% to 62%) and south-subtropical (from 38% to 57%) evergreen broadleaved forests, whereas a decreasing trend was witnessed in the tropical forest, particularly after 2010. There was an upward trend of total AGB among the four economic zones of Guangdong; the mountainous area had the highest AGB value distribution, accounting for 58%-70%, followed by the Pearl River Delta region (20%-30%), the western coast of Guangdong (3%-9%), and the eastern coast of Guangdong (2%-7%). The resulting provincial continuous forest AGB maps will provide a better evaluation of carbon dynamic in southern China.

TI  - Asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on spring phenology in the temperate grasslands of China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spring phenology of temperate grasslands and its response to climate change are crucial for diagnosing the responses of ecosystem to regional climate change and projecting regional ecosystem carbon exchange. Using NDVI data from 1982 to 2015, this study investigated the changes of the start date of the vegetation growing season (SOS) for the temperate grasslands of China, and explored the possible effects of average monthly T-max, T-min, and total precipitation on the SOS across different grassland vegetation types. We improved on prior studies of climate change in China's temperate zone by focusing only on grasslands unchanged over this extended study period. The results showed that the SOS significantly advanced at a rate of 1.84 days/decade from 1982 to 2015, controlled mainly by spring precipitation and spring and winter temperatures, with differing degrees of influence among vegetation types. On average, an increase of 10 mm in spring precipitation would advance SOS by 1.7 days across the temperate grasslands of China. Although warmer temperatures generally led to advanced SOS, this study revealed for the first time that the seasonal effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the SOS of temperate grasslands in China were asymmetric, with T-max more influential in winter and Tmin more influential in spring. An increase of 1 degrees C in winter T-max and spring T-min would advance SOS by 0.42 and 1.34 days, respectively, compared with effects of 0.24 or 0.64 days for 1 degrees C increases in winter T-min or spring T-max. Given the global asymmetry in daytime and nighttime warming, this study highlights the asymmetric effects of daytime and nighttime warming on the SOS of temperate grasslands in China, and suggests that the impacts of seasonal T-max and T-min should be considered separately in the SOS modules of terrestrial ecosystem models for temperate grasslands.

TI  - The life cycle of crevasse splays as a key mechanism in the aggradation of alluvial ridges and river avulsion
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accommodation space in the unconfined distal part of low-gradient fluvial fans facilitates abundant floodplain deposition. Here, the development of crevasse splays plays a key role in the aggradation of alluvial ridges and subsequent river avulsion. This study presents an analysis of different stages in the evolution of crevasse splays based on observations made in the modern-day Rio Colorado dryland fluvial fan fringing the endorheic Altiplano Basin in Bolivia. A generic life cycle is proposed in which crevasse-splay channels adjust towards a graded equilibrium profile with their lower-lying distal termini acting as a local base level. Initial development is dominantly controlled by the outflow of floodwater, promoting erosion near the crevasse apex and deposition towards the splay fringes. When proximal incision advances to below the maximum level of floodplain inundation, return flow occurs during the waning stage of flooding. This floodwater reflux leads to a temporary repositioning of the local base level to the deeper trunk-channel thalweg at the apex of the crevasse-splay channels. The resultant decrease in the floodplainward gradient of these channels ultimately leads to backfilling and abandonment of the crevasse splay, leaving a subtle local elevation of the floodplain. Consecutive splays form an alluvial ridge through lateral amalgamation and subsequent vertical stacking, which is mirrored by the aggradation of their parent channel floor. As this alluvial ridge becomes increasingly perched above the surrounding floodplain, splay equilibration may cause incision of the levee crevasse down to or below its trunk channel thalweg, leading to an avulsion. The mechanisms proposed in this study are relevant to fluvial settings promoting progradational avulsions. The relatively rapid accumulation rate and high preservation potential of crevasse splays in this setting makes them an important constituent of the resultant fluvial stratigraphy, amongst which are hydrocarbon-bearing successions.

TI  - Capability of Sentinel-2 data for estimating maximum evapotranspiration and irrigation requirements for tomato crop in Central Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of water shortages ascribed to projected climate change, especially in the Mediterranean region, fosters the interest in remote sensing (RS) applications to optimize water use in agriculture. Remote sensing evapotranspiration and water demand estimation over large cultivated areas were used to manage irrigation to minimize losses during the crop growing cycle. The research aimed to explore the potential of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) sensor on board Sentinel-2A to estimate crop parameters, mainly surface albedo (alpha) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) that influence the dynamics of potential evapotranspiration (ETp) and Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR) of processing tomato crop (Solanum lycopersicum L.). Maximum tomato ETp was calculated according to the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (FAO-56 PM) using appropriate values of canopy parameters derived by processing Sentinel-2A data in combination with daily weather information. For comparison, we used the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) derived from the soil water balance (SWB) module in the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and calibrated with in-situ Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM). The experiment was set up in a privately-owned farm located in the Tarquinia irrigation district (Central Italy) during two growing seasons, within the framework of the EU Project FATIMA (FArming Tools for external nutrient Inputs and water Management). The results showed that canopy growth, maximum evapotranspiration (ETp) and IWR were accurately inferred from satellite observations following seasonal rainfall and air temperature patterns. The net estimated IWR from satellite observations for the two-growing seasons was about 272 and 338 mm in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Such estimated requirement was lower compared with the actual amount supplied by the farmer with sprinkler and drip micro-irrigation system in both growing seasons resulting in 364 (276 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) and 662 (574 mm drip micro-irrigation, and 88 mm sprinkler) mm, respectively. Our findings indicated the suitability of Sentinel-2A to predict tomato water demand at field level, providing useful information for optimizing the irrigation over extended farmland.

TI  - Vegetation phenology from Sentinel-2 and field cameras for a Dutch barrier island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing studies of vegetation phenology increasingly benefit from freely available satellite imagery acquired with high temporal frequency at fine spatial resolution. Particularly for heterogeneous landscapes this is good news, given the drawback of medium-resolution sensors commonly used for phenology retrieval (e.g., MODIS) to properly represent the fine-scale spatial variability of vegetation types. The Sentinel-2 mission acquires spectral data globally at 10 to 60 m resolution every five days. To illustrate the mission's potential for studying vegetation phenology, we retrieved phenological parameters for the Dutch barrier island Schiermonnikoog for a full season of Sentinel-2A observations in 2016. Overlapping orbits resulted in two acquisitions per 10 days, similar to what is achieved globally since the launch of Sentinel-2B. For eight locations on the island's salt marsh we compared greenness chromatic coordinate (GCC) series derived from digital repeat RGB-cameras with vegetation index series derived from Sentinel-2 (NDVI and GCC). For each series, a double hyperbolic tangent model was fitted and thresholds were applied to the modelled data to estimate start-, peak-, and end-of-season (SOS/PS/EOS). Variability in Sentinel-2 derived SOS, when taken as the midpoint between minimum and peak NDVI, was well-explained by camera GCC-based SOS (R-2 = 0.74, MSD = 8.0 days, RMSD = 13.0 days). However, EOS estimates from camera GCC series were on average almost two months before NDVI-based estimates. This could partially be explained by the observed exponential relationship between GCC and NDVI, as well as by the combined effect of viewing angle differences and the presence of nonphotosynthetic elements in the vegetation canopy. A two-layer canopy radiative transfer model incorporating reduced chlorophyll levels in the upper layer provided a physically-based explanation of the viewing angle effect. Finally, we applied the phenology retrieval approach to NDVI series for all pixels of the island in order to map spatial patterns of phenology at fine resolution. Our results demonstrate the potential of the Sentinel-2 mission for providing spatially-detailed retrievals of phenology.

TI  - Insights into the kinematics and dynamics of the Luanshibao rock avalanche (Tibetan Plateau, China) based on its complex surface landforms
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Complex topographic features on the surfaces of rock avalanche deposits have been regarded as important indicators for understanding avalanche kinematics and dynamics. Based on a combination of remote sensing data and in situ observations of surface landforms, including toreva blocks, transverse and longitudinal ridges, ridges separated by conjugate troughs, and hummocks, a giant Holocene rock avalanche on the Tibetan Plateau is recognized. This work aims to understand the kinematics of this event. In planview, the tongue-shaped rock avalanche exhibits a clear sequential distribution of various landforms. The translation zone (II) is characterised by toreva blocks originating from extension. In subzone III-1 of the accumulation zone (III), compression-related transverse ridges are well developed. Longitudinal ridges resulting from lateral velocity differences due to radial spreading are present in the front part of subzone III-1. Farther down, ridges separated by conjugate troughs (generated by a combination of compression and radial spreading) are common in subzone III-2. Subzone III-3 is characterised by abundant scattered hummocks with circular to oval shapes. Based on the distributions of these landforms, this rock avalanche is proposed to have mainly experienced a motion featuring laminar flow with radial spreading in its distal and marginal parts. During transport, three distinct processes appear to have occurred in the avalanche mass from the proximal to the distal zones: extension-dominated sliding in zone II, compression-dominated sliding in sub zones III-1 and III-2, and rapid radial spreading in subzone III-3.

TI  - An assessment of Landsat-8 atmospheric correction schemes and remote sensing reflectance products in coral reefs and coastal turbid waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat-8 satellite can provide remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) of aquatic environments with high spatial resolution (30 m), allowing for benthic habitat mapping and monitoring of bathymetry and water column optical properties. To facilitate these applications, accurate sensor-derived R-rs is required. In this study, we assess atmospheric correction schemes, including NASA's NIR-SWIR approach, Acolite's NIR and SWIR approaches and the cloud-shadow approach. We provide the first comprehensive evaluation for Landsat-8 R-rs retrievals in optically shallow coral reefs, along with an investigation of Landsat-8 R-rs products in a temperate turbid embayment. The obtained Landsat-8 R-rs data products are evaluated with concurrent in situ hyperspectral R-rs measurements. Our analyses show that the NASA and the cloud-shadow approaches generated reliable R-rs products across shallow coral reefs and optically deep waters. This evaluation suggests that high quality R-rs products are achievable from the Landsat-8 satellite in optically shallow environments, which supports further application of Landsat-8 type measurements for coral reef studies.

TI  - Scale-up of zeolite-Y/polyethersulfone substrate for composite membrane fabrication in CO<sub>2</sub> separation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A vacuum-assisted deposition setup was developed in pilot scale to scale up and continuously deposit zeolite-Y (ZY) nanoparticles on 14-in wide nanoporous polyethersulfone (PES) substrate. The deposited substrate was used for composite membrane fabrication for carbon capture from flue gas. The effects of operating parameters, including ZY dispersion concentration, pressure differential, and web speed, on the ZY layer thickness and uniformity were studied. A ZY dispersion concentration of 0.08 wt%, a pressure differential of 3.7 in Hg, and a web speed of 3 ft/min were identified as the optimal operating conditions for depositing a thin and uniform ZY layer with a thickness of approximately 160 nm. A mathematical model with two adjustable parameters was derived from Darcy's law to correlate the operating parameters to the ZY layer thickness. After coating a polymeric amine-containing selective layer on the deposited substrate, the formed composite membrane showed a CO2 permeance of 800 GPU with a CO2/N-2 selectivity over 150 at the typical flue gas temperature of 57 degrees C, which was superior to the performance of the membrane coated on the bare PES substrate. This improvement was due to the reduced selective layer penetration and effective diffusional length from the deposited substrate.

TI  - Sentinel-2A multi-temporal misregistration characterization and an orbit-based sub-pixel registration methodology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) provides global coverage 10 m to 60 m optical wavelength data in fixed geolocated tiles. Recently, it became apparent that when multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions are compared, they can be misregistered by more than one 10 m pixel. This study quantifies the multi-temporal misregistration by application of a recently published matching algorithm to all the available Sentinel-2A data sensed in six months (June 2nd to November 30th 2016) over 1400 x 3000 km of southern Africa. The Sentinel-2A L1C tile product processing software was updated by ESA on June 15th 2016. The results of our analysis show that the update reduced the mean multi-temporal Sentinel-2A tile misregistration from about 1.6 10 m pixels (standard deviation > 0.9 pixels) to 0.4 10 m pixels (standard deviation of about 0.2 pixels). Future updates to the ESA L1C tile product processing software are expected to further reduce this misregistration error. Meanwhile, users should exercise care when using multi-temporal Sentinel-2A data for applications that require precise sub-pixel registration. In solution, an orbit-based registration methodology that uses a least-squares adjustment applied to matches derived among Sentinel-2A tile acquisitions sensed in different orbits is described and demonstrated. For all the tile acquisitions in an orbit in a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) map projection zone, they are registered in the same manner, meaning that there are no relative shifts among the tile acquisitions from the same orbit in the registered data, and that the tile acquisitions that are obscured by cloud or that have a large amount of missing data can still be registered. Over 97% of the study data, including the data sensed before June 15th 2016, were registered. The mean tile registration precision was better than 0.15 10 m pixels (standard deviation 0.06 pixels) and is shown qualitatively to provide multi-temporal data with no visually obvious misregistration at 10 m resolution.

TI  - Interannual variations in surface urban heat island intensity and associated drivers in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial, diurnal and seasonal variations of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have been investigated in many places, but we still have limited understanding of the interannual variations of SUHIs and associated drivers. In this study, the interannual variations in SUHI intensity (SUHII, derived from MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data (8-day composites of twice-daily observations), urban LST minus rural) and their relationships with climate variability and urbanization were analyzed in 31 cities in China for the period 2001-2015. Significant increasing trends of SUHII were observed in 71.0%, 58.1%, 25.8% and 54.8% the cities in summer days (SDs), summer nights (SNs), winter days (WDs) and winter nights (WNs), respectively. Pearson's correlation analyses were first performed from a temporal perspective, which were different from a spatial perspective as previous studies. The results showed that the SUHII in SDs and WDs was negatively correlated with the background LST and mean air temperature in most of the cities. The nighttime SUHII in most cities was negatively and positively correlated with total precipitation and total sunshine duration, respectively. Average wind speed has little effect on SUHII. Decreasing vegetation and increased population were the main factors that contributed to the increased SUHII in SDs and SNs, while albedo only influenced the SUHII in WDs. In addition, Pearson's correlation analyses across cities showed that cities with higher decreasing rates of vegetation exhibited higher increasing rates of the SUHII in SDs and WDs. Cities with larger population growth rates do not necessarily have higher increasing rates of SUHII.

TI  - PLC: A simple and semi-physical topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rugged terrain distorts optical remote sensing signals, and land-cover classification and biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions must account for topographic effects. Therefore, topographic correction is a prerequisite for many remote sensing applications. In this study, we proposed a semi-physically based and simple topographic correction method for vegetation canopies based on path length correction (PLC). The PLC method was derived from the solution to the classic radiative transfer equation, and the influence of terrain on the radiative transfer process within the canopy is explicitly considered, making PLC physically sound. The radiative transfer equation was simplified to make PLC mathematically simple. Near-nadir observations derived from a Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image covering a mountainous region and wide field-of-view observations derived from simulation using a canopy reflectance model were combined to test the PLC correction method. Multi-criteria were used to provide objective evaluation results. The performances were compared to that of five other methods: CC, SCS + C, and SE, which are empirical parameter-based methods, and SCS and DS, which are semi-physical methods without empirical parameter. All the six methods could significantly reduce the topographic effects. However, SCS showed obvious overcorrection for near-nadir observations. The correction results from D-S showed an obvious positive bias. For near-nadir observations, the performance of PLC was comparable to the well-validated parameter-based methods. For wide field-of-view observations, PLC obviously outperformed all other methods. Because of the physical soundness and mathematical simplicity, PLC provides an efficient approach to correct the terrain-induced canopy BRDF distortion and will facilitate the exploitation of multi-angular information for biophysical parameter retrieval over mountainous regions.

TI  - A regime-dependent retrieval algorithm for near-surface air temperature and specific humidity from multi-microwave sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface specific humidity (q(a)) and air temperature (T-a) over the global ocean are important meteorological variables, but they cannot be retrieved directly from remote sensing. Many efforts have been made to develop algorithms that derive q(a) and T-a from multisensor microwave and/or infrared observations using in situ measurements as training datasets. However, uncertainty remains large in the resultant q(a) and T-a retrievals. In this study, 147 moored surface buoys are used to examine how buoy measured q(a) and T-a are related to satellite microwave brightness temperature (Tb) on the spatial scale from the warm/humid tropics to the cold/dry high latitudes. It is found that the Tb - q(a) and Tb - T-a relations are structured along two distinct, near-linear bands, with the primary band in the warm/humid regime and a secondary (weaker) band in the cold/dry regime. The step-like transition (or separation) between the two regimes occurs at 8-10 g kg(-1) for q(a) and 14-17 degrees C for T-a. The evidence suggests that one algorithm may not be sufficient to extract q(a) and T-a from Tb in all regimes. Therefore, a high-latitude enhancement is added to the global algorithm so that the q(a) and T-a retrievals in the dry/cold regime can be specifically addressed. The new algorithms are applied to 11 microwave sensors, including SSM/I, SSMIS, and AMSU-A, from 1988 to 2016. Based on the 475,717 buoy collocations during the 29-year period, the retrieved q(a) and T-a have root-mean-square differences of 0.82 g kg(-1) and 0.51 degrees C, respectively.

TI  - Characterization of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 top of atmosphere, surface, and nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance and NDVI differences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The medium spatial resolution satellite data from the polar-orbiting Sentinel-2A Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensors provide 10 m to 30 m multi-spectral global coverage with a better than 5-day revisit. There are a number of differences between the sensor data that need to be considered before the data can be used together reliably. Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data for approximately 10 degrees x 10 degrees of southern Africa acquired in two summer (December and January) and in two winter (June and July) months of 2016 were compared. The data were registered and each orbit projected into 30 m fixed non-overlapping tiles defined in the sinusoidal equal area projection. Only corresponding sensor observations of each 30 m tile pixel that were both not cloudy, shadow, saturated, or cirrus contaminated, and that were acquired within one-day of each other, were compared. Both the Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data were atmospherically corrected using the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) and were also corrected to nadir BRDF adjusted reflectance (NBAR). Top of atmosphere (TOA), surface reflectance, and NBAR, for the spectrally corresponding visible, near infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) MSI and OLI bands, and derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (from the narrow NIR band for MSI), were compared and their sensor differences quantified by regression analyses. Atmospheric contamination and bi-directional reflectance differences were evident in the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI observations considered. The MSI surface reflectance was greater than the OLI surface reflectance for all the bands except the green, red, and the broad MSI NIR bands, and the MSI surface NDVI was greater than the OLI surface NDVI. This pattern was also found in the NBAR sensor comparisons except for the red bands. Simulated MSI and OLI reflectance derived using the sensor spectral response functions and laboratory spectra showed similar results in the red, NIR and SWIR bands as the real data comparisons. Ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regressions of the 65 million pairs of contemporaneous MSI and OLI data for the three processing levels had good fits (r(2) > 0.87 for the TOA data comparisons, r(2) > 0.89 for the atmospherically corrected data comparisons, r(2) > 0.90 for the NBAR data comparisons; p-values < 0.0001). The OLS regression coefficients are provided so that they can be used to help improve the consistency between Sentinel-2A MSI and Landsat-8 OLI data.

TI  - Spatial snow water equivalent estimation for mountainous areas using wireless-sensor networks and remote-sensing products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed an approach to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) through interpolation of spatially representative point measurements using a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm and historical spatial SWE data. It accurately reproduced measured SWE, using different data sources for training and evaluation. In the central-Sierra American River basin, we used a k-NN algorithm to interpolate data from continuous snow-depth measurements in 10 sensor clusters by fusing them with 14 years of daily 500-m resolution SWE-reconstruction maps. Accurate SWE estimation over the melt season shows the potential for providing daily, near real-time distributed snowmelt estimates. Further south, in the Merced-Tuolumne basins, we evaluated the potential of k-NN approach to improve real-time SWE estimates. Lacking dense ground-measurement networks, we simulated k-NN interpolation of sensor data using selected pixels of a bi-weekly Lidar-derived snow water equivalent product. k-NN extrapolations underestimate the Lidar-derived SWE, with a maximum bias of -10 cm at elevations below 3000 m and +15 cm above 3000 m. This bias was reduced by using a Gaussian-process regression model to spatially distribute residuals. Using as few as 10 scenes of Lidar-derived SWE from 2014 as training data in the k-NN to estimate the 2016 spatial SWE, both RMSEs and MAEs were reduced from around 20-25 cm to 10-15 cm comparing to using SWE reconstructions as training data. We found that the spatial accuracy of the historical data is more important for learning the spatial distribution of SWE than the number of historical scenes available. Blending continuous spatially representative ground-based sensors with a historical library of SWE reconstructions over the same basin can provide real-time spatial SWE maps that accurately represents Lidar-measured snow depth; and the estimates can be improved by using historical Lidar scans instead of SWE reconstructions.

TI  - Multiscale divergence between Landsat- and lidar-based biomass mapping is related to regional variation in canopy cover and composition
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Satellite-based aboveground forest biomass maps commonly form the basis of forest biomass and carbon stock mapping and monitoring, but biomass maps likely vary in performance by region and as a function of spatial scale of aggregation. Assessing such variability is not possible with spatially-sparse vegetation plot networks. In the current study, our objective was to determine whether high-resolution lidar-based and moderate-resolution Landsat-base aboveground live forest biomass maps converged on similar predictions at stand- to landscape-levels (10 s to 100 s ha) and whether such differences depended on biophysical setting. Specifically, we examined deviations between lidar- and Landsat-based biomass mapping methods across scales and ecoregions using a measure of error (normalized root mean square deviation), a measure of the unsystematic deviations, or noise (Pearson correlation coefficient), and two measures related to systematic deviations, or biases (intercept and slope of a regression between the two sets of predictions).Results: Compared to forest inventory data (0.81-ha aggregate-level), lidar and Landsat-based mean biomass predictions exhibited similar performance, though lidar predictions exhibited less normalized root mean square deviation than Landsat when compared with the reference plot data. Across aggregate-levels, the intercepts and slopes of regression equations describing the relationships between lidar- and Landsat-based biomass predictions stabilized (i.e., little additional change with increasing area of aggregates) at aggregate-levels between 10 and 100 ha, suggesting a consistent relationship between the two maps at landscape-scales. Differences between lidar- and Landsat-based biomass maps varied as a function of forest canopy heterogeneity and composition, with systematic deviations (regression intercepts) increasing with mean canopy cover and hardwood proportion within forests and correlations decreasing with hardwood proportion.Conclusions: Deviations between lidar- and Landsat-based maps indicated that satellite-based approaches may represent general gradients in forest biomass. Ecoregion impacted deviations between lidar and Landsat biomass maps, highlighting the importance of biophysical setting in determining biomass map performance across aggregate scales. Therefore, regardless of the source of remote sensing (e.g., Landsat vs. lidar), factors affecting the measurement and prediction of forest biomass, such as species composition, need to be taken into account whether one is estimating biomass at the plot, stand, or landscape scale.

TI  - On estimating the gross primary productivity of Mediterranean grasslands under different fertilization regimes using vegetation indices and hyperspectral reflectance
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We applied an empirical modelling approach for gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation from hyperspectral reflectance of Mediterranean grasslands undergoing different fertilization treatments. The objective of the study was to identify combinations of vegetation indices and bands that best represent GPP changes between the annual peak of growth and senescence dry out in Mediterranean grasslands.In situ hyperspectral reflectance of vegetation and CO2 gas exchange measurements were measured concurrently in unfertilized (C) and fertilized plots with added nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) or the combination of N, P and potassium (NPK). Reflectance values were aggregated according to their similarity (r >= 90 %) in 26 continuous wavelength intervals (Hyp). In addition, the same reflectance values were resampled by reproducing the spectral bands of both the Sentinel-2A Multispectral Instrument (S2) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (L8) and simulating the signal that would be captured in ideal conditions by either Sentinel-2A or Landsat 8.An optimal procedure for selection of the best subset of predictor variables (LEAPS) was applied to identify the most effective set of vegetation indices or spectral bands for GPP estimation using Hyp, S2 or L8. LEAPS selected vegetation indices according to their explanatory power, showing their importance as indicators of the dynamic changes occurring in community vegetation properties such as canopy water content (NDWI) or chlorophyll and carotenoids / chlorophyll ratio (MTCI, PSRI, GNDVI) and revealing their usefulness for grasslands GPP estimates.For Hyp and S2, bands performed as well as vegetation indices to estimate GPP. To identify spectral bands with a potential for improving GPP estimates based on vegetation indices, we applied a two-step procedure which clearly indicated the short-wave infrared region of the spectra as the most relevant for this purpose. A comparison between S2- and L8-based models showed similar explanatory powers for the two simulated satellite sensors when both vegetation indices and bands were included in the model.Altogether, our results describe the potential of sensors on board Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites for monitoring grassland phenology and improving GPP estimates in support of a sustainable agriculture management.

TI  - Outdoor particulate matter (PM<sub>10</sub>) exposure and lung cancer risk in the EAGLE study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveCohort studies in Europe, but not in North-America, showed an association between exposure to outdoor particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m (PM10) and lung cancer risk. Only a case-control study on lung cancer and PM10 in South Korea has so far been performed. For the first time in Europe we analyzed quantitatively this association using a case-control study design in highly polluted areas in Italy.MethodsThe Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, a population-based case-control study performed in the period 2002-2005 in the Lombardy Region, north-west Italy, enrolled 2099 cases and 2120 controls frequency-matched for area of residence, gender, and age. For this study we selected subjects with complete active and passive smoking history living in the same municipality since 1980 until study enrollment. Fine resolution annual PM10 estimates obtained by applying land use regression modeling to satellite data calibrated with fixed site monitor measurements were used. We assigned each subject the PM10 average estimates for year 2000 based on enrollment address. We used logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for matching variables, education, smoking, and dietary and occupational variables.ResultsWe included 3473 subjects, 1665 cases (1318 men, 347 women) and 1808 controls (1368 men, 440 women), with PM10 individual levels ranging from 2.3 to 53.8 mu g/m(3) (mean: 46.3). We found increasing lung cancer risk with increasing PM10 category (P-value for trend: 0.04). The OR per 10 mu g/m(3) was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.95-1.72). The association appeared stronger for squamous cell carcinoma (OR 1.44, 95% CI: 0.90-2.29).ConclusionIn a population living in highly polluted areas in Italy, our study added suggestive evidence of a positive association between PM10 exposure and lung cancer risk. This study emphasizes the need to strengthen policies to reduce airborne pollution.

TI  - Modelling leaf spectral properties in a soybean functional-structural plant model by integrating the prospect radiative transfer model
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims Currently. functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) mostly resort to static descriptions of leaf spectral characteristics, which disregard the influence of leaf physiological changes over time. In many crop species, including soybean, these time-dependent physiological changes are of particular importance as leaf chlorophyll content changes with leaf age and vegetative nitrogen is remobilized to the developing fruit during pod filling.Methods PROSPECT, a model developed to estimate leaf biochemical composition from remote sensing data, is well suited to allow a dynamic approximation of leaf spectral characteristics in terms of leaf composition. In this study. measurements of the chlorophyll content index (CCI) were linked to leaf spectral characteristics within the 400-800 nm range by integrating the PROSPECT model into a soybean FSPM alongside a wavelength-specific light model.Key Results Straightforward links between the CCI and the parameters of the PROSPECT model allowed us to estimate leaf spectral characteristics with high accuracy using only the CCI as an input. After integration with an FSPM, this allowed digital reconstruction of leaf spectral characteristics on the scale of both individual leaves and the whole canopy. As a result, accurate simulations of light conditions within the canopy were obtained.Conclusions The proposed approach resulted in a very accurate representation of leaf spectral properties, based on fast and simple measurements of the CCI. Integration of accurate leaf spectral characteristics into a soybean FSPM leads to a better, dynamic understanding of the actual perceived light within the canopy in terms of both light quantity and quality.

TI  - Susceptibility to <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> malaria associated with DARC (Duffy antigen) polymorphisms is influenced by the time of exposure to malaria
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaria has provided a major selective pressure and has modulated the genetic diversity of the human genome. The variants of the Duffy Antigen/Receptor for Chemokines (DARC) gene have probably been selected by malaria parasites, particularly the FY*O allele, which is fixed in sub-Saharan Africa and confers resistance to Plasmodium vivax infection. Here, we showed the influence of genomic ancestry on the distribution of DARC genotypes in a highly admixed Brazilian population and confirmed the decreased susceptibility of the FY*A/FY*O genotype to clinical P. vivax malaria. FY*B/FY*O individuals were associated with a greater risk of developing clinical malaria. A remarkable difference among DARC variants concerning the susceptibility to clinical malaria was more evident for individuals who were less exposed to malaria, as measured by the time of residence in the endemic area. Additionally, we found that DARC-negative and FY*A/FY*O individuals had a greater chance of acquiring high levels of antibodies against the 19-kDa C-terminal region of the P. vivax merozoite surface protein-1. Altogether, our results provide evidence that DARC polymorphisms modulate the susceptibility to clinical P. vivax malaria and influence the naturally-acquired humoral immune response to malaria blood antigens, which may interfere with the efficacy of a future vaccine against malaria.

TI  - Changes in the aerosol direct radiative forcing from 2001 to 2015: observational constraints and regional mechanisms
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present estimates of changes in the direct aerosol effects (DRE) and its anthropogenic component (DRF) from 2001 to 2015 using the GFDL chemistry-climate model AM3 driven by CMIP6 historical emissions. AM3 is evaluated against observed changes in the clear-sky shortwave direct aerosol effect (DREswclr) derived from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) over polluted regions. From 2001 to 2015, observations suggest that DREclrsw increases (i.e., less radiation is scattered to space by aerosols) over western Europe (0.7-1 W m(-2) decade(-1)) and the eastern US (0.9-1.4 W m(-2) decade(-1)), decreases over India (-1 to -1.6 W m(-2) decade(-1)), and does not change significantly over eastern China. AM3 captures these observed regional changes in DREclrsw well in the US and western Europe, where they are dominated by the decline of sulfate aerosols, but not in Asia, where the model overestimates the decrease of DREclrsw. Over India, the model bias can be partly attributed to a decrease of the dust optical depth, which is not captured by our model and offsets some of the increase of anthropogenic aerosols. Over China, we find that the decline of SO2 emissions after 2007 is not represented in the CMIP6 emission inventory. Accounting for this decline, using the Modular Emission Inventory for China, and for the heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 significantly reduces the model bias. For both India and China, our simulations indicate that nitrate and black carbon contribute more to changes in DREclrsw than in the US and Europe. Indeed, our model suggests that black carbon (+0.12 W m(-2)) dominates the relatively weak change in DRF from 2001 to 2015 (+0.03 W m(-2)). Over this period, the changes in the forcing from nitrate and sulfate are both small and of the same magnitude (-0.03 W m(-2) each). This is in sharp contrast to the forcing from 1850 to 2001 in which forcings by sulfate and black carbon largely cancel each other out, with minor contributions from nitrate. The differences between these time periods can be well understood from changes in emissions alone for black carbon but not for nitrate and sulfate; this reflects non-linear changes in the photochemical production of nitrate and sulfate associated with changes in both the magnitude and spatial distribution of anthropogenic emissions.

TI  - Aerosol-induced intensification of cooling effect of clouds during Indian summer monsoon
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements and models show that enhanced aerosol concentrations can modify macroand micro-physical properties of clouds. Here, we examine the effect of aerosols on continental mesoscale convective cloud systems during the Indian summer monsoon and find that these aerosol-cloud interactions have a net cooling effect at the surface and the top-ofatmosphere. Long-term (2002-2016) satellite data provide evidence of aerosol-induced cloud invigoration effect (AIvE) during the Indian summer monsoon. The AIvE leads to enhanced formation of thicker stratiform anvil clouds at higher altitudes. These AIvE-induced stratiform anvil clouds are also relatively brighter because of the presence of smaller sized ice particles. As a result, AIvE-induced increase in shortwave cloud radiative forcing is much larger than longwave cloud radiative forcing leading to the intensified net cooling effect of clouds over the Indian summer monsoon region. Such aerosol-induced cooling could subsequently decrease the surface diurnal temperature range and have significant feedbacks on lower tropospheric turbulence in a warmer and polluted future scenario.

TI  - Evaluating the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic stratocumulus clouds as observed by MSG SEVIRI
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine stratocumulus (Sc) clouds play an essential role in the earth radiation budget. Here, we compare liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical thickness (tau), and cloud droplet effective radius (r(e)) retrievals from 2 years of collocated Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI) observations; estimate the effect of biomass burning smoke on passive imager retrievals; and evaluate the diurnal cycle of South Atlantic marine Sc clouds.The effect of absorbing aerosols from biomass burning on the retrievals was investigated using the aerosol index (AI) obtained from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). SEVIRI and MODIS LWPs were found to decrease with increasing AI relative to TMI LWP, consistent with well-known negative visible/near-infrared (VIS/NIR) retrieval biases in tau and r(e). In the aerosol-affected months of July-August-September, SEVIRI LWP - based on the 1.6 mu m r(e) - was biased low by 14 gm 2 (similar to 16 %) compared to TMI in overcast scenes, while MODIS LWP showed a smaller low bias of 4 gm 2 (similar to 5 %) for the 1.6 mu m channel and a high bias of 8 gm 2 (similar to 10 %) for the 3.7 mu m channel compared to TMI. Neglecting aerosol-affected pixels reduced the mean SEVIRI-TMI LWP bias considerably. For 2 years of data, SEVIRI LWP had a correlation with TMI and MODIS LWP of about 0.86 and 0.94, respectively, and biases of only 4-8 gm(-2) (5 %-10 %) for overcast cases.The SEVIRI LWP diurnal cycle was in good overall agreement with TMI except in the aerosol-affected months. Both TMI and SEVIRI LWP decreased from morning to late afternoon, after which a slow increase was observed. Terra and Aqua MODIS mean LWPs also suggested a similar diurnal variation. The relative amplitude of the 2-year-mean and seasonal-mean LWP diurnal cycle varied between 35% and 40% from morning to late afternoon for overcast cases. The diurnal variation in SEVIRI LWP was mainly due to changes in tau, while r(e) showed only little diurnal variability.

TI  - Skeletal muscle metabolomics and blood biochemistry analysis reveal metabolic changes associated with dietary amino acid supplementation in dairy calves
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of different amino acid (AA) supplementations of milk protein-based milk replacers in pre-ruminant calves from 3 days to 7 weeks of age were studied. Animals were divided into 4 groups: Ctrl) Control group fed with milk protein-based milk replacer without supplementation; GP) supplementation with 0.1% glycine and 0.3% proline; FY) supplementation with 0.2% phenylalanine and 0.2% tyrosine; MKT) supplementation with 0.62% lysine, 0.22% methionine and 0.61% threonine. For statistical analysis, t-test was used to compare AA-supplemented animals to the Ctrl group. At week 7, body weight and average daily gain (ADG) were measured and blood samples and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken. Blood biochemistry analytes related to energy metabolism were determined and it was shown that MKT group had higher serum creatinine and higher plasma concentration of three supplemented AAs as well as arginine compared with the Ctrl group. GP group had similar glycine/ proline plasma concentration compared with the other groups while in FY group only plasma phenylalanine concentration was higher compared with Control. Although the AA supplementations in the GP and FY groups did not affect average daily gain and metabolic health profile from serum, the metabolome analysis from skeletal muscle biopsy revealed several differences between the GP-FY groups and the Ctrl-MKT groups, suggesting a metabolic adaptation especially in GP and FY groups.

TI  - Snow Cover Change as a Climate Indicator in Brunswick Peninsula, Patagonia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover changes are assessed for the Brunswick Peninsula in southern Patagonia (52.9 degrees S to 53.5 degrees S), located on the transition between the wet Pacific Ocean area and the drier leeward side of the Andes. We use the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and a new index which we call Snowpower, combining the NDSI and the Melt Area Detection Index (MADI), to reconstruct the snow cover extent and its temporal distribution for the period 2000-2016, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Sensor (MODIS) MOD09GA products. Comparison of these satellite-derived products with available snow duration and snow height data for 2010-2016 at the local Club Andino ski center of Punta Arenas shows that the NDSI exhibits the best agreement. A reasonable and significant linear correlation is found between the MODIS NDSI snow cover extent and the mean monthly temperature at Punta Arenas Airport combined with the monthly snow accumulation at Jorge Schythe station at Punta Arenas city for the extended winter period (April to September) from 2000 to 2016. Snow cover changes within this time series are extended to 1972 and 1958 based on historical climate data of Jorge Schythe and Punta Arenas airport, repectively. The results show a significant decreasing trend of snow extent of 19% for Brunswick Peninsula for the 45-year period (1972-2016), which can be attributed to a statistically significant long-term warming of 0.71 degrees C at Punta Arenas during the extended winter (April-September) in the same period. Multiple correlation with different climate variables indicates that solid precipitation has a relevant role on short-term snow cover variability, but is not related to the observed long-term snow cover decrease.

T2  - PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The coordination of humanitarian relief, e.g. in a natural disaster or a conflict situation, is often complicated by a scarcity of data to inform planning. Remote sensing imagery, from satellites or drones, can give important insights into conditions on the ground, including in areas which are difficult to access. Applications include situation awareness after natural disasters, structural damage assessment in conflict, monitoring human rights violations or population estimation in settlements. We review machine learning approaches for automating these problems, and discuss their potential and limitations. We also provide a case study of experiments using deep learning methods to count the numbers of structures in multiple refugee settlements in Africa and the Middle East. We find that while high levels of accuracy are possible, there is considerable variation in the characteristics of imagery collected from different sensors and regions. In this, as in the other applications discussed in the paper, critical inferences must be made from a relatively small amount of pixel data. We, therefore, consider that using machine learning systems as an augmentation of human analysts is a reasonable strategy to transition from current fully manual operational pipelines to ones which are both more efficient and have the necessary levels of quality control.This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The growing ubiquity of algorithms in society: implications, impacts and innovations'.

TI  - Spectral preservation fusion for remote sensing images using focus measure operators based on fast discrete curvelet transform and hyperspherical color space
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - How to preserve the spectral information when enhancing the spatial details is a key issue of remote sensing image fusion. The component substitution (CS)-based fusion methods can effectively enhance the spatial details while suffering spectral distortion, and multiresolution analysis (MRA)-based methods have advantages in preserving spectral information but are not satisfactory in terms of spatial details. This paper proposes a hybrid method to integrate the advantages of CS- and MRA-based approaches. The intensity image is first obtained from an original multispectral (MS) image by hyperspherical color space (HCS) transform; then, the intensity image and original panchromatic (PAN) image are decomposed by fast discrete curvelet transform (FDCT). The focus measure operators are introduced to fused low-frequency, middle-high frequency, and fine scale subband coefficients in curvelet domain with specific fusion strategies. The final fusion image is achieved by inverse FDCT and inverse HCS transform. From the aspects of subjective and objective quality assessments, the experimental results on various types of remote sensing images including IKONOS, QuickBird, and WorldView-2 indicate that compared with existing well-known algorithms and commercial softwares, the proposed method shows obvious advantages in preserving spectral information and maintaining the spatial details.

TI  - Introducing novel and comprehensive models for predicting recurrence in breast cancer using the group LASSO approach: are estimates of early and late recurrence different?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In here, we constructed personalized models for predicting breast cancer (BC) recurrence according to timing of recurrence (as early and late recurrence).Methods: An efficient algorithm called group LASSO was used for simultaneous variable selection and risk factor prediction in a logistic regression model.Results: For recurrence < 5 years, age (OR 0.96, 95% CI = 0.95-0.97), number of pregnancies (OR 0.94, 95% CI = 0. 89 0.99), family history of other cancers (OR 0.73, 95% CI = 0.60-0.89), hormone therapy (OR 0.76, 95% CI = 0.61-0. 96), dissected lymph nodes (OR 0.98, 95% CI = 0.97-0.99), right-sided BC (OR 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.99), diabetes (OR 0.77, 95% CI = 0.60-0.98), history of breast operations (OR 0.38, 95% CI = 0.17-0.88), smoking (OR 5.72, 95% CI = 2. 11-15.55), history of breast disease (OR 3.32, 95% CI = 1.92-5.76), in situ component (OR 1.58, 95% CI = 1.35-1.84), tumor necrosis (OR 1.87, 95% CI = 1.57-2.22), sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) (OR 2.90, 95% CI = 2.05-4.11) and SLNB+axillary node dissection (OR 3.50, 95% CI = 2.26-5.42), grade 3 (OR 1.79, 95% CI = 1.46-2.21), stage 2 (OR 2.71, 95% CI = 2.18-335), stages 3 and 4 (OR 5.01, 95% CI = 3.52-7.13), and mastectomy+radiotherapy (OR 2.97, 95% CI = 2.39-3.68) were predictors of recurrence <5 years. Moreover, relative to mastectomy without radiotherapy (as reference for comparison), quadrantectomy without radiotherapy had a noticeably higher odds ratio compared to quadranectomy with radiotherapy for recurrence <5 years. (OR 17.58, 95% CI = 6.70-46.10 vs. OR: 2.50, 95% CI = 2-3.12). Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were 82%, 75.6%, and 74.9%, respectively.For recurrence > 5 years, stage 2 cancer (OR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.31-2.14) and radiotherapy+mastectomy (OR 2.45, 95% CI = 1.81-3.32) were significant predictors; furthermore, relative to mastectomy without radiotherapy (as reference for comparison), quadranectomy without radiotherapy had a noticeably higher odds ratio compared to quadranectomy with radiotherapy for recurrence > 5 years (OR 7.62, 95% CI = 1.52-38.15 vs. OR 1.75, 95% CI = 1.32-2.32). Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the model were 71%, 78.8%, and 55.8%, respectively.Conclusion: For the first time, we constructed models for estimating recurrence based on timing of recurrence which are among the most applicable models with excellent accuracy (> 80%).

TI  - Using the Gaofen-4 geostationary satellite to retrieve aerosols with high spatiotemporal resolution
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - GaoFen-4 (GF-4) is China's first optical remote sensing geostationary satellite, which observes the Earth's surface every 20 s. GF-4 has a gaze camera with a ground resolution of 50 m in the visible spectral bands that are sensitive to aerosol optical depth (AOD). AOD retrieval was completed using initial prior surface reflectance in ground-atmosphere decoupling. Surface reflectance was then updated using satellite measurements. The algorithm used in this study was based on two time-adjacent images of GF-4 (which have a constant viewing angle in the same area) and on the following two assumptions: (1) AOD varies quickly with time, but slowly with location and (2) surface reflectance varies quickly with location, but slowly with time. AOD retrieval was then accomplished using a lookup table strategy. The data from June 2016, in the North China Plain were selected for the AOD retrieval test. GF-4-derived AOD was validated using ground measurements from the aerosol robotic network and Sun-Sky radiometer network with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.794. The derived results agreed reasonably well with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer collection 6.0 aerosol product, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.893. The atmospheric distribution and changes in some parts of the North China Plain were analyzed using the aerosol products of GF-4. The results showed that it is feasible to use the time-series imaging method to conduct high spatiotemporal resolution aerosol inversion using GF-4's data, which can be used for detecting changes in air pollution.

TI  - GreenHouse gas Observations of the Stratosphere and Troposphere (GHOST): an airborne shortwave-infrared spectrometer for remote sensing of greenhouse gases
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - GHOST is a novel, compact shortwave-infrared grating spectrometer, designed for remote sensing of tropospheric columns of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from an airborne platform. It observes solar radiation at medium to high spectral resolution (better than 0.3 nm), which has been reflected by the Earth's surface using similar methods to those used by polar-orbiting satellites such as the JAXA GOSAT mission, NASA's OCO-2, and the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor. By using an original design comprising optical fibre inputs along with a single diffraction grating and detector array, GHOST is able to observe CO2 absorption bands centred around 1.61 and 2.06 mu m (the same wavelength regions used by OCO-2 and GOSAT) whilst simultaneously measuring CH4 absorption at 1.65 mu m (also observed by GOSAT) and CH4 and CO at 2.30 mu m (observed by Sentinel-5P). With emissions expected to become more concentrated towards city sources as the global population residing in urban areas increases, there emerges a clear requirement to bridge the spatial scale gap between small-scale urban emission sources and global-scale GHG variations. In addition to the benefits achieved in spatial coverage through being able to remotely sense GHG tropospheric columns from an aircraft, the overlapping spectral ranges and comparable spectral resolutions mean that GHOST has unique potential for providing validation opportunities for these platforms, particularly over the ocean, where ground-based validation measurements are not available. In this paper we provide an overview of the GHOST instrument, calibration, and data processing, demonstrating the instrument's performance and suitability for GHG remote sensing. We also report on the first GHG observations made by GHOST during its maiden science flights on board the NASA Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle, which took place over the eastern Pacific Ocean in March 2015 as part of the CAST/ATTREX joint Global Hawk flight campaign.

TI  - Performance of existing QAAs in Secchi disk depth retrieval in phytoplankton and dissolved organic matter dominated inland waters
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A semianalytical model developed to estimate the Secchi disk depth (Z(SD)) was used in eutrophic-to-hypereutrophic reservoirs (Ibitinga, Ibi, and Barra Bonita, BB) placed in the cascade system of the Tiete River, Brazil. The model was evaluated using the simulated remote sensing reflectance based on the Ocean and Land Color Instrument/Sentinel-3A and the Operational Land Imager/Landsat-8 from both reservoirs. Three quasianalytical algorithm (QAA) versions (QAA(v5), QAA(M14), and QAA(w16)) were evaluated to derive the absorption and backscattering coefficients, and then used for Z(SD) retrieval. For BB, where the chlorophyll-a concentration exceeded 200 mg m(-3) , the model based on QAA(v5) showed high uncertainties while the QAA(w16), which was originally parameterized for BB showed better performance regarding the Z(SD) retrieval (mean absolute percentage errors-MAPE of 22%). However, QAA(w16) did not perform satisfactorily for Ibi, which is dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). For Ibi, QAA(v5) provided the best result with MAPE of 34.60%, followed by QAA(M14) with 34.65%. QAA-based Z(SD) models tend to perform poorly in waters with high concentration of chlorophyll-a possibly due to phytoplankton package effect, whereas the same models may require additional parameterization in waters dominated by CDOM. Landsat-8 data showed significant potential for Z(SD) retrieval in inland waters. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Does Environment Filtering or Seed Limitation Determine Post-fire Forest Recovery Patterns in Boreal Larch Forests?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire is a primary natural disturbance in boreal forests, and post-fire vegetation recovery rate influences carbon, water, and energy exchange between the land and atmosphere in the region. Seed availability and environmental filtering are two important determinants in regulating post-fire vegetation recovery in boreal forests. Quantifying how these determinants change over time is helpful for understanding post-fire forest successional trajectory. Time series of remote sensing data offer considerable potential in monitoring the trajectory of post-fire vegetation recovery dynamics beyond current field surveys about structural attributes, which generally lack a temporal perspective across large burned areas. We used a time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference shortwave infrared reflectance index (NDSWIR) derived from Landsat images to investigate post-fire dynamics in a Chinese boreal larch forest. An adjacent, unburned patch of a similar forest type and environmental conditions was selected as a control to separate interannual fluctuation in NDVI and NDSWIR caused by climate from changes due to wildfire. Temporal anomalies in NDVI and NDSWIR showed that more than 10 years were needed for ecosystems to recover to a pre-fire state. The boosted regression tree analysis showed that fire severity exerted a persistent, dominant influence on vegetation recovery during the early post-fire successional stage and explained more than 60% of variation in vegetation recovery, whereas distance to the nearest unburned area and environmental conditions exhibited a relatively small influence. This result indicated that the legacy effects of fire disturbance, which control seed availability for tree recruitment, would persist for decades. The influence of environmental filtering could increase with succession and could mitigate the initial heterogeneity in recovery caused by wildfire.

TI  - Naphthol Blue Black and <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled Mannosylated Human Serum Albumin (<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-MSA) Conjugate as a Multimodal Lymph Node Mapping Nanocarrier
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tc-99m-labeled mannosylated human serum albumin (MSA) has been reported as a sentinel lymph node (SLN)-imaging agent by binding to macrophages in the LNs. By conjugating it with blue dye, we developed a new multimodal radio-nanocarrier by visual investigation, fluorescence imaging, and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT). Binding affinities of seven blue dyes to MSA were tested. According to the spectroscopic study and visual inspection of MSA-bound dyes, naphthol blue black (NBB) was selected as the best candidate of multimodal agent. Thus, Tc-99m-MSA-NBB conjugate was prepared and further investigated using mice. After footpad injection, it showed high popliteal LN accumulation at 1 h. SPECT/CT also showed high popliteal as well as inguinal LN uptakes at 10 min that sustained until 2 h. In conclusion, we prepared a multimodal SLN imaging radio-nanocarrier, Tc-99m-MSA-NBB conjugate, and confirmed its excellency as a multimodal probe for SLN mapping.

TI  - Population growth, land use and land cover transformations, and water quality nexus in the Upper Ganga River basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Ganga River basin is socioeconomically the most important river basin in India and is highly stressed in terms of water resources due to uncontrolled land use and land cover (LULC) activities. This study presents a comprehensive set of analyses to evaluate the population growth, LULC transformations, and water quality nexus for sustainable development in this river basin. The study was conducted at two spatial scales: basin scale and district scale. First, population data were analyzed statistically to study demographic changes, followed by LULC change detection over the period of February-March 2001 to 2012 (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data) using remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) techniques. Trends and spatiotemporal variations in monthly water quality parameters, viz. biological oxygen demand (BOD), dissolved oxygen (DO, measured in percentage), fluoride (F), hardness (CaCO3), pH, total coliform bacteria and turbidity, were studied using the Mann-Kendall rank test and an overall index of pollution (OIP) developed specifically for this region, respectively. A relationship was deciphered between LULC classes and OIP using multivariate techniques, viz. Pearson's correlation and multiple linear regression. From the results, it was observed that population has increased in the river basin. Therefore, significant and characteristic LULC changes were observed. The river became polluted in both rural and urban areas. In rural areas, pollution is due to agricultural practices, mainly fertilizers, whereas in urban areas it is mainly contributed from domestic and industrial wastes. Water quality degradation has occurred in the river basin, and consequently the health status of the river has also changed from acceptable to slightly polluted in urban areas. Multiple linear regression models developed for the Upper Ganga River basin could successfully predict status of the water quality, i.e., OIP, using LULC classes.

TI  - Influenza vaccine effectiveness in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in outpatient settings: A test-negative case-control study in Beijing, China, 2016/17 season
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) for the 2016/17 epidemic of co-circulating influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses in Beijing, the capital of China.Methods: The surveillance-based study included all swabbed patients through influenza virological surveillance, between November 2016 and April 2017. A test-negative case-control design was used to estimate influenza VE against medically-attended laboratory-confirmed influenza in outpatient settings. Cases were influenza-like illness (ILI) patients who tested positive for influenza, and controls were influenza negative patients.Results: A total of 10,496 ILI patients were enrolled and swabbed. Among them, 735 tested positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 1851 for A(H3N2), and 40 for type B. Of the 45 randomly selected specimens out of 1851 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 2(4.4%) belonged to the H3N2 3C.2a1 Glade, and 43(95.6%) belonged to A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like 3C.2a Glade. Among the 43 viruses of the 3C.2a clade, 32 viruses clustered in one subgroup carrying T131K, R142K and R261Q substitutions. The adjusted VE against all influenza was low at 25% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0-43%), with 54% (95%CI: 22-73%) for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 2% (95%CI: -35% to 29%) for influenza A(H3N2).Conclusions: Our study suggested a moderate VE against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, but low VE against influenza A(H3N2) in Beijing, 2016/17 season. Amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin may contribute to the low VE against influenza A(H3N2) for this season. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Reconstruction of sea level around the Korean Peninsula using cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the advent of the modern satellite altimeter era, the understanding of the sea level has increased dramatically. The satellite altimeter record, however, dates back only to the 1990s. The tide gauge record, on the other hand, extends through the 20th century but with poor spatial coverage when compared to the satellites. Many studies have been conducted to create a dataset with the spatial coverage of the satellite datasets and the temporal length of the tide gauge records by finding novel ways to combine the satellite data and tide gauge data in what is known as sea level reconstruction. However, most of the reconstructions of sea level were conducted on a global scale, leading to reduced accuracy on regional levels, especially when there are relatively few tide gauges. The seas around the Korean Peninsula are one such area with few tide gauges before 1960. In this study, new methods are proposed to reconstruct past sea level around the Korean Peninsula. Using spatial patterns obtained from a cyclostationary empirical orthogonal function decomposition of satellite data, we reconstruct sea level over the period from 1900 to 2014. Sea surface temperature data and altimeter data are used simultaneously in the reconstruction process, leading to an elimination of reliance on tide gauge data. Although we did not use the tide gauge data in the reconstruction process, the reconstructed sea level has a better agreement with the tide gauge observations in the region than previous studies that incorporated the tide gauge data. This study demonstrates a reconstruction technique that can potentially be used at regional levels, with particular emphasis on areas with poor tide gauge coverage.

TI  - Understanding sea ice melting via functional data analysis
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We have addressed the problem of sea ice extent (SIE) melting for Arctic and Southern Ocean. The 'satellite passive microwave remote sensing data' for daily SIE over a year has been considered as a smooth continuous function, called functional data. The analysis of the mean function of SIE over the different year-blocks and 95% bootstrap confidence bands for Arctic Ocean shows a statistically significant drop in SIE. Additional evidence of SIE melting in the Arctic Ocean is provided through phase plane analysis. During the summer, the SIE is observed about 30% less in the current year-block than that of the first year-block.

TI  - Melting over the northeast Antarctic Peninsula (1999-2009): evaluation of a high-resolution regional climate model
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface melting over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) may impact the stability of ice shelves and thus the rate at which grounded ice is discharged into the ocean. Energy and mass balance models are needed to understand how climatic change and atmospheric circulation variability drive current and future melting. In this study, we evaluate the regional climate model MAR over the AP at a 10 km spatial resolution between 1999 and 2009, a period when active microwave data from the QuikSCAT mission is available. This model has been validated extensively over Greenland, has is applied here to the AP at a high resolution and for a relatively long time period (full outputs are available to 2014). We find that melting in the northeastern AP, the focus area of this study, can be initiated both by sporadic westerly fohn flow over the AP mountains and by northerly winds advecting warm air from lower latitudes. A comparison of MAR with satellite and automatic weather station (AWS) data reveals that satellite estimates show greater melt frequency, a larger melt extent, and a quicker expansion to peak melt extent than MAR in the centre and east of the Larsen C ice shelf. These differences are reduced in the north and west of the ice shelf, where the comparison with satellite data suggests that MAR is accurately capturing melt produced by warm westerly winds. MAR shows an overall warm bias and a cool bias at temperatures above 0 degrees C as well as fewer warm, strong westerly winds than reported by AWS stations located on the eastern edge of the Larsen C ice shelf, suggesting that the underestimation of melt in this region may be the product of limited eastward flow. At higher resolutions (5 km), MAR shows a further increase in wind biases and a decrease in meltwater production. We conclude that non-hydrostatic models at spatial resolutions better than 5 km are needed to better-resolve the effects of fohn winds on the eastern edges of the Larsen C ice shelf.

TI  - On the use of global DEMs in ecological modelling and the accuracy of new bare-earth DEMs
T2  - ECOLOGICAL MODELLING

CP  - 20th Biennial Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Modelling (ISEM)

AB  - It is now widely acknowledged that the increasing availability of remotely sensed data facilitates ecological modelling. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are arguably one of the most common remote sensing products used in this context. Topographic indices (e.g. slope, orientation, rugosity) derived from DEMs are widely used as surrogates for field-measured environmental variables. Available global DEMs, such as those from the shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), however, do not provide information on bare-earth elevation as they measure elevation of the highest objects above the ground (e.g. canopy). This affects the derived topographic indices and limits the use of global DEMs in ecological modelling. Unfortunately, most ecological studies ignore this limitation despite the fact that methods to remove the vegetation offset have been developed. We used high resolution LiDAR DTM to assess the accuracy of two newly available global bare-earth DEM5 where such methods were applied and to compare them with the SRTM DEM. Furthermore, we assessed the effect of DEMs' vertical error on species distribution models (SDMs) by calculating slope and topographic wetness index (TWI) from these different models and evaluating their suitability for SDMs by adopting a virtual species approach. We simulated virtual species based on slope and TWI derived from accurate LiDAR DTM at three resolutions (30 m, 90 m and 900 m) and developed univariate generalized models to assess the performance of the bare-earth and SRTM DEM5. Our results show that the vertical error in both newly available, vegetation-corrected global DEM5 is indeed successfully reduced. The overall vertical root mean squared error (RMSE) was 10.52 m for SRTM, while it was 6.80 m and 6.25 m for the two global bare-earth DEMs. The effect of the vertical error on SDMs was most significant at finer spatial resolutions. Using SRTM DEM, as opposed to a more accurate bare-earth DEM, led to a decline in area under curve (AUC) values from 0.94 to 0.77. SDMs fitted with slope and TWI derived from new global bare-earth DTMs performed slightly better than SRTM. Since methods for vegetation-offset removal in DEMs exist and corrected DEMs are freely available, we argue that the vertical accuracy of DEMs should be more consistently considered. Local, high-accuracy DEM5 should be used where available; in remaining instances, however, global DEMs where vertical bias was minimized should be used in ecological modelling. Further improvement of global DEMs at 30 m and better resolutions are needed to enhance accuracy of derived indices and ecological models.

TI  - Significant Differences in Debris Captured by the Sentinel Dual-Filter Cerebral Embolic Protection During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Among Different Valve Types
T2  - JACC-CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to evaluate the debris captured by the Claret Sentinel cerebral embolic dual-filter protection device during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with different valve types.BACKGROUND Risk for embolization of debris during TAVR may vary by TAVR device.METHODS The filters of 100 consecutive patients were collected and captured debris was analyzed by histopathology and histomorphometry. Three valve types were implanted: the balloon-expandable Edwards SAPIEN 3 (n = 42), the self-expandable Medtronic Evolut R (n = 35), and the mechanically implantable Boston Scientific Lotus (n = 23).RESULTS Among the 3 groups there was no difference in baseline data, including Society of Thoracic Surgeons score for mortality, calcification, or pre-dilation. The type of captured debris did not differ among the 3 valve types in the proximal or distal filter. With the balloon-expandable valve, there were significantly more patients with large debris measuring >= 1,000 mm. The number of particles in the proximal filter was significantly lower with the Lotus (89.8 +/- 106.3) compared with the Evolut R (187.3 +/- 176.9) and Edwards SAPIEN 3 (172.3 +/- 133.5) valves (p = 0.035). Total tissue area in the proximal filter was significantly smaller for the Lotus compared with the other 2 valve types (7.1 +/- 6.3, 20.1 +/- 19.0, and 21.3 +/- 15.1 mm(2); p = 0.0014). In contrast, for the distal filter, there were no differences with respect to valve type for total tissue area, particle size, and number of particles.CONCLUSIONS A significant difference was observed in the size and number of captured tissue particles with the double-filter embolic protection device among different valve types in patients undergoing TAVR. The largest particles were observed in patients treated with a balloon-expandable valve. (c) 2018 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

CP  - 20th Biennial Conference of the International-Society-for-Ecological-Modelling (ISEM)
CL  - Towson, MD
AB  - Arctic ecosystems exhibit functional convergence in Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE's) of CO2 response to light, air temperature, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Leaf Area Index (LAI), potentially simplifying predictions of climate change impacts on the arctic C cycle over space and time. This convergence is hypothesized to be induced by tightly coupled carbon and nitrogen cycles, but has never been explicitly tested. We used model-data fusion on a mass balance model (i.e. the Coupled Carbon and Nitrogen; CCaN) to determine whether functional convergence in NEE results from tightly coupled carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. CCaN captured a majority, but not all, of NEE and NDVI observations across eight growing seasons, and MODIS NDVI observations across a tundra latitudinal gradient in Alaska. The hypothesis of temporal functional convergence was challenged by model-data disagreements for NEE during shoulder seasons and low light. The hypothesis of spatial functional convergence was challenged by the underestimation of NDVI in warm tundra. CCaN structure and parameter uncertainty analyses revealed that factors controlling leaf litter rate, the proportion of N in leaves, and net N mineralization rate are critical knowledge gaps in predicting pan-arctic NEE and NDVI in a future warmer climate.

TI  - Simulation and Sensibility Analysis of Earth Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Factor Based on Radiosity
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional fixed imaging sensors are mostly used to analyze the changes of spectrum resulting from changes in the biochemical parameters of the ground objects. However, the computer simulation model used to study the bidirectional reflectance characteristics can not complete the simulation of multiple types of ground objects because of the large amount of view factors that need to be calculated when constructing a scene. Therefore, there is less connection between them. To deal with these problems, based on the Radiosity Applicable to Porous Individual objects (RAPID), we simulate the reflectance of thc Yuhuayuan area in Changchun City and analyze the sensitivity of the reflectance to the environment factors. The results show that the field of view of the sensor has a strong influence on hot spot. The solar zenith angle and sky light ratio have a strong influence on all directions of the visible and near-infrared bands. Simulating the influence of environmental factors on the imaging spectrum is a good way to provide the basis for inversion of the ground objects of the biochemical parameters of fixed imaging sensor.

TI  - Effect of antiretroviral therapy on all-cause mortality among people living with HIV/AIDS in Ghana using Mahalanobis distant metric matching within propensity score caliper analysis: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several health interventions have been put in place to improve health outcomes of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) in Ghana. We evaluated the impact of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) on all-cause mortality in Ghana using matching procedures. This was a retrospective cohort study of 12,881 HIV/AIDS patients initiated on ART at 40 sentinel sites and 199 treatment centers between 2013 and 2016 countrywide. Patients were included if they had date of ART initiation and if they had mortality outcome recorded. Mahalanobis distant metric matching within propensity score caliper and other matching procedures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of ART in reducing the risk of all-cause mortality among PLHIV in Ghana. We performed sensitivity analysis using different matching procedures including Kernel weighting adjustment and Mahalanobis distance metric matching with nearest neighbour to ascertain the robustness of our results in the presence of unmeasured covariates. The proportion of patients on ART was 60.3% (95% CI: 59.5 +/- 61.1). The total number of mortalities reported was only 734 representing 4.6% (95% CI: 4.2 +/- 4.9) of the studied population. The risk of all-cause mortality has reduced by 11.6 percentage point among HIV/AIDS patients who were on ART compared to those who were not on ART (95% CI: 9.6 +/- 13.4). ART was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality. Effort being made by Government and non-Governmental organizations in support of ART treatment in Ghana should continue unabated to help reduce mortality rate and improve health outcomes among HIV/AIDS. To reduce bias to the barest minimum between treatment and intervention group when evaluating the effectiveness of health interventions, it is recommended to use matching procedures especially when the study design is not a randomized control trial.

TI  - Constraining chemical transport PM<sub>2.5</sub> modeling outputs using surface monitor measurements and satellite retrievals: application over the San Joaquin Valley
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in satellite retrieval of aerosol type can improve the accuracy of near-surface air quality characterization by providing broad regional context and decreasing metric uncertainties and errors. The frequent, spatially extensive and radiometrically consistent instantaneous constraints can be especially useful in areas away from ground monitors and progressively downwind of emission sources. We present a physical approach to constraining regional-scale estimates of PM2.5, its major chemical component species estimates, and related uncertainty estimates of chemical transport model (CTM; e.g., the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model) outputs. This approach uses ground-based monitors where available, combined with aerosol optical depth and qualitative constraints on aerosol size, shape, and light-absorption properties from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) on the NASA Earth Observing System's Terra satellite. The CTM complements these data by providing complete spatial and temporal coverage. Unlike widely used approaches that train statistical regression models, the technique developed here leverages CTM physical constraints such as the conservation of aerosol mass and meteorological consistency, independent of observations. The CTM also aids in identifying relationships between observed species concentrations and emission sources.Aerosol air mass types over populated regions of central California are characterized using satellite data acquired during the 2013 San Joaquin field deployment of the NASA Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) project. We investigate the optimal application of incorporating 275 m horizontal-resolution aerosol air-mass-type maps and total-column aerosol optical depth from the MISR Research Aerosol retrieval algorithm (RA) into regional-scale CTM output. The impact on surface PM2.5 fields progressively downwind of large single sources is evaluated using contemporaneous surface observations. Spatiotemporal R-2 and RMSE values for the model, constrained by both satellite and surface monitor measurements based on 10-fold cross-validation, are 0.79 and 0.33 for PM2.5, 0.88 and 0.65 for NO3-, 0.78 and 0.23 for SO42-, 1.00 and 1.01 for NH4+, 0.73 and 0.23 for OC, and 0.31 and 0.65 for EC, respectively. Regional cross-validation temporal and spatiotemporal R-2 results for the satellite-based PM2.5 improve by 30 % and 13 %, respectively, in comparison to unconstrained CTM simulations and provide finer spatial resolution. SO42- cross-validation values showed the largest spatial and spatiotemporal R-2 improvement, with a 43 % increase. Assessing this physical technique in a well-instrumented region opens the possibility of applying it globally, especially over areas where surface air quality measurements are scarce or entirely absent.

TI  - An on-demand femtoliter droplet dispensing system based on a gigahertz acoustic resonator
T2  - LAB ON A CHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - On-demand droplet dispensing systems are indispensable tools in bioanalytical fields, such as microarray fabrication. Biomaterial solutions can be very limited and expensive, so minimizing the use of solution per spot produced is highly desirable. Here, we proposed a novel droplet dispensing method which utilizes a gigahertz (GHz) acoustic resonator to deposit well-defined droplets on-demand. This ultra-high frequency acoustic resonator induces a highly localized and strong body force at the solid-liquid interface, which pushes the liquid to generate a stable and sharp liquid needle and further delivers droplets to the target substrate surface by transient contact. This approach is between contact and non-contact methods, thus avoiding some issues of traditional methods (such as nozzle clogging or satellite spots). We demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by fabricating high quality DNA and protein microarrays on glass and flexible substrates. Notably, the spot size can be delicately controlled down to a few microns (femtoliter in volume). Because of the CMOS compatibility, we expect this technique to be readily applied to advanced biofabrication processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although, occupational asthma (OA) causes great work disability, due to its diagnostic complexity, it is difficult to have it recognized by the official registration systems. To improve its detection, suspected systems have been developed. After years of experience in Navarre, we set out to characterize the suspected cases and compare them with those declared as an occupational disease (OD).METHODS: We identified the cases of OA reported as sentinel events in the Epidemiological Surveillance Program in Occupational Health in Navarra from January 2010 to December 2015 and the cases declared as OD (asthma). The population under study was the Navarra employed population (357,200 on average). In the cases with consent, the clinical and labor characteristics were compared with those of OD. Using the SPSS Statistics 20v computer program, mean differences were calculated by the T test for independent samples and distribution percentage differences by Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test and nonparametric tests when application conditions were not satisfied. As an indicator of notification, the accumulated incidence per 100,000 workers was calculated for each year of program monitoring.RESULTS: In the period, 79 sentinel events were reported (in 22 the investigation was concluded) and 50 cases of OD (24% relapses). We did not find statistically significant differences in age (41 vs. 40 years), nor gender (40.9% women vs. 44.7%), nor proportion that caused sick leave (45% and 36.8%), nor size, activity of the company or occupation of the worker. Where differences are found was in the meantime of exposure before the recognition/notification, significantly higher in the OD than in the sentinel (94.1 vs. 22.2 months), 72 months longer.CONCLUSIONS: The cases detected by both systems are similar but, due to the diagnostic complexity, the recognition is delayed as OD, which demonstrates the usefulness of a more agile system for reporting suspicions of this work pathology.
AB  - OBJETIVO: El asma ocupacional (AO), aunque causa gran discapacidad laboral, debido a su complejidad diagnostica es de dificil reconocimiento por los sistemas oficiales de registro. Para mejorar su deteccion se han desarrollado sistemas de sospecha. Tras anos de experiencia en Navarra, nos planteamos caracterizar los casos de sospecha y compararlos con los declarados como enfermedad profesional (EEPP).METODOS: Se identificaron los casos de AO notificados como sucesos centinela en el Programa de Vigilancia Epidemiologica en Salud Laboral en Navarra desde enero de 2010 a diciembre de 2015 y los casos declarados como EEPP (asma). La poblacion a estudio fue la poblacion navarra ocupada (357.200 de media). En los casos con consentimiento se compararon las caracteristicas clinicas y laborales con las de EEPP. Mediante el programa informatico SPSS Statistics 20v se calcularon diferencias de medias mediante prueba T para muestras independientes y diferencias de porcentajes de distribucion mediante Test de Chi cuadrado, test exacto de Fisher y test no parametricos cuando no se cumplian condiciones de aplicacion. Como indicador de notificacion se calculo la incidencia acumulada por 100.000 trabajadores para cada ano de seguimiento del programa.RESULTADOS: En el periodo de estudio se notificaron 79 sucesos centinela (en 22 se concluyo la investigacion) y 50 casos de EEPP ( 24% recaidas). No encontramos diferencias estadisticamente significativas en la edad (41 vs 40 anos), ni el sexo (40,9 % mujeres vs 44,7% hombres), ni la proporcion que causo baja laboral (45% y 36,8%), ni el tamano, la actividad de la empresa o la ocupacion del trabajador. Donde si se encontramos diferencias fue en el tiempo medio de exposicion antes de la declaracion/notificacion, significativamente mayor en las EEPP que en los centinela (94,1 vs 22,2 meses), 72 meses mayor.CONCLUSIONES: Los casos detectados por ambos sistemas son similares pero, debido a la complejidad diagnostica, se retrasa la declaracion como EEPP, lo que evidencia la utilidad de un sistema mas agil de notificacion de sospechas para esta patologia laboral.

TI  - Graphics algorithm for deriving atmospheric boundary layer heights from CALIPSO data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric boundary layer is an important atmospheric feature that affects environmental health and weather forecasting. In this study, we proposed a graphics algorithm for the derivation of atmospheric boundary layer height (BLH) from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data. Owing to the differences in scattering intensity between molecular and aerosol particles, the total attenuated backscatter coefficient 532 and attenuated backscatter coefficient 1064 were used simultaneously for BLH detection. The proposed algorithm transformed the gradient solution into graphics distribution solution to overcome the effects of large noise and improve the horizontal resolution. This method was then tested with real signals under different horizontal smoothing numbers (1, 3, 15 and 30). Finally, the results of BLH obtained by CALIPSO data were compared with the results retrieved by the ground-based lidar measurements. Under the horizontal smoothing number of 15, 12 and 9, the correlation coefficients between the BLH derived by the proposed algorithm and ground-based lidar were both 0.72. Under the horizontal smoothing number of 6, 3 and 1, the correlation coefficients between the BLH derived by graphics distribution method (GDM) algorithm and ground-based lidar were 0.47, 0.14 and 0.12, respectively. When the horizontal smoothing number was large (15, 12 and 9), the CALIPSO BLH derived by the proposed method demonstrated a good correlation with ground-based lidar. The algorithm provided a reliable result when the horizontal smoothing number was greater than 9. This finding indicated that the proposed algorithm can be applied to the CALIPSO satellite data with 3 and 5 km horizontal resolution.

TI  - Stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing simulated by the chemistry climate model EMAC using Aerosol CCI satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents decadal simulations of stratospheric and tropospheric aerosol and its radiative effects by the chemistry general circulation model EMAC constrained with satellite observations in the framework of the ESA Aerosol CCI project such as GOMOS (Global Ozone Monitoring by Occultation of Stars) and (A)ATSR ((Advanced) Along Track Scanning Radiometer) on the ENVISAT (European Environmental Satellite), IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) on MetOp (Meteorological Operational Satellite), and, additionally, OSIRIS (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System). In contrast to most other studies, the extinctions and optical depths from the model are compared to the observations at the original wavelengths of the satellite instruments covering the range from the UV (ultraviolet) to terrestrial IR (infrared). This avoids conversion artifacts and provides additional constraints for model aerosol and interpretation of the observations.MIPAS (Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding) SO2 limb measurements are used to identify plumes of more than 200 volcanic eruptions. These three-dimensional SO2 plumes are added to the model SO2 at the eruption times. The interannual variability in aerosol extinction in the lower stratosphere, and of stratospheric aerosol radiative forcing at the tropopause, is dominated by the volcanoes. To explain the seasonal cycle of the GOMOS and OSIRIS observations, desert dust simulated by a new approach and transported to the lowermost stratosphere by the Asian summer monsoon and tropical convection turns out to be essential. This also applies to the radiative heating by aerosol in the lowermost stratosphere. The existence of wet dust aerosol in the lowermost stratosphere is indicated by the patterns of the wavelength dependence of extinction in observations and simulations. Additional comparison with (A)ATSR total aerosol optical depth at different wavelengths and IASI dust optical depth demonstrates that the model is able to represent stratospheric as well as tropospheric aerosol consistently.

TI  - Concentration, temporal variation, and sources of black carbon in the Mt. Everest region retrieved by real-time observation and simulation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the high-resolution measurement of black carbon (BC) at the Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Station (QOMS, 28.36 degrees N, 86.95 degrees E, 4276 m a.s.l.) from 15 May 2015 to 31 May 2017, we investigated the seasonal and diurnal variations in BC and its potential source regions. Both monthly and daily mean BC concentrations reached the highest values in the pre-monsoon season and the lowest values in the monsoon season. The highest monthly and daily mean BC concentrations were at least 1 order of magnitude higher than the lowest concentrations. For the diurnal variation, the BC concentrations remained significantly high from late at night to morning in the pre-monsoon season. Meanwhile, the westerly winds prevailed during this period, implying the potential for pollutants to be transported across the Himalayas from long-distance sources to QOMS along the valley. In the monsoon season, the BC concentrations remained low but peaked in the morning and at noon, which might be caused by local emissions from cooking. By analyzing the simulation results from the backward trajectories of air masses and the fire spot distribution from the MODIS data, we found that the seasonal cycle of BC was significantly influenced by the atmospheric circulation and combustion intensity in the Mt. Everest region. The transport mechanisms of BC were further revealed using a WRF-Chem simulation during severe pollution episodes. For the pollution event in the monsoon season, BC aerosols in southern Asia were uplifted and transported to the Mt. Everest region by the southerly winds in the upper atmosphere. However, for the events in the pre-monsoon season, BC from northern India was transported and concentrated on the southern slope of the Himalayas by the northwesterly winds in the lower atmosphere and then transported across the Himalayas by the mountain-valley wind. A relatively smaller amount of BC from northwestern India and central Asia was transported to the Mt. Everest region by the westerly winds in the upper atmosphere.

TI  - Trends and determinants of antimicrobial susceptibility of <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> in the Netherlands, 2007 to 2015
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Neisseria gonorrhoeae antibiotic resistance surveillance is important to maintain adequate treatment. We analysed 2007-15 data from the Gonococcal Resistance to Antimicrobials Surveillance (GRAS), which currently includes 19 of 25 sexually transmitted infection (STI) centres in the Netherlands. Methods: From each patient with a gonorrhoea culture, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for several antibiotics was determined. Time trends were assessed by geometric means and linear regression of logarithmic MIC. Determinants for decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC>0.032mg/L) and resistance to cefotaxime (MIC > 0.125 mg/L) and azithromycin (MIC>0.5mg/L) were assessed using stratified logistic regression. Results: 11,768 isolates were analysed. No ceftriaxone resistance was found. In 2015, 27 of 1,425 isolates (1.9%) were resistant to cefotaxime and 176 of 1,623 (10.9%) to azithromycin. Ceftriaxone susceptibility showed no trend (p =0.96) during the study period, but cefotaxime MIC decreased (p< 0.0001) and azithromycin MIC increased (p< 0.0001) significantly. Concerning ceftriaxone, isolates of men who have sex with men (MSM) from 2013 (p=0.0005) and 2014 (p=0.0004) were significantly associated with decreased susceptibility. Significant determinants for cefotaxime resistance were having >= 6 partners for women (p = 0.0006). For azithromycin,isolates from MSM collected in 2012 (p=0.0035), 2013 (p=0.012), and 2014 (p=0.013), or from non-Dutch (p<0.0001) or older >= 35 years; p= 0.01) MSM were significantly associated with susceptibility. Resistance in heterosexual men was significantly associated with being >= 25 years-old (p=0.0049) or having 3-5 partners (p=0.01). Conclusions: No ceftriaxone resistance was found, but azithromycin MIC increased in 2007-15. Resistance determinants could help with focused intervention strategies.

TI  - Challenges to belief systems in the context of climate change adaptation
T2  - JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on the social aspects of climate change and explores the interrelationship between belief systems and adaptation. The links and interaction between external and internal realities are examined from the perspective of contextual vulnerability, with a focus on the multifaceted structure of belief systems. The aim was to determine those challenges regarding climate change adaptation that are caused by a community's belief system and to make recommendations to overcome them. Diverse perceptions of climate change and beliefs from three townships in the North-West Province of South Africa were collected and analysed using Q-methodology, finding five distinct worldview narratives. These narratives were named naturalist collectivist, religious, religious determinist, activist collectivist and structural thinker. It is recommended that policymakers aim to address diverse views and should be informed by factors that increase resistance to belief revision. Information should be framed in ways that foster the perception of internal control, are clearly evidence based and encourage a desire to learn more.

TI  - Selecting appropriate variables for detecting grassland to cropland changes using high resolution satellite data
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland is one of the most represented, while at the same time, ecologically endangered, land cover categories in the European Union. In view of the global climate change, detecting its change is growing in importance from both an environmental and a socio-economic point of view. A well-recognised tool for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) Change Detection (CD), including grassland changes, is Remote Sensing (RS). An important aspect affecting the accuracy of change detection is finding the optimal indicators of LULC changes (i.e., variables). Inappropriately selected variables can produce inaccurate results burdened with a number of uncertainties. The aim of our study is to find the most suitable variables for the detection of grassland to cropland change, based on a pair of high resolution images acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite and from the vector database Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS). In total, 59 variables were used to create models using Generalised Linear Models (GLM), the quality of which was verified through multi-temporal object-based change detection. Satisfactory accuracy for the detection of grassland to cropland change was achieved using all of the statistically identified models. However, a three-variable model can be recommended for practical use, namely by combining the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Wetness and Fifth components of Tasselled Cap. Increasing number of variables did not significantly improve the accuracy of detection, but rather complicated the interpretation of the results and was less accurate than detection based on the original Landsat 8 images. The results obtained using these three variables are applicable in landscape management, agriculture, subsidy policy, or in updating existing LULC databases. Further research implementing these variables in combination with spatial data obtained by other RS techniques is needed.

TI  - Collectin-11 (CL-11) Is a Major Sentinel at Epithelial Surfaces and Key Pattern Recognition Molecule in Complement-Mediated Ischaemic Injury
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complement system is a dynamic subset of the innate immune system, playing roles in host defense, clearance of immune complexes and cell debris, and priming the adaptive immune response. Over the last 40 years our understanding of the complement system has evolved from identifying its presence and recognizing its role in the blood to now focusing on understanding the role of local complement synthesis in health and disease. In particular, the local synthesis of complement was found to have an involvement in mediating ischaemic injury, including following transplantation. Recent work on elucidating the triggers of local complement synthesis and activation in renal tissue have led to the finding that Collectin-11 (CL-11) engages with L-fucose at the site of ischaemic stress, namely at the surface of the proximal tubular epithelial cells. What remains unknown is the precise structure of the damage-associated ligand that participates in CL-11 binding and subsequent complement activation. In this article, we will discuss our hypothesis regarding the role of CL-11 as an integral tissue-based pattern recognition molecule which we postulate has a significant contributory role in complement-mediated ischaemic injury.

TI  - Shrub encroachment into grasslands: end of an era?
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in the abundance of grasses and woody plants in drylands have occurred several times during the Holocene. However, our understanding of the rates and dynamics of this state-change in recent decades is limited to scattered studies conducted at disparate spatial and temporal scales; the potential misperceptions of shrub cover change could be remedied using cross spatiotemporal scale analyses that link field observations, repeat ground-level photography and remote sensing perspectives. The study was conducted across a semi-arid landscape in southern Arizona. Local data from long-term transects revealed three distinct chronological phases of shrub cover change: expansion (1961-1991, 0.7% y(-1)), decline (1992-1997, -2.3% y(-1)) and stabilization (1998-2012, 22-25% with no net cover change). Twenty-eight years (1984-2011) of broad-scale Landsat Thematic Mapper assessments confirm that shrub cover has been relatively stable in recent decades regardless of grazing regimes and landforms with the exception of the proliferation of succulents at lower elevations (verified by repeat photography acquired in 1987 and 2015) where the physical environment is the harshest, reflecting elevated temperature and winter precipitation deficit. Warmer, drier future climates are predicted to reduce woody plant carrying capacity and promote a shift to xerophytic succulents.

TI  - Varicella in the prison setting: A report of three outbreaks in Rhode Island and a review of the literature
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The prison setting carries unique risks for varicella outbreaks and the disease in adults, particularly those who are immunocompromised, can be life-threatening. In 2016-17, there were three outbreaks of varicella at three different correctional facilities in Rhode Island. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend post-exposure vaccination within three to five days for affected populations however the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) notes the logistical challenges of vaccinating exposed incarcerated individuals.Material and methods: A descriptive analysis was performed for each outbreak along with an overview of the response. Varicella serologies were obtained from the exposed population at each facility and the results compiled for comparative analysis. A literature review was then performed to identify and analyze other reported varicella outbreaks in incarcerated populations.Results: In each outbreak, the sentinel event was an inmate with herpes zoster. In prison A, there were 432 inmates exposed to the virus leading to 5 cases of varicella, while the outbreak in Prison B exposed 46 inmates and led to 3 cases. In Prison C, there was one case of primary varicella and 97 inmates were exposed.Discussion: It is remarkable that there were 3 unrelated outbreaks in a short time and, although corroborating data would be necessary to establish a trend, it may signal an increased risk of varicella transmission within this population. Correctional facilities should remain vigilant and have plans for managing the disease including isolation protocols, serology testing and post-exposure vaccination when indicated. While the BOP does not provide clear recommendations on the use of post-exposure prophylaxis during an outbreak response in this population, the experience in Rhode Island and the review of the literate demonstrate steps that can be taken to facilitate a response including post-exposure vaccination in line with CDC recommendations.

TI  - Assessment of quasi-analytical algorithm for estimating the inherent optical properties in a complex cascade system
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Several quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) versions were developed to make it suitable for different inland water systems. QAA(BBHR) and QAA(OMW) were reparameterized based on two reservoirs from the Tiete River cascading system (Sao Paulo State, Brazil), which present widely differing compositions. Considering the purpose of monitoring the entire cascade through a unique QAA version, we aimed to assess the suitability of these two QAA versions and, in addition, another two QAA native forms (versions 5 and 6), for retrieving inherent optical properties (IOPs) in Ibitinga hydroelectric reservoir (IHR), situated in the same cascading system. In addition to that, we addressed bio-optical characterization of IHR, using spectral and water quality data collected in a field campaign conducted in July 2016. Wide spatial variability of optically significant constituent (OSC) in IHR and colored dissolved organic matter predominance in its absorption budget was observed. None of the tested QAA versions were completely suitable in retrieving absorption coefficients for IHR in all wavelengths. However, results for wavelengths commonly used as proxy for OSC concentration retrieval were satisfactory in some of the models. Therefore, the results obtained in this study shows that QAAs versions can be used for specific purposes (e.g., chlorophyll-a mapping), by employing the best model for IOPs retrieval at a specific wavelength. This highlights the challenge of copying with high optical variability in cascading systems. In this sense, further research is necessary, for either achieving a QAA reparameterized version appropriate for aquatic systems with widely differing optical properties or another analytical scheme.

TI  - Improving the image fusion procedure for high-spatiotemporal aerosol optical depth retrieval: a case study of urban area in Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies employed remote sensing techniques on regional air quality in terms of aerosols, in particular, the observations from polar-orbiting satellites offer more detail on spatial distribution. Since the air pollutants/aerosols dramatically vary in location with time, diurnal observations on a timescale are restricted by the temporal resolution of the polar-orbiting satellite. To address this issue, this research proposes a spatially and temporally adaptive reflectance fusion model for measuring atmospheric properties to synthesize high-spatial-temporal resolution images from polar and geostationary satellite imagery for air quality monitoring. The reflectivity from short-wave infrared is employed to preserve the atmospheric effect within the fused image in the green band for further aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval. Taking the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager as the reference, the spatial resolution of the Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (in kilometers) can thus be resampled into 30 m every 10 min during the daytime, by considering the surface bidirectional reflectivity from the variation of the solar zenith angle. The AOD retrieved with fused images containing atmospheric effect could have a better performance after comparison with in situ measurements, and therefore, be suggested for high-spatial-temporal aerosol monitoring.

TI  - Anaphylactic shock due to patent blue: case report and review of literature
T2  - PAN AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Intraoperative search for the sentinal node using patent blue is considered a non risk procedure. We emphasize the highly exceptional nature of this adverse effect previously observed in other disciplines using this coloring agent. We present a case of allergic reaction to patent blue in a patient who underwent left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node. About 25 min after the dye injection, the patient developed increased heart frequency and allergic skin reaction. The patient was treated successfully with decreased inspired fraction of inhaled anesthetic and fluid replacement. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged from the PACU 3h after the end of surgery without skin changes and was discharged from hospital on the morning after surgery. Allergic reactions with the use of patent blue are far superior to the hypersensitivity reactions seen with anesthetic and adjuvant drugs. Therefore, the anesthesiologist must be aware of cardiovascular instability associated with skin changes during the use of patent blue, for early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of this hypersensitivity reaction to this dye. Skin tests done later confirmed allergy to patent blue dye; the tests induced a small syndrome reaction. Surgical personnel who use patent blue dye should be made aware of the risk of allergic reactions, sometimes severe, to this dye.

TI  - Exploring the first aerosol indirect effect over Southeast Asia using a 10-year collocated MODIS, CALIOP, and model dataset
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations and model simulations cannot, by themselves, give full insight into the complex relationships between aerosols and clouds. This is especially true over Southeast Asia, an area that is particularly sensitive to changes in precipitation yet poses some of the world's largest observability and predictability challenges. We present a new collocated dataset, the Curtain Cloud-Aerosol Regional ATrain dataset, or CCARA. CCARA includes collocated satellite observations from Aqua's Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) with the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS). The CCARA dataset is designed with the capability to investigate aerosol-cloud relationships in regions with limited aerosol retrievals due to high cloud amounts by leveraging the NAAPS model reanalysis of aerosol concentration in these regions. This combined aerosol and cloud dataset provides coincident and vertically resolved cloud and aerosol observations for 2006-2016. Using the model reanalysis aerosol fields from the NAAPS and coincident cloud liquid effective radius retrievals from MODIS (cirrus contamination using CALIOP), we investigate the first aerosol indirect effect in Southeast Asia. We find that, as expected, aerosol loading anti-correlates with cloud effective radius, with maximum sensitivity in cumulous mediocris clouds with heights in the 3-4.5 km level. The highest susceptibilities in droplet effective radius to modeled perturbations in particle concentrations were found in the more remote and pristine regions of the western Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. Conversely, there was much less variability in cloud droplet size near emission sources over both land and water. We hypothesize this is suggestive of a high aerosol background already saturated with cloud condensation nuclei even during the relatively clean periods, in contrast to the remote ocean regions, which have periods where the aerosol concentrations are low enough to allow for larger droplet growth.

TI  - On the minimization of adjacency effects in SeaWiFS primary data products from coastal areas
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The minimization of adjacency effects (AE) in SeaWiFS primary products at the Aqua Alta Oceanographic Tower (AAOT) was investigated using sample images concurrent with in situ measurements. The validation exercise was performed with the NASA SeaDAS processing scheme ingesting original SeaWiFS data and alternatively SeaWiFS top-of-atmosphere data corrected for AE, and additionally including and excluding the default turbid water (TW) correction algorithm. Results show overestimates of the TW contributions partially compensating for AE. The analysis also suggests that intra-annual biases observed in SeaWiFS radiometric products at the AAOT may result from a misinterpretation of the NIR atmospheric signal as water contribution in data acquired in winter, and from uncompensated AE in data acquired in summer.

TI  - Short-Term Forecasting and Detection of Explosions During the 2016-2017 Eruption of Bogoslof Volcano, Alaska
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We describe a multidisciplinary approach to forecast, rapidly detect, and characterize explosive events during the 2016-2017 eruption of Bogoslof volcano, a back-arc shallow submarine volcano in Alaska's Aleutian arc. The eruptive sequence began in December 2016 and included about 70 discrete explosive events. Because the volcano has no local monitoring stations, we used distant stations on the nearest volcan oes, Okmok (54 km) and Makushin (72 km), combined with regional infrasound sensors and lightning detection from the Worldwide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN). Preeruptive seismicity was detected for 12 events during the first half of the eruption; for all other events co-eruptive signals allowed for detection only. Monitoring of activity used a combination of scheduled checks combined with automated alarms. Alarms triggered on real-time data included real-time seismic amplitude measurement (RSAM); infrasound from several arrays, the closest being on Okmok; and lightning strokes detected from WWLLN within a 20-km radius of the volcano. During periods of unrest, a multidisciplinary response team of four people fulfilled specific roles to evaluate geophysical and remote-sensing data, run event-specific ash-cloud dispersion models, ensure interagency coordination, and develop and distribute of formalized warning products. Using this approach, for events that produced ash clouds >= 7.5 km above sea level, Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) called emergency response partners 15 min, and issued written notices 30 min, after event onset (mean times). Factors that affect timeliness of written warnings include event size and number of data streams available; bigger events and more data both decrease uncertainty and allow for faster warnings. In remote areas where airborne ash is the primary hazard, the approach used at Bogoslof is an effective strategy for hazard mitigation.

TI  - Effective surveillance systems for vector-borne diseases in urban settings and translation of the data into action: a scoping review
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundVector-borne diseases (VBDs) continue to represent a global threat, with "old" diseases like malaria, and "emergent" or "re-emergent" ones like Zika, because of an increase in international trade, demographic growth, and rapid urbanization. In this era of globalization, surveillance is a key element in controlling VBDs in urban settings, but surveillance alone cannot solve the problem. A review of experiences is of interest to examine other solution elements. The objectives were to assess the different means of VBD surveillance in urban environments, to evaluate their potential for supporting public health actions, and to describe the tools used for public health actions, the constraints they face, and the research and health action gaps to be filled.Main bodyFor this scoping review we searched peer-reviewed articles and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Various tools were used for data coding and extraction. A quality assessment was done for each study reviewed, and descriptive characteristics and data on implementation process and transferability were analyzed in all studies.After screening 414 full-text articles, we retained a total of 79 articles for review. The main targets of the articles were arboviral diseases (65.8%) and malaria (16.5%). The positive aspects of many studies fit within the framework of integrated vector management. Public awareness is considered a key to successful vector control programs. Advocacy and legislation can reinforce both empowerment and capacity building. These can be achieved by collaboration within the health sector and with other sectors. Research is needed to develop well designed studies and new tools for surveillance and control.ConclusionsThe need for surveillance systems in urban settings in both developing and developed countries was highlighted. Countries face the same challenges relating to human, financial, and structural resources. These findings also constitute a wake-up call for governments, academia, funders, and World Health Organization to strengthen control programs and enhance VBD research in urban environments.

TI  - Epidemiology of influenza in Ethiopia: findings from influenza sentinel surveillance and respiratory infection outbreak investigations, 2009-2015
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Influenza is an acute viral disease of the respiratory tract which is characterized by fever, headache, myalgia, prostration, coryza, sore throat and cough. Globally, an estimated 3 to 5 million cases of severe influenza illness and 291 243-645 832 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually. Although recent efforts from some African countries to describe burden of influenza disease and seasonality, these data are missing for the vast majority, including Ethiopia. Ethiopia established influenza sentinel surveillance in 2008 aiming to determine influenza strains circulating in the country and know characteristics, trend and burden of influenza viruses.Methods: We used influenza data from sentinel surveillance sites and respiratory disease outbreak investigations from 2009 to 2015 for this analysis. We obtained the data by monitoring patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) at three health-centers, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) at five hospitals and investigating patients during different respiratory infection outbreaks. Throat-swab specimens in viral transport media were transported to the national reference laboratory within 72 h of collection using a cold-chain system. We extracted viral RNA from throat-swabs and subjected to real-time PCR amplification. We further subtyped and characterized Influenza Apositive specimens using CDC real-time reverse transcription PCR protocol.Results: A total of 4962 throat-swab samples were collected and 4799 (96.7%) of them were tested. Among them 988 (20.6%) were influenza-positive and of which 349 (35.3%) were seasonal influenza A(H3N2), 321 (32.5%) influenza A(H1N1) pdm2009 and 318 (32.0%) influenza B. Positivity rate was 29.5% in persons 5-14 years followed by 26.4% in 15-44 years, 21.2% in > 44 years and 6.4% in under five children. The highest positivity rate observed in November (37.5%) followed by March (27.6%), December (26.4%), October (24.4%) and January (24.3%) while the lowest positivity rate was in August (7.7%).Conclusion: In Ethiopia, seasonal Influenza A(H3N2), Influenza A(H1N1) pdm2009 and Influenza B viruses were circulating during 2009-2015. Positivity rate and number of cases peaked in November and December. Influenza is one of public health problems in Ethiopia and the need to introduce influenza vaccine and antivirus is important to prevent and treat the disease in future.

TI  - La Cueva de las Mulas: re-creations of Tepehuan worldview during the colonial period
T2  - AUSTRALIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, I have analysed a rock art site named La Cueva de las Mulas in Mexico. In an earlier work, I proposed some arguments attributing the work to the Tepehuanes, an indigenous group of the north of Mexico, and placed the execution in the seventeenth century. In this study, I focus on the discourse and symbolism expressed in the sets of paintings with the most images, Groups 2 and 3. I analyse the iconography, the symbolisms and the structure of each panel. I summarise some aspects of what is known about Tepehuan culture, its pre-Hispanic past and the historical processes since the conquest from the perspectives of historical and anthropological disciplines. I explore the hypothesis that the cultural clash with the Spanish sparked the emergence of this type of rock art amongst the Tepehuan as a strategy of cultural resistance. I argue that this rock art was an attempt by the Tepehuan to reformulate their oral tradition. Their aim was the construction of a new universal order, a new history, a new explanation of the world, from the distant past until the moment they expressed their ideas on the walls of the cave.

T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Optimum management of clinically negative neck (cN0) remains controversial in early stage (T1-T2) squamous cell cancer of the oral tongue (OTSCC).The purpose of this study was to investigate the value of pre-treatment Neutrophil-to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in predicting occult cervical metastasis in stage I and II OTSCC.Methods: We carried out a retrospective chart review on 110 patients suffering from early stage OTSCC who were surgically treated with tumour excision and elective neck dissection (END). Our cohort was divided in pN + and pN0 groups basing on histopathological examination after elective neck dissection. For each patient pretreatment NLR was calculated.Results: A statistically significant relationship between high levels of pre-treatment NLR and probability rate for neck occult metastases (0.000496 p-value) has been found. On our model the cut-off value was set for NLR > 2.93. Above this level the probability to finding metastasis in a clinically negative neck increases exponentially.Conclusion: These preliminary results offer clinicians an easily obtainable tool to stratify patients based on risks of metastatic node in whom END could be indicated.

AB  - Lymph node in breast cancer is of clinical significance in determining the disease stage, appropriate therapy and predicting the outcome of patients. Lymphoscintigraphy is essential for preoperative Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) identification in breast cancer; it provides the surgeon with a roadmap of lymphatic drainage and the location of SLN. SLN are normally easily detected by lymphoscintigraphy most of the time.We report a case of right breast cancer for sentinel node mapping at mastectomy. Planar lymphoscintigraphy images showed tracer dispersion around the injection site with non-visualization of SLN while SPECT/CT delineated the SLN and identified the initial breast tracer dispersion to be localized dermal activity, indicating dermal lymphatic backflow.

AB  - Understanding the statistical relations among the Advanced Space borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiation (ASTER) data and observed water quality parameters, in order to develop a mathematical relation for the precise prediction of the missing data in a given area, is the main aim of the present study. This should enable to establish a spatial distribution map for each parameter of water quality for the area. The method was applied to Qaroun Lake in the Fayoum depression of Egypt.The water quality parameters obtained from ASTER data used in the present work are: Temperature, Turbidity, Hydrogen ion concentration (pH), Salinity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Electrical Conductivity (EC), Total alkalinity, Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and Ortho-phosphorus.18 water sample data were used in the study: 15 sample data for mathematical model construction, giving the relation between the ASTER values and the water quality parameters, while 3 samples data were used to test the obtained model.The SPSS software of IBM was also used in the present research for the applied statistical analysis.The analysis showed a significant correlation between the observed values and the remotely sensed data with R-2 > 0.94 and sig. < 0.01 in most cases. The calculated values resulting through the obtained equation showed a high accuracy: Root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.8 to 0.014 and Standard Estimated Error (SEE) ranging from 0.9 to 0.0116.ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS packages were used for applying the obtained mathematical model and spatial distribution map to the Qaroun Lake.

TI  - REE geochemical characteristics and satellite-based mapping of hydrothermal alteration in Atud gold deposit, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - New geochemical data of the hydrothermal alteration zones associated with gold-bearing quartz veins at Atud mine are used for better understanding the ore evolution and exploration vectoring. ASTER and Landsat 8 OLI data are used to elucidate the distribution of gold-associated alteration zones. Three alteration zones are defined; zone 1 (sericite-kaolinite-quartz-pyrite), zone 2 (quartz-sericite-albitepyrite), and zone 3 (chlorite-carbonate-epidote pyrite). Sericite and hydrothermal quartz are confined to the mineralized quartz veins. Fe-OH and OH-bearing minerals are observed along NW- and NE trending shear zones in the Main Atud mine. The association of gold-bearing quartz veins and sericite alteration is constrained by processing ASTER- and OLI-imagery data. The geochemical data of the ore enveloping hydrothermally altered rocks are used to assess the behavior of the REEs during the mineralization process. Mild enrichment in LREE and significant enrichment in the HREE are associated with sericite in zones (1) and (2) alterations. Carbonate alteration (zone 3) is enriched in LREE and in immobile HREE. Moreover, LREE and Eu anomalies have negative correlated with the Alteration Index (A.I.) and K2O index (K.I.) in zones 1 and 2, suggesting high mobility of LREE in K-rich hydrothermal fluids. On the other hand, HREE anomalies with increasing MgO index (M.I.) in alteration zone 3 may imply low solubility of these elements in alkaline solutions. Au anomalies linked to sericite/silica alteration is a rather meaningful vector for further exploration in the area. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study describes a conceptual tool, labeled the culture cube, developed to identify and articulate the cultural underpinnings of prevention and early intervention projects in five priority populations (i.e., African American, Asian Pacific Islander, Latino, Native American, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Questioning), participating in the California Reducing Disparities Project Phase 2 (CRDP Phase 2). The culture cube was developed for evaluation of these practice-based evidence services (PBEs) for three purposes: (a) to focus attention on revealing and articulating more fully the operative worldview and culturally grounded frameworks underlying PBEs, explicitly identifying the links between cultural beliefs and values, community needs, and intervention design; (b) to guide the methods used to assess and evaluate PBEs so that the outcome indicators and process measures are conceptually consistent, community defined, and culturally centered; and (c) to invite communities to use their own indigenous epistemological frameworks to establish credible evidence. After reviewing the literature in this area and describing the theoretical framework for the culture cube, we describe its development, application, and the response to its use in the initial stages of the California Reducing Disparities Project-Phase 2.HighlightsIdentifies the operative worldview and culturally grounded theoretical framework in practice based evidence services (PBEs). Strengthens links among cultural beliefs and values, community needs, and intervention design. Guides evaluation methods to be conceptually consistent, community defined, and culturally centered.

The focus of this paper is to explore the applicability of mapping GT related anomalies by identifying mineralogy and lithological features at regional scale using image enhancement techniques on Landsat 8 satellite data. A combination of established Band ratios from literature were implemented on Landsat 8 optical bands using innovative digital image processing and knowledge-based spectral information extraction techniques which enhanced surface mineralogy and possible alteration areas of interest. The results indicate that ratios using bands; 7/4, 6/3, 5/7 and 6/7, 4/3, 5/6 and 7/5, 5/4, 6/7 respectively as RGB, were unique but corroborative in enhancing and identifying; clay rich rocks, iron oxides, micas, carbonates and possible hydrothermal alteration zones related to GT anomaly. The results could have implication for GT exploration in especially unexplored regions where expensive airborne surveys are unaffordable. Copyright (C) 2018 Abubakar et al.

TI  - Detection of Railroad Networks in SAR Images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a railroad networks detection method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is proposed. Proposed method consists of three steps. Firstly, railroad segments are detected. An existing line detector is modified by describing some rules for this process. Then segments are connected by utilizing perceptual grouping. Finally, a new line analysis algorithm is applied to determine real parts of railroad networks. A software is developed to achieve and evaluate proposed method. Completeness and correctness values which are obtained after different steps are computed to evaluate proposed method. Two different TerraSAR-X images are used in experiments and obtained results are discussed in detail.

TI  - GIS-based spatial prediction of debris flows using logistic regression and frequency ratio models for Zezere River basin and its surrounding area, Northwest Covilha, Portugal
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) is important for catastrophe management in the mountainous regions. They focus on generating susceptibility maps beginning from landslide inventories and considering the main predisposing parameters. The aim of this study was to assess the susceptibility of the occurrence of debris flows in the Zezere River basin and its surrounding area using logistic regression (LR) and frequency ratio (FR) models. To achieve this, a landslide inventory map was created using historical information, satellite imagery, and extensive field works. One hundred landslides were mapped, of which 75% were randomly selected as training data, while the remaining 25% were used for validating the models. The landslide influence factors considered for this study were lithology, elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to roads, topographic wetness index (TWI), and stream power index (SPI). The relationships between landslide occurrence and these factors were established, and the results were then evaluated and validated. Validation results show that both methods give acceptable results [the area under curve (AUC) of success rates is 83.71 and 76.38 for LR and FR, respectively]. Furthermore, the AUC results for prediction accuracy revealed that LR model has the highest predictive performance (AUC of predicted rate = 80.26). Hence, it is concluded that the two models showed reasonably good accuracy in predicting the landslide susceptibility in the study area. These two models have the potential to aid planners in development and land-use planning and to offer tools for hazard mitigation measures.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy between invasive lobular carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies suggested that ALND (axillary lymph node dissection) can be avoided in breast cancer patients with limited SLN (sentinel lymph node) metastasis. However, these trials included only several invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases, and the validity of omitting ALND for ILC remains controversial. Here, we examined whether omitting ALND is feasible in ILC treatment.MethodsA total of 3771 breast cancer patients underwent surgery for breast cancer at the Aichi Cancer Center Hospital between January 2006 and December 2015. We excluded patients with neoadjuvant therapy or without axillary management, and identified 184 ILC patients and 2402 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) patients. We compared SLN and non-SLN metastasis rates and the number of total ALN metastases between the ILC and IDC cohorts, and we examined the factors that influenced non-SLN metastasis in the SLN micrometastasis group.ResultsSLN biopsies were performed in 171 (93%) ILC and 2168 (90%) IDC cases, and 31 (18%) ILC and 457 (21%) IDC cases were SLN micrometastasis and macrometastasis (p=0.36). Among SLN macrometastasis patients, 17 (68%) ILC cases and 163 (46%) IDC cases showed non-SLN metastasis (p=0.03). The number of non-SLN metastases was greater in ILC cases compared with IDC cases. Multivariate analysis showed that ILC was the influential factor predicting non-SLN metastasis in patients with SLN macrometastasis.ConclusionILC cases had more non-SLN metastasis than IDC cases among SLN-positive cases, and ILC was an important factor for the prediction of non-SLN positivity in SLN macrometastasis cases. Omitting ALND for ILC with positive SLNs requires more consideration.

TI  - Variability of Satellite Derived Phenological Parameters across Maize Producing Areas of South Africa
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in phenology can be used as a proxy to elucidate the short and long term trends in climate change and variability. Such phenological changes are driven by weather and climate as well as environmental and ecological factors. Climate change affects plant phenology largely during the vegetative and reproductive stages. The focus of this study was to investigate the changes in phenological parameters of maize as well as to assess their causal factors across the selected maize-producing Provinces (viz: North West, Free State, Mpumalanga and KwaZulu-Natal) of South Africa. For this purpose, five phenological parameters i.e., the length of season (LOS), start of season (SOS), end of season (EOS), position of peak value (POP), and position of trough value (POT) derived from the MODIS NDVI data (MOD13Q1) were analysed. In addition, climatic variables (Potential Evapotranspiration (PET), Precipitation (PRE), Maximum (TMX) and Minimum (TMN) Temperatures spanning from 2000 to 2015 were also analysed. Based on the results, the maize-producing Provinces considered exhibit a decreasing trend in NDVI values. The results further show that Mpumalanga and Free State Provinces have SOS and EOS in December and April respectively. In terms of the LOS, KwaZulu-Natal Province had the highest days (194), followed by Mpumalanga with 177 days, while North West and Free State Provinces had 149 and 148 days, respectively. Our results further demonstrate that the influences of climate variables on phenological parameters exhibit a strong space-time and common covariate dependence. For instance, TMN dominated in North West and Free State, PET and TMX are the main dominant factors in KwaZulu-Natal Province whereas PRE highly dominated in Mpumalanga. Furthermore, the result of the Partial Least Square Path Modeling (PLS-PM) analysis indicates that climatic variables predict about 46% of the variability of phenology indicators and about 63% of the variability of yield indicators for the entire study area. The goodness of fit index indicates that the model has a prediction power of 75% over the entire study area. This study contributes towards enhancing the knowledge of the dynamics in the phenological parameters and the results can assist farmers to make the necessary adjustment in order to have an optimal production and thereby enhance food security for both human and livestock.

TI  - Quality Indicators for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Applicability and Clinical Relevance in a Non-screened Population
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality Indicators for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Applicability and Clinical Relevance in a Non-screened Population: sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as standard of care for management of early breast cancer. This study assessed our SLNB program against 11 published quality indicators (QIs). All breast cancer patients who underwent SLNB in our centre from June 2013-Dec 2015 were included. Clinical, pathological and follow-up data were extracted from the institutional REDCap data system. Analysis was done with SPSS 23. Following validation, 234 patients had SLNB, always performed along with primary surgery. Identification rate was 95.3% and > 1 SLN was identified in 72% of patients. SLNB positivity was 33%, of these, 100% underwent ALND. Overall 91% of QI eligible patients underwent SLNB. No ineligible patients (T4) underwent SLNB. For the patients who had radio colloid, injection criteria were met for 100%. Pathological evaluation and reporting criteria were met for 100% of patients. There were no axillary recurrences in a median follow-up of 2 years. 7.6% patients had SLN negative on frozen section but positive on final histology. 7.2% of patients with clinical negative nodes had pN2 disease in final histopathology report after surgery. Sixty percent of patients who had completion ALND had only positive SLN. This study supports the applicability of published QI of SLNB in a non-screened cohort of early breast cancer patients. Although QI were useful, modification based on patient characteristics and resource availability may be needed. These indicators can be used as audit tools to improve the overall accuracy of the procedure.

TI  - Insights Into Polarimetric Processing for Wetlands From Backscatter Modeling and Multi-Incidence Radarsat-2 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have observed unexpected results using the Freeman-Durden (FD) and other polarimetric decompositions in Radarsat-2 quad-pol data from many swamps in Eastern Ontario. In particular, the decompositions reported minimal backscatter from the double-bounce mechanism in a situation where there was compelling evidence that double-bounce backscatter contributed substantially to the return. This led to a hypothesis that the FD and similar models give erroneous results because of the physics of Fresnel reflection of wood, a lossy dielectric material, that makes up the vertical reflecting surfaces in swamps. We found some support for this hypothesis in the literature, and now report on an extensive theoretical and observational investigation. This work has shown that the Freeman-Durden decomposition, and other decompositions that use the same logic, will often mistake double-bounce backscatter as single-bounce backscatter in wetlands. This is a consequence of the fundamental physics of Fresnel reflection. It is important for users to be aware of this pitfall. Double-bounce backscatter from natural surfaces can he identified without recourse to polarimetric decomposition. The simplest, and most reliable, indicator of double-bounce backscatter is a high return in HH polarization. Double-bounce backscatter will generally produce higher return in HH than any other scattering mechanism. If both HH and VV polarizations are available, a high HH/VV intensity ratio is also a strong indicator of double-bounce backscatter. Additional modeling efforts are expected to provide further insights that can lead to improved applications of polarimetric data.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Support Vector Machine, Maximum Likelihood and Neural Network Classification on Multispectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover classification is an essential process in many remote sensing applications. Classification based on supervised methods have been preferred by many due to its practicality, accuracy and objectivity compared to unsupervised methods. Nevertheless, the performance of different supervised methods particularly for classifying land covers in Tropical regions such as Malaysia has not been evaluated thoroughly. The study reported in this paper aims to detect land cover changes using multispectral remote sensing data. The data come from Landsat satellite covering part of Klang District, located in Selangor, Malaysia. Landsat bands 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 are used as the input for three supervised classification methods namely support vector machines (SVM), maximum likelihood (ML) and neural network (NN). The accuracy of the generated classifications is then assessed by means of classification accuracy. Land cover change analysis is also carried out to identify the most reliable method to detect land changes in which showing SVM gives a more stable and realistic outcomes compared to ML and NN.

TI  - Overview of the application of geospatial technology to groundwater potential mapping in Nigeria
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Sustainable development of groundwater resources in many developing nations like Nigeria is hampered by paucity of information about the resource. Geospatial technology has provided useful information in understanding the distribution of groundwater throughout the world for the purpose of planning, exploration, monitoring and conservation. Numerous studies have integrated remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) in the assessment of groundwater potential in different parts of Nigeria. This paper therefore aims to review the literatures and reveal the successes and most importantly the challenges faced by such studies and provide useful recommendations for improvement in future research. A global perspective of advances in the application of geospatial technology to groundwater mapping was first captured from where the strength and weaknesses of the same application in Nigeria in terms of methodology of data extraction, modelling and validation were assessed. The review shows that less than 20 bibliographies are available with about 50% from the south-western part of the country. Few parameters controlling groundwater are often analysed and categorised without any standard. Most models are produced from software packages that do not allow weighting of thematic layers hence cannot incorporate expert judgements. Areas needing urgent attention for improvement include: time of remote sensing data acquisition, methods of parameter extractions, standard GIS software packages used, novel models and comparison between models and the need for model and map validations. Recommendations on country wide coverage of groundwater potential assessment, provision of groundwater monitoring facilities and strict adherence to groundwater development standards were also made.

T2  - GIORNALE DI CHIRURGIA
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Objectives. Quantification of elective and emergency hospital admissions as a resultant of patients' diagnostic and therapeutic pathways (referral system) and patients' preferences to choose the health-care provider.Design. Retrospective analysis of routine hospital discharge data. Findings were analyzed with descriptive statistical methods. Setting. University Hospital Center, "Mother Teresa", Albania, a secondary and tertiary health care provider to the capital Tirana and tertiary health care provider for the rest of Albania.Subjects. 692,284 hospital admissions during eleven years period, 2006-2016.Main outcome measures. Hospital admission trends measured as Average Annual Percentage Change and standardized admissions by district per 100,000 inhabitants.Results. Number of hospital admissions increased from 55,528 in the baseline year to 78,130 in the last year of our study. During eleven years ALOS changed from 7.60 to 5.80 days and BOR increased from 83.2% to 91.6%. AAPC total, Average Annual Percentage Change was 3.2% at the ending year, 2006 to 2016. Cramer's V between variables 'year of admission' and 'prefecture' was 0.024, p < 0.001 and between 'year of admission' and 'Tirana University Hospital Center administrative units' was 0.055, p < 0.001. Both relationships are weak but significant. Maps show the exaggerated flow from other districts towards Tirana.Conclusions. Patient satisfaction, as a health care quality metric, is a driving force towards the choice of health provider. The satisfied patient chooses again or tells the next patient the preferred provider. The perceived professional difference among health care providers has built a competitive environment. The referral system puts strict rules over patient pathway which in his turn finds ways to bypass it if preferences are not taken in consideration. Commitment to such rules is accepted till forces considered as expression of free choice overcome them, jeopardizing the performance of the whole system. Patient's preferences deserve to be evaluated and incorporated in the patient pathway design.

T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT-GJESM
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of inland wetlands' distribution and their level of vulnerability is important to enhance management and conservation efforts. The aim of the study was to map inland wetlands and assess their distribution pattern and vulnerability to natural and human disturbances such as climate change (temperature increase) and human activities by the year 2080. Inland wetland types i.e. forested/shrub, emergent and open water bodies were classified and mapped using maximum likelihood standard algorithm. The spatial distribution pattern of inland wetlands was examined using average nearest neighbor analysis. A weighted geospatial vulnerability analysis was developed using variables such as roads, land cover/land use (developed and agricultural areas) and climate data (temperature) to predict potentially vulnerable inland wetland types. Inland wetlands were successfully classified and mapped with overall accuracy of about 73 percent. Clustered spatial distribution pattern was found among all inland wetland types with varied degree of clustering. The study found about 13 percent of open water bodies, 11 percent of forested/shrub and 7 percent of emergent wetlands potentially most vulnerable to human and natural stressors. This information could be used to improve wetland planning and management by wetland managers and other stakeholders.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We used a global positioning system (GPS), levelling, and Sentinel-1 data to evaluate the stability of the Darbandikhan dam in northeast Iraq after the 2017 Mw 7.3 Sarpol-e Zahab earthquake. GPS and levelling datasets collected in March and November 2017 were used to compute the co-seismic surface displacements of the dam. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images collected between October 2014 and March 2018 were employed to recover the displacement time series of the dam. The large-magnitude displacement gradient on the dam crest hindered the estimation of the co-seismic displacement using this medium-resolution SAR data. However, Sentinel-1 images are sufficient to examine the stability of the dam displacement before and after the earthquake. The results show that the dam was stable between October 2014 and November 2017, but after the earthquake, Sentinel-1 data shows a continuous subsidence of the dam crest between November 2017 and March 2018. To the best knowledge of the authors, this study is the first that utilises InSAR to investigate the behaviour of a dam after a large earthquake.

TI  - Design, Development and Calibration of a Lightweight, Compliant Six-Axis Optical Force/Torque Sensor
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces the fabrication of a six degree-of-freedom force and torque sensor based on fiber-optic sensing technology and its novel calibration methodology. The sensor is cast effective, lightweight, and flexible with a large force and torque measurement range suitable for biomechanics and rehabilitation systems particularly when a wearable sensing system is desired. Six fiber-optic sensing elements are used to detect three main forces Fx, Fy, and Fz, and three main torques Tx, Ty, and Tz. Sensor data were collected by applying dynamic forces and torques with various magnitudes, directions, and frequencies and compared with measurements obtained from a standard force and torque reference. The proposed calibration procedure is intended to reduce errors stemmed from a nonlinear force-deformation relationship and to increase the estimation speed by splitting the calibration into two estimation models: a linear model, based on a standard least squares method (LSM) to estimate the linear portion, and a nonlinear decision trees' model (DT) to estimate the residuals. Both the models work simultaneously as a single calibration system named least squares decision trees LSDT. Using LSDT, the estimation speed increased by 55.17%, and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) reduced to 0.53%. In comparison, each model separately had a RMSEs of 1.26% and 4.70% for the DT and the LSM, respectively.

TI  - Image Segmentation Parameter Selection and Ant Colony Optimization for Date Palm Tree Detection and Mapping from Very-High-Spatial-Resolution Aerial Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of date palm trees is essential for their sustainable management, yield estimation, and environmental studies. In this study, we integrated geographic object-based image analysis, class-specific accuracy measures, fractional factorial design, metaheuristic feature-selection technique, and rule-based classification to detect and map date palm trees from very-high-spatial-resolution (VHSR) aerial images of two study areas. First, multiresolution segmentation was optimized through the synergy of the Fl-score accuracy measure and the robust Taguchi design. Second, ant colony optimization (ACO) was adopted to select the most significant features. Out of 31 features, only 12 significant color invariants and textural features were selected. Third, based on the selected features, the rule-based classification with the aid of a decision tree algorithm was applied to extract date palm trees. The proposed methodology was developed on a subset of the first study area, and ultimately applied to the second study area to investigate its efficiency and transferability. To evaluate the proposed classification scheme, various supervised object-based algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), were applied to the first study area. The result of image segmentation optimization demonstrated that segmentation optimization based on an integrated Fl-score class-specific accuracy measure and Taguchi statistical design showed improvement compared with objective function, along with the Taguchi design. Moreover, the result of the feature selection by ACO outperformed, with almost 88% overall accuracy, several feature-selection techniques, such as chi-square, correlation-based feature selection, gain ratio, information gain, support vector machine, and principal component analysis. The integrated framework for palm tree detection outperformed RF, SVM, and k-NN classification algorithms with an overall accuracy of 91.88% and 87.03%, date palm class-specific accuracies of 0.91 and 0.89, and kappa coefficients of 0.90 and 0.85 for the first and second study areas, respectively. The proposed integrated methodology demonstrated a highly efficient and promising tool to detect and map date palm trees from VHSR aerial images.

TI  - Changing Local Therapy in Breast Cancer: Who Needs What, and When?
T2  - CLINICAL ADVANCES IN HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The local therapy of breast cancer continues to evolve toward less surgery. Breast conservation is firmly in place, with recent trends toward decreased rates of re-excision. Axillary dissection is becoming a rare operation and is being replaced by sentinel node biopsy. The switch to sentinel node biopsy occurred first in patients with pathologically tumor-free nodes, and later in patients with limited nodal disease. Sentinel node biopsy is now also widely used in patients with pathologically positive nodes who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Axillary surgery is being replaced with radiotherapy in some situations, and ongoing trials will further clarify the need for nodal radiotherapy in specific situations following neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Shorter radiotherapy regimens are widely accepted as the standard of care following breast conservation, and the omission of radiotherapy is recognized as appropriate for older patients. The appropriate sequencing of specific components of local therapy, particularly with regard to the timing of chemotherapy, requires thoughtful multidisciplinary planning and leveraging of the strengths of each component of therapy. Here, we review issues related to therapeutic sequencing and decision making in the local therapy of breast cancer.

TI  - Urban environmental quality assessment using remote sensing and census data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban planning to solve environmental problems in Latin American cities requires information that commonly does not exist or, if it does exist, is at different scales, which makes the information incomparable. Therefore, a quantitative approach is proposed to assess an urban environmental quality index (UEQI) for Cali, Colombia, integrating remote sensing and census data. Landsat TM images were used to extract biophysical indicators: land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), leaf wetness content index (LWCI), normalized humid index (NHI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and normalized difference impervious surface index (NDISI). These seven indicators were integrated with seven socioeconomic indicators obtained from census data using multivariate statistical analysis to determine the UEQ index at the commune level. The results showed consistent correlation among the indicators, and the highest values of UEQI occurred in communes with less built-up areas and more green areas. There were statistically significant differences among the index at the commune level. Therefore, communes were categorized into five classes (very good, good, moderate, poor and very poor environmental quality) according to the index to determine the most critical interventions to be made by planning and decision-making institutions. This method could be applied to similar cities using large-scale administrative units.

TI  - Seasonality and trends of dry forest of Piaxtla-Elota-Quelite basin and protected area Meseta de Cacaxtla, Mexico
T2  - MADERA Y BOSQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The tropical dry forests are one of the most vulnerable and unprotected ecosystem in Mexico. Currently, only 30% of the original cover remains and 0.2% of it is under some form of protection status. In order to promote the conservation and management of these ecosystems, the objective of this study was to describe the seasonality and trends change of the forest canopy of the Piaxtla-Elota-Quelite basin and the Meseta de Cacaxtla Flora and Fauna Protection Area in Sinaloa State, in Northwest Mexico. A monthly time series from 2001 to 2016 of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of the satellite Modis Terra was decomposed with a Principal Component Analysis with two orientations. In the analyzed period, 99% of the variation of the forest canopy was due to a vegetative phenological cycle, in which the maximum vigor of the vegetation occurred in September; three and four months after the beginning of the rainy season. Likewise, deforestation or reforestation processes were not identified in the basin. The Meseta de Cacaxtla has fulfilled its function of protecting its forest, and its good state of conservation detected in the whole basin could be an incentive to extend the limits of the protected natural area and to increase the percentage of tropical dry forest under protection status in Sinaloa, which is currently 0.02%.

TI  - Accuracy of intraoperative frozen section evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: Our experience in Bahrain.
T2  - The Gulf journal of oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intraoperative frozen section of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in clinically node-negative breast cancer patients is performed to stage the axilla and allows axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) to be avoided in the same operative setting. The aim of this study was to evaluate our institutional experience on the accuracy of intraoperative frozen section of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in breast cancer patients.METHODS: Clinicopathological data from patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer with SLNB from January 2013 to May 2017 at Salmaniya Medical Complex (SMC) in Bahrain were collected retrospectively. Results of intraoperative frozen section were compared to paraffin section to determine accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV), negativepredictive value (NPV) and false-negative rate (FNR).RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with breast cancer underwent breast surgery with SLNB and intraoperative frozen section evaluation of SLNB. Frozen section correctly identified a positive or negative result in 97 cases (accuracy 93.2%). The sensitivity was 77.7%. The specificity was 98.7%. The PPV was 95.4%. The NPV was 92.6%. The overall FNR was 22.3%.CONCLUSION: Our results show that intraoperative frozen section can reliably evaluate the status of SLNB in patients with breast cancer, allowing us to avoid second stage surgery in most women.

TI  - Expanding severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance beyond influenza: The process and data from 1year of implementation in Vietnam
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn 2016, as a component of the Global Health Security Agenda, the Vietnam Ministry of Health expanded its existing influenza sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to include testing for 7 additional viral respiratory pathogens. This article describes the steps taken to implement expanded SARI surveillance in Vietnam and reports data from 1year of expanded surveillance.MethodsThe process of expanding the suite of pathogens for routine testing by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) included laboratory trainings, procurement/distribution of reagents, and strengthening and aligning SARI surveillance epidemiology practices at sentinel sites and regional institutes (RI).ResultsSurveillance data showed that of 4003 specimens tested by the RI laboratories, 20.2% (n=810) were positive for influenza virus. Of the 3193 influenza-negative specimens, 41.8% (n=1337) were positive for at least 1 non-influenza respiratory virus, of which 16.2% (n=518), 13.4% (n=428), and 9.6% (n=308) tested positive for respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus, respectively.ConclusionsThe Government of Vietnam has demonstrated that expanding respiratory viral surveillance by strengthening and building upon an influenza platform is feasible, efficient, and practical.

TI  - Quasi-Static Granular Flow of Ice Melange
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use Landsat 8 imagery to generate ice melange velocity fields at Greenland's three most productive outlet glaciers: Jakobshavn Isbrae, Helheim Glacier, and Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier. Winter velocity fields are generally steady and highly uniform. Summer velocity fields, on the other hand, tend to be much more variable and can be uniform, compressional, or extensional. We rarely observe compressional flow at Jakobshavn Isbrae or extensional flow at Helheim Glacier, while both are observed at Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier. Transverse velocity profiles from all three locations are suggestive of viscoplastic flow, in which deformation occurs primarily in shear zones along the fjord walls. We analyze the transverse profiles in the context of quasi-static flow using continuum rheologies for granular materials and find that the force per unit width that ice melange exerts on glacier termini increases exponentially with the ice melange length-to-width ratio and the effective coefficient of friction. Our estimates of ice melange resistance are consistent with other independent estimates and suggest that ice melange may be capable of inhibiting iceberg calving events, especially during winter. Moreover, our results provide geophysical-scale support for constitutive relationships for granular materials and suggest a potential avenue for modeling ice melange dynamics with continuum models.

TI  - Detecting Land Use Changes in a Rapidly Developing City during 1990-2017 Using Satellite Imagery: A Case Study in Hangzhou Urban Area, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the rapidly-developing mega cities in China, Hangzhou has experienced great land use change during the past three decades. By analyzing land use change in designated period, it is beneficial to understand urbanization process in Hangzhou, and undertake further urban management and urban planning. In this study, the land use change from 1990 to 2017 in Hangzhou urban area was detected by a method of supervised classification with Landsat TM images from 1990, 1997, 2004, 2010 and 2017, and analyzed by a Markov matrix. The results show that from 1990 to 2017, a great deal of rural areas transformed into built up areas in the Hangzhou urban area. Consequently, the urban area of Hangzhou increased eight times over the period from 1990 to 2017. This may imply that such a change should be directly related to the Chinese government policy, of which the main factor is rapidly-developing urbanization in China, such as in Hangzhou. Thus, it is believed that China's land use change is going to be small in the following decades. This may indicate that China's urban construction is slowing down, while its urban planning is being shifted from construction to management.

TI  - Long-term breast cancer survival in relation to the metastatic tumor burden in axillary lymph nodes
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The clinical significance of lymph node micrometastases and isolated tumor cells (ITCs) in breast cancer is still controversial. After a median follow-up of 52 months, a report from the Swedish Multicenter Cohort Study presented a worse cancer-specific and event-free survival for patients with micrometastases than node-negative individuals, but could not demonstrate a significant difference in overall survival (OS). Due to the tendency of breast cancer to relapse after more than 5-10 years, we now report the long-term survival of the cohort.Methods Between September 2000 and January 2004, 3355 breast cancer patients were included in a prospective cohort. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was always performed. Patients were classified in four groups according to their overall nodal stage: node negative (N0, 2372), ITCs (113), micrometastases (123), and macrometastases (747). Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied.Results Median follow-up was 156 months. Ten-year cancer-specific survival and OS were significantly lower in case of micrometastases than in N0 (84.7 vs. 93.5%, p = 0.001, and 75.5 vs. 84.2%, p = 0.046, respectively). In case of macrometastases, corresponding survival rates were 82.8 and 74.3%. Only for those aged less than 50 years, cancer-specific survival and OS were significantly worse in case of ITCs than N0. Patients with micrometastases received less often chemotherapy than those with macrometastases (24.4 vs. 53.9%).Conclusions Lymph node micrometastases in breast cancer have a prognostic significance. This study demonstrates a similar survival for patients with micrometastases and those with macrometastases, possibly due to systemic undertreatment.

TI  - Understanding linkages between global climate indices and terrestrial water storage changes over Africa using GRACE products
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Africa, a continent endowed with huge water resources that sustain its agricultural activities is increasingly coming under threat from impacts of climate extremes (droughts and floods), which puts the very precious water resource into jeopardy. Understanding the relationship between climate variability and water storage over the continent, therefore, is paramount in order to inform future water management strategies. This study employs Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data and the higher order (fourth order cumulant) statistical independent component analysis (ICA) method to study the relationship between terrestrial water storage (TWS) changes and five global climate-teleconnection indices; El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) over Africa for the period 2003-2014. Pearson correlation analysis is applied to extract the connections between these climate indices (CIs) and TWS, from which some known strong CI-rainfall relationships (e.g., over equatorial eastern Africa) are found. Results indicate unique linear-relationships and regions that exhibit strong linkages between CIs and TWS. Moreover, unique regions having strong CI-TWS connections that are completely different from the typical ENSO-rainfall connections over eastern and southern Africa are also identified. Furthermore, the results indicate that the first dominant independent components (IC) of the CIs are linked to NAO, and are characterized by significant reductions of TWS over southern Africa. The second dominant ICs are associated with IOD and are characterized by significant increases in TWS over equatorial eastern Africa, while the combined ENSO and MJO are apparently linked to the third ICs, which are also associated with significant increase in TWS changes over both southern Africa, as well as equatorial eastern Africa.

TI  - Estimation of Methane Emissions from Rice Paddies in the Mekong Delta Based on Land Surface Dynamics Characterization with Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In paddy soils in the Mekong Delta, soil archaea emit substantial amounts of methane. Reproducing ground flux data using only satellite-observable explanatory variables is a highly transparent method for evaluating regional emissions. We hypothesized that PALSAR-2 (Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture RADAR) can distinguish inundated soil from noninundated soil even if the soil is covered by rice plants. Then, we verified the reproducibility of the ground flux data with satellite-observable variables (soil inundation and cropping calendar) and with hierarchical Bayesian models. Furthermore, inundated/noninundated soils were classified with PALSAR-2. The model parameters were successfully converged using the Hamiltonian-Monte Carlo method. The cross-validation of PALSAR-2 land surface water coverage (LSWC) with several inundation indices of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AMSR-2 (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2) data showed that (1) high PALSAR-2-LSWC values were detected even when MODIS and AMSR-2 inundation index values (MODIS-NDWI and AMSR-2-NDFI) were low and (2) low values of PALSAR-2-LSWC tended to be less frequently detected as the MODIS-NDWI and AMSR-2-NDFI increased. These findings indicate the potential of PALSAR-2 to detect inundated soils covered by rice plants even when MODIS and AMSR-2 cannot, and show the similarity between PALSAR-2-LSWC and the other two indices for nonvegetated areas.

TI  - Livestock intensification potential in Brazil based on agricultural census and satellite data analysis
T2  - PESQUISA AGROPECUARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of livestock intensification in Brazil. Beef cattle stocking rates were estimated according to agricultural census data on livestock production in Brazilian municipalities. Pasture carrying capacity was obtained by combining moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (Modis) images of gross primary productivity and data on dry matter demand per animal unit (AU). Cattle stocking rate for Brazil, in 2014/2015, was 0.97 AU ha(-1), and the carrying capacity was 3.60 AU ha(-1); therefore, there is an average livestock intensification potential of 2.63 AU ha(-1). The highest average intensification potential was observed for the Southern region (3.62 AU ha(-1)), and the lowest for the Northern (2.13 AU ha(-1)) and Northeastern regions (2.22 AU ha(-1)). It is possible to estimate cattle stocking rate, pasture carrying capacity, and potential of livestock intensification by integrating data on agricultural census and remote sensing.

TI  - Local-scale accuracy assessment of vegetation cover change maps derived from Global Forest Change data, ClasLite, and supervised classifications: case study at part of Riau Province, Indonesia
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Massive deforestation in Indonesia drives the need for proper monitoring using appropriate technology and method. The continuing mission of Landsat sensor extends the observation to almost 30 years back, initiating the ability to monitor the dynamics of vegetation intensively. By taking the advantage of the Landsat archive, advanced semi-automatic classification method, namely ClasLite developed by Asner et al. (J Appl Remote Sens 3:33543-33543.2009) and a new end-product of 30 m Global Forest Cover Change cover (GFC) datasets developed by (Hansen et al. in Science 342:850-853, 2013a), offered the ability to easily monitor deforestation and forest degradation with little or few knowledge of mapping. This study aims to assess the performance of these newly available products of GFC and the ClasLite method against the traditional pixel-based supervised classification of minimum distance to mean (MD), maximum likelihood (ML), spectral angle mapper (SAM). and random forest (RF). Visual image interpretation of pan-sharpened Landsat was carried out to measure the accuracy of each final map. Result demonstrated that GFC and ClasLite performance has 3 to 18% higher overall accuracy for mapping vegetation cover change compared with the conventional supervised analysis using MD, ML, SAM, and RF with ClasLite as the most accurate method with 78.14 +/- 2%. Further adjustment of the cover change map of GFC by using forest extent from ClasLite was able to increase the accuracy of the original GFC data by 10%. Therefore, GFC and ClasLite ensure the ability to monitor vegetation cover change accurately in a simple manner.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Area and Canopy Cover Based on Visual Interpretation of Satellite Images in Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests, particularly in the tropics, are suffering from deforestation and forest degradations. The estimation of forest area and canopy cover is an essential part of the establishment of a measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system that is needed for monitoring carbon stocks and the associated greenhouse gas emissions and removals. Information about forest area and canopy cover might be obtained by visual image interpretation as an alternative to expensive fieldwork. The objectives of this study were to evaluate different types of satellite images for forest area and canopy cover estimation though visual image interpretation, and assess the influence of sample sizes on the estimates. Seven sites in Ethiopia with different vegetation systems were subjectively identified, and visual interpretations were carried out in a systematical design. Bootstrapping was applied to evaluate the effects of sample sizes. The results showed that high-resolution satellite images (5 m) (PlanetScope and RapidEye) images produced very similar estimates, while coarser resolution imagery (10 m, Sentinel-2) estimates were dependent on forest conditions. Estimates based on Sentinel-2 images varied significantly from the two other types of images in sites with denser forest cover. The estimates from PlanetScope and RapidEye were less sensitive to changes in sample size.

TI  - Dual Link Image Coding for Earth Observation Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional strategy to download images captured by satellites is to compress the data on board and then transmit them via the downlink. It often happens that the capacity of the downlink is too small to accommodate all the acquired data, so the images are trimmed and/or transmitted through lossy regimes. This paper introduces a coding system that increases the amount and quality of the downloaded imaging data. The main insight of this paper is to use both the uplink and the downlink to code the images. The uplink is employed to send reference information to the satellite so that the onboard coding system can achieve higher efficiency. This reference information is computed on the ground, possibly employing extensive data and computational resources. The proposed system is called dual link image coding. As it is devised in this paper, it is suitable for Earth observation satellites with polar orbits. Experimental results obtained for data sets acquired by the Landsat 8 satellite indicate significant coding gains with respect to conventional methods.

TI  - Forest mapping: a comparison between hyperspectral and multispectral images and technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping forests is an important process in managing natural resources. At present, due to spectral resolution limitations, multispectral images do not give a complete separation between different forest species. In contrast, advances in remote sensing technologies have provided hyperspectral tools and images as a solution for the determination of species. In this study, spectral signatures for stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) forests were collected using an advanced spectroradiometer "ASD FieldSpec 4 Hi-Res" with an accuracy of 1 nm. These spectral signatures are used to compare between different multispectral and hyperspectral satellite images. The comparison is based on processing satellite images: hyperspectral Hyperion, hyperspectral CHRIS-Proba, Advanced Land Imager (ALI), and Landsat 8. Enhancement and classification methods for hyperspectral and multispectral images are investigated and analyzed. In addition, a well-known hyperspectral image classification algorithm, spectral angle mapper (SAM), has been improved to perform the classification process efficiently based on collected spectral signatures. The results show that the modified SAM is 9% more accurate than the conventional SAM. In addition, experiments indicate that the CHRIS-Proba image is more accurate than Landsat 8 (overall accuracy 82%, precision 93%, and Kappa coefficient 0.43 compared to 60, 67%, and 0.035, respectively). Similarly, Hyperion is better than ALI in mapping stone pine (overall accuracy 92%, precision 97%, and Kappa coefficient 0.74 compared to 52, 56%, and - 0.032, respectively).

TI  - Variations of the Snow Water Equivalent in the Ourika Catchment (Morocco) over 2000-2018 Using Downscaled MERRA-2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ourika River is an important tributary of the Tensift River in the water-stressed region of Marrakesh (Morocco). The Ourika river flow is dominated by the snow melt contribution from the High Atlas mountains. Despite its importance in terms of water resources, the snow water equivalent (SWE) is poorly monitored in the Ourika catchment. Here, we used MERRA-2 data to run a distributed energy-balance snowpack model (SnowModel) over 2000-2018. MERRA-2 data were downscaled to 250-m spatial resolution using a digital elevation model. The model outputs were compared to in situ measurements of snow depth, precipitation, river flow and remote sensing observations of the snow cover area from MODIS. The results indicate that the model provides an overall acceptable representation of the snow cover dynamics given the coarse resolution of the MERRA-2 forcing. Then, we used the model output to analyze the spatio-temporal variations of the SWE in the Ourika catchment for the first time. We suggest that MERRA-2 data, which are routinely available with a delay of a few weeks, can provide valuable information to monitor the snow resource in high mountain areas without in situ measurements.

TI  - Wave steepness from satellite altimetry for wave dynamics and climate studies
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave steepness is presented as an extension and a valuable add-on to the conventional set of sea state parameters retrieved from satellite altimetry data. Following physical model based on recent advances of weak turbulence theory wave steepness is estimated from directly measured spatial gradient of wave height. In this way the method works with altimetry trajectories rather than with point-wise data. Moreover, in contrast to widely used parametric models this approach provides us with instantaneous values of wave steepness and period. Relevance of single-track estimates of wave steepness (period) is shown for wave climate studies and confirmed by a simple probabilistic model. The approach is verified via comparison against buoy and satellite data including crossover points for standard 1 second data of Ku-band altimeters. High quality of the physical model and robustness of the parametric ones are examined in terms of global wave statistics. Prospects and relevance of both approaches in the ocean wave climate studies are discussed.

TI  - Evaluating emergency care capacity in Africa: an iterative, multicountry refinement of the Emergency Care Assessment Tool
T2  - BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare facilities in low-income and middle-income countries lack an objective measurement tool to assess emergency care capacity. The African Federation for Emergency Medicine developed the Emergency Care Assessment Tool (ECAT) to fulfil this function. The ECAT assesses the provision of key medical interventions (signal functions) that emergency units (EUs) should be able to perform to adequately treat six common, life-threatening conditions (sentinel conditions). We describe the piloting and refinement of the ECAT, to improve usability and context-appropriateness. We undertook iterative, multisite refinement of the ECAT. After pilot testing at a South African referral hospital, subsequent studies occurred at district, regional and central facilities across four countries representing the major regions of Africa: Cameroon, Uganda, Egypt and Botswana. At each site, the tool was administered to three participants: one senior physician, one senior nurse and one other clinical provider. Feedback informed refinements of the ECAT, and an updated tool was used in the next-studied country. Iteratively implementing refined versions of the tool in various contexts across Africa resulted in a final ECAT that uses signal functions, categorised by sentinel conditions and evaluated against discrete barriers to emergency care service delivery, to assess EUs. It also allowed for refinement of administration and data analysis processes. The ECAT has a total of 71 items. Advanced facilities are expected to perform all 71 signal functions, while intermediate facilities should be able to perform 53. The ECAT is the first tool to provide a standardised method for assessing facility-based emergency care in the African context. It identifies where in the maturation process a hospital or system is and what gaps exist in delivery of care, so that a comprehensive roadmap for development can be established. Although validity and feasibility testing have now occurred, reliability studies must be conducted prior to amplification across the region.

AB  - BackgroundAxillary lymph node status remains a significant prognostic indicator in breast cancer. Here, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (US-FNA) and ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy (US-CNB) in axillary staging was compared.MethodsA comprehensive search was undertaken of all published studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of US-CNB and US-FNA of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer. Studies were included if raw data were available on the diagnostic performance of both US-FNA and US-CNB, and compared with final histology results. Relevant data were extracted from each study for systematic review. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of US-FNA and US-CNB were obtained using a bivariable model. Summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs were created to confirm diagnostic accuracy.ResultsData on a total of 1353 patients from six studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. US-CNB was superior to US-FNA in diagnosing axillary nodal metastases: sensitivity 88 (95 per cent c.i. 84 to 91) versus 74 (70 to 78) per cent respectively. Both US-CNB and US-FNA had a high specificity of 100 per cent. Reported complication rates were significantly higher for US-CNB compared with US-FNA (71 versus 13 per cent; P<0001). Conversely, the requirement for repeat diagnostic procedures was significantly greater for US-FNA (40 versus 05 per cent; P<0001).ConclusionUS-CNB is a superior diagnostic technique to US-FNA for axillary staging in breast cancer.

TI  - Arm morbidity of axillary dissection with sentinel node biopsy versus delayed axillary dissection
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundStaging of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer is important for prognostication and planning of adjuvant therapy. The traditional practice of proceeding to axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) if sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is positive is being challenged and clinical trials are underway. For many centres, this will mean a move away from intra-operative SLNB assessment and utilization of a second procedure to perform ALND. It is sometimes perceived that a delayed ALND results in increased tissue damage and thus increased morbidity. We compared morbidity in those undergoing SLNB only, or ALND as a one- or two-stage procedure.MethodsA retrospective review of a prospectively collected institutional database was used to review rates of lymphoedema and shoulder function in women undergoing breast cancer surgery between 2008 and 2012.ResultsThe overall lymphoedema rate in 745 patients was 8.2% at 12 months. There was no difference in lymphoedema rates between those undergoing immediate or delayed ALND (17.8 and 8.6%, respectively, P = 0.092). Post-operative shoulder elevation, odds ratio (OR) = 0.390, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.218, 0.698) and abduction, OR = 0.437 (95% CI = (0.271, 0.705)) were reduced if an ALND was performed although there was no difference between immediate or delayed.ConclusionALND remains a risk factor for post-operative morbidity. There is no increased risk of lymphoedema or shoulder function deficit with a positive SLNB and delayed ALND compared to immediate ALND.

TI  - Remote sensing-based forest health monitoring systems - case studies from Czechia and Slovakia
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim of this paper is to present the remote sensing-based systems of forest health assessment in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and to analyse both their strengths and weaknesses. Nationwide assessment of forest health in the Czech Republic is based on the interpretation of Sentinel-2 satellite data using novel approaches for cloud-free image synthesis based on all available satellite observations. A predictive statistical model to yield time series of leaf area index (LAI) from satellite observations is developed above extensive in-situ data, including [Al and forest defoliation assessment. Forest health is evaluated for each pixel from yearly changes of forest LAI, while the country-wise assessment of the health status is performed at the cadastral level. Methodology developed for Slovakia is based on a two-phase regression sampling. The first phase of the procedure provides an initial fast estimate of forest damage using only satellite observations (visible and infrared channels from Landsat or Sentinel-2 systems). The second phase refines the result of the first phase using data from a ground damage assessment (site-level defoliation from ICP Forests database). Resulting forest health assessment over the whole forest area is presented in 10 defoliation classes. The Czech Republic shows 1.6% of heavily damaged forests, 12.5% of damaged forests, 79.2% of forests with stable conditions, 6.3% of regenerated forests and 0.4% of strongly regenerated forests. In Slovakia, the total share of damaged stands (i. e. with defoliation higher than 40%) increased from 6 - 8% in 2003 - 2011 to 13 - 15% in 2012-2017. Both methodologies conduct nationwide assessment of forest health status in a fast and automatized way with high accuracy and minimal costs. The weaknesses are, for example, a high computational demands for production cloud free mosaics, inability to identify initial phases of forest health decline, exclusion of stands older than 80 years (in the Czech Republic) and inability to differentiate between harvested and severely damaged stands (in Slovakia). Finally, the paper outlines future development of both methodologies.

TI  - Towards a Decommodified Wildlife Tourism: Why Market Environmentalism Is Not Enough for Conservation
T2  - SOCIETIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife tourism is frequently touted as a solution to the problems of increased poaching, habitat destruction, and species extinction. When wildlife is able to pay for its right to survive through attracting tourists, there is an incentive to conserve wildlife populations and the habitats that support them. However, numerous reports in recent years have drawn attention to the potential negative impacts of wildlife tourism attractions. This paper examines whether market environmentalism diminishes the potential of wildlife tourism to contribute to conservation and the welfare of individual animals. Market environmentalism commodifies the animals involved in wildlife tourism attractions and fuels an anthropocentric worldview where animals are resources to be used by humans for entertainment or economic gain, potentially presenting a threat to long-term conservation. Instead, we call for a decommodified experience of wildlife tourism based on more than just economic value.

T2  - SUPPORTIVE CARE IN CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Determine the changes in shoulder strength, shoulder range of motion, and arm volume in breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND)Sixty-eight SLNB and 44 ALND patients were followed up from pre-surgery to 5 years after surgery. Primary outcomes were the differences between affected and non-affected sides for the following: shoulder strength measured by dynamometry, shoulder range of motion measured by goniometry, and lymphedema measured by volume. As a secondary outcome, health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed by the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for breast cancer (FACT-B+4) questionnaires. Changes over time were tested for SLNB and ALND using univariate repeated measures analysis of variance. Generalized estimating equation models were constructed to assess the effect of SLNB and ALND over time.After 5 years, the ALND group had significant loss of strength for internal rotators (1.39 kg, p = 0.001) and significant arm volume increase (132.45 mL, p = 0.031). The ALND group had a greater number of patients with clinically relevant internal rotator strength loss (38.7 vs. 13.6%, p = 0.012) and a greater number of lymphedema requiring treatment (33.3 vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001) than the SLNB group. A loss of strength for shoulder external rotators, shoulder range of motion, and HRQL in physical and arm domains persisted at 5 years in both SLNB and ALND groups.These results could help understand and plan the prevention, needs, and long-term care of breast cancer patients.

TI  - MAPPING OF DEFOLIATION IN THE <i>PAYS DES ETANGS</i> IN THE LORRAINE - EFFECTIVENESS OF REMOTE SENSING
T2  - Revue Forestiere Francaise (Nancy)
M3  - Article
AB  - Oak groves in the Pays des Etangs forest in Lorraine, composed essentially of oak trees, have suffered extensive die back since the beginning of the years 2000, attributable to various causes (defoliating insects, drought and 2003 heatwave, etc.). The oak processionary caterpillar has played an essential role by causing major, widespread defoliation since the 1990's. This exploratory study shows that based on observations in the field used as reference data, mapping of defoliation in the years starting in 2010 can be performed with satellite images. The method relies on medium-(MODIS) and high-(Landast) spatial resolutions acquired on various days of the year on the one hand. And on the other, it relies on a supervised classification method based on the random forests of decision trees. By extrapolation, one obtains indications about the level of defoliation locally. Improvements of the method in several respects (better match between field observations and images, use of Sentinel-2 satellite images, choice of predictors derived from images) are being researched so that it can be applied to other forests experiencing major defoliation.

TI  - SPECTRAL AND SPATIAL SUPER-RESOLUTION METHOD FOR EARTH REMOTE SENSING IMAGE FUSION
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article we propose a spatial and spectral super-resolution algorithm for a set of multichannel images obtained by various Earth remote sensing detectors. We regard the result of the algorithm as a model of an ideal data source, which has a better accuracy of the observed terrain representation than each of the input images having lower spatial and spectral resolution. The proposed algorithm utilizes a method of gradient descent and applies a refined model of image observation, including both spectral and spatial down-sampling and up-sampling. The article describes an experimental study of the proposed algorithm and a comparison of the quality of its work with bilinear interpolation of low-resolution images. The practical application of the proposed algorithm consists in the joint processing of remote sensing data of various levels, which makes it possible to erase the boundaries that arise from the design differences of imaging sensors.

TI  - Birds of a Feather can Butt Heads: When Machiavellian Employees Work with Machiavellian Leaders
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machiavellians are manipulative and deceitful individuals willing to utilize any strategy or behavior needed to attain their goals. This study explores what occurs when Machiavellian employees have a Machiavellian leader with the same negative, manipulative disposition. We argue that Machiavellian employees have a negative worldview and are likely to trust their leaders less. This reduced trust likely results in these employees experiencing higher stress and engaging in more unethical behavior. In addition, we expect these negative relationships to be exacerbated when such followers experience Machiavellian leadership. Thus, we test a moderated mediation model assessing whether Machiavellianism affects employees and whether combining Machiavellian leaders and Machiavellian employees is toxic in the sense of exacerbating the negative impact of Machiavellianism on employee trust. Results do not support the proposed conditional indirect effect of trust for either stress or unethical behavior. Instead, we find a conditional direct effect of employee Machiavellianism on both trust and stress: When Machiavellian employees have Machiavellian leaders, their trust in their leader significantly decreases, and their level of stress significantly increases. We also find support for an unconditional indirect effect of trust for employee stress (but not for unethical work behaviors), Machiavellianism in employees relates to stress via lowered trust in the leader. For unethical behavior, we only find a main effect of employee Machiavellianism.

TI  - Contribution of Land Surface Temperature (TCI) to Vegetation Health Index: A Comparative Study Using Clear Sky and All-Weather Climate Data Records
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Vegetation Health Index (VHI) is widely used for monitoring drought using satellite data. VHI depends on vegetation state and thermal stress, respectively assessed via (i) the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) that usually relies on information from the visible and near infra-red parts of the spectrum (in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI); and (ii) the Thermal Condition Index (TCI), based on top of atmosphere thermal infrared (TIR) brightness temperature or on TIR-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST). VHI is then estimated as a weighted average of VCI and TCI. However, the optimum weights of the two components are usually not known and VHI is usually estimated attributing a weight of 0.5 to both. Using a previously developed methodology for the Euro-Mediterranean region, we show that the multi-scalar drought index (SPEI) may be used to obtain optimal weights for VCI and TCI over the area covered by Meteosat satellites that includes Africa, Europe, and part of South America. The procedure is applied using clear-sky Meteosat Climate Data Records (CDRs) and all-sky LST derived by combining satellite and reanalysis data. Results obtained present a coherent spatial distribution of VCI and TCI weights when estimated using clear- and all-sky LST. This study paves the way for the development of a future VHI near-real time operational product for drought monitoring based on information from Meteosat satellites.

TI  - Shallow Water Depth Retrieval From Multitemporal Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 constellation can provide numerous high-resolution C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with long-term continuity and freely, thus showing a cost-effective solution for the coastal monitoring at high or moderate spatial resolutions. The major goal is to improve estimates of shallow water depth for SAR applications. We present an algorithm that is based on the linear dispersion relation between water depth and swell parameters like swell wavelength, direction, and period to estimate shallow water depth using multitemporal SAR data with a short repeating cycle. This is accomplished via circular convolution and Kalman filter that provides both the estimates and a measure of their uncertainty at each location. The introduced algorithm is tested on four Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath (IW) mode SAR images over the coastal region of Fujian Province, China. The retrieved water depth both from multitemporal SAR images and different single SAR images show general agreement with water depth from an official electronic navigational chart. All comparisons indicate that the proposed method is feasible and multitemporal SAR data have great potential in bathymetric surveying.

AB  - This study is an attempt to use satellite imagery for the assessment of environmental changes near the Ba Lai River, Mekong Delta, in Vietnam. Landsat imagery was used to calculate water quality variables as well as land cover changes near Ba Lai River, both before and after the construction of an irrigation dam in 2002. A lot of changes in land use and land cover were observed in this area since the construction of the Ba Lai dam, particularly in the agricultural practice such as rotational plantation of rice and other crops. The present study stated that water quality has decreased and became polluted with organic materials between 1988 and 2006. Water quality variables such as chlorophyll (algae), nitrogen, and phosphorus were highly increased, whereas turbidity levels have slightly increased since the dam construction, possibly due to alluvial silty deposition.

TI  - MAPPING AND MONITORING EROSION-ACCRETION IN AN ALLUVIAL RIVER USING SATELLITE IMAGERY - THE RIVER BANK CHANGES OF THE PADMA RIVER IN BANGLADESH
T2  - QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPHICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Padma river is widely known for its dynamic and disastrous behaviour, and the river has been experiencing intense and frequent bank erosion and deposition leading to the changes and shifting of bank line. In this paper, a time series of Landsat satellite imagery MSS, TM and OLI and TIRS images and are used to detect river bank erosion-accretion and bank line shifting during the study period 1975-2015. This study exhibits a drastic increase of erosion and accretion of land along the Padma river. The results show that from 1975 to 2015, the total amount of river bank erosion is 49,951 ha of land, at a rate of 1,249 ha a(-1) and the total amount of accretion is 83,333 ha of land, at a rate of 2,083 ha a(-1). Throughout the monitoring period, erosion-accretion was more pronounced in the right part of the river and bank line had been shifting towards the southern direction. The paper also reveals that the total area of islands had been increased significantly, in 2015 there was about 50,967 ha of island area increased from 20,533 ha of island area in 1975, and the results evidence consistency of sedimentation in the river bed.
