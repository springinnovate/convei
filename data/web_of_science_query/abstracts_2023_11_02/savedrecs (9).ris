TI  - Improved Generalized IHS Based on Total Variation for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the fusion of a panchromatic (PAN) and a multispectral (MS) image aimed at generating a high-quality outcome over the same area. This particular image fusion problem has been widely studied, but until recently, it has been challenging to balance the spatial and spectral fidelity in fused images. The spectral distortion is widespread in the component substitution-based approaches due to the variation in the intensity distribution of spatial components. We lightened the idea using the total variation optimization to improve upon a novel GIHS-TV framework for pansharpening. The framework drew the high spatial fidelity from the GIHS scheme and implemented it with a simpler variational expression. An improved L1-TV constraint to the new spatial-spectral information was introduced to the GIHS-TV framework, along with its fast implementation. The objective function was solved by the Iteratively Reweighted Norm (IRN) method. The experimental results on the "PAirMax" dataset clearly indicated that GIHS-TV could effectively reduce the spectral distortion in the process of component substitution. Our method has achieved excellent results in visual effects and evaluation metrics.

TI  - Multi-nighttime-light data comparison analysis based on image quality values and lit fishing vessel identification effect
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fisheries provide high-quality protein for many people, and their sustainable use is of global concern. Light trapping is a widely used fishing method that takes advantage of the phototropism of fish. Remote sensing technology allows for the monitoring of lit fishing vessels at sea from the air at night, which supports the sustainable management of fisheries. To investigate the potential of different nighttime light remote sensing data for lit fishing vessel identification and applications, we used the fuzzy evaluation method to quantitatively assess images in terms of their radiometric and geometric quality, and Otsu's method to compare the effects of lit fishing vessel identification. Three kinds of nighttime lighting data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program/Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS), Visible infrared imaging radiometer suite day/night band (VIIRS/DNB), and Luojia1-01(LJ1-01) were analyzed, compared, and application pointers were constructed. The results are as follows. ?In the image radiation quality evaluation, the information entropy, clarity, and noise performance of the LJ1-01 image are higher than those of the DMSP/OLS and VIIRS/DNB images, where the information entropy value of the LJ1-01 image is nearly 10 times that of VIIRS/DNB and 23 times that of DMSP/OLS. The average gradient value is 14 times that of the image from VIIRS/DNB and 1,600 times that of DMSP/OLS, while its noise is only about 2/3 of the VIIRS/DNB image and 1/3 of the DMSP/OLS image. In the geometric quality assessment, the geometric positioning accuracy and ground sampling accuracy of the VIIRS/DNB image is the best among the three images, with a relative difference percentage of 100.1%, and the LJ1-01 and DMSP/OLS images are relatively lower, at 96.9% and 92.3%, respectively. ? The detection of squid fishing vessels in the Northwest Pacific is taken as an example to compare the identification effects of three types of data: DMSP/OLS, VIIRS/DNB, and LJ1-01. Among these data, DMSP/OLS can effectively identify the position of the lit fishing boat, and VIIRS/DNB images can accurately estimate the spatial position and number of lit fishing boats with large distances. However, in the case of fishing boats gathering or clustering, the number of fishing vessels could not be identified. This led to the detected number of lit fishing vessels being less than the real value. For the VIIRS/DNB and LJ1-01 images with a 5 & PRIME;x8 & PRIME; span in the same spatiotemporal range using the same batch of pelagic squid fishing vessels, LJ1-01 extracted 18 fishing vessels. VIIRS/DNB extracted 15, indicating that LJ1-01 can distinguish multiple fishing vessels in the lighted overlapping area, thus accurately identifying the number of fishing vessels. The application pointing table generated based on the results of the three data analyses can provide a reference for sensor/image selection for nighttime light remote sensing fishery applications and a basis for more refined fishing vessel identification, extraction, and monitoring.

TI  - Landslide-prone area retrieval and earthquake-inducing hazard probability assessment based on InSAR analysis
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow-moving landslide-prone areas (SLAs) are unstable objects on the terrestrial surface that can collapse rapidly when provoked by earthquakes, leading to infrastructure damage. It is critical to identify SLAs prior to earthquake events and assess their hazard-causing probabilities when triggered. An assessment approach of earthquake-triggered geohazards is proposed in this paper by combining interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) derived SLAs and geological and geomorphological factors. Taking the Ms6.8 Luding earthquake, which occurred in the Sichuan Province of southwestern China on September 5, 2022, as an example, 1320 scenes of Sentinel-1 SAR data in western Sichuan were processed using the small baseline subset (SBAS) InSAR technique before the earthquake. After the earthquake, hazard probability assessment was performed in real-time by filtering the SLAs using a spatial analysis technique with geological and geomorphological factors, e.g., real-time peak ground acceleration (PGA), slope, distance to fault (DTF), and distance to the river (DTR) data. The results show that 11 SLAs were classified into high-risk zones. As verified by the Luding co-seismic landslide dataset from visual interpretation of optical remote sensing images, 142 coseismic landslides were triggered by the earthquake in these high-risk regions. In these areas, an ancient landslide, with high pre-earthquake displacement rates (-50 mm/year) on the scarp was reactivated under the Luding earthquake forces. This method can provide a scientific tool for disaster mitigation and rapid response emergency management.

TI  - Retrieving Atmospheric Gas Profiles Using FY-3E/HIRAS-II Infrared Hyperspectral Data by Neural Network Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The observed radiation data from the second-generation Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS-II) on the Fengyun-3E (FY-3E) satellite contain useful vertical atmosphere information which can distinguish and retrieve vertical profiles of atmospheric gas components including ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4). This paper utilizes FY-3E/HIRAS-II observational data to optimize each gas channel using the improved Optimal Sensitivity Profile method (OSP) channel algorithm and establishes a typical convolutional neural network model (CNN) and a representative U-shaped network model (UNET) with deep features and shallow feature links to perform atmospheric profile retrieval calculations of O3, CO, and CH4. We chose the clear sky data of the Indian and its southern seas in December 2021 and January 2022, with reanalysis data from European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis v4 (EAC4) serving as the reference values. The retrieval outcomes were then compared against advanced numerical forecast models including the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM), Global Forecast System (GFS), and satellite products from an Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI). Experimental results show that the generalization ability and retrieval accuracy of CNN are slightly higher compared with UNET. For O-3 profile retrieval, the mean percentage error (MPE) of the whole layers for CNN and UNET data in relation to ERA5 data was less than 8%, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) was below 1.5 x 10(-7) kg/kg; for CH4 profile retrieval, the MPE of the whole layers for CNN and UNET data in relation to EAC4 data was less than 0.7%, while the RMSE was below 1.5 x 10(-8) kg/kg. The retrieval of O-3 and CH4 are resulted in a significant improvement compared to the forecast data and satellite products in most pressure levels; for CO profile retrieval, the MPE of the whole layers for CNN and UNET data in relation to EAC4 data was less than 11%, while the RMSE was below 4 x 10(-8) kg/kg. The error of the CO retrieval results was higher than that of the forecast data at the pressure level of 200-500 hPa and lower than that of similar satellite products with most pressure levels. The experiments indicated that the neural network method effectively determines the atmospheric gas profiles using infrared hyperspectral data, exhibiting a positive performance in accuracy and retrieval speed.

TI  - BFASTm-L2, an unsupervised LULCC detection based on seasonal change detection-An application to large-scale land acquisitions in Senegal
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of Global Change Research, detection, monitoring and characterization of land use/land cover (LULC) changes are of prime importance. The increasing availability of dense satellite image time series (SITS) has led to a shift in the change detection paradigm, with algorithms able to exploit the full temporal information laid down in SITS. So far, most of these algorithms have focused on the detection of abrupt and gradual changes, and thus developed breakpoint detection based on significant deviations from the mean. However, LULC changes may manifest themselves in other patterns, particularly changes in seasonality (amplitude, number and length of the growing seasons) that are harder to detect. In this paper, we propose a simple method to automatically select the breakpoint linked to the biggest seasonal change in long and dense SITS with multiple breakpoints. This approach - BFASTm-L2 - relies on linking a high-speed algorithm (BFAST monitor) with a time series similarity metric (Euclidian distance L2) sensitive to seasonal changes. The capacity of BFASTm-L2 to identify the date of change in different situations was tested on two data sets, and compared to the performances of three other algorithms (BFAST monitor, BFAST lite, and Edyn). The data sets are 1. a published benchmark data set composed of 25 200 simulated SITS with different change types and change magnitudes, and 2. the 2000-2020 MODIS NDVI SITS over a 200x200 pixels area in Senegal including different study sites which have undergone recent LULC changes due to agricultural large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs) (as reported in the ground field database used in this study). The results show that BFASTm-L2 is efficient in accurately detecting in time most of the changes, and, in contrast with BFAST Lite and BFASTmonitor, to spatially highlight LSLAs-induced changes without the need of any prior knowledge. The automatic proposed approach, faster than BFAST Lite and Edyn, and with very few tuneable parameters, may thus be easily implemented in unsupervised pipelines to map and analyse generic LULC changes at regional scale.

TI  - Exploring the performance of spectral and textural information for leaf area index estimation with homogeneous and heterogeneous surfaces
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the key parameters of vegetation structure, which can be applied in monitoring vegetation growth status. Currently, abundant spatial information (e.g., textural information), provided by the developing remote sensing satellite techniques, could boost the accuracy of LAI estimation. Thus, the performance of spectral and textural information must be evaluated for different vegetation types of LAI estimation in different surface types. In this study, different spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and grey-level co-occurrence matrix-based textural variables under different moving window sizes were extracted from Landsat TM satellite data. First, the ability of different types of SVIs for LAI estimation in different surface types was analysed. Subsequently, the effect of different texture variables with different moving window sizes towards LAI estimation accuracy in different vegetation types was explored. Lastly, the performance of SVIs combined with textural information for the LAI estimation in different vegetation types was evaluated. Results indicated that SVIs performed better for LAI estimation in the homogeneous region than that in the heterogeneous region, and difference vegetation index was more remarkable for LAI estimation in different vegetation types than other SVIs. In addition, variations in texture variables and moving window sizes had a large influence on LAI estimation of natural vegetation with high canopy heterogeneity. SVI combined with textural information can efficiently improve the accuracy of LAI estimation in different vegetation types (R-2 = 0.672, 0.455 and 0.523 for meadow, shrub and cantaloupe, respectively.) compared with SVI alone (R-2 = 0.189, 0.064 and 0.431 for meadow, shrub and cantaloupe, respectively.). Especially for natural vegetation (meadow, shrub), the addition of textural information can greatly improve the accuracy of LAI estimation.

TI  - Segmentation-based linear discriminant analysis with information theoretic feature selection for hyperspectral image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of hyperspectral imaging sensors has greatly improved the classification of remotely sensed data because of the abundant spectral information they offer. However, the numerous contiguous, tiny wavelength bands captured in hyperspectral images (HSIs) often hinder the classification process. To overcome the aforementioned problem, various feature reduction techniques, including feature extraction (FE) and feature selection (FS), are commonly employed to improve classification performance. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a well-established approach that has been utilized for the FE of HSI. LDA's consideration of global characteristics and the variance accumulator for FS can lead to the poor reduction of HIS's intrinsic characteristics. Furthermore, LDA's limited ability to select a very low number of features, i.e. the number of classes minus one, restricts its effectiveness in HSI classification. Therefore, we introduce an FS method based on a non-linear information-theoretic measure, normalized mutual information (nMI) combined with minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). This approach is used to identify inherent features from the transformed space of our proposed correlation-based segmented-LDA (SLDA) and spectral region-based segmented-LDA (SSLDA) FE methods. We thoroughly compare the performance of the SLDA-mRMR and SSLDA-mRMR methods with the existing linear and non-linear state-of-the-art techniques, including unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA), PCA-based methods, supervised LDA, and LDA-based methods. Additionally, we explore the performance of nMI-based mRMR selection with all FE methods by incorporating a cumulative variance-based top features pick-up strategy. Based on the experimental results, we observe that SSLDA-mRMR and SLDA-mRMR achieve the highest classification accuracy, such as 91.91%, and 91.57% for agricultural Indian Pines, respectively, 97.66%, and 97.54%, respectively, for Kennedy Space Center, and 96.69%, and 96.57%, respectively, for Pavia University. In contrast, the classification accuracies using all original features of the HSIs are 71.39%, 70.01%, and 83.52%, respectively. Moreover, our proposed SSLDA-mRMR and SLDA-mRMR combinations outperformed all other FE and FS combinations that were examined using actual HSI datasets.

TI  - An investigation of the reasons behind the biases in the tropical and extratropical atmospheric motion vectors derived from EUMETSAT Low Earth Orbit satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived from Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) images are essential to understand atmospheric dynamics, in particular in polar areas where other types of measurements are scarce. EUMETSAT computes AMVs from several sensors on board LEO satellites, including Metop - Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Sentinel-3 - Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). Wind observations from these sensors have a positive impact on the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems in which they are assimilated, but show strong speed biases when compared to the forecast model, especially in the tropics and the mid-latitude regions. Studies have tried to characterize these biases from a physical perspective and have hypothesized that a wrong height assignment could be responsible for these biases. In this article, we show however that the real culprit is the tracking algorithm. Indeed, our analysis of an SLSTR AMV dataset revealed that an approximation on the guess vector, combined with a lack of robustness of cross-correlation matching, is responsible for the patterns observed on our AMV bias world maps. As a side product of this finding, we elaborate on the necessity to investigate new algorithms to derive AMVs from LEO platforms.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - In the south-west of the Mediterranean, the Jijel coastal waters (JCW) run along the central part of the east coast of Algeria. A useful indicator of the health of coastal waters is the concentration of total suspended matter (TSM). This study intends to investigate how chlorophyll a (Chla) and climatic variables affect TSM variability, to look for possible models that could control this variability, and to find the parameter that most closely correlates with TSM fluctuation in the JCW. This was done by looking at the variability of TSM with reference to Chla, sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation (P) and wind speed (WS). TSM, Chla, SST were derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images downloaded from the oceancolor website for the 2003-2012 period after processing under SeaDAS (Sea Data Analysis System), while P and WS were collected at a weather station for the same period. Whatever the type of variablliy (interannual, monthly, seasonal or spatial), the statistical analysis showed that a positive correlation always occurs between TSM and Chla, which is the most significant among the studied variables. This study suggested that the length of the dry and rainy seasons can be estimated by comparing the monthly variability of the three variables TSM, Chla and P. The spatial and seasonal analysis also showed that TSM and Chla values are higher near the coasts and wadi mouths than offshore and in winter and spring than in summer and autumn.

TI  - Quadruple stacked-based concept: A novel approach for change detection
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing a novel change-detection approach instead classic one is imperative for better assessment of the accuracy of evaluable results. Modern generations of optical satellites, which are characterized by their high to moderate spatial and temporal resolutions enable us to continuously develop the traditional approaches. Suc-cessive changes on land with different scales, and their environmental impact needs more accurate specific approaches, which reduce the noise in the data and increase the precision of the results. Integration between many developed methods may produce a new specific one, which solves this.The present work developed a novel approach based on time series results temporally at a very short time scale "Quadruple-stacked changes concept". The higher weight of change probability indicates a certain change. The advantage of the developed methodology is decreasing the amount of data noise; by using the weight concept of GIS layers. The NDVI "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index" was calculated for each month all over the used two years (2016 and 2021) -using Sentinel-2 imagery data -then were subjected to reclassification and weighted sum to produce the accumulated NDVI. PlanetScope imagery data were used for Quadruple image difference (4 images/2 times). The Threshold of 1/ 3, 1/2 and 1 Standard deviation were tested -this step was essential for mapping the true changes which is considered as one of the inputs of the change detection -The resulted accuracy of the real changed areas detected by the newly developed concept was 0.9662, 0.9602, and 0.9579 respectively to the used SD.

TI  - Evaluation of surface reflectance retrieval over diverse surface types using SREM algorithm in varied aerosol conditions for coarse to medium resolution data from multiple spaceborne sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance (SR) is one of the most important components for deriving different biophysical parameters from remotely sensed data. For accurate retrieval of SR, it is essential to accurately estimate the degree of atmospheric alteration to the target signals reaching at-sensor. Simplified and robust SR estimation method (SREM) is one such approximate estimation method that could demonstrate the retrieval of SR from top-of-atmosphere (ToA) signals, without using any precalculated LUTs or aerosol information. The present study attempts to assess the accuracy of the SREM algorithm over varied Indian land surfaces using data from Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, AWiFS and LISS III. The results indicate that while SREM performs quite well for Sentinel 2 over most land surface types, the performance is good for Landsat 8 as well except over water and in coastal aerosol band. SREM retrievals also show high correlation for AWiFS and LISS III but the estimated values are much lower than level 2 SR due to smaller ToA reflectance values. Furthermore, while aerosol load does impact the performance adversely, it is least impactful for Sentinel 2 and LISS III datasets and most over Landsat 8, particularly over water. Additionally, while AWiFS and LISS III SR retrievals are underestimated at all spectral bands, retrieval is slightly underestimated from green to SWIR band in case of Sentinel 2 and SWIR band in case of Landsat 8. Overall, the findings demonstrate that while SREM will need to be modified to adapt to LISS III and AWiFS retrievals, it can, nevertheless, be readily used as a simplified method for quick and approximate estimation of SR over the Indian region using data from Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2.

M3  - Article
AB  - As more machine learning and deep learning models are applied in studying the quantitative relationship between the climate and terrestrial vegetation growth, the uncertainty of these advanced models requires clarification. Partial dependence plots (PDPs) are one of the most widely used methods to estimate the marginal effect of independent variables on the predicted outcome of a machine learning model, and it is regarded as the main basis for conclusions in relevant research. As more controversies regarding the reliability of the results of the PDPs emerge, the uncertainty of the PDPs remains unclear. In this paper, we experiment with real, remote sensing data to systematically analyze the uncertainty of partial dependence relationships between four climate variables (temperature, rainfall, radiation, and windspeed) and vegetation growth, with one conventional linear model and six machine learning models. We tested the uncertainty of the PDP curves across different machine learning models from three aspects: variation, whole linear trends, and the trait of change points. Results show that the PDP of the dominant climate factor (mean air temperature) and vegetation growth parameter (indicated by the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) has the smallest relative variation and the whole linear trend of the PDP was comparatively stable across the different models. The mean relative variation of change points across the partial dependence curves of the non-dominant climate factors (i.e., radiation, windspeed, and rainfall) and vegetation growth ranged from 8.96% to 23.8%, respectively, which was much higher than those of the dominant climate factor and vegetation growth. Lastly, the model used for creating the PDP, rather than the relative importance of these climate factors, determines the fluctuation of the PDP output of these climate variables and vegetation growth. These findings have significant implications for using remote sensing data and machine learning models to investigate the quantitative relationships between the climate and terrestrial vegetation.

TI  - Validation of FY-4A Temperature Profiles by Radiosonde Observations in Taklimakan Desert in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric temperature profiles (ATPs) retrieved through the geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FY-4A satellite (GIIRS/FY-4A) can effectively fill the gap of the scarce conventional sounding data in the Taklimakan Desert (TD), the second largest desert in the world, with an area of 330,000 square kilometers. In this study, we take the experimental radiosonde observations (RAOB) from one RAOB station in the hinterland of TD and seven conventional radiosondes in the oasis region around the desert as the true values and analyze the bias distribution characteristics of GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs with quality control (QC) flags 0 or 1 for this region. In addition, a bias comparison is made with GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs, and the fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate (ERA5) ATPs. The results show that (1) Missing measurements in GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs are the most frequent in the near-surface layer, accounting for more than 80% of all the retrieved grid points. The averaged total proportion of GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs with QC marks 0 or 1 is about 33.06%. (2) The root mean square error (RMSE) of GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs is less than 3 K, smaller than that of ERA5 ATPs. The RMSE of ERA5 ATPs can exceed 10 K in the desert hinterland. The absolute mean biases of GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs and ERA5 ATPs are, respectively, smaller than 3 K and 2 K, the former being slightly larger. The correlation coefficients of GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs with ERA5 ATPs and RAOB ATPs are higher than 0.98 and 0.99, respectively, and the correlation between GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs and RAOB ATPs is inferior to the latter. (3) The overall atmospheric temperature retrieved by GIIRS/FY-4A is 0.08 K higher than the temperature of RAOB, on average, while the overall temperature from ERA5 is 0.13 K lower than that of RAOB, indicating that the temperature profile obtained by integrating GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs and ERA5 ATPs may be much closer to RAOB ATPs. (4) The probability density of the GIIRS/FY-4A ATP biases in the TD region generally follows the Gaussian distribution so that it can be effectively assimilated in the 3-D variational assimilation modules. The probability density distribution characteristics of the GIIRS/FY-4A ATP biases in the desert hinterland and oasis are not much different. However, due to the fusion analysis of the relatively rich multi-source conventional observation data from the oasis stations, the probability density of ERA5 ATPs biases at the oasis stations is nearer to Gaussian distribution than that of the GIIRS/FY-4A ATPs. In the desert hinterland, where conventional observation is not enough, the probability density distributions of the ATPs biases from ERA5 and GIIRS/FY-4A are alike. Therefore, the GIIRS FY4A can contribute to a more accurate estimation of ERA5 ATPs in the TD region.

TI  - Determining fire frequency and its relationship with rangeland aboveground grass biomass using MODIS and Landsat imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High frequency burned area (BA) images provide an opportunity to monitor rangeland fire frequency (FF). This study related grass aboveground biomass (AGB) to FF in a 4800 ha biodiversity conservation savannah-grassland rangeland. Archived (2000-2021), 500 m resolution MODIS burned area monthly images were used. Following Boolean coding (fire event pixel = 1, no-fire pixel = 0), addition GIS overlay analysis yielded total fires per pixel location. Fire detection accuracy was assessed using 2018-2021 management fire event records. Sample grass AGB data were obtained at the end of the 2020 and 2021 growing seasons from widely dispersed sampling sites with wide grass cover uniformity, where a 1 m quadrat was tossed randomly in a 20 m x 20 m plot up to three times. The quadrat-enclosed grass was harvested to soil level, air-dried, and weighed to generate site average AGB values, which were correlated with vegetation index (VI) values from sampling near-concurrent surface reflectance (L2SP) Landsat-8 OLI images. Four biomass-sensitive VIs utilising Landsat sensor spectral ranges were tested. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) yielded the strongest relationship (r = 0.410, p < 0.01). A linear model predicting grass AGB from EVI values was developed using 58% of sample data for training (R (2) = 0.3062, p < 0.01) and 42% for validation (R (2) = 0.5225, p < 0.001). Using the model, sampling site historical grass AGB values were predicted on same season, L2SP Landsat (TM, ETM+, OLI) images from 2000, 2002, 2006, 2009, 2013 and 2016, whose dates were selected by comparing rainfall. The MODIS images detected 73% of fires larger than 25 ha (one pixel). Most sites experienced long-term AGB gains, at faster rates in high FF (4-5 fires), low grazing sites. Most fires occurred as ecologically undesired late burns, indicating the utility of archived high-frequency BA images for rangeland management

TI  - Combination of optical images and SAR images for detecting landslide scars, using a classification and regression tree
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are some of the most destructive and recurrent natural hazards worldwide. Landslides are triggered by natural phenomena such as extreme rainfall and earthquakes, causing human and economic losses. A rapid response to landslide events is necessary to assess damage mitigation and save lives and property. This study developed a landslide detection model using differential spectral indices and amplitude ratio changes with a classification and regression tree (CART), aiming to detect landslide scars after the occurrence of these events in Asian regions for testing different environment condition. The multi-temporal SAR and optical stack images were pre-processed to reduce speckle noise, seasonal noise, and atmospheric noise. This study explored change detection approaches with a minimum threshold of amplitude ratio change (A(ratio)), using Sentinel-1 images and the relative difference in the normalized difference vegetation index (rdNDVI), differential bare soil index (dBSI), and differential brightness index (dBI) was obtained using Sentinel-2 images. The accuracy of the model was examined by F1-scores. The accuracy of the model for landslide detection was considered moderately good to excellent. As a result of the landslide detection model, amplitude ratio change detection improved the model as revealed by the F1-scores. Moreover, this study found that differential spectral indices could be used to classify the types of landslides (deep-seated and shallow landslides) according to the level of surface changes and texture of the collapsed material after landslide events.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Modelling of Past and Present Shahjahanabad through Multi-Temporal Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural heritage is under tremendous pressure in the rapidly growing and transforming cities of the global south. Historic cities and towns are often faced with the dilemma of having to preserve old monuments while responding to the pressure of adapting itself to a modern lifestyle, which often results in the loss of cultural heritage. Indian cities such as Delhi possess a rich legacy of tangible heritage, traditions, and arts, which are reflected in their present urban form. The creation of temporal 3D models of such cities not only provides a platform with which one can experience the past, but also helps to understand, examine, and improve its present deteriorating state. However, gaining access to historical data to support the development of city-scale 3D models is a challenge. While data gaps can be bridged by combining multiple data sources, this process also presents considerable technical challenges. This paper provides a framework to generate LoD-2 (level-of-detail) 3D models of the present (the 2020s) and the past (the 1970s) of a heritage mosque surrounded by a dense and complex urban settlement in Shahjahanabad (Old Delhi) by combining multiple VHR (very high resolution) satellite images. The images used are those of Pleiades and Worldview-1 and -3 (for the present) and HEXAGON KH-9 declassified spy images (for the past). The chronological steps are used to extract the DSMs and DTMs that provide a base for the 3D models. The models are rendered, and the past and present are visualized using graphics and videos. The results reveal an average increase of 80% in the heights of the built structures around the main monument (mosque), leading to a loss in the visibility of this central mosque.

TI  - 3D thermal mapping of smoldering coal gangue pile fires using airborne thermal infrared data
T2  - CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smoldering coal gangue pile fires pollute the air, soil and groundwater severely. Physical and chemical explosions between water and fiery coal gangue may occur, resulting in a large number of casualties. Recognizing and delineating the scope of coal gangue pile fires is a precondition and top priority for firefighting efforts. The present study employs a 3D thermal imaging methodology based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data. Thermal infrared oblique photogrammetry is used to collect overlap-high thermal infrared images of smoldering fires. A batch preprocessing software is developed to standardize the temperature range, temperature distribution mode and color scale of all thermal infrared images, improving feature point identification accuracy. The elaborate delineation and accurate identification of 3D temperature field are realized by feature point matching and texture mapping. The method was used to build the 3D temperature model and visualize the scope of the coal gangue pile fires in the 1360 bench,

TI  - Research on smoke relative concentration identification method based on Landsat8-OLI multispectral data and multivariate analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The early stages of forest fires are usually accompanied by large amounts of smoke, so smoke identification and concentration inversion can effectively warn and locate the fire point. To achieve smoke identification and concentration inversion, this paper first analysed the spectral differences between smoke and underlying background features based on the samples selected from Landsat 8/OLI fire data of Qiqian forest in Inner Mongolia, China, andNew South Wales, Australia. Then, the sensitive band of smoke identification was screened and the relative smoke concentration indices were established. Finally, a mathematical model between the indices and smoke concentration level was constructed and the best inversion model was established by accuracy test based on samples in each background. The results show that (1) the reflectance increases with increasing smoke concentration in B1-B4 bands under different backgrounds (vegetation, water, bare ground), and the reflectance was significantly different between different concentrations of smoke; (2) the smoke concentration inversion model form is y = kx + b with R-2 > 0.8 (x denotes the smoke concentration level, y denotes the relative smoke concentration index), and the visible brightness index (VBI = B1 + B2 + B3 + B4) was the best relative smoke concentration index under different background; (3) the model's accuracy was tested using each background smoke sample with a known level of smoke concentration, and the inversion accuracy was above 90%. The results show that the VBI can effectively reflect the spectral variation between different smoke concentrations and background features; the variation is closely related to smoke concentration which determines that the mathematical correlation model between VBI and relative smoke concentration can be established; the model is accuracy and can be used for the relative smoke concentration inversion of forest fire cases in different study areas.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variation in atmospheric aerosol properties over Turkiye based on MERRA-2 reanalysis data: aerosol classification based on city type
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to their complex aerosol characteristics, it is crucial to analyze the trends and properties of atmospheric aerosols over the eastern Mediterranean countries. This study comprehensively evaluates Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Angstrom Exponent (AE) trends and aerosol classification over Turkiye, using the MERRA-2 reanalysis data from 1980 to 2019. The spatial distributions of AOD and AE were determined across various temporal scales, including multiannual, 5-year intervals, seasonal, and monthly periods. The analysis of the spatial distribution of AOD values revealed that the mean values in the northwestern areas, ranging from 0.20 to 0.25, were comparatively higher than those observed in the eastern regions, which ranged from 0.10 to 0.15. Between 1980 and 1994, the AOD values gradually increased, followed by a subsequent decline from 1995 to 2019. Based on 5-year intervals between 1980 and 2019, the coastal regions exhibited higher AOD values than the inland areas. Specifically, higher AOD values were noted between May and August, whereas lower values were observed during autumn and winter. Additionally, higher AE values were detected over the northwestern region, while the southeastern region had the lowest AE values, particularly during spring, attributed to the frequent occurrence of dust transport events in this area. The AOD and AE values were also examined in different city types, using the population thresholds of the European Commission. The global city category consisting only of Istanbul showed the highest AOD values across all seasons, while the category of very small cities, which includes 12 cities, had the lowest AOD values. Furthermore, this study investigated the contributions of dominant aerosol categories across various city types based on multiannual and seasonal variations of AOD and AE. The results showed that mixed and continental aerosols had higher portions across all city types. However, biomass burning/industrial and mixed aerosol categories were more prominent in global and large cities. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the atmospheric aerosol properties in Turkiye and can serve as a useful guide for researchers intending to conduct future studies utilizing AOD and AE data obtained through MERRA-2 aerosol diagnosis.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Field-measured spectra are critical for remote sensing physical modelling, retrieval of structural, biophysical, and biochemical parameters, and other practical applications. We present a library of field spectra, which includes (1) portable field spectroradiometer measurements of vegetation, soil, and snow in the full-wave band, (2) multi-angle spectra measurements of desert vegetation, chernozems, and snow with consideration of the anisotropic reflectance of land surface, (3) multi-scale spectra measurements of leaf and canopy of different vegetation cover surfaces, and (4) continuous reflectance spectra time-series data revealing vegetation growth dynamics of maize, rice, wheat, rape, grassland, and so on. To the best of our knowledge, this library is unique in simultaneously providing full-band, multi-angle, multi-scale spectral measurements of the main surface elements of China covering a large spatial extent over a 10-year period. Furthermore, the 101 by 101 satellite pixels of Landsat ETM/OLI and MODIS surface reflectance centered around the field site were extracted, providing a vital linkage between ground measurements and satellite observations. The code language used for this work is Matlab 2016a.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Prior research has shown that user-generated content (UGC) on social media is an important source for consumers seeking information about mental health treatment. The purpose of this study is to explore UGC about prescription drugs for depression as a type of digital 'pharma' folklore. Using qualitative inquiry, the authors analyse 73 user-generated product reviews on YouTube. Findings yield a compelling portrait of people's struggle with mental illness and their treatment journey. Applying folklore as a framework provides a novel strategy for analysing and theorising the cultural worldview of a consumer group. It allows marketers to decipher the knowledge being passed on to others from product review videos and gain a deeper understanding of stories that resonate with consumers seeking treatment with depression drugs.

TI  - Combining Radiative Transfer Model and Regression Algorithms for Estimating Aboveground Biomass of Grassland in West Ujimqin, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland aboveground biomass (AGB) is a crucial indicator when studying the carbon sink of grassland ecosystems. The exploration of the grassland AGB inversion method with viable reproducibility is significant for promoting the practicability and efficiency of grassland quantitative monitoring. Therefore, this study provides a novel retrieval method for grassland AGB by coupling the PROSAIL (PROSPECT + SAIL) model and the random forest (RF) model on the basis of the lookup-table (LUT) method. These sensitive spectral characteristics were optimized to significantly correlate with AGB (ranging from 0.41 to 0.68, p < 0.001). Four methods were coupled with the PROSAIL model to estimate grassland AGB in the West Ujimqin grassland, including the LUT method, partial least square (PLSR), RF and support vector machine (SVM) models. The ill-posed inverse problem of the PROSAIL model was alleviated using the MODIS products-based algorithm. Inversion results using sensitive spectral characteristics showed that the PROSAIL + RF model offered the best performance (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 21.65 g/m(2) and RMESr = 27.62%), followed by the LUT-based method, which was higher than the PROSAIL + PLSR model. Relatively speaking, the PROSAIL + SVM model was more challenging in this study. The proposed method exhibited strong robustness and universality for AGB estimation in large-scale grassland without field measurements.

TI  - Identifying mangroves through knowledge extracted from trained random forest models: An interpretable mangrove mapping approach (IMMA)
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Black-box algorithms are among the dominant mangrove mapping approaches with complex decision-making procedures. Model internals and tacit knowledge were neglected, such as a large number of decision rules provided by random forest (RF) analyses. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has emerged to emphasize the interpretability of an approach. However, current knowledge-based mangrove mapping approaches rely on extensive experiments. Thus, they cannot be easily updated to accommodate new issues, such as prevalent false positives resulting from insufficient consideration of the spectral mixture of vegetation and water in existing studies. To combine the advantages of black-box-based approaches with high update rates and knowledge-based approaches with high interpretability, this study developed a knowledge extraction method by parsing trained RF models, reconstructing decision rules to incorporate the ensemble procedure, and selecting the optimal decision rule as the target. Using this method, an interpretable mangrove mapping approach (IMMA) consisting of five features was constructed, which derived from Sentinel-2 image bands and a digital elevation model: B12 < 0.06 & B8/B2 > 3.50 & elevation < 4.70 & mangrove vegetation index (MVI) > 2.92 & normalized difference index4 (NDI) < 0.07. The study achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 82.3% along the entire coast of China using test samples. Comparatively, it achieved an OA of 78.8% in south Florida, with no training samples for the RF models. The IMMA approach had a limited number of false positives compared with the black-box-based and knowledge-based approaches. By analyzing, we found B12 < 0.06 & B8/B2 > 3.50 & elevation < 4.70 dominated the IMMA to achieve comparable classification results to the existing studies, and B8/B2 > 3.50 was the key to suppressing the false positives resulting from the spectral mixture. The IMMA provided a bridge between training samples and interpretable decision rules, a tool to discover new knowledge, a key to improving fundamental scientific understanding of mangrove mapping, and an alternative to black-box algorithms in the XAI era expandable to various fields.

TI  - Potential toxic effects of titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticles on the biological, biochemical, and histological aspects of the land snail <i>Helix aspersa</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Nanotechnology has come a long way in our lives. However, it maintains some negative effects on the environment. This study aims to use the land snail Helix aspersa as a bioindicator. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO(2)NPs) had been used at 70 and 140 mu g/L for two weeks by the spraying method. The oxidative biomarkers, condition index (CI), DNA damage, hemocyte count, and phagocytic activity were estimated. The toxicity of TiO(2)NPs was determined (LC50 = 544 mu g/L). The exposure to TiO(2)NPs caused a significant reduction of the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in the digestive gland of Helix aspersa (the activity of CAT was 3.4 +/- 0.1 (P = 0.001), SOD was 11 +/- 1 (P = 0.0002) at concentration 140 mu g/L after two weeks). The activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) was (1.13 +/- 0.01 mu/mg protein at 140 mu g/L compared with controls (5.47 +/- 0.01 mu/mg protein). The treatment caused DNA damage in the hemocytes (tail DNA % = 8.66 +/- 0.02 and tail moment = 52.99 +/- 0 at140 mu g/L (P = 0.002)). In the digestive gland, both tail DNA % and tail moment increased (tail moment = 78.38 +/- 0.08 compared with control = 2.29 +/- 0.09 (P = 0.0001)). The total count of hemocytes significantly decreased after two weeks (the average number was 71 +/- 1.5 compared with controls 79 +/- 1.1 at 140 mu g/L). Furthermore, TiO(2)NPs caused histological alterations in the digestive gland of Helix aspersa. It can be concluded that the Helix aspersa can be used as environmental pollution bioindicator. A comprehensive evaluation of toxic effects induced by TiO(2)NPs in vivo assays must be investigated.

TI  - Deep learning-based semantic segmentation of urban-scale 3D meshes in remote sensing: A survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation in 3D meshes is the classification of its constituent element(s) into specific classes or categories. Using the powerful feature extraction abilities of deep neural networks (DNNs), significant results have been obtained in the semantic segmentation of various remotely sensed data formats. With the increased utilization of DNNs to segment remotely sensed data, there have been commensurate in-depth reviews and surveys summarizing the various learning-based techniques and methodologies that entail these methods. However, most of these surveys focused on methods that involve popular data formats like LiDAR point clouds, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, and hyperspectral images (HSI) while 3D meshes hardly received any attention. In this paper, to our best knowledge, we present the first comprehensive and contemporary survey of recent advances in utilizing deep learning techniques for the semantic segmentation of urban-scale 3D meshes. We first describe the different approaches employed by mesh-based learning methods to generalize and implement learning techniques on the mesh surface, and then describe how the element-wise classification tasks are achieved through these methods. We also provide an in-depth discussion and comparative analysis of the surveyed methods followed by a summary of the benchmark large-scale mesh datasets accompanied with the evaluation metrics for assessing the segmentation performance of the methods. Finally, we summarize some of the contemporary problems of the field and provide future research directions that may help researchers in the community.

TI  - Extending polarimetric optimization of multi-temporal InSAR techniques on dual polarized Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The rationale of combining polarimetric SAR data with multi-temporal InSAR techniques, which is based on polarimetric optimization, is to improve their performance in identifying coherent pixels and increasing the accuracy of deformation monitoring. This paper extended the polarimetric optimization of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) techniques on dual-polarized Sentinel-1 data. For this purpose, 20 dual-polarization (VV/VH) SAR images acquired by the Sentinel-1A sensor were used. The results indicated that by applying polarimetric optimization on dual-polarized data in the SBAS technique, the number of candidate and final coherent pixels increased 2.95 and 1.42 times, respectively. Similarly, the number of candidate and final coherent pixels (CP) increased 3.12 and 1.45 times in the PSI technique, respectively. Also, the effect of the polarimetric optimization on increasing the density of coherent points in different regions was investigated. In this framework, Sentinel-2 time-series images were classified into four classes (bare soil, vegetation, build-up, and others) using Google Earth Engine by applying remote sensing indices. This demonstrated that polarimetric optimization of the SBAS technique was more effective in bare soil and vegetated regions than in urban areas. However, polarimetric optimization of the PSI technique was more successful in non-urban regions than in urban areas. An external comparative analysis was also performed between the deformation results derived by PSI and SBAS techniques and GPS observation. The evaluation demonstrated that polarimetric optimization coupled with multi-temporal InSAR analysis yielded more reliable deformation results than conventional single-polarimetric data.(C) 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Scalable approach for high-resolution land cover: a case study in the Mediterranean Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The production of land cover maps is an everyday use of image classification applications on remote sensing. However, managing Earth observation satellite data for a large region of interest is challenging in the task of creating land cover maps. Since satellite imagery is getting more precise and extensive, Big Data techniques are becoming essential to handle the rising quantity of data. Furthermore, given the complexity of managing and analysing the data, defining a methodology that reduces the complexity of the process into different smaller steps is vital to data processing. This paper presents a Big Data methodology for creating land cover maps employing artificial intelligence algorithms. Machine Learning algorithms are contemplated for remote sensing and geodata classification, supported by explainable artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the process considers aspects related to downloading data from different satellites, Copernicus and ASTER, executing the pre-processing and processing of the data in a distributed environment, and depicting the visualisation of the result. The methodology is validated in a test case for er map of the Mediterranean Basin.

TI  - A two-level variational algorithm in the Sobolev-Orlicz space to predict daily surface reflectance at LANDSAT high spatial resolution and MODIS temporal frequency
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a new two-level variational model in Sobolev-Orlicz spaces with non-standard growth conditions of the objective functional and discuss its applications to the spatiotemporal interpolation of multispectral satellite images. At the first level, we deal with the temporal interpolation problem that can be cast as a state constrained optimal control problem for anisotropic convection-diffusion equation, whereas at the second level we solve a constrained minimization problem with a nonstandard growth energy functional that lives in variable Sobolev-Orlicz spaces. The characteristic feature of the proposed model is the fact that the variable exponent, which is associated with nonstandard growth in spatial interpolation problem, is unknown a priori and it depends on the solution of the first-level optimal control problem. It makes this spatiotemporal interpolation problem rather challenging. In view of this, we discuss the consistency of the proposed model, study the existence of optimal solutions, and derive the corresponding optimality systems. In particular, we apply this approach to the well-known prediction problem of the Daily MODIS Surface Reflectance at the Landsat-Like Resolution.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Plural planning theories: cherishing the diversity of planning
T2  - EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial planning faces the brutal plurality of truths, exacerbated by constant crises and long-term transformation. When ideologically weaponized narratives replace 'the truth', planners no longer can validate their inputs into the planning process by referring to an undisputed base of knowledge. We present two approaches to planning theories that help understand why and how planners can address plural rationalities. One approach asserts that polyrationality is inevitable and planners need to listen to other voices, other rationalities. The other approach admonishes planners to choose wisely which worldview, rationality or bias they wish to follow and pursue. Finally, we invite the academic planning community to provide environments that allow for more theory-led debates. The AESOP Thematic Group Planning Theories will continue to provide one such forum.

AB  - Density functional theory calculations of 2D materialsand biologicalmolecules have been used to evaluate disease progression through biosensing.In this case, a glycine molecule in normal and zwitterionic form wasevaluated on its interaction with zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes,graphene sheets, and molybdenum disulfide sheets. Glycine was rotatedin order to interact with the materials at different active sites.Binding and cohesion energies, band gaps, and charge transfer forthe systems were obtained. Binding and cohesion for the interactionbetween normal glycine and 2D materials result in better outcomeswith the presence of a dangling bond using van der Waals correction,giving the more stable results for glycine and carbon nanotubes inthe plane ZY and glycine with graphene in the plane YX, respectively.For zwitterion glycine, binding and cohesion energies are better withouta dangling bond supported on graphene in the plane ZX. Charge transferresults for normal glycine show a better interaction for glycine andmolybdenum disulfide in the plane ZY, while for zwitterion glycine,higher charge transfer is reported in graphene (ZX). Furthermore,the density of states of normal glycine exhibits an improvement inthe band gap for carbon related materials (more semiconductor behavior)and a slight decrease in semiconductor behavior for molybdenum disulfide.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in extramammary paget disease: a systematic review
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is increasingly used to detect subclinical nodal metastases in extramammary Paget disease. We performed a comprehensive systematic review of the literature to further explore the role of sentinel lymph node biopsy in extramammary Paget disease. Five databases were searched for relevant terms. Articles were included if they were in English and presented primary data on at least one patient with extramammary Paget disease who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy in the absence of lymphadenopathy or known metastatic disease. Twenty-eight articles were included, with 366 subjects. Seventy-seven sentinel node biopsies (21.2%) were positive, including 12 in which the primary tumor had microinvasion (15.6%) and 56 with deep invasion (72.7%). Of the positive cases, 11 (14.3%) had no further treatment, 54 (70.1%) underwent nodal dissection, 4 (5.2%) were treated with systemic agents, and 1 (1.3%) had radiation. After a mean follow up of 24 months, 9 subjects with a positive lymph node biopsy experienced nodal recurrence (11.7%), 15 had distant metastases (19.5%), and 13 died of the disease (16.9%). In conclusion, invasive extramammary Paget disease is strongly associated with poor outcomes including nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease specific death. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a useful tool to screen for subclinical nodal metastases in invasive disease, and can be used to help guide clinical management.

TI  - Changes in air pollution, land surface temperature, and urban heat islands during the COVID-19 lockdown in three Chinese urban agglomerations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - COVID-19 has notably impacted the world economy and human activities. However, the strict urban lockdown policies implemented in various countries appear to have positively affected pollution and the thermal environment. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data were selected, combined with Sentinel-5P images and meteorological elements, to analyze the changes and associations among air pollution, LST, and urban heat islands (UHIs) in three urban agglomerations in mainland China during the COVID-19 lockdown. The results showed that during the COVID-19 lockdown period (February 2020), the levels of the AOD and atmospheric pollutants (fine particles (PM2.5), NO2, and CO) significantly decreased. Among them, PM2.5 and NO2 decreased the most in all urban agglomerations, by >14 %. Notably, the continued improvement in air pollution attributed to China's strict control policies could lead to overestimation of the enhanced air quality during the lockdown. The surface temperature in all three urban agglomerations increased by >1 & DEG;C during the lockdown, which was mainly due to climate factors, but we also showed that the lockdown constrained positive LST anomalies. The decrease in the nighttime urban heat island intensity (UHIInight) in the three urban agglomerations was greater than that in the daytime quantity by >25 %. The reduction in surface UHIs at night was mainly due to the reduced human activities and air pollutant emissions. Although strict restrictions on human activities positively affected air pollution and UHIs, these changes were quickly reverted when lockdown policies were relaxed. Moreover, small-scale lockdowns contributed little to environmental improvement. Our results have implications for assessing the environmental benefits of city-scale lockdowns.

TI  - Aboveground biomass estimation in dry forest in northeastern Brazil using metrics extracted from sentinel-2 data: Comparing parametric and non-parametric estimation methods
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Caatinga is a dry forest, which occupies almost one million square kilometers in the Brazilian territory, representing more than 11% of the territory. However because of the extensive areas to be inventoried and the difficulties in collecting data from this natural vegetation using traditional techniques, the operation becomes very costly, often resulting in low sampling intensity owing to cost and time con-straints. Therefore, remote sensing tools have become very useful for minimizing the difficulties caused by traditional methods. Given this context, our study aims to evaluate the performance of spectral and texture variables extracted from an MSI/Sentinel-2 image in the estimation and mapping of AGB in a fragment (natural vegetation area) of Caatinga vegetation in northeastern Brazil. The original reflectance values, the ratio between spectral bands, vegetation indices, texture metrics (extracted from the 3 x 3, 5 x 5, 7 x 7, and 9 x 9 -pixel windows), and fraction images (proportion of the vegetation, soil, and shadow/water components) were associated with AGB. These variables were derived from a forest inventory with systematic sampling composed of 40 plots of 900 m2 each. We evaluated the estimates using a parametric model of multiple linear regression (MLR) and a non-parametric model of an artificial neural network (ANN). The texture metrics (angular second moment, correlation, entropy, and contrast), extracted in a 7 x 7-pixel window, were the best predictors. The parametric model was the most accurate for AGB estimation. The MLR and ANN techniques showed bias valida-tion of 2.58% and 2.79%, and relative root mean square errors of 12.02% and 16.60%, respectively. AGB estimates ranged from 1.49 Mg ha -1 to approximately 73 Mg ha -1 on the MLR and ANN maps. The textural metrics showed the potential to accurately predict AGB, providing valuable information for the use of open access data. Such information is very useful in the management of natural resources in large areas, such as the Caatinga vegetation. The use of optical data for AGB estimation in the region is relatively unexplored and this study contributes to filling that gap or better understand their application for deriving AGB in a dry forest in the semiarid region of Sergipe. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Evaluation of Surgical Aid of Methylene Blue in Addition to Intraoperative Gamma Probe for Sentinel Lymph Node Extirpation in 116 Canine Mast Cell Tumors (2017-2022)
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methylene Blue (MB) is combined with radiopharmaceutical for intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping, but its role during SLN extirpation has not been investigated yet in veterinary medicine. The aim of this study was to assess whether MB increased surgical detection of SLN beyond the use of intraoperative gamma-probe (IGP) alone in clinically node-negative dogs with mast cell tumors (MCTs) following the detection of sentinel lymphocentrums (SLCs) via preoperative planar lymphoscintigraphy. Dogs enrolled underwent MCT excision and SLC exploration guided by both MB and IGP. Data recorded for each SLN were staining (blue/non-blue), radioactivity (hot/non-hot), and histopathological status (HN0-1 vs. HN2-3). A total of 103 dogs bearing 80 cutaneous, 35 subcutaneous, and 1 mucocutaneous MCTs were included; 140 SLCs were explored, for a total of 196 SLNs removed. Associating MB with IGP raised the SLNs detection rate from 90% to 95%. A total of 44% of SLNs were metastatic: 86% were blue/hot, 7% were only blue, 5% were only hot, and 2% were non-blue/non-hot. All HN3 SLNs were hot. Combining MB with IGP can increase the rate of SLN detection in dogs with MCTs; nonetheless, all lymph nodes identified during dissection should be removed, as they might be unstained but metastatic.

TI  - Evaluation of regression models' accuracy for estimating soil heavy metals content from topographic rectified satellite imagery (Case study: Irankouh from Iran)
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the traditional approach is vital in environmental studies, satellite images have recently become one of the main tools for estimating soil pollution due to their advantages. Among sources of soil pollution, heavy metals (HMs) play a crucial role; in this regard, evaluating the soil contamination anomaly is indispensable due to an enormous number of HMs mines and agricultural land irrigation by industrial sewage in developing countries. Therefore, the main goals of this study are: to evaluate Landsat-8 image capability for estimating HMs content (Cr, Cd, Co, and AS) of the soil, performance evaluation of linear and nonlinear regression models, and topographic influence on the estimation accuracy of heavy metals. To do so, we applied multivariate-linear, partial least square, exponential regression, and neural network models to achieve a relation between the HMs content and soil spectral reflectance. Regarding the R2 value of models, the neural network demonstrated a more acceptable performance than other models. The results show that topographic correction improves the accuracy of HMs estimation; for example, the Minnaert model obtained the highest score (equal to 30.02), which is sufficient to support the preceding sentence. Furthermore, the neural network and Minnaert (with a score of 17.56) would produce the best results for estimating HMs content.& COPY; 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Open-source environmental data as an alternative to snail surveys to assess schistosomiasis risk in areas approaching elimination
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAlthough the presence of intermediate snails is a necessary condition for local schistosomiasis transmission to occur, using them as surveillance targets in areas approaching elimination is challenging because the patchy and dynamic quality of snail host habitats makes collecting and testing snails labor-intensive. Meanwhile, geospatial analyses that rely on remotely sensed data are becoming popular tools for identifying environmental conditions that contribute to pathogen emergence and persistence.MethodsIn this study, we assessed whether open-source environmental data can be used to predict the presence of human Schistosoma japonicum infections among households with a similar or improved degree of accuracy compared to prediction models developed using data from comprehensive snail surveys. To do this, we used infection data collected from rural communities in Southwestern China in 2016 to develop and compare the predictive performance of two Random Forest machine learning models: one built using snail survey data, and one using open-source environmental data.ResultsThe environmental data models outperformed the snail data models in predicting household S. japonicum infection with an estimated accuracy and Cohen's kappa value of 0.89 and 0.49, respectively, in the environmental model, compared to an accuracy and kappa of 0.86 and 0.37 for the snail model. The Normalized Difference in Water Index (an indicator of surface water presence) within half to one kilometer of the home and the distance from the home to the nearest road were among the top performing predictors in our final model. Homes were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads, or nearer to waterways.ConclusionOur results suggest that in low-transmission environments, leveraging open-source environmental data can yield more accurate identification of pockets of human infection than using snail surveys. Furthermore, the variable importance measures from our models point to aspects of the local environment that may indicate increased risk of schistosomiasis. For example, households were more likely to have infected residents if they were further from roads or were surrounded by more surface water, highlighting areas to target in future surveillance and control efforts.

TI  - An Investigation of Volcanic Ground Deformation Using InSAR Observations at Tendurek Volcano (Turkey)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although approximately one-tenth of the world's population lives near volcanoes, most of the 1500 active volcanoes are not monitored by ground-based instruments because of the cost and difficulty of access. Since the development of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) in the 1990s, recent advances have allowed the near-real-time detection of surface deformations, one of the earliest markers of volcanic activity. According to the Global Volcanism Program, Turkey's most recent eruption (involving gas and ash) occurred in the Tendurek volcano in 1885. An explosion in the Tendurek volcano, which continues to actively output gas and steam, would be a critical issue for the life and property of the people living nearby. In this context, we processed the Sentinel-1 data collected by the European Space Agency using the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers, and the surface deformations of the Tendurek volcano were investigated. In addition, we applied two different atmospheric correction approaches (linear phase-based tropospheric correction and the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR) to reduce atmospheric effects and found that the linear phase-based tropospheric correction model produced lower standard deviation values. Subsequently, the mean deformation velocity maps, displacement time series, and deformation components in the line-of-sight direction were calculated. The results showed that the most severe subsidence was -11 mm/yr on the upper slopes of the Tendurek volcano. Although the lower slopes of the subsidence region have a lower settlement rate, the subsidence has a peak-caldera-centered location.

TI  - Outcomes for patients with high-risk endometrial cancer undergoing sentinel lymph node assessment versus full lymphadenectomy
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. The objective of this study was to determine the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) among patients with high-risk endometrial cancer (EC) who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) map-ping and dissection compared to patients who underwent pelvic +/- para-aortic lymphadenectomy (LND).Methods. Patients with newly diagnosed high-risk EC were identified. Inclusion criteria included patients who underwent primary surgical management from January 1, 2014 to September 1, 2020 at our institution. Patients were categorized into either the SLN or LND group based on their method of planned lymph node assessment. Patients in the SLN group had dye injected followed by successful bilateral lymph node mapping, retrieval, and processing per our institutional protocol. Clinicopathological and follow-up data were extracted from patient's medical records. The t-test or Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous variables and Chi-squared or Fisher's exact test were used for categorical variables. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the date of initial surgery to the date of progression, death, or last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of surgical staging to the date of death or last follow-up. Three-year PFS and OS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used to compare cohorts. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess the relationship between nodal assessment cohort and OS/PFS while adjusting for age, adjuvant therapy, and surgical approach. A result was considered statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level of significance and all statistical analysis was done using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).Results. Out of 674 patients diagnosed with EC during the study period, 189 were diagnosed with high-risk EC based on our criteria. Forty-six (23.7%) patients underwent SLN assessment and 143 (73.7%) underwent LND. No difference was observed between the two groups in regards to age, histology, stage, body mass index, tumors myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, or peritoneal washing positivity. Patients in the SLN group underwent robotic-assisted procedures more frequently than those in the LND group (p < 0.0001). The three-year PFS rate was 71.1% (95% CI 51.3-84.0%) in the SLN group and 71.3% (95% CI 62.0-78.6%) in the LND group (p = 0.91). The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for recurrence in the SLN versus LND group was 1.11 (95% CI 0.56-2.18; p = 0.77), and after adjusting for age, adjuvant therapy, and surgical approach, the HR for recurrence was 1.04 (95% CI 0.47-2.30, p = 0.91). The three-year OS rate was 81.1% (95% CI 51.1-93.7%) in the SLN group and 95.1% (95% CI 89.4-97.8%) in the LND group (p = 0.009). Although the unadjusted HR for death was 3.74 in the SLN vs LND group (95% CI 1.39-10.09; p = 0.009), when adjusted for age, adjuvant therapy, and surgical approach, it was no longer significant with a HR of 2.90 (95% CI 0.94-8.95, p = 0.06).Conclusions. There was no difference in three-year PFS in patients diagnosed with high-risk EC who under-went SLN evaluation compared to those who underwent full LND in our cohort. The SLN group did experience shorter unadjusted OS; however, when adjusting for age, adjuvant therapy and surgical approach, there was no difference OS in patients who underwent SLN compared to LND.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Resident parasitoids associated with Drosophilidae in Michigan tart cherry orchards and woodland edges
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYMENOPTERA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the distribution and abundance of resident parasitoid species of Drosophila flies consti-tutes an important base for developing and implementing a biological control program for Drosophila suzukii (Matsumura) (Diptera: Drosophilidae), an invasive pest that attacks ripening thin-skinned wild and cultivated berries and stone fruits. For this purpose, a field survey was conducted to identify the parasitoid community associated with D. suzukii infested sites in tart cherry orchards and woodlots in west, northwest, and central Michigan. Sentinel traps baited with D. suzukii larvae and pupae in banana slices were deployed in the center of tart cherry orchards, in woodlots adjacent to tart cherry orchards, and in woodlots isolated from any known commercial host of D. suzukii. Traps were placed from the begin-ning of July to the end of October 2021. Three parasitoid species that are known to use drosophilids as hosts were recovered from these traps. Pachycrepoideus vindemiae (Rondani) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) and Leptopilina boulardi Barbotin, Carton & Keiner-Pillault (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) emerged from the infested bananas. Leptopilina heterotoma (Thomson) was collected as an adult in a sentinel trap. Among these wasps, only P. vindemiae successfully parasitized D. suzukii pupae in the laboratory. This pupal para-sitoid was abundant and widely distributed in both cherry orchards and woodlots. The highest number of P. vindemiae was collected from orchards, followed by woodlots adjacent to orchards, with woodlots without nearby cultivated fruit having the lowest detections. These findings suggest that future release of augmentative or classical biological control agents for D. suzukii could be successful in orchards post-harvest to control late-season populations of this pest.

TI  - Hydrography and deep chlorophyll maximum patterns of the Athos Basin and the Thracian Sea continental shelf (North Aegean Sea) combining glider and satellite observations
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on the North Aegean Sea deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) dynamics, as revealed during the first glider mission over the continental shelf and slope of the Thracian Sea and along the Athos basin, and presents a conceptual model on the response of the DCM in relation to the prevailing stratification/mixing of the water column. Water temperature, conductivity, salinity, chlorophyll-a, CDOM, DO and particle backscatter data (bb700), were recorded during this underwater glider mission in summer 2019. Daily satellite data from Sentinel 3 complemented the glider collected data to validate the satellite-derived estimates of surface Chlorophyll-a levels. The high-resolution physical and chemical observations were analyzed emphasizing on thermal stratification, pycnocline strength, CDOM and dissolved oxygen vertical distribution and the presence of deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). DCM statistical characteristics were derived by fitting a Gaussian model on the chlorophyll-a profiles. The mean DCM was observed at 76 & PLUSMN; 14.5 m depth, located below the euphotic layer, estimated at 64 & PLUSMN; 2.1 m, with the water column dynamics affecting directly its depth, thickness and peak prominence. The satellite-derived chlorophyll-a, integrated within the euphotic layer, was found in fair agreement to the integrated chlorophyll-a values from surface to optical depth recorded by the glider. Chl-a at the DCM were found up to 0.60 mg m- 3, the vertically-integrated pigment content was estimated at 45 & PLUSMN; 14 mg m- 2 and the values of Optical Community Index (OCI) illustrate the dominance of small-sized plankton. The increased variability in the particulate backscattering coefficient bb700 in Thracian Sea shelf and slope deep waters seems related to sediment resuspension. CDOM levels increased from 0.76 ppb at the sea surface to 1.11 ppb at 40 m depth, being positively correlated to Chl-a within the DCM. CDOM concentration increased steadily at intermediate and deeper waters up to 1.34 & PLUSMN; 0.07 ppb. DO profiles revealed the presence of an oxycline in the DCM layer, capable to oxygenate the intermediate and deeper waters (+3 x 10-3 ml/L/m). Bottom DO in Athos basin was measured at 5.0 ml L-1, indicating that the apparent oxygen utilization in Athos Basin is approximately 50 & mu;mol L-1.

TI  - Monitoring ice flow velocity of Petermann glacier combined with Sentinel-1 and-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are commonly used to monitor glacier flow velocity at Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS). However, offset-tracking with SAR imagery in summer usually show poor quality because the rapid ice surface freezing-melting cycles contaminating the surface backscattering characteristic, while optical images are less sensitive to this phenomenon. In this study, we combine Sentinel-1 and-2 images to create the glacier velocity time series for the Petermann glacier, located in the northern GrIS. Firstly, the offset-tracking technique is employed to acquire the initial deformation fields with SAR and optical sensors separately, each SAR and/or optical acquisition is tracked with its closest next three acquisitions. Next, after removing the bad matchings, the least squares method based on connected components is employed to calculate the time series of glacier velocity for Sentinel-1 and-2, separately. Finally, these two kinds of derived time series are integrated with a weighted least squares method, where weights are evaluated according to the estimated RMSEs in the last step. Error propagation analysis suggests RMSEs of the single pair of Sentinel-1 and-2 images offset-tracking are -0.22 m and -2.5 m for Petermann glaciers. Standard deviation of the difference between Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 measured velocity are -0.25 m/day. Compared with 6-day velocity fields product, NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Center)-0766, which is only derived with Sentinel-1observations, our results show good agreement and less defects in summer. The differences are -0.20 m/day in non-melting seasons and -0.34 m/day in summer. Longitudinal velocity differences growing in 2019 and 2020 at -20 Km up to the terminus are con-sistency with the crevasse expansion, indicating another calving event is approaching. This research finds that the fusion of Sentinel-1 and-2 offset-tracking results improves the completeness of the ice movement time series for polar glaciers.

TI  - GIS-based analysis of landslides susceptibility mapping: a case study of Lushoto district, north-eastern Tanzania
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Landslides are becoming increasingly widespread, claiming tens of thousands of fatalities, hundreds of thousands of injuries, and billions of dollars in economic losses each year. Thus, studies for geographically locating landslides, vulnerable areas have been increasingly relevant in recent decades. This research is aimed at integrating Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS) techniques to delineate landslides susceptibility areas of Lushoto district, Tanzania. RS assisted in providing remote datasets including; Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), Landsat 8 OLI imageries, and past spatially distributed landslides coordinate with the use of a handheld Global Position System (GPS) receiver, while various GIS analysis techniques were used in the preparation and analysis of landslides influencing factors hence, generating landslides susceptibility areas index values. However, rainfall, slope angle, elevation, soil type, lithology, proximity to roads, rivers, faults, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) factors were found to have a direct influence on the occurrence of landslides in the study area. These factors were evaluated, weighted, and ranked using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique in which a 0.086 (8.6%) Consistency Ratio (CR) was attained (highly accepted). Findings reveal that rainfall (29.97%), slopes' angle (21.72%), elevation (15.68%), and soil types (11.77%) were found to have high influence on the occurrence of landslides, while proximity to faults (8.35%), lithology (4.94%), proximity to roads (3.41%), rivers (2.48%), and NDVI (1.69%) had very low influences, respectively. The overall results, obtained through Weighted Linear Combination (WLC) analysis techniques indicate that about 97669.65 Hectares (ha) of land are under very low levels of landslides susceptibility, which accounts for 24.03% of the total study area. Low susceptibility levels had 123105.84 ha (30.28%), moderate landslides susceptibility areas were found to have 140264.79 ha (34.50%), while high and very high susceptibility areas were found to cover about 45423.43 ha (11.17%) and 57.78 ha (0.01%), respectively. Furthermore, 81% overall model accuracy was obtained as computed from the Area Under the Curve (AUC) using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

TI  - Considerations for environmental biogeochemistry and food security for aquaculture around Lake Victoria, Kenya
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL GEOCHEMISTRY AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of population expansion through economic growth and development has been identified as one of the key drivers of both water and sediment contamination from potentially harmful elements (PHEs). This presents a major hazard not only to aquatic ecosystems but local riparian communities and beyond who rely heavily on this natural resource for drinking water and fish-a valuable source of dietary micronutrients and protein. The present study measured biogeochemical concentration of PHEs in water, sediment and fish from locations pooled into four zones within Winam Gulf and Lake Victoria area of Kenya. Captured fish were used as a sentinel receptor of lake health to evaluate potential risks to fisheries and aquaculture food security. In water, concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and lead (Pb) were observed above the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) maximum contamination level drinking water guidelines (MCL), with aluminium (Al) observed above the Aquatic Life Criteria in all four zones. Similarly, sediment concentrations in all four zones exceeded the US EPA Effects range low (ERL) threshold guidelines for Cu, nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn) and Pb, with Cu, Zn and Pb classed at moderate contamination levels using the contamination factor. Fish tissue concentrations from the four zones were calculated using recommended daily intakes (RDI) and for PHEs as provisional maximum tolerable intakes (PMTIs) and indicated most macro- and micronutrients were at or below 10% RDI from aquaculture and wild fish, with Se indicating a greater RDI (16-29%) in all the zones. Contributions of PHEs to PMTIs were below threshold guidelines for both aquaculture and wild fish with only Cd, Cr and Pb levels being above the PMTI thresholds. There is a need to assess the long-term effects of persistent anthropogenic PHE input into Winam Gulf and the wider Lake Victoria basin. Continued monitoring of PHEs using both historical and more recent data will enable future management policies to be implemented through improved mitigation strategies to reduce their impact on water quality, fish health and subsequent human health.

TI  - Analysis of the impact of green urban areas in historic fortified cities using Landsat historical series and Normalized Difference Indices
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green areas minimize the negative effects of climatic change and improve the sustainability of historic cities. Despite this, green areas have traditionally been considered a threat to heritage buildings because they cause humidity changes, that accelerate degradation processes. Within this context, this study evaluates the trends in the inclusion of green areas in historic cities and the effects it causes on humidity and conservation of earthen fortifications. To achieve this goal, vegetative and humidity information has been obtained since 1985 from Landsat satellite images. The historical series of images has been statistically analysed in Google Earth Engine to obtain maps that show the means, 25th, and 75th percentiles of the variations registered in the last 35 years. The results allow visualizing spatial patterns and plotting the seasonal and monthly variations. In the decision-making process, the proposed method allows to monitor whether the presence of vegetation is an environmental degradation agent in the nearby earthen fortifications.The analysis of the historic fortified cities of Seville and Niebla (Spain) shows a gradual increase in green areas and an interest in locating them near the earthen fortifications. The impact on the fortifications is specific to each type of vegetation and can be positive or negative. In general, the low humidity registered indicates low danger, and the presence of green areas favours drying after heavy rains. This study suggests that increasing green spaces to historic cities does not necessarily endanger the preservation of earthen fortifications. Instead, managing both heritage sites and urban green areas together can encourage outdoor cultural activities, reduce the impacts of climate change, and enhance the sustainability of historic cities.

TI  - A Multi-Variable Sentinel-2 Random Forest Machine Learning Model Approach to Predicting Perennial Ryegrass Biomass in Commercial Dairy Farms in Southeast Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most valuable and nutritionally essential agricultural commodities worldwide is milk. The European Union and New Zealand are the second- and third-largest exporting regions of milk products and rely heavily on pasture-based production systems. They are comparable to the Australian systems investigated in this study. With projections of herd decline, increased milk yield must be obtained from a combination of animal genetics and feed efficiencies. Accurate pasture biomass estimation across all seasons will improve feed efficiency and increase the productivity of dairy farms; however, the existing time-consuming and manual methods of pasture measurement limit improvements to utilisation. In this study, Sentinel-2 (S2) band and spectral index (SI) information were coupled with the broad season and management-derived datasets using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning (ML) framework to develop a perennial ryegrass (PRG) biomass prediction model accurate to +/-500 kg DM/ha, and that could predict pasture yield above 3000 kg DM/ha. Measurements of PRG biomass were taken from 11 working dairy farms across southeastern Australia over 2019-2021. Of the 68 possible variables investigated, multiple simulations identified 12 S2 bands and 9 SI, management and season as the most important variables, where Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands were the most influential in predicting pasture biomass above 4000 kg DM/ha. Conditional Latin Hypercube Sampling (cLHS) was used to split the dataset into 80% and 20% for model calibration and internal validation in addition to an entirely independent validation dataset. The combined internal model validation showed R-2 = 0.90, LCCC = 0.72, RMSE = 439.49 kg DM/ha, NRMSE = 15.08, and the combined independent validation had R-2 = 0.88, LCCC = 0.68, RMSE = 457.05 kg DM/ha, NRMSE = 19.83. The key findings of this study indicated that the data obtained from the S2 bands and SI were appropriate for making accurate estimations of PRG biomass. Furthermore, including SWIR bands significantly improved the model. Finally, by utilising an RF ML model, a single 'global' model can automate PRG biomass prediction with high accuracy across extensive regions of all seasons and types of farm management.

TI  - A general and extensible framework for assessing change detection techniques
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection techniques play an essential role in Remote Sensing applications, such as environmental monitoring, governmental planning, and studies of areas affected by natural disasters. This fact makes the development of more accurate change detection techniques a constant challenge. However, the lack of public benchmarks available to analyze and compare the performance of change detection techniques hampers quantitative comparisons. In light of this reality, this study proposes and formalizes a novel framework for imagery dataset simulation. In contrast with other image simulation methods, images synthesized by the proposed method are explicitly designed to assess and compare change detection methods. The framework is extensible and general allowing, in particular, the use of both supervised and unsupervised change detection methods. As an application, we compare the performance of well-known algorithms to data sets that mimic what the Landsat 5 TM sensor observed over a forest area subjected to deforestation for agricultural purposes. The results support discussing the performance of methods and show the usefulness of the proposed framework. We provide the source codes in a public repository.

AB  - It is necessary to evaluate the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation dynamics. The purpose of this study is to assess the linkage of vegetation cover and climate fluctuations and distinguish the contribution of climate fluctuations and human activities on vegetation and its vulnerability in Namak Lake basin, Iran. For this purpose, changes in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in association with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) were analyzed. The roles of climate fluctuations and human activities on vegetation vulnerability were then assessed in various land use land cover (LULC) classes using the residual analysis and probability of vegetation vulnerability index (PVVI). The EVI and land surface temperature (LST) maps for the period 2001-2019 were obtained from MOD13A2 and MOD11A2 products of MODIS, respectively. The results indicated that vegetation cover was mainly dependent on short-term climatic changes and their correlation decreased with increasing time scale of SPEI. It reflected that short-term water availability was vital for vegetation growth. Also, the sparse vegetation cover was mainly more vulnerable to climate fluctuations. Residual analysis showed that the vegetation dynamics was intensively attributed to the climate fluctuations, so that climate fluctuations affected vegetation cover in 78.94% of the basin, while 15.58% was affected by human activities and 5.48% was affected by both factors. The value of PVVI in the regions affected by climatic change was the highest (55.99); in the regions affected by human activities, it was lower (50.40); and in the regions affected by both factors, it was between the other two numbers (50.94). Therefore, climate fluctuations and human activities were both driving factors affecting vegetation covers over time in Namak Lake basin.

TI  - Using a Web Map Service to map Little Ice Age glacier extents at regional scales
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Extending the record of glacier area changes into the past improves our understanding of climate change impacts. Although analogue maps showing historic glacier extents are abundant, digital outlines from before the satellite era are sparse as the digitisation of moraines and trimlines on freely available satellite images is challenging. With the now available very high-resolution images provided by Web Map Services (WMS), new doors are open for the precise digitisation. Here, we used the ESRI WMS to digitise Little Ice Age (LIA) glacier extents and present area changes since the LIA in four selected regions along with a detailed uncertainty analysis. We used modern glacier outlines as a starting point and additionally consulted Sentinel-2 images, the ArcticDEM and historic maps for interpretation. Dating records from the literature allowed calculating area change rates. In total, 493 LIA glaciers (4640 km(2), now 891 ice bodies with 3590 km(2)) were digitised, yielding relative area changes of -20% (-0.14% a(-1)), -15% (-0.10% a(-1)), -26% (-0.16% a(-1)) and -61% (-0.19% a(-1)) for Alaska, Baffin Island, Novaya Zemlya and the tropics, respectively. The ESRI WMS images are a great asset to precisely map moraines and trimlines, but information about the timing of the related extents requires further sources.

TI  - Understanding the Rhodopsin Worldview Through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): Structure, Stability, and Activity Studies
T2  - CHEMICAL RECORD
M3  - Review
AB  - Rhodopsin is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) present in the rod outer segment (ROS) of photoreceptor cells that initiates the phototransduction cascade required for scotopic vision. Due to the remarkable advancements in technological tools, the chemistry of rhodopsin has begun to unravel especially over the past few decades, but mostly at the ensemble scale. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a tool capable of providing critical information from a single-molecule point of view. In this regard, to bolster our understanding of rhodopsin at the nanoscale level, AFM-based imaging, force spectroscopy, and nano-indentation techniques were employed on ROS disc membranes containing rhodopsin, isolated from vertebrate species both in normal and diseased states. These AFM studies on samples from native retinal tissue have provided fundamental insights into the structure and function of rhodopsin under normal and dysfunctional states. We review here the findings from these AFM studies that provide important insights on the supramolecular organization of rhodopsin within the membrane and factors that contribute to this organization, the molecular interactions stabilizing the structure of the receptor and factors that can modify those interactions, and the mechanism underlying constitutive activity in the receptor that can cause disease.

TI  - Integrating Moral Personhood and Moral Management: A Confucian Approach to Ethical Leadership
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This article clarifies the relationship between moral personhood and moral management in ethical leadership from a Confucian perspective. Drawing from four Confucian classics, this study integrates the leader's ethical values and activities undertaken to promote virtues in followers. The harmonisation of moral personhood and moral management is facilitated by two cardinal Confucian beliefs: innate human nature and moral self-cultivation. From a Confucian viewpoint, all human beings are endowed with a good nature that enables them to become virtuous persons and leaders. Ethical leaders subdue their selfish desires and extend their natural moral feelings of true goodness, righteousness, propriety and wisdom to others. Moral personhood and moral management are inseparable because to cultivate oneself morally is to help others to become moral persons. By synthesising moral personhood and moral management, a Confucian worldview of ethical leadership contributes to leadership studies in two main ways: safeguarding against the leader's abuse of power, and advancing organisational change through path-shaping.

T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL-CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Juvenile onset of extensive atrial electromechanical failure, including atrial standstill, is a rare disease entity that may precede ventricular cardiomyopathy. Genetic variants associated with early-onset atrioventricular (AV) cardiomyopathy are increasingly recognized.Case summary A 16-year-old patient presented with atrial brady- and tachyarrhythmias and concomitant impaired atrial electromechanical function (atrial standstill). The atrial phenotype preceded the development of a predominantly right-sided AV dilated cardiomyopathy with pronounced myocardial fibrosis. A His-bundle pacemaker was installed for high-degree AV conduction block and sinus arrest. Using familial-based whole-exome sequencing, a missense mutation and a copy number variant deletion (compound heterozygosity) of the TAF1A gene (involved in ribosomal RNA synthesis) were identified.Discussion Juvenile onset of severe atrial electromechanical failure with atrial arrhythmias should prompt deep pheno- and genotyping and calls for vigilance for downstream cardiomyopathic deterioration.

TI  - Gangotri glacier dynamics from multi-sensor SAR and optical data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study has analyzed dynamics of Gangotri glacier using multiple remote sensing (RS) datasets and ground based obser-vations. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data pairs from European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS 1/2) tandem pair for spring of 1996, Sentinel-1 SAR pairs and Japanese's Advance Land Observation System (ALOS) PALSAR-2 SAR data for Spring of 2015 were used to derive glacier-surface velocity at seasonal time scale using Differential InSAR (DInSAR) techniques. Bi-static TanDEM-X (Experimental) data was used for the 1st time to estimate glacier surface elevation changes for a period of 22, 44, 88 days during summer of 2012 using InSAR techniques in this study. Annual glacier velocity was also estimated using temporal panchromatic data of LANDSAT-5 (30 m), LANDSAT-7/8 (15 m), Sentinel-2 (10 m) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite IRS-1C/1D panchromatic (5 m) data during 1998-2019 with feature tracking approach. This study has estimated glacier surface velocity and surface elevation changes for the major parts of Gangotri glacier and its tributary glaciers using medium to high resolution optical and SAR datasets, at annual and seasonal time scale, which is an improvement over earlier studies, wherein snout based glacier recession or only main gla-cier velocities were reported. The velocity and slope were used to assess glacier-ice thickness distribution using Glabtop-2, slope depen-dent and laminar flow based methods over the Gangotri group of glaciers. The estimated ice thickness was estimated in the range of 58- 550 m for the complete glacier while few small areas in middle & upper regions carry higher thickness of about 607 m. The estimated glacier-ice thickness was found in the range of 58-67 m at the snout region. The estimation was validated using 2014 field measurements from Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) for the first time and correlation was found to be 0.799 at snout of the glacier.& COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Prediction of Land Surface Temperature Considering Future Land Use Change Effects under Climate Change Scenarios in Nanjing City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) changes resulting from rapid urbanization are the foremost causes of increases in land surface temperature (LST) in urban areas. Exploring the impact of LULC changes on the spatiotemporal patterns of LST under future climate change scenarios is critical for sustainable urban development. This study aimed to project the LST of Nanjing for 2025 and 2030 under different climate change scenarios using simulated LULC and land coverage indicators. Thermal infrared data from Landsat images were used to derive spatiotemporal patterns of LST in Nanjing from 1990 to 2020. The patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model was applied to simulate the LULC of Nanjing for 2025 and 2030 using historical LULC data and spatial driving factors. We simulated the corresponding land coverage indicators using simulated LULC data. We then generated LSTs for 2025 and 2030 under different climate change scenarios by applying regression relationships between LST and land coverage indicators. The results show that the LST of Nanjing has been increasing since 1990, with the mean LST increased from 23.44 ? in 1990 to 25.40 ? in 2020, and the mean LST estimated to reach 26.73 ? in 2030 (SSP585 scenario, integrated scenario of SSP5 and RCP5.8). There were significant differences in the LST under different climate scenarios, with increases in LST gradually decreasing under the SSP126 scenario (integrated scenario of SSP1 and RCP2.6). LST growth was similar to the historical trend under the SSP245 scenario (integrated scenario of SSP2 and RCP4.5), and an extreme increase in LST was observed under the SSP585 scenario. Our results suggest that the increase in impervious surface area is the main reason for the LST increase and urban heat island (UHI) effect. Overall, we proposed a method to project future LST considering land use change effects and provide reasonable LST scenarios for Nanjing, which may be useful for mitigating the UHI effect.

TI  - Coseismic deformation and stress triggering of the 2021 MS6.4 Yangbi earthquake inverted from integrating GNSS and InSAR displacement fields
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 May 2021, the MS6.4 Yangbi earthquake occurred at the Tibetan Plateau's southeastern margin along the Weixi-Qiaohou-Weishan fault. We obtained the fine coseismic deformation fields by integrating 37 near-field GNSS observations and Sentinel-1 InSAR observations of the ascending and descending orbits. Considering that the earthquake did not rupture to the surface, the existing earth fault data is difficult to effectively constrain the deep underground fault. We used aftershock precision location data to constrain fault strike, dip angle, and depth, effectively integrate GNSS and InSAR data, and obtained the fault model closest to the real fault. Based on the coseismic slip distribution model, we calculated the Coulomb stress generated from the earthquake and discussed the triggering rela-tionship between the change of coseismic Coulomb stress and the aftershock distribution. The results show that the maximum rupture occurred at the southeast side of the epicenter and the overall unilateral rupture characteristic. We calculated the stress change when the Yangbi earthquake ruptured, significantly reducing the stress difference between the fault and the surrounding area, which has a signif-icant unloading effect on the surrounding faults and reduces the seismic risk of the surrounding faults. & COPY; 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - New Zealand patients have a higher melanoma burden in sentinel nodes and completion lymphadenectomy than patients in MSLT-II
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - New Zealand has the highest rate of melanoma-related mortality in the world. Access to immunotherapy and radiology is limited and surgical treatment of regional disease remains important. A recent pilot study of a single health district observed a higher nodal melanoma burden than was reported in the second Multicentre Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial (MSLT-II). In this study, a series of regional censuses were undertaken covering the 10 years immediately prior to the publication of MSLT-II. The study population was seven District Health Boards covering 62.2% of the population of New Zealand across a 10-year period preceding MSLT-II. The primary outcomes measured were the size of sentinel lymph node metastases and non-sentinel node (NSN) positivity on completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for patients with a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). In the 2323 SLNB identified, the mean sentinel lymph node metastatic deposit size was larger compared to MSLT-II (2.55 vs. 1.07/ 1.11 mm). A greater proportion of New Zealand patients (44.2%) had metastatic deposits larger than 1 mm compared to MSLT-II (33.2/34.5%) and the rate of non-sentinel node involvement on CLND was also higher (22.2% vs. 11.5%). These findings indicate that New Zealand is a high-risk population for nodal melanoma metastases. Due to these differences, the conclusions of MSLT- II may not be able to be applied to melanoma patients in the 7 regions studied in New Zealand.& REG; 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Dense flux observations reveal the incapability of evapotranspiration products to capture the heterogeneity of evapotranspiration
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) estimation over complex surfaces with spatial heterogeneity is crucial for local, regional, and global applications. Currently, a variety of global ET products with different spatiotemporal resolutions have been developed and evaluated. However, little is known about their perfor-mance in capturing the heterogeneity of ET over complex surfaces. Focusing on the Heihe River Basin (HRB), a typical arid and semi-arid region that is hydrologically vulnerable, this study compared ET from eleven global ET products (six remotely-sensed ET, two land surface model ET, one hydrological model-based ET, one reanalysis ET, and one synthesis ET) and one regional ET dataset against dense eddy covariance observations in terms of the magnitude, seasonal cycle, and spatial pattern. In general, the remotely-sensed ET and synthesis ET out-performed other categories, with the operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), Penman-Mon-teith-Leuning (PML), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MOD16) and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) performing relatively better (root mean square error ranging from 1.22 to 1.57 mm d-1). Across all the land cover types, ET products reproduced a relatively feasible ET over the desert steppe, meadow, and barren, but substantially underestimated ET over ecosystems with high ET values but a low land area fraction over HRB (cropland, wetland, and forest). This highlights the importance of accurately representing the het-erogeneity and local climates in the complex land surfaces for ET quantification in regional water resource management.

AB  - Civic course is an important guarantee for college students to form a correct outlook on life, values and worldview, and the construction of college students' civic course is one of the key tasks in the construction of college curriculum system, so the analysis of the influencing factors on its development becomes an inherent requirement for the reform of college civic course. Based on the ISO (International Standardization Organization) model and the gradient theory, this paper applies the neural network method to combine the associative memory model with the fuzzy comprehensive judgment to make a comprehensive analysis of several influencing factors that affect the development of college students' thinking and political education and propose an effective evaluation method. The case study shows that the proposed evaluation method based on the ISO model not only promotes the smooth development of college students' civic course, but also provides some reference for the teaching diagnosis and improvement of college civic courses, which has an important role and significance.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Soil Total Nitrogen Content Using Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil total nitrogen (STN) is a crucial component of the ecosystem's nitrogen pool, and accurate prediction of STN content is essential for understanding global nitrogen cycling processes. This study utilized the measured STN content of 126 sample points and 40 extracted remote sensing variables to predict the STN content and map its spatial distribution in the northeastern coastal region of Hebei Province, China, employing the random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) methods. The purpose was to compare the ability of remote sensing images (Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2) with different machine learning methods for predicting STN content. The research results show the following: (1) The three machine learning methods accurately predicted the STN content and the optimal model provided by the XGBoost method, with an R-2 of 0.627, RMSE of 0.127 g.kg(-1), and MAE of 0.092 g.kg(-1). (2) The combination of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images improved prediction accuracy, with the R-2 improving by 45.5%. (3) The importance of optical images is higher than that of SAR images in the RF, GBM, and XGBoost methods, with optical images accounting for 87%, 76%, and 77% importance, respectively. (4) The spatial distribution of STN content predicted by the three methods is similar. Higher STN contents are distributed in the northern part of the study area, while lower STN contents are distributed in coastal areas. The results of this study can be very useful for inventories of soil nitrogen and provide data support and method references for revealing nitrogen cycling.

TI  - Recurrent Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) of the Forearm: A Case Report.
T2  - Cureus
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - We describe a case of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in a 36-year-old lady. She had a history of recurrent BCC in the ventral aspect of her right forearm. She presented to our hospital with her third recurrence of skin lesions in the same location. Histopathological examination of the skin revealed the features of BCC with evidence of perineural invasion (PNI). She underwent a margin-free, wide local excision, vacuum-assisted closure of the wound, and reconstructive surgery using a skin graft. She also underwent a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), which was negative for the tumor. Then she was referred for radiotherapy. Although the patient underwent a free-margin excision in the previous episodes, she came back years later with a recurrent lesion. It is considered that basal cell carcinomas larger than 3 cm in size with perineural invasion evidence on histopathological examination and with deep tissue involvement have a bad prognosis compared with the smaller superficial lesions. Thus, based on the findings in our case and the previously reported cases, careful follow-up is recommended for patients with BCC with bad prognostic factors. In certain high-risk cases, SLNB should be considered to rule out occult metastasis.

TI  - Frequency of axillary nodal complete pathological response of breast cancer patients in neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting: A cross-sectional study
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Pathological complete response (pCR) occurs in about 20-30% of patients undergoing systemic neoadjuvant therapy. This leads to the idea of sparing the patient the morbidity associated with axillary surgery."Wait and watch" policy for cancers which achieve complete pathological response on neoadjuvant systemic therapy is a well-established practice in various cancers like the esophagus, rectum and larynx. This has led to organ preservation protocols being practiced worldwide for these cancers without affecting the overall survival of the patient. We believe patients undergoing a complete pathological response in the breast may be spared axillary surgery. Axillary surgery leads to morbidity and extra financial burden with no added advantage in survival.Material and Methods: A total of 326 patients with breast cancer who had received neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy from 2015 to 2020 were included in our retrospective study. Final histopathology of the breast and axillary surgery was noted to report the frequency of complete pathological response. The frequency of positive nodal disease with respect to stage, grade and type of cancer was measured.Results: Among 326 patients, our study showed that 53% of patients with complete pathological response in breast also had complete response in the axilla compared to 43% with incomplete pathological response. No significant difference was found for age, menopausal status, initial tumor size when patients with complete pathological response were compared to non or partial responders. The rate of complete pathological response was higher in patients with clinically node negative patients after NACT, hormone negative, HER2 positive and triple negative population.Conclusion: Our results indicated that 53% of the patients who developed complete pathological response in the breast underwent needless axillary procedure. Axillary surgery can be staged after the breast surgery if residual tumor is present on the histopathological specimen. In case of pCR, omission of axillary surgery can be considered. However, a larger population, multi-centric studies are needed for treatment guidelines.

TI  - The combined impact of shallow groundwater and soil salinity on evapotranspiration using remote sensing in an agricultural alluvial setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The Nile Delta, EgyptStudy focus: Shallow groundwater (GW) and soil salinity are major issues for irrigated agriculture, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions, but more research is needed to link both issues with evapotranspiration. Satellite-based evapotranspiration from Landsat images (ETLS) has the potential to be an efficient method of estimating evapotranspiration (ET), which can integrate ETLS with groundwater and soil salinity, particularly in data-scarce areas. This study examines shallow GW and soil salinity effects on crop water use in the North Nile Delta during the summer season of 2017 and winter season of 2017/2018.New hydrological insights for the region: The ETLS was moderately affected by groundwater depth (GWD), decreasing from 4.3 to 4.0 mm day 1 when GWD was reduced from 75 to 120 cm, then increasing to 4.4 mm day 1 when GWD was increased to 140 cm. The study also highlighted a significant negative correlation between ETgw and GWD; which increased with shallower GW (>75 cm) and then decreased with deeper GW. The shallower the GW, the greater the contribution to crop water requirements, with GW contributing 1.6 and 1.7 mm day 1 for seed melon and cotton, respectively, while GW contributed 0.9 mm day 1 for sugar beet and 1.3 mm day 1 for wheat and clover. The study's findings highlight the importance of remote sensing and GIS techniques for quickly and cheaply assessing the impact of shallow GW and soil salinity on evapotranspiration over large geographic areas.

TI  - Predicting Dynamics of Soil Salinity and Sodicity Using Remote Sensing Techniques: A Landscape-Scale Assessment in the Northeastern Egypt
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional mapping of salt affected soils (SAS) is very costly and cannot precisely depict the space-time dynamics of soil salts over landscapes. Therefore, we tested the capacity of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data to retrieve soil salinity and sodicity during the wet and dry seasons in an arid landscape. Seventy geo-referenced soil samples (0-30 cm) were collected during March (wet period) and September to be analyzed for pH, electrical conductivity (EC), and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). Using 70% of soil and band reflectance data, stepwise linear regression models were constructed to estimate soil pH, EC, and ESP. The models were validated using the remaining 30% in terms of the determination coefficient (R-2) and residual prediction deviation (RPD). Results revealed the weak variability of soil pH, while EC and ESP had large variabilities. The three indicators (pH, EC, and ESP) increased from the wet to dry period. During the two seasons, the OLI bands had weak associations with soil pH, while the near-infrared (NIR) band could effectively discriminate soil salinity and sodicity levels. The EC and ESP predictive models in the wet period were developed with the NIR band, achieving adequate outcomes (an R-2 of 0.65 and 0.61 and an RPD of 1.44 and 1.43, respectively). In the dry period, the best-fitted models were constructed with deep blue and NIR bands, yielding an R-2 of 0.59 and 0.60 and an RPD of 1.49 and 1.50, respectively. The SAS covered 50% of the study area during the wet period, of which 14 and 36% were saline and saline-sodic soils, respectively. The extent increased up to 59% during the dry period, including saline soils (12%) and saline-sodic soils (47%). Our findings would facilitate precise, rapid, and cost-effective monitoring of soil salinity and sodicity over large areas.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Change Detection Analysis of Land Use Land Cover of Bathinda District, Punjab, India
T2  - Biosciences Biotechnology Research Asia
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid industrialization and urban sprawl in the last few decades, the land use pattern and its consumption takes place at a large scale that could lead to problems such as over-exploitation of land resources, food insecurity and pollution. It becomes imperative to carry out monitoring and subsequent modelling of land use land cover (LULC) changes. An attempt was made to study the changes in the LULC pattern of district of Bathinda, Punjab, India. Remote sensing (RS) and geographical information system (GIS) were used to perform the analysis of satellite data using image processing and classification procedures. For preparing LULC maps, supervised classification was carried out using maximum likelihood classification (MLC) algorithm, aided with Earth Resources Data Analysis System (ERDAS) Imagine 2014 and ArcGIS 10.3 software. Further, change detection study was done using multi-temporal Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor-III (LISS-III) data sets of the year 2006 and 2018 to analyze the temporal changes. It was observed that the region is occupied by various ground features such as water, built-up area, agricultural land, vegetation/trees and fallow land. The results revealed that the area under water bodies have increased by 0.413km2 in 2018. The built-up areas including human settlements, commercial infrastructures, roads and other pavements, have increased from 584.448km2 to 852.140km2 between 2006 and 2018, whereas the agricultural land has reduced from 2686.121km2 to 2398.384km2 during the period. The area under vegetation (trees) indicated that there was an increasing trend from 28.490km2 to 54.678km2 during 12years of time span whereas, the fallow land/barren land showed a decreasing trend from 26.361km2 to 18.367km2. It is suggested that the LULC change detection studies are very significant to conserve the land resources and to avoid further degradation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the internal problems faced by Muslims today is confusion and mistakes in understanding the meaning, hierarchy, and scope of the limitations of knowledge. As a result, there is a collapse of manners, which refers to the loss of physical discipline, mind and soul that demands identification and recognition of the right place for a person in his relationship with himself and his society. Islam does not concede to the dichotomy of al-dunya and al-akhirah aspect. The worldview of Islam encompasses both al-dunya and al-akhirah in which the al-akhirah aspect has ultimate and final significance. The al-dunya aspect is seen as a preparation for the al-akhirah aspect. Everything in Islam is ultimately focused on the al-akhirah aspect without thereby implying any attitude of neglect or being unmindful of the al-dunya aspect. Knowledge that reveals the mysteries of Existence and reveals the true relationship between man and his God that is closely related to the main purpose of human creation is the main basis and foundation for other knowledge. This is because other knowledge itself, without the guidance of this main basic knowledge, will not be able to guide people correctly in their lives and will only confuse and ensnare people into an endless search. This article will cover the main basis of knowledge based on the understanding of knowledge derived from the philosophy of maqasid al-Qur'an presented by Imam al-Ghazali through his book Jawahir al-Qur'an.

TI  - Recovery of upland acid grasslands after successful<i> Pteridium</i><i> aquilinum</i> control: Long-term effectiveness of cutting, repeated herbicide treatment and bruising
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a clear need for the development of management strategies to control dominant, perennial weeds and restore semi-natural communities and an important part of this is to know how long control treatments take to be effective and how long they last after treatments stop. Here, we report the results from a 17-year long experiment where we compared the effects of five control treatments on dense Pteridium aquilinum (L. Kuhn) relative to an untreated experimental-control in Derbyshire, UK. The experiment was run in two phases. In Phase 1 (2005-2012) we controlled the P. aquilinum by cutting and bruising, both twice and thrice annually, and a herbicide treatment (asulam in year 1, followed by annual spot-re-treatment of all emergent fronds). In Phase 2 (2012-2021) all treatments were stopped, and the vegetation was allowed to develop naturally. Between 2005 and 2021 we monitored P. aquilinum performance annually and full plant species composition at intervals. Here, we concentrate on analysing the Phase 2 data where we used regression approaches to model individual species responses through time and unconstrained ordination to compare treatment effects on the entire species composition over both Phases. Remote sensing was also used to assess edge invasion in 2018.At the end of Phase 1, a good reduction of P. aquilinum and restoration of acid-grassland was achieved for the asulam and cutting treatments, but not for bruising. In Phase 2, P. aquilinum increased through time in all treated plots but the asulam and cutting ones maintained a much lower P. aquilinum performance for nine years on all measures assessed. There was a reduction in species richness and richness fluctuations, especially in graminoid species. However, multivariate analysis showed that the asulam and cutting treatments were stationed some distance from the untreated and bruising treatments with no apparent sign of reversions suggesting an Alter-native Stable State had been created, at least over this nine-year period. P. aquilinum reinvasion was mainly from plot edges.The use of repeated P. aquilinum control treatments, either through an initial asulam spray with annual follow-up spot-spraying or cutting twice or thrice annually for eight years gave good P. aquilinum control and helped restore an acid-grassland community. Edge reinvasion was detected, and it is recommended that either whole -patch control be implemented or treatments should be continued around patch edges.

TI  - Science and policy lessons learned from a decade of adaptation to the emergent risk of sargassum proliferation across the tropical Atlantic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic and anthropogenic changes appear to be driving the emergence of new ecosystem and human health risks. As new risks emerge, and the severity or frequency of known risks change, we ask: what evidence is there of past adaptations to emergent risks? What scientific and policy processes lead to adaptive solutions that minimise the impacts of these events, and draw out opportunities? We identify science and policy lessons learned from coping with, and responding to, the sudden arrival of brown macroalgae (pelagic sargassum) that has proliferated across the tropical Atlantic since 2011. Drawing on an evidence base developed from a systematic search of literature relating to sargassum seaweed, and using event timelines and word clouds, we provide an analysis of lessons learned from a case study of adaptive responses across three continents to an emergent risk over the course of a decade. We reflect on successes and failures as well as opportunities taken in building adaptive capacity to address the risk in four key domains: policy, knowledge and evidence, monitoring and early warning, and technology and valorisation. Failures include: lack of environmental risk registries; missed opportunities to share monitoring data; and lack of a shared approach to manage the risk. Successes include: development of national management strategies; open-access knowledge hubs, networks and webinars sharing information and best practice; semi-operational early advisory systems using open access remote sensing data; numerous innovations customising clean-up and harvesting equipment, and research and development of new uses and value-added products.

TI  - Evaluation of Index-Based Methods for Impervious Surface Mapping from Landsat-8 to Cities in Dry Climates; A Case Study of Buraydah City, KSA
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural landscape is fast turning into impervious surfaces with the increase in urban density and the spatial extent of urbanized areas. Remote sensing data are crucial for mapping impervious surface area (ISA), and several methods for ISA extraction have been developed and implemented successfully. However, the heterogeneity of the ISA spectra and the high similarity of the ISA spectra to those of bare soil in dry climates were not adequately addressed. The objective of this study is to determine which spectral impervious surface index best represents impervious surfaces in arid climates using two seasonal Landsat-8 images. We attempted to compare the performance of various impervious surface spectral Index for ISA extraction in dry climates using two seasonal Landsat-8 data. Specifically, nine indices, i.e., band ratio for the built-up area (BRBA), built-up area extraction method (BAEM), visible red near infrared built-up index (VrNIR-BI), normalized ratio urban index (NRUI), enhanced normalized difference impervious surfaces index (ENDISI), dry built-up index (DBI), built-up land features extraction index (BLFEI), perpendicular impervious surface index (PISI), combinational biophysical composition index (CBCI), and two impervious surface binary methods (manual method and ISODATA unsupervised classification). According to the results, PISI and CBCI combined with the manual method had the best accuracy with 88.5% and 88.5% overall accuracy (OA) and 0.76 and 0.81 kappa coefficients, respectively, while DBI combined with the manual method had the lowest accuracy with 75.37% OA and 0.56 kappa coefficients. PISI is comparatively more stable than the other approaches in terms of seasonal sensitivity. The ability of PISI to discriminate ISA from soil and vegetation accounts for much of its good performance. In addition, spring is the ideal time of the year for mapping ISA from Landsat-8 images because the impervious surface is generally less likely to be confused with bare soil and sand at this time of year. Therefore, this study can be used to determine spectral indices for studying ISA extraction in drylands in conjunction with binary approaches and seasonal effects.

TI  - Drought Risk Assessment and Monitoring of Ilocos Norte Province in the Philippines Using Satellite Remote Sensing and Meteorological Data
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has been known to be a natural hazard reflecting geographic and climatic characteristics. Satellite technology advancements have benefited drought assessment and monitoring to formulate plans for dealing with this slow-onset disaster. However, combining satellite remote sensing (RS) and meteorological data for drought monitoring is lacking in the literature. This study uses satellite RS and meteorological-based drought indicators to assess drought risk in the Ilocos Norte, Philippines. Data analysis included the retrieval of vegetation conditions using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data. The standardized precipitation index (SPI) and Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) were calculated to account for climatic variabilities. Results revealed that the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient decreased by -2 dB in the cropland area, indicating crop growth irregularities compared to grassland areas. These irregularities were supported by Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) strong fluctuations during the two-year observation period. A significant coefficient of determination (R-2 > 0.60) between the Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficient and Sentinel-2 NDVI was observed for the study area. On the one hand, only KBDI significantly correlated (R-2 > 0.60) with the cropland area's RS data-derived drought indicators. These results revealed RS data variability for drought risk management but are still valuable for developing an early warning system.

TI  - Comparison of PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and landsat 8 data in soybean yield estimation within-field variability with random forest regression
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate timely and early-season crop yield estimation within the field variability is important for precision farming and sustainable management applications. Therefore, the ability to estimate the within-field variability of grain yield is crucial for ensuring food security worldwide, especially under climate change. Several Earth observation systems have thus been developed to monitor crops and predict yields. Despite this, new research is required to combine multiplatform data integration, advancements in satellite technologies, data processing, and the application of this discipline to agricultural practices. This study provides further developments in soybean yield estimation by comparing multisource satellite data from PlanetScope (PS), Sentinel-2 (S2), and Landsat 8 (L8) and introducing topographic and meteorological variables. Herein, a new method of combining soybean yield, global positioning systems, harvester data, climate, topographic variables, and remote sensing images has been demonstrated. Soybean yield shape points were obtained from a combine-harvester-installed GPS and yield monitoring system from seven fields over the 2021 season. The yield estimation models were trained and validated using random forest, and four vegetation indices were tested. The result showed that soybean yield can be accurately predicted at 3-, 10-, and 30-m resolutions with mean absolute error (MAE) value of 0.091 t/ha for PS, 0.118 t/ha for S2, and 0.120 t/ha for L8 data (root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.111, 0.076). The combination of the environmental data with the original bands provided further improvements and an accurate yield estimation model within the soybean yield variability with MAE of 0.082 t/ha for PS, 0.097 t/ha for S2, and 0.109 t/ha for L8 (RMSE of 0.094, 0.069, and 0.108 t/ha). The results showed that the optimal date to predict the soybean yield within the field scale was approximately 60 or 70 days before harvesting periods during the beginning bloom stage. The developed model can be applied for other crops and locations when suitable training yield data, which are critical for precision farming, are available.

TI  - High-Resolution Digital Soil Maps of Forest Soil Nitrogen across South Korea Using Three Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable estimation of the forest soil nitrogen spatial distribution is necessary for effective forest ecosystem management. This study aimed to develop high-resolution digital soil maps of forest soil nitrogen across South Korea using three powerful machine learning methods to better understand the spatial variations of forest soil nitrogen and its environmental drivers. To achieve this, the study used national-level forest soil nitrogen data and environmental data to construct various geographic and environmental variables including geological, topographic, and vegetation factors for digital soil mapping. The results show that of the machine learning methods, the random forest model had the best performance at predicting total soil nitrogen in the A and B horizons, closely followed by the extreme gradient-boosting model. The most critical predictors were found to be geographic variables, quantitatively confirming the significant role of spatial autocorrelation in predicting soil nitrogen. The digital soil maps revealed that areas with high elevation, concave slopes, and deciduous forests had high nitrogen contents. This finding highlights the potential usefulness of digital soil maps in supporting forest management decision-making and identifying the environmental drivers of forest soil nitrogen distribution.

TI  - Improving the detection of<i> Angiostrongylus</i><i> cantonensis</i> in the brain tissues of mammalian hosts
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Angiostrongylus cantonensis is an invasive nematode parasite that causes eosinophilic meningitis in many verte-brate hosts, including humans. This parasite is spreading rapidly through the six continents, with Europe being the final frontier. Sentinel surveillance may be a cost-effective strategy to monitor the pathogen's arrival to new geographical regions. Necropsy, followed by tissue digestion, is often used to recover helminth parasites from vertebrate host tissues, however, to detect brain parasites, this protocol is poorly utilized. Our brain digestion protocol is easily performed and 1) reduces false positivity and negativity, 2) provides accurate estimates of parasite burden and 3) helps establish a more precise prevalence. Early detection of A. cantonensis increases the efficacy of prevention, treatment, and disease control strategies for susceptible animal populations and humans.

TI  - Modelling of land use land cover changes using machine learning and GIS techniques: a case study in El-Fayoum Governorate, Egypt
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) changes can occur naturally or due to human activities. In this study, the maximum likelihood algorithm (MLH) and machine learning (random forest algorithm (RF) and support vector machine (SVM)) were investigated for image classification to oversight spatio-temporal land use changes in El-Fayoum governorate, Egypt. The Google Earth Engine has been utilized to pre-process the Landsat imagery, and then upload it for classification. Each classification method was evaluated using field observations and high-resolution Google Earth imagery. LULC changes were assessed, utilizing Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, over the last 20 years in three different periods: 2000-2012, 2012-2016, and 2016-2020. The results showed that socioeconomic changes occurred during these transitions. The SVM procedure provided the most accurate maps in terms of the kappa coefficient (0.916) compared to MLH (0.878) and RF (0.909) procedures. Therefore, the SVM technique was adopted to classify all available satellite imagery. The results of change detection showed that urban sprawl has occurred and most of the encroachments were on agricultural land. The results showed that agricultural land area decreased from 26.84% in 2000 to 26.61% in 2020 and urban area increased from 3.43% in 2000 to 5.99% in 2020. In addition, urban land expanded rapidly on account of agricultural lands by a total of 4.78% from 2012 to 2016, while it expanded slowly by a total of 3.23% from 2016 to 2020. Overall, this study offers useful insight into LULC changes that might aid shareholders and decision makers in making informed decisions.

TI  - Assessment of variations in air quality in cities of Ecuador in relation to the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzes the effect of lockdown due to COVID-19 on the spatiotemporal variability of ozone (O3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in different provinces of continental Ecuador using satellite information from Sentinel - 5P. The statistical analysis includes data from 2018 to March 2021 and was performed based on three periods defined a priori: before, during, and after lockdown due to COVID-19, focusing on the provinces with the highest concentrations of the studied gases (hotspots). The results showed a significant decrease in NO2 concentrations during the COVID-19 lockdown period in all the study areas: the Metropolitan District of Quito (DMQ) and the provinces of Guayas and Santo Domingo de los Ts & PRIME;achilas. In the period after lockdown, NO2 concentrations increased by over 20% when compared to the pre-lockdown period, which may be attributable to a shift towards private transportation due to health concerns. On the other hand, SO2 concentrations during the lockdown period showed irregular, non-significant variations; however, increases were observed in the provinces of Chimborazo, Guayas, Santa Elena, and Morona Santiago, which could be partly attributed to the eruptive activity of the Sangay volcano during 2019-2020. Conversely, O3 concentrations increased by 2-3% in the study areas; this anomalous behavior could be attributed to decreased levels of NOx, which react with ozone, reducing its concentration. Finally, satellite data validation using the corresponding data from monitoring stations in the DMQ showed correlation values of 0.9 for O3 data and 0.7 for NO2 data, while no significant correlation was found for SO2.

TI  - Noninteger Dimension of Seasonal Land Surface Temperature (LST)
T2  - AXIOMS
M3  - Article
AB  - During the few last years, climate change, including global warming, which is attributed to human activities, and its long-term adverse effects on the planet's functions have been identified as the most challenging discussion topics and have provoked significant concern and effort to find possible solutions. Since the warmth arising from the Earth's landscapes affects the world's weather and climate patterns, we decided to study the changes in Land Surface Temperature (LST) patterns in different seasons through nonlinear methods. Here, we particularly wanted to estimate the noninteger dimension and fractal structure of the Land Surface Temperature. For this study, the LST data were obtained during the daytime by a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA's Terra satellite. Depending on the time of the year data were collected, temperatures changed in different ranges. Since equatorial regions remain warm, and Antarctica and Greenland remain cold, and also because altitude affects temperature, we selected Riley County in the US state of Kansas, which does not belong to any of these location types, and we observed the seasonal changes in temperature in this county. According to our fractal analysis, the fractal dimension may provide a complexity index to characterize different LST datasets. The multifractal analysis confirmed that the LST data may define a self-organizing system that produces fractal patterns in the structure of data. Thus, the LST data may not only have a wide range of fractal dimensions, but also they are fractal. The results of the present study show that the Land Surface Temperature (LST) belongs to the class of fractal processes with a noninteger dimension. Moreover, self-organized behavior governing the structure of LST data may provide an underlying principle that might be a general outcome of human activities and may shape the Earth's surface temperature. We explicitly acknowledge the important role of fractal geometry when analyzing and tracing settlement patterns and urbanization dynamics at various scales toward purposeful planning in the development of human settlement patterns.

TI  - The Understanding of and Response to Western Learning by Confucian Scholars of the Yeongnam Region in the 19th Century: Emperor Above, Master of Heaven, and Worshiping Rites for the Spirit
T2  - REVIEW OF KOREAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reviews how the Confucian scholars of the Yeongnam region in Joseon around the 19th century critically perceived Western Learning, particularly the Catholic concepts of Deus and anima. The Confucian scholars of Yeongnam primarily focused on the two aspects of the principle from a Neo-Confucian worldview: the aspect of non-action (muwi) and the aspect of ruling over (jujae). They understood the notion of Emperor Above (sangje) through this ruling nature of the principle. While guarding against the favorable interpretation of Western Learning by the Southerners of the Gyeonggi area such as Yi Ik and An Jeongbok, the Southerners of the Yeongnam region felt the necessity to distinguish their scholarly identity more clearly. The disciples of Yi Sangjeong such as Nam Hanjo, Jo Suldo, Jeong Jongno, Ryu Geonhyu, and Ryu Chimyeong criticized the concept of the Master of Heaven (cheonju) and emphasized the aspect of non-action found in Emperor Above in Confucianism, namely, the impersonal and universal properties of the Great Ultimate (taegeuk) and the principle (ri). Although Western books introducing Catholicism argued that Deus was an immaterial, eternal, and intellectual being, Confucian scholars regarded that a personified Master of Heaven, who had specific emotions and will and judged the good and evil of humans, was ultimately in the same finite category as divine force (yeongsin). In face of such limited and personified characteristic of the Master of Heaven, the Confucian scholars of the Yeongnam region further emphasized the universality and public nature of the principle. This was particularly the case of ancestral spirit (hollyeong), which was universal and public. According to them, material force was constantly regenerated in accordance with the universality of the principle. One was able to perform a worshiping rite and reciprocally connect with the objects of worship, be it one's ancestors or the sages, since the principle deserved to be revered and worshiped. The key to the worshiping ritual was to therefore understand and perceive the principle with one's mind and venerate the proper objects of worship. The spirit (sin) only existed when the principle was proper. The encounter with the arguments of Western Learning and Catholicism by the Southerners of the Gyeonggi area who were of the Seongho School as well as the Confucian scholars of the Yeongnam region served as an important opportunity that triggered their various inner capabilities. While the dissemination of Western Learning agitated the intellectuals of Joseon and divided their lines of thought, it also provided an impetus for them to actively reflect upon the beliefs and values they harbored. This is evident by the intellectual response of the Confucian scholars of the Yeongnam area who critically reviewed the meaning of Emperor Above, ancestral spirit, and worshiping rituals.

TI  - Using the band ratio approach, FULL-PIXEL (SAM and SFF) and SUB- PIXEL (MF and SID) methodologies to discover areas with alteration using the Aster sensor: a case study in north westen Iran- Sivardaghi Area
T2  - NEXO REVISTA CIENTIFICA
M3  - Article
AB  - ASTER sensor data is among the most potent satellite data accessible for doing geological investigations, with images for the whole earth's surface. In order to test the capability of this sensor to detect places with geochemical alterations, photographs of Mount Seiver Daghi in the western Iranian province of Samal were utilized in this study. This region, which comprises of magmatic and volcanic terrain, is part of the Arsbaran territory and is covered by intrusive masses with alluvial and sedimentary deposits. To conduct this study, an ASTER measuring frame was utilized, which, after performing atmospheric corrections using the internal average relative reflectance (IARR) method of false color composite images and principal component analysis (PCA), was able to differentiate between different lithological units using the Band assignment method, full-pixel methods of spectral angle mapper (SAM) and base spectrum algorithm of spectral feature fitting (SFF) as well as sub-pixel methods of matched filtering. The study demonstrates that the approach of principal component analysis and false color composition is efficient for distinguishing sedimentary rock units from igneous rock units, and its application is suggested for the designated rock units. Due to the lack of spectral characteristics of feldspars and quartz in the short infrared wavelength range, the basic spectrum methods utilized in this work are incapable of identifying such minerals. It is not advised to use these algorithms to distinguish between various magmatic units.

TI  - Monitoring and Analysis of the Driving Forces of Changes in the Ecological Environment of a Mining Area of Western China from 1986 to 2022
T2  - PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) has been widely used in the rapid monitoring and evaluation of the regional ecological environment; however, the research on the main factors that cause changes in RSEI and the impact of human activities in the mining area on RSEI is not often explored. To this end, this paper selected the Landsat (TM/OLI) series of remote sensing images from 1986 to 2022; extracted the four important indicators of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation (WET), normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDBSI), and land surface temperature (LST); calculated the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the principal component analysis method; monitored and evaluated the ecological environment changes in the Shendong Mining Area for a period of 36 years; and analyzed the driving forces that cause these ecological environment changes. The results show the following: (1) The ecological status of the study area has shown an overall upward trend during the 1986-2022 period. (2) From 1986 to 2022, the area of RSEI with a grade of 0.4-0.6 increased by 1142.74 km(2), that with a grade of 0.6-0.8 increased by 124.09 km(2), and that with a grade of 0.8-1.0 increased by 0.73 km(2). (3) In the past 36 years, the proportion of RSEI with a positive grade difference was 97.52%, and the proportion of regions with a negative grade difference was 6.20%. (4) Rainfall is the main factor that causes changes in the regional ecological environment. By analyzing the main driving factors of ecological environment change and the relationship between human activities and RSEI, reference can be provided for the formulation of environmental protection policies and environmental planning in mining areas.

TI  - Simulating the impact of varying vegetation on West African monsoon surface fluxes using a regional convection-permitting model.
T2  - Plant-environment interactions (Hoboken, N.J.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This study assessed the sensitivity of the West African climate to varying vegetation fractions. The assessment of a such relationship is critical in understanding the interactions between land surface and atmosphere. Two sets of convection-permitting simulations from the UK Met Office Unified Model at 12km horizontal resolution covering the monsoon period May-September (MJJAS) were used, one with fixed vegetation fraction (MF-V) and the other with time-varying vegetation fraction (MV-V). Vegetation fractions are based on MODIS retrievals between May and September. We focused on three climatic zones over West Africa: Guinea Coast, Sudanian Sahel, and the Sahel while investigating heat fluxes, temperature, and evapotranspiration. Results reveal that latent heat fluxes are the most strongly affected by vegetation fraction over the Sahelian and Sudanian regions while sensible heat fluxes are more impacted over the Guinea Coast and Sudanian Sahel. Also, in MV-V simulation there is an increase in evapotranspiration mainly over the Sahel and some specific areas in Guinea Coast from June to September. Moreover, it is noticed that high near-surface temperature is associated with a weak vegetation fraction, especially during May and June. Finally, varying vegetation seems to improve the simulation of surface energy fluxes and in turn impact on climate parameters. This suggests that climate modelers should prioritize the use of varying vegetation options to improve the representation of the West African climate system.

TI  - Real de-escalation or escalation in disguise?
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - The past two decades have seen an unprecedented trend towards de-escalation of surgical therapy in the setting of early BC, the most prominent examples being the reduction of re-excision rates for close surgical margins after breast-conserving surgery and replacing axillary lymph node dissection by less radical procedures such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Numerous studies confirmed that reducing the extent of surgery in the upfront surgery setting does not impact locoregional recurrences and overall outcome. In the setting of primary systemic treatment, there is an increased use of less invasive staging strategies reaching from SLNB and targeted lymph node biopsy (TLNB) to targeted axillary dissection (TAD). Omission of any axillary surgery in the presence of pathological complete response in the breast is currently being investigated in clinical trials. On the other hand, concerns have been raised that surgical de-escalation might induce an escalation of other treatment mo-dalities such as radiation therapy. Since most trials on surgical de-escalation did not include standardized pro-tocols for adjuvant radiotherapy, it remains unclear, whether the effect of surgical de-escalation was valid in itself or if radiotherapy compensated for the decreased surgical extent. Uncertainties in scientific evidence may therefore lead to escalation of radiotherapy in some settings of surgical de-escalation. Further, the increasing rate of mastectomies including contralateral procedures in patients without genetic risk is alarming. Future studies of locoregional treatment strategies need to include an interdisciplinary approach to integrate de-escalation ap-proaches combining surgery and radiotherapy in a way that promotes optimal quality of life and shared decision -making.

TI  - The Transport Path and Vertical Structure of Dust Storms in East Asia and the Impacts on Cities in Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storm disasters have emerged as a significant environmental challenge in East Asia. However, relying on a single monitoring method to track dust storms presents limitations and can be variable. Therefore, it is necessary to use a combination of ground and remote sensing monitoring methods to explore the source and impact range of dust storms in order to fully characterize them. To achieve this, we examined the sources and impact ranges of dust storms in East Asia from 1980 to 2020 using both ground station data and remote sensing data. In addition, we focused on three specific dust storm events in the region. Our results indicate that the central source areas of dust storms are located in southern Mongolia and the Taklamakan Desert in China. Dust storms are mainly transported and spread in the northwestern region, while they are relatively rare in the southeastern region. The HYSPLIT model simulations reveal that the primary source directions of dust storms in East Asia are northwest, west, and north, the region involved includes Kazakhstan, southern Mongolia, and the Taklimakan Desert in China. The vertical structure of the dust storm layer depends on the source of the dust storm and the intensity of the dust storm event. Dust grain stratification probably occurs due to differences in dust storm sources, grain size, and regularity. These findings demonstrate that a combination of ground-based and remote sensing monitoring methods is an effective approach to fully characterize dust storms and can provide more comprehensive information for dust storm studies.

TI  - Who (What) Lies in the Tomb in the Middle English St. Erkenwald?
T2  - STUDIES IN PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article makes the case for an Anglo-Saxon cultural identity for the nameless man in the tomb in the Middle English St. Erkenwald on textual, hagiographic, historical, art historical, and literary grounds. The poem's historical proem, akin to similar prologues in Middle English lives of pre-Conquest saints, evokes the negative stereotype of the primitive Saxon heathen popular in the post-Conquest era, which the remainder of the poem dispels. The incorrupt corpse and garments, in the guise of a king, signal two abiding markers of Anglo-Saxon sanctity that distinguish it from post-Conquest hagiography, while the body's social role as a judge announces a primary arena of continuing authority of early English culture. The material culture of the tomb and robes bespeaks Anglo-Saxon design and the social and economic networks that facilitated these artforms. When revived, the body expresses an Anglo-Saxon worldview in terms of time, historical orientation, poetic sensibility, codes of reciprocity, spirituality, and life after death. The poem portrays a golden age of early English society and proposes its acceptance in the contemporary world of the poem.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection: Dead or still alive?
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Although sentinel lymph node biopsy is now the primary method of axillary staging and is therapeutic for pa-tients with limited nodal disease, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is still necessary for staging in groups where sentinel lymph node biopsy has not been proven to be accurate and to maintain local control in those with a heavy axillary tumor burden. Additionally, newer approaches to systemic therapy tailored to risk level sometimes necessitate knowledge of the number of involved axillary nodes which can only be obtained with ALND. Ongoing trials will address whether there are additional circumstances where radiotherapy can replace ALND.

TI  - Geographic and taxonomic variation in adaptive capacity among mountain-dwelling small mammals: Implications for conservation status and actions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary climate change is modifying the distribution, morphology, phenology, physiology, evolution, and interspecific interactions of species. Effects of climate change are mediated not only through the magnitude of change experienced (exposure) and an animal's sensitivity to such changes, but also through the ability of the population or species to adjust to climatic variability and change genetically, behaviorally, or spatially (via its distribution) (i.e., adaptive capacity; AC). Here, we used an attribute-based framework to systematically evaluate and compare the AC of American pikas (Ochotona princeps) against four other mountain-dwelling small mammals of North America to determine whether pikas are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change, as has been postulated. Unlike previous analyses, we also compared AC across O. princeps lineages and across three taxo-nomic (and thus, spatial) scales. Our results indicate that pikas have markedly lower adaptive capacity than all compared species except bushy-tailed woodrats (Neotoma cinerea), and that our assessments of species generally align with earlier characterizations of climate-change vulnerability based on life-history characteristics. Although AC did not differ dramatically among pika lineages, some attributes are likely constraining AC differently in various parts of the geographic range. Comparisons across taxonomic levels of pikas illustrated that, although AC levels were comparable in pika lineages versus range-wide, AC was assessed as lower in interior-Great-Basin pikas than across the entire O.p. schisticeps lineage. We conclude that the comparatively lower AC of pikas results in particularly high susceptibility to anthropogenic climate change, corroborating results from numerous other recent investigations of pikas' climate-responsiveness. Adaptive-capacity evalua-tions appear useful as a consistent way to identify sentinel species or populations and for conservation prioritization.

TI  - Elimination of Thermal Effects from Limited Structural Displacements Based on Remote Sensing by Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Confounding variability caused by environmental and/or operational conditions is a big challenge in the structural health monitoring (SHM) of large-scale civil structures. The elimination of such variability is of paramount importance in avoiding economic and human losses. Machine learning-aided data normalization provides a good solution to this challenge. Despite proper studies on data normalization using structural responses/features acquired from contact-based sensors, this issue has not been explored properly via new features, such as displacement responses from remote sensing products, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Hence, the main aim of this work was to eliminate environmental variability, particularly thermal effects, from different and limited structural displacements retrieved from a few SAR images related to long-term health monitoring programs of long-span bridges. For this purpose, we conducted a comprehensive comparative study to investigate two supervised and two unsupervised data normalization algorithms. The supervised algorithms were based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector regression (SVR), for which temperature records acquired from contact temperature sensors and structural displacements retrieved from spaceborne remote sensors produce univariate predictor (input) and response (output) data for the regression problem. For the unsupervised algorithms, this paper employed principal component analysis (PCA) and proposed a deep autoencoder (DAE), both of which conform with unsupervised reconstruction-based data normalization. In contrast to the GPR- and SVR-based data normalization algorithms, both the PCA and DAE methods only consider the SAR-based displacement (output) data without any requirement of the environmental and/or operational (input) data. Limited displacement sets of long-span bridges from a few SAR images of Sentinel-1A, related to long-term SHM programs, were considered to assess the aforementioned techniques. Results demonstrate that the proposed DAE-aided data normalization is the best approach to remove thermal effects and other unmeasured environmental and/or operational variability.

TI  - Multi-temporal Landsat imagery and MSAVI index for monitoring rangeland degradation in arid ecosystem, case study of Biskra (southeast Algeria)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Algerian Saharan rangelands are an arid ecosystem characterized by limited soil, water, and vegetation resources, which make it very susceptible to degradation. This research focuses on the diachronic assessment and multi-temporal mapping of the degradation of steppe vegetation in the south of Biskra during the period 1987-2019, using remote sensing data (MSAVI index), for extracting spatiotemporal data to monitor the rangeland vegetation dynamics. We examined demographic evolution, number of livestock, and land use from quantitative data. The results show that during this period, the landscape of the region changed considerably. The area of rangelands decreased from 19,939 ha (1987) to 3605 ha (2019), where 58% of the pre-existing vegetation was transformed into bare soil. This study confirmed that the rangeland vegetation health is closely related to climate, and its degradation is mainly due to the recurrence, duration, severity, and magnitude of drought events. Manmade activities were also a determinant factor of long-term degradation of the rangeland, such as the expansion of new land development areas that increased from 3754 ha (1987) to 24,410 ha (2019). This trend was found throughout the region, including predominantly pastoral regions such as Oumache and El Haouch, leading to overgrazing with a loss of about 2% of vegetation cover. All these factors have led to a severe and continuous degradation of pastoral resources in a vulnerable environment. The preservation of these limited resources requires appropriate management of the ecosystem and a rational exploitation of its vegetation, soil, and water resources.

TI  - Characteristics of Marine Heatwaves in the Indonesian Waters during the PDO, ENSO, and IOD Phases and Their Relationships to Net Surface Heat Flux
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We conducted an investigation into the characteristics of marine heatwaves (MHWs) in Indonesian waters, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for their formation, particularly the ones generated by net surface heat flux. To accomplish this, we utilized remote sensing data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The dataset covered a 40-year period (1982-2021) encompassing both warm (1982-2007) and cold (2008-2021) phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Statistical analysis methods were employed to process the data. Our study reveals significant findings regarding MHWs in Indonesian waters. We observed the highest average frequency and maximum intensity of MHWs, occurring approximately 2-3 times a year and exceeding 1.5 & DEG;C, respectively, during the warm phase of PDO (with El Nino events occurring more frequently than La Nina). Conversely, the longest durations of MHWs in Indonesian waters were recorded during the cold phase of PDO (with La Nina events occurring more frequently than El Nino), spanning approximately 7-15 days. We identified local forcing in the form of net surface heat flux as the primary driver of MHW frequency and maximum intensity. During the warm phase of PDO, the net surface heat flux was notably higher, primarily due to increased shortwave radiation (heat gain) and reduced latent heat flux (heat loss) through the evaporation process. These factors collectively contributed to maintaining warmer ocean temperatures. Moreover, our study provides valuable insights into the interannual variability of MHWs through the application of composite calculations. We discovered a strong correlation between the occurrence of El Nino and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events during the warm PDO phase and the highest frequency and maximum intensity of MHWs, with approximately 2.52 events and 1.54 & DEG;C, respectively. In contrast, we found that MHWs with the longest durations were closely linked to La Nina and negative IOD events during the cold PDO phase, lasting approximately 10.90 days. These findings highlight the complex interplay between climate phenomena and MHW characteristics, further deepening our understanding of their dynamics.

TI  - Detecting and Predicting Archaeological Sites Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning-Application to the Saruq Al-Hadid Site, Dubai, UAE
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, the feasibility of satellite remote sensing in detecting and predicting locations of buried objects in the archaeological site of Saruq Al-Hadid, United Arab Emirates (UAE) was investigated. Satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is proposed as the main technology for this initial investigation. In fact, SAR is the only satellite-based technology able to detect buried artefacts from space, and it is expected that fine-resolution images of ALOS/PALSAR-2 (L-band SAR) would be able to detect large features (>1 m) that might be buried in the subsurface (<2 m) under optimum conditions, i.e., dry and bare soil. SAR data were complemented with very high-resolution Worldview-3 multispectral images (0.31 m panchromatic, 1.24 m VNIR) to obtain a visual assessment of the study area and its land cover features. An integrated approach, featuring the application of advanced image processing techniques and geospatial analysis using machine learning, was adopted to characterise the site while automating the process and investigating its applicability. Results from SAR feature extraction and geospatial analyses showed detection of the areas on the site that were already under excavation and predicted new, hitherto unexplored archaeological areas. The validation of these results was performed using previous archaeological works as well as geological and geomorphological field surveys. The modelling and prediction accuracies are expected to improve with the insertion of a neural network and backpropagation algorithms based on the performed cluster groups following more recent field surveys. The validated results can provide guidance for future on-site archaeological work. The pilot process developed in this work can therefore be applied to similar arid environments for the detection of archaeological features and guidance of on-site investigations.

TI  - Monitoring the Spatial and Interannual Dynamic of Zostera noltei
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass is a vital structural and functional element of the marine environment worldwide and is highly valued for its ecological benefits. Monitoring the evolution of the seagrass habitat is essential to understand how this coastal ecosystem changes, and to develop good environmental management practices. For the present study, two remote sensing methods were used to map and monitor Zostera noltei Hornemann, 1832 (Z. noltei), in the Merja Zerga lagoon from 2010 to 2020. These methods which are the random forest algorithm and the object-oriented classification, were convenient to provide significant results. The first approach employed Sentinel-2 images from 2018 to 2020, which were used to extract information on changes in Z. noltei (commonly called dwarf eelgrass) distribution and aboveground biomass estimation. The second involved three orthophotography (orthophoto) mosaics from the years 2010, 2016, and 2018, which were analyzed to map the distribution of the species. It was revealed that Z. noltei coverage has increased by 212 ha since 2010, with most of the growth occurring in the center and upstream part of the lagoon. The mean aboveground biomass of dwarf eelgrass in the lagoon was 78.5 DW/m(2) in 2018, 92.6 DW/m(2) in 2019, and 115.2 g DW/m(2) in 2020. The approach used in this study has provided important insights into the dynamic and mean biomass of Z. noltei in the Merja Zerga lagoon. It is therefore a valuable, non-destructive method that uses freely-available Sentinel-2 satellite data.

AB  - Dramatic irregularities in the plasma density of the ionosphere, first discovered by their effects on radio wave propagation in 1938, despite decades of investigation, still remain puzzling. Their deleterious effects on radio wave communication, satellite command and control, and GPS navigation strongly motivate better understanding of their nature. Many aspects of such irregularities are now understood, but the mechanism(s) of their formation and their detailed nature remain a topic of great interest. In this work, detailed time resolved measurements of lightning generated waves sometimes show dispersionless, strongly attenuated propagation with substantial propagation delays. These characteristics of the electromagnetic wave propagation in the hypothetical two-phase bubble/non-bubble lower ionosphere parallel the characteristics of acoustic wave propagation through two-phase liquid/vapor foams. This motivates the suggestion that the bottomside layer of the ionosphere may sometimes be foamy.Plain Language Summary Just as ocean waves breaking at the interface between sea and land produce copious bubbles and foam, recent satellite data suggests a similar phenomenon at the interface between neutral atmosphere and the charged plasma of the ionosphere. Lightning generated electromagnetic waves passing through the lower ionosphere observed by low altitude satellites are found to have the same characteristics as acoustic waves passing through foamy water. This hypothetical foam in the lower ionosphere apparently strongly absorbs some radio wave frequencies and seems to prevent most such waves from escaping the foam to pass through to the upper ionosphere.

TI  - Lithuanian river ice detection and automated classification using machine-learning methods
T2  - BALTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In regions susceptible to river freezing and flooding, river ice detection is a priority. Localization of ice jams and ice drift zones could mean a faster and better response to possible flooding areas, and classifica-tion of river ice could help better predict freezing and thawing conditions that hinder the use of commercial and recreational river transport. As many freezing-prone rivers are located in regions with short winter days and common cloud cover, the use of optical sensors can be very limited, therefore, the use of Synthetic Aper-ture Radar (SAR) - a microwave imaging radar - is more applicable. In this article, Sentinel-1 SAR C-band imagery is used to create derivate texture rasters, which are analyzed, compared with known optical imagery and then considered for river ice detection and discrimination. These results are compared in terms of their effectiveness for river ice discrimination, and the most useful methods are selected. The chosen methods are then compared in an experimental machine-learning model capable of detecting and classifying ice and water. Various machine-learning approaches (both classical and deep-learning) are considered and compared, and the best models are selected. The purpose of this research is to analyze the capability of texture rasters, calculated from a gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), to discriminate river ice. Texture rasters have recently been applied for river ice classification by de Roda Husman et al. (de Roda Husman et al. 2021), but included only three metrics. This research aims to expand on this knowledge by comparing eight metrics instead of three, as well as including an experiment with a deep-learning model. The results demonstrate that in machine-learning experiments, only one texture measure out of eight (GLCM Mean calculation) is able to discriminate river ice better than discrimination from a standard SAR backscatter intensity image (the baseline).

TI  - Enumerating and Modelling the Seasonal alterations of Surface Urban Heat and Cool Island: A Case Study over Indian Cities
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study has been carried out to analyze the seasonal variation of the Urban Heat and Cool Island over the nine developing cities of India. The magnitude of urban heat/cool island and vegetation gradient ( increment NDVI) were measured from the daytime satellite datasets. Results of this study show that during the pre-monsoon (March to May) season, the maximum magnitude of the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) was experienced over Kolhapur city, whereas, in the winter, the highest intensity of SUHI was noticed over Pune city. Subsequently, outcomes also depict that the changes in increment NDVI restrain the pre-monsoon means and the seasonal alterations in SUHI magnitude. However, during the winter (November to February) season, it is controlled by the temperature-vegetation conditions of the rural areas. For pre-monsoon and seasonal changes in SUHI, with the aid of increment NDVI and the surface temperature of the urban area, regression equations were fitted for pre-monsoon and seasonal changes in SUHI, which explains nearly 90% of SUHI variation. Similarly, the variation of SUHI has been modeled for winter, which elucidates up to 84% of SUHI discrepancy. The study reveals that, on a seasonal scale, a decrement of 0.1 in seasonal increment NDVI leads to an increase in the seasonal intensity of SUHI by 1.74 & DEG;C, which is quite a significant augmentation.

TI  - Development of an emission estimation method with satellite observations for significant forest fires and comparison with global fire emission inventories: Application to catastrophic fires of summer 2021 over the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few decades, forest fires have increased in number and severity, especially in the Mediterranean regions of Turkiye and Greece, where significant fires caused damage to thousands of hectares of land as well as wildlife. The main objective of the present study is to develop an emission estimation method with satellite-based burned area data from significant forest fire events in the Eastern Mediterranean in July-August 2021. In the first stage of this study, pre-fire and post-fire images of the study area acquired by the Sentinel-2 satellite were processed to calculate the normalized burn rate difference index (dNBR). Then, CORINE Land Cover (CLC) data were used for detecting land cover classes in the burned areas. Atmospheric emissions of NOx, CO, SO2, total suspended particulate matter (TSP), particulate matter with diameters that are equal to or smaller than 2.5 & mu;m (PM2.5), and black carbon (BC) were estimated using the EMEP/EEA Tier 2 -technology-specific approach method, in which burned area maps were retrieved using Sentinel-2 imageries and later combined with land cover type and burning efficiency to estimate the quantity of burning biomass emissions. Emission factors were then used to estimate the fires' trace gas and aerosol emissions. The results showed that the highest burned areas were found in the western Mediterranean region in Turkiye and Central Greece (⁓50,000 ha). The atmospheric emissions from these fires were calculated to be similar in both countries. Furthermore, emission amounts were compared with three different global fire emission inventories including GFAS, GFED, and FINN. The emissions obtained from the GFAS database were the highest emissions of the four emission estimation approaches and our estimated emissions were close to the GFAS. Emissions calculated from the other two databases (FINN and GFED) mostly provided underestimated emissions. The emission uncertainties in this study mainly originated from assumptions regarding the inclusion of burned area efficiency in emission calculations, the landcover dataset, and the emission factors used. Overall, this study is considered a new approach to emission calculations using Sentinel-2 data. This research provides further insight into the use of Sentinel-2 data in emission calculation applications at the local to regional scales.

TI  - Assessing landscape fragmentation due to urbanization in English Bazar Municipality, Malda, India, using landscape metrics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in India is having a significant impact on the environment and human health, as built-up areas are expanding while vegetation and water bodies are declining. To mitigate the negative effects of urbanization, there is an urgent need to monitor and manage the growth of cities through the creation of smart cities. Accurately identifying and mapping urban expansion patterns is crucial to achieving this goal, but this is currently lacking in India. To address this gap, this study takes a comprehensive approach to examining the processes of urban expansion in English Bazar Municipality, Malda, India. The study employs the random forest (RF) method for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping for the years 2001, 2011, and 2021 and then uses the frequency approach, landscape homogeneity, and fragmentation to model urban expansion over the same time period. The study also employs several landscape matrices to quantify urban expansion. The results of the study reveal a substantial increase in built-up areas from 601.26 hectares in 2001 to 859.13 hectares in 2021, accompanied by a corresponding decline in vegetation, cropland, and open land. This land use transition process has also led to increased fragmentation of the landscape. The spatiotemporal landscape homogeneity analysis identifies two transition zones (zone 2 and zone 1) surrounding the stable zone, which capture the new, small, isolated built-up areas and show a progression of urban expansion from 2001 to 2021. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the changes in urban expansion and fragmentation in English Bazar Municipality. To promote sustainable urban development and enhance the quality of life for residents, it is important for stakeholders and the government to prioritize the conservation and creation of green and blue spaces. This can be accomplished through the incorporation of green infrastructure, smart city principles, community engagement and education, and partnerships with local businesses.

TI  - An investigation of the effects of sand and dust storms in the North East Sahara Desert on Turkish airports and PM<sub>10</sub> values: 7 and 8 April, 2013 events
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Between April 7 and April 10, 2013, a cyclone with a value of 995 hPa that developed in the central Mediterranean transported dust from the Sahara Desert towards Turkey. At 13 airports in Turkey, dust haze and widespread dust were seen during different occasions in this period and caused the observation of so-called "Blowing dust events." This cyclone blew dust towards the Cappadocia airport, and the prevailing visibility decreased to 3800 m, making it the lowest value measured during the transition of this cyclone. In this study, Aviation Routine Weather Report (Metar) and Aviation Selected Special Weather Report (Speci) observations of airports in North Africa and Turkey were evaluated for the period between April 3 and April 11, 2013. With this cyclone the prevailing visibility at Benina Airport in Libya decreased to 50 m on April 6, 2013. This study aims to evaluate long-distance dust transport's effects on meteorological visibility at airports in Turkey and examine the episodic changes of PM10 values measured by air quality monitoring stations. Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model outputs were used to determine the trajectories of long-distance dust particles. Powder red, green, and blue (RGB) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images, Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) images, the Barcelona Supercomputing Center-Dust Regional Atmosphere Model (BSC-DREAM8b) outputs, and Global Forecast System (GFS) synoptic maps were used for analysis. In addition, PM10 values obtained from air quality monitoring stations were examined. According to the data obtained from the CALIPSO images, the dust concentration on the Eastern Mediterranean reaches up to 5 km. The episodic values obtained from certain air quality measurement stations are Adana 701, Gaziantep 629, Karaman 900, Nevsehir 1343, and Yozgat 782 mu g/m(3) on an hourly average.

TI  - Strategies for Stimulating Intrinsic Consciousness in the Training Process
T2  - REVISTA ROMANEASCA PENTRU EDUCATIE MULTIDIMENSIONALA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is dedicated to the educational researchers and academia involved in the initial training of students. The educational process is based on a set of principles, and intrinsic consciousness in one of them. It guides personality development towards forming a self-concept and worldview. Furthermore, this principle stems from one of the four dimensions of spiritual intelligence, namely transcendental awareness, which focuses on developing consciousness and self-awareness. The principle of intrinsic consciousness entails engaging students in academic activities that demand complex cognitive processes, such as analysis, synthesis, reflection, imagination as well as other mental faculties based on intuition. In this context, training approaches and planning shall focus both on theoretical benchmarks, particularly on the model of spiritual intelligence and, more specifically, on transcendental awareness, and on methodological benchmarks, comprising the teaching strategies guiding the educational approach aimed at developing intrinsic consciousness. For this investigative approach, a strategy is a construct consisting of a harmonious combination of learning tasks and methods used in shaping the personality to be self-aware and conscious of the components of the relationship with the surrounding world. Moreover, academics can apply these strategies both in a formal context, in the planning of lectures and seminars on academic subjects, and in a non-formal context, as part of continuing education activities.

TI  - Integrated Spatiotemporal Analysis of Vegetation Condition in a Complex Post-Mining Area: Lignite Mine Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The motivation for this study arises from the need to monitor the condition of a rehabilitated post-mining areas even decades after the end of the recovery phase. This can be facilitated with satellite derived spectral vegetation indices and Geographic Information System (GIS) based spatiotemporal analysis. The study area described in this work is located in Western Poland and has unique characteristics, as it was subjected to the combined underground and open pit mining of lignite deposits that had been shaped by glaciotectonic processes. The mining ended in early 1970'ties and the area was subjected to reclamation procedures that ended in the 1980'ties. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) spectral indices derived from Sentinel-2 data for the 2015-2022. period. Then, we applied a combination of GIS-based map algebra statistics (local, zonal and combinatorial) and GI* spatial statistics (hot spot and temporal hot spot) for a complex analysis and assessment of the vegetation cover condition in a post-mining area thought to be in the rehabilitated phase. The mean values of NDVI and EVI for the post-mining study area range from 0.48 to 0.64 and 0.24 to 0.31 and are stable in the analyzed 8 year period. This indicates general good condition of the vegetation and post-recovery phase of the area of interest. However, the combination of spatiotemporal analysis allowed us to identify statistically significant clusters of higher and lower values of the vegetation indices and change of vegetation cover classes on 3% of the study area. These clusters signify the occurrence of local processes such as, the encroachment of aquatic vegetation in waterlogged subsidence basins, and growth of low vegetation in old pits filled with waste material, barren earth zones on external waste dumps, as well as present-day forest management activities. We have confirmed that significant vegetation changes related to former mining occur even five decades later. Furthermore, we identified clusters of the highest values that are associated with zones of older, healthy forest and deciduous tree species. The results confirmed applicability of Sentinel-2 derived vegetation indices for studies of post-mining environment and for the detection of local phenomena related to natural landscaping processes still taking place in the study area. The methodology adopted for this study consisting of a combination of GIS-based data mining methods can be used in combination or separately in other areas of interest, as well as aid their sustainable management.

TI  - Monitoring Forest Cover Dynamics Using Orthophotos and Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of changes in forest coverage is crucial for managing protected forest areas, particularly in the face of climate change. This study monitored forest cover dynamics in a 6535 ha mountain area located in north-west Romania as part of the Apuseni Natural Park from 2003 to 2019. Two approaches were used: vectorization from orthophotos and Google Earth images (in 2003, 2005, 2009, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019) and satellite imagery (Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM, and 8 OLI) pre-processed to Surface Reflectance (SR) format from the same years. We employed four standard classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM), and three combined methods: Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) with Natural Breaks (NB), Otsu Method (OM) and SVM, to extract and classify forest areas. Our study had two objectives: (1) to accurately assess changes in forest cover over a 17-year period and (2) to determine the most efficient methods for extracting and classifying forest areas. We validated the results using performance metrics that quantify both thematic and spatial accuracy. Our results indicate a 9% loss of forest cover in the study area, representing 577 ha with an average decrease ratio of 33.9 ha/year(-1). Of all the methods used, SVM produced the best results (with an average score of 88% for Overall Quality (OQ)), followed by RF (with a mean value of 86% for OQ).

TI  - Review on Main Arboviruses Circulating on French Guiana, An Ultra-Peripheric European Region in South America
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - French Guiana (FG), a French overseas territory in South America, is susceptible to tropical diseases, including arboviruses. The tropical climate supports the proliferation and establishment of vectors, making it difficult to control transmission. In the last ten years, FG has experienced large outbreaks of imported arboviruses such as Chikungunya and Zika, as well as endemic arboviruses such as dengue, Yellow fever, and Oropouche virus. Epidemiological surveillance is challenging due to the differing distributions and behaviors of vectors. This article aims to summarize the current knowledge of these arboviruses in FG and discuss the challenges of arbovirus emergence and reemergence. Effective control measures are hampered by the nonspecific clinical presentation of these diseases, as well as the Aedes aegypti mosquito's resistance to insecticides. Despite the high seroprevalence of certain viruses, the possibility of new epidemics cannot be ruled out. Therefore, active epidemiological surveillance is needed to identify potential outbreaks, and an adequate sentinel surveillance system and broad virological diagnostic panel are being developed in FG to improve disease management.

TI  - SAR Coherence in Detecting Fluvial Sediment Transport Events in Arid Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coherence change detection (CCD) is a remote sensing technique used to map phenomena that, under certain conditions, can be directly related to changes in Interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence. Mapping the areas affected by sediment transport events in arid environments is one of the most common applications of CCD. However, the reliability of these maps remains an unsolved issue. This paper focuses on verifying that InSAR coherence is indeed able to detect all the fluvial sediment transport events that have actually mobilised sediments in arid environments by building a classification model and validating its results. The proposed methodology is tested in three study areas in Salar de Atacama, Chile, using three years of Sentinel data plus a fourth year for validation, and meteorological records of rainfall, the relative humidity of the air and snow cover. The results prove that InSAR coherence can be used to remotely detect sediment transport events related to flash floods in arid environments, that it might have a greater detection ability than meteorological records and that the perpendicular baseline does have a relevant effect on the InSAR coherence that needs to be considered. All these findings will increase the reliability of maps based on InSAR coherence. In addition, the proposed method will allow focusing the mapping tasks only on the relevant dates and, once calibrated, the classification model will enable the automatised remote detection of new events.

TI  - Spruce Bark Beetle Outbreak Prediction through Automatic Classification of Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, posing a threat to forest ecosystems and eliciting forest-pest outbreaks. In the southern Italian Alps, a dramatic windthrow called Vaia occurred in October 2018, shifting populations of the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) from an endemic to an epidemic phase. Remote-sensing methods are often employed to detect areas affected by disturbances, such as forest-pest outbreaks, over large regions. In this study, a random forest model on the Sentinel-2 images acquired over the south-eastern Alps in 2021 and 2022 was used to detect the outbreak spots. The automatic classification model was tested and validated by exploiting ground data collected through a survey conducted in 2021 and 2022 in both healthy and infested spots, characterized by variable sizes and degrees of infestation. The model correctly identified the forest conditions (healthy or infested) with an overall accuracy of 72% for 2022 and 58% for 2021. These results highlight the possibility of locating I. typographus outbreaks, even in small spots (between 5 and 50 trees) or spots intermixed with healthy trees. The prompt detection of areas with a higher frequency of outbreaks could be a useful tool to integrate field surveys and select forest areas in which to concentrate management operations.

TI  - Improving crop yield prediction accuracy by embedding phenological heterogeneity into model parameter sets
T2  - AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - CONTEXT: The assimilation of Remote Sensing (RS) data into crop models improves the accuracy of yield pre-dictions by considering crop growth dynamics and their spatial heterogeneity due to the different management practices and environmental conditions. OBJECTIVE: This study proposes a new method for performing sub-regional yield predictions (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS-3 level) using RS time series data and crop models. The primary objective was to release a procedure whereby the heterogeneity of the agricultural landscape (i.e. the agrophenotypes) observed from RS is used to drive crop model calibration.METHODS: Fine-resolution barley and maize distribution maps (100 m) and related crop calendars have been used to derive the "where" and "when" of the 8-day MODIS NDVI time series data, located in Apulia, Tuscany, and Veneto in 2018-2019. Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Clustering have been applied to NDVI seasonal profiles to identify the agrophenotypes, which have been used to derive crop growth and leaf area index dynamics. These data served as the reference to optimize the most relevant parameters of the WOFOST_GT model, using gridded weather data as input (0.25 degrees resolution, Copernicus ERA5). Parameter distributions from multiple automatic calibrations have been sampled to characterize the agricultural heterogeneity within 22 NUTS-3 administrative units. Yield statistics from the Italian National Institute of Statistics have been used as reference data to test the accuracy of the yield simulation by the crop model WOFOST_GT.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The agrophenotypes reflected the wide north-south latitudinal gradient experi-enced in Italy by the two crops, leading to a gap of 15-30 days in barley and maize flowering and harvest dates across the study area. Average Nast-Sutcliffe modelling efficiency in reproducing LAI dynamics from RS (0.6) and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) in predicting yield data (12.1% for barley, 3.7% for maize) in hindcast simulations demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. The average RRMSE was reduced by 32.7% (barley) and 8.5% (maize) compared to baseline, decreasing by 0.7-1 Mg ha-1 absolute yield errors on both crops.SIGNIFICANCE: The inclusion of local agrophenotypes in the yield prediction workflow reduced errors in yield prediction compared to unsupervised simulations at NUTS-3 level. The script for agrophenotypes extraction and the model parameter sets are released to the scientific community, to foster improvements and further appli-cations to other crops, ecoclimatic regions, satellite sensors and spatial scales.

TI  - Future flooding of the Volta Delta caused by sea level rise and land subsidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Volta Delta (Ghana, West Africa) is increasingly impacted by Sea Level Rise (SLR). SLR renders the Volta Delta mostly vulnerable to flooding, salinization of water resources and agricultural fields, and permanent loss of lands. This would potentially threaten its population, infrastructure and economy, and could be worsened by land subsidence (LS). Relative Sea Level Rise (RSLR) in this study is the rate of LS with respect to SLR. It is thus very important to precisely quantify LS rates together with SLR and plan and assess countermeasures. This study presents and discusses recent LS rates in the Volta Delta derived from satellite-based SAR-Interferometry and their impact on relative SLR. Sentinel-1 scenes acquired between 2015 and 2021 were used to quantify recent LS in the study area. The Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PS-InSAR) technique was applied, which allowed for estimating displacement rates of coherent backscatter targets with mm/yr precision. Separate analyses of time series for the Keta lagoon and Songor lagoon areas of the delta give insight into the vertical land movements, with irregularly distributed average rates of up to 4 mm/yr. LS in the Volta Delta is due to various causes, most prominently natural compaction of young deltaic sediments, but also aquifer over-exploitation and salt mining, and probably increasingly less compensated by a drop in sediment supply due to damming. Furthermore, projection of future elevation projections by RSLR was assessed by combining the observed LS rates with three IPCC representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. The RSLR impact assessments computed revealed that by 2100, more than 20% of the Volta Delta districts could potentially be below MSL for all the addressed RCP scenarios, including the fragile but key sand barriers surrounded by water bodies. The study is, however, a preliminary investigation and recommends further local ground-based LS investigations to calibrate PS-InSAR outcome, thus improving our understanding of the areas driving critical present and future changes in the Volta Delta.

TI  - Deciphering Small-Scale Seasonal Surface Dynamics of Rock Glaciers in the Central European Alps Using DInSAR Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Essential Climate Variable (ECV) Permafrost is currently undergoing strong changes due to rising ground and air temperatures. Surface movement, forming characteristic landforms such as rock glaciers, is one key indicator for mountain permafrost. Monitoring this movement can indicate ongoing changes in permafrost; therefore, rock glacier velocity (RGV) has recently been added as an ECV product. Despite the increased understanding of rock glacier dynamics in recent years, most observations are either limited in terms of the spatial coverage or temporal resolution. According to recent studies, Sentinel-1 (C-band) Differential SAR Interferometry (DInSAR) has potential for monitoring RGVs at high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, the suitability of DInSAR for the detection of heterogeneous small-scale spatial patterns of rock glacier velocities was never at the center of these studies. We address this shortcoming by generating and analyzing Sentinel-1 DInSAR time series over five years to detect small-scale displacement patterns of five high alpine permafrost environments located in the Central European Alps on a weekly basis at a range of a few millimeters. Our approach is based on a semi-automated procedure using open-source programs (SNAP, pyrate) and provides East-West displacement and elevation change with a ground sampling distance of 5 m. Comparison with annual movement derived from orthophotos and unpiloted aerial vehicle (UAV) data shows that DInSAR covers about one third of the total movement, which represents the proportion of the year suited for DInSAR, and shows good spatial agreement (Pearson R: 0.42-0.74, RMSE: 4.7-11.6 cm/a) except for areas with phase unwrapping errors. Moreover, the DInSAR time series unveils spatio-temporal variations and distinct seasonal movement dynamics related to different drivers and processes as well as internal structures. Combining our approach with in situ observations could help to achieve a more holistic understanding of rock glacier dynamics and to assess the future evolution of permafrost under changing climatic conditions.

TI  - Journals of Vyatka Seminarians of 1905-1907: Verbal and Visual Content of Socio-Political Protest
T2  - BYLYE GODY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is an analysis of satirical journals published by Vyatka seminarians during the years of the First Russian Revolution; they are a historical source that reflects the social mood of the student youth of those years. The basis for the study of sources was handwritten journals of Vyatka seminarians distributed on a hectograph, materials from all-Russian and regional periodicals, documents characterizing the learning process at the Vyatka Theological Seminary. The analysis of the studied materials that arose in the seminarian environment during the period of censorship restriction and ideological pluralism turned out to be quite promising in identifying the features of the formation of the worldview of young people. The studied illustrative material (first of all, cartoons) made it possible to identify the specifics of reflection and self -reflection of Russian youth (on the example of seminarian students) of the revolutionary era. The authors come to the conclusion that the socio-political protest of Vyatka seminarians, vividly presented on the pages of their satirical publications, was the result of objective social processes. In addition to the revolutionary events, factors such as the outdated system of training and education of seminarians, the predominance of spiritual literature in the educational process, the edifying tone of teaching, disregard for the views and personal position of the seminarian also played a role. Texts and caricatures in hectographic publications testify to the influence of the Social democratic press on seminarians, as well as well-known satirical publications in Russia. The materials involved allow us to state that the protest moods of the students were strong in the Vyatka Theological Seminary, expressed both in the spread of nihilism and unbelief, and in the involvement of some of the pupils in the revolutionary movement.

TI  - Extraction of Rocky Desertification Information in the Karst Area Based on the Red-NIR-SWIR Spectral Feature Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The complex topography, severe surface fragmentation and landscape heterogeneity of the karst region of southwest China make it extremely difficult to extract information on rocky desertification in the region. In order to overcome the disadvantages of the surface parameter-based feature space approach, which is difficult to construct and apply, this study uses the reflectance of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) in the red (Red), near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands as the feature variables, and establishes a two-dimensional SWIR-NIR, Red-NIR and SWIR-Red reflectance spectral feature space. The three models of perpendicular rocky desertification index 1 (PRDI1), perpendicular rocky desertification index 2 (PRDI2) and perpendicular rocky desertification index 3 (PRDI3) were also constructed based on the variation of the degree of rocky desertification in each spectral feature space. The accuracy of the rocky desertification extracted by these three index models was verified and compared with the karst rocky desertification index (KRDI) and rocky desertification difference index (RSDDI), which are constructed based on the surface parameter feature space. The results show that: (1) The waveband reflectance-based feature space model provides a new method for large-scale rocky desertification information extraction, characterized by easy data acquisition, simple index calculation and good stability, and is conducive to the monitoring and quantitative analysis of rocky desertification in karst areas. (2) The overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of PRDI1 are 0.829 and 0.784, respectively, both higher than other index models, showing the best applicability, accuracy and effectiveness in rocky desertification information extraction. (3) According to the results extracted from PRDI1, the total area of rocky desertification in Huaxi District of Guizhou province is 320.44 km(2), with the more serious grades of rocky desertification, such as severe and moderate, mainly distributed in the southwestern, western and southeastern areas of Huaxi District. This study provides important information on the total area and spatial distribution of different degrees of rocky desertification in the study area, and these results can be used to support the local government's ecological and environmental management decisions. The method proposed in this study is a scientific and necessary complement to the characteristic spatial methods based on different surface parameters, and can provide important methodological support for the rapid and efficient monitoring of karstic rocky desertification over large areas.

TI  - Study on the Effects of NO<sub>2</sub> Pollution Under COVID-19 Epidemic Prevention and Control in Urumqi
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the impact of the new crown epidemic prevention and control measures on NO2 pollution in Urumqi, and to promote air pollution control more effectively. In this study, based on the combination of OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite remote sensing hyperspectral technology and ground monitoring data, the NO2 dry deposition flux was estimated. To study the NO2 diffusion trajectory and potential sources in Urumqi City during epidemic prevention and control in 2019-2021. Using night light data, the Baidu map heat map tool, and AutoNavi map POI (Point Of Interface) functional area, the source of NO2 pollution in Urumqi was further analyzed and discussed. The research shows that: (1) The overall performance of NO2 concentration in Urumqi City is: Xincheng Districts>Shayibak Districts >Tianshan Districts >Shuimogou Districts> Midong District, the comparison between 2020 (epidemic outbreak period) and 2019 (pre-epidemic period) during the same period. It is found that the NO2 concentration in each urban area has decreased significantly, among which the Shaybak District has the largest decrease of 47. 63%. The comparison between 2021 (post-epidemic era) and 2020 (epidemic outbreak period) shows that the NO2 concentration in each urban area has gradually recovered. The Ibarque district saw the largest increase, at 60. 09 %. The urban thermal conditions are as follows: Tianshan District>Shayibak District>Shuimogou District>Xincheng District>Midong District. The urban thermal conditions and NO2 concentration changes are roughly the same, and the urban population agglomeration in Midong District is the lowest, so the urban thermal value and NO2 concentration are both the lowest. (2) The long tributaries are transported in the long-distance northwest direction. The farthest distance is from Kazakhstan, and the airflow accounts for the largest proportion, reaching 80. 32%. The short tributaries mainly come from and around Urumqi, and the air flow accounts for 19. 69%. NO2 is a short-lived gas, so the short-distance transportation of air flow has a greater impact on NO2 in Urumqi. The probabilities of the potential source regions passed by various types of airflow are relatively consistent in the spatial distribution. The potential source contributions simulated by the PSCF analysis method have great credibility. (3) Analyze the atmospheric system as a gray system, and divide it into: standard coal consumption>secondary industry>total industrial output value> industrial electricity consumption> population density> car ownership> tertiary industry> primary industry. Under static and stable weather conditions, the dry deposition flux was estimated based on OMI satellite remote sensing data. This method can compensate for the shortage of ground monitoring and provide evidence for the estimation of dry deposition flux.

TI  - Stereoscopic Monitoring Methods for Flood Disasters Based on ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has led to an increased frequency of extreme precipitation events, resulting in increased damage from rainstorms and floods. Rapid and efficient flood forecasting is crucial. However, traditional hydrological simulation methods that rely on site distribution are limited by the limited availability of data and cannot provide fast and accurate flood monitoring information. Therefore, this study took the flood event in Huoqiu County in 2020 as an example and proposes a three-dimensional flood monitoring method based on active and passive satellites, which provides effective information support for disaster prevention and mitigation. The experimental results indicated the following: (1) the flood-inundated area was 704.1 km(2), with the Jiangtang Lake section of the Huaihe River and the southern part of Chengdong Lake being the largest affected areas; (2) water levels in the study area ranged from 15.36 m to 17.11 m, which is 4-6 m higher than the original water level. The highest flood water level areas were the Jiangtang Lake section and the flat area in the south of Chengdong Lake, with Chengdong Lake and the north of Chengxi Lake having the greatest water level increase; (3) the flood water depth was primarily between 4 m and 7 m, with a total flood storage capacity of 2833.47 million m(3), with Jiangtang Lake having the largest flood storage capacity; and (4) the rainstorm and flood disaster caused a direct economic loss of approximately CNY 7.5 billion and affected a population of approximately 91 thousand people. Three-dimensional monitoring of floods comprehensively reflects the inundation status of floods and can provide valuable information for flood prediction and management.

TI  - Insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of West Nile virus transmission in emerging scenarios
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The incidence of West Nile fever (WNF) is highly variable in emerging areas, making it difficult to identify risk periods. Using clinical case records has important biases in understanding the transmission dynamics of West Nile virus (WNV) because asymptomatic infections are frequent. However, estimating virus exposure in sentinel species could help achieve this goal at varying spatiotemporal scales. To identify the determinants of inter-annual variation in WNV transmission rates, we designed a 15-year longitudinal seroepidemiological study (2005-2020) in five environmentally diverse areas of southwestern Spain. We modeled individual annual area-dependent exposure risk based on potential environmental and host predictors using generalized linear mixed models. Further, we analyzed the weight of predictors on exposure probability by variance partitioning of the model components. The analysis of 2418 wild ungulate sera (1168 red deer - Cervus elaphus - and 1250 Eurasian wild boar - Sus scrofa) with a highly sensitive commercial blocking ELISA identified an average seroprevalence of 24.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 23.2-26.7%). Antibody prevalence was slightly higher in wild boar (27.5%; CI: 25.1-30.1%) than in deer (22.2%; CI: 19.8-24.7%). We observed a spatial trend in exposure, with higher frequency in the southernmost areas and a slight, although area-dependent, increasing temporal trend. Host-related predictors were important drivers of exposure risk. The environmental predictor with the highest weight was annual cumulative precipitation, while temperature variations were also relevant but with less weight. We observed a coincidence of spatiotemporal changes in exposure with the notification of WNF outbreaks in horses and humans. That indicates the usefulness of wild ungulates as sentinels for WNV transmission and as models to understand its spatiotemporal dynamics. These results will allow the development of more accurate predictive models of spatiotemporal variations in transmission risk that can inform health authorities to take appropriate action.

TI  - Remote-Sensing-Based Sampling Design and Prescription Mapping for Soil Acidity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil acidification is a major problem in the inland Pacific Northwest. A potential solution is the application of lime to neutralize acidity and raise pH. As lime is an expensive input, precision variable rate application is necessary. However, high-resolution mapping of pH and buffer pH for lime prescription requires costly sampling and analysis. To reduce the amount of sampling needed, remote sensing, which correlates with soil pH and buffer pH, can be used to determine optimal sampling locations and allow optimal interpolation. We used soil and crop data from the Washington State University R.J. Cook Agronomy Farm to develop an optimal sampling plan for a farmer's property, followed that sampling design, and used the measured pH and buffer pH to fit a Bayesian hierarchical model using remote sensing variables specific to that farmer's land. Following this, a new model was developed for the research farm with similar covariates. Ultimately, on the farmer's field, we observed a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.2487 for soil pH at a depth of 0-10 cm and 0.1221 for modified Mehlich buffer at 0-10 cm of depth. For the research farm, where buffer pH was not measured, we saw an RMSE of 0.3272 for soil pH at 0-10 cm of depth and 0.3381 for soil pH at 10-20 cm of depth. The ability make predictions of soil acidity with uncertainty using this technique allows for prescription lime application while optimizing soil sampling and testing. Further, this paper serves as a case study of on-farm research.

TI  - RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT & EARLY-CAREER FACULTY: CATALYSTS OF CHANGE FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION IN STEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Problem Statement: Early-career science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) faculty members are often challenged when identifying authentic diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, objectives, and tasks for their research grant proposals. Advancing DEI has not been one person's job but rather the responsibility of a highly organized network within a system. Research development professionals have been and will continue to be critical resources for developing DEI plans and broadening participation. Their value is partly due to relationship-oriented processes that research professionals cultivate and shepherd as well as the inherently cross-disciplinary nature of the day-to-day work. Observation: In FY 19, 53% of the highest growth in R&D was in biological, biomedical, and health sciences followed closely by engineering. While many complexities are involved in advancing DEI within our universities, colleges, and workplaces, this article is focused on early-career STEM faculty and research development professionals' roles to facilitate DEI linkages within research. Analyze: First, descriptions of the recent federal definitions of diversity, equity, and inclusion are provided in research development; This is intended to anchor the discussion and propel the ideation for early-career faculty in federal funding solicitations. Next, a few examples of how early-career STEM faculty engaged in authentic DEI activities with a research development professional are provided. Reflect and Recommend: Finally, five potential DEI partners for collaboration and resources for early-career STEM faculty are provided to support brainstorming as faculty begin to develop their own DEI engagement for research. Context drives design, and research development resources are mechanisms for authentic engagement in DEI for faculty.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Mycorrhizal-Assisted Phytoremediation for the Management of Mining Waste: Opportunities and Challenges to Raw Materials Supply
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, the development of innovative processes permits the application of a circular economy approach to the management and exploitation of mining waste with respect to human health and environment, such that society is changing its fundamentally negative perception of the mining sector. This study presents the opportunities and challenges of supplying raw materials from waste using a remote sensing technique, mycorrhizal-assisted phytoremediation, and hydrometallurgical techniques to transform mining waste from a problem to a resource. Soil/mine wastes from the Sierra Pintada mine (Mendoza, Argentina) were mineralogically and chemically analyzed, and then, a mapping of the mining waste was carried out by Sentinel-2A images to identify areas with similar characteristics. The bioaccumulation of HMs by autochthonous shrubs was also determined to select accumulator plant species, and to evaluate their potential for phytoremediation of mine soils at different technological scales, when they were inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi originated from a mining-impacted area. RMs were recovered from plant biomass by scaling in bioreactors, the depuration module, and hydrometallurgical techniques. The encouraging results highlight that this multidisciplinary approach can be applied to meet the increasing demand for RMs supply and, at the same time, to protect the environment and public health.

TI  - Modelling the dead fuel moisture content in a grassland of Ergun City, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The dead fuel moisture content (DFMC) is the key driver leading to fire occurrence. Accurately estimating the DFMC could help identify locations facing fire risks, prioritise areas for fire monitoring, and facilitate timely deployment of fire-suppression resources. In this study, the DFMC and environmental variables, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, rainfall, atmospheric pressure, soil temperature, and soil humidity, were simultaneously measured in a grassland of Ergun City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China in 2021. We chose three regression models, i.e., random forest (RF) model, extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model, and boosted regression tree (BRT) model, to model the seasonal DFMC according to the data collected. To ensure accuracy, we added time-lag variables of 3 d to the models. The results showed that the RF model had the best fitting effect with an R-2 value of 0.847 and a prediction accuracy with a mean absolute error score of 4.764% among the three models. The accuracies of the models in spring and autumn were higher than those in the other two seasons. In addition, different seasons had different key influencing factors, and the degree of influence of these factors on the DFMC changed with time lags. Moreover, time-lag variables within 44 h clearly improved the fitting effect and prediction accuracy, indicating that environmental conditions within approximately 48 h greatly influence the DFMC. This study highlights the importance of considering 48 h time-lagged variables when predicting the DFMC of grassland fuels and mapping grassland fire risks based on the DFMC to help locate high-priority areas for grassland fire monitoring and prevention.

TI  - Predicting Grassland Fire-Occurrence Probability in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fires greatly threaten the grassland ecosystem, human life, and economic development. However, since limited research focuses on grassland fire prediction, it is necessary to find a better method to predict the probability of grassland-fire occurrence. Multiple environmental variables impact fire occurrence. After selecting natural variables based on remote sensing data and anthropogenic variables, we built regression models of grassland fire probability, taking into account historical fire points and variables in Inner Mongolia. We arrived at three methods to identify grassland fire drivers and predict fire probability: global logistic regression, geographically weighted logistic regression, and random forest. According to the results, the random forest model had the best predictive effect. Nine variables selected by a geographically weighted logistic regression model exercised a spatially unbalanced influence on grassland fires. The three models all showed that meteorological factors and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were of great importance to grassland fire occurrence. In Inner Mongolia, grassland fires occurring in different areas indicated varying responses to the influencing drivers, and areas that differed in their natural and geographical conditions had different fire-prevention periods. Thus, a grassland fire management strategy based on local conditions should be advocated, and existing fire-monitoring systems based on original meteorological factors should be improved by adding remote sensing data of grassland fuels to increase accuracy.

TI  - Pixel-Wise Attention Residual Network for Super-Resolution of Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The deep-learning-based image super-resolution opens a new direction for the remote sensing field to reconstruct further information and details from captured images. However, most current SR works try to improve the performance by increasing the complexity of the model, which results in significant computational costs and memory consumption. In this paper, we propose a lightweight model named pixel-wise attention residual network for optical remote sensor images, which can effectively solve the super-resolution task of multi-satellite images. The proposed method consists of three modules: the feature extraction module, feature fusion module, and feature mapping module. First, the feature extraction module is responsible for extracting the deep features from the input spatial bands with different spatial resolutions. Second, the feature fusion module with the pixel-wise attention mechanism generates weight coefficients for each pixel on the feature map and fully fuses the deep feature information. Third, the feature mapping module is aimed to maintain the fidelity of the spectrum by adding the fused residual feature map directly to the up-sampled low-resolution images. Compared with existing deep-learning-based methods, the major advantage of our method is that for the first time, the pixel-wise attention mechanism is incorporated in the task of super-resolution fusion of remote sensing images, which effectively improved the performance of the fusion network. The accuracy assessment results show that our method achieved superior performance of the root mean square error, signal-to-reconstruction ratio error, universal image quality index, and peak signal noise ratio compared to competing approaches. The improvements in the signal-to-reconstruction ratio error and peak signal noise ratio are significant, with a respective increase of 0.15 and 0.629 dB for Sentinel-2 data, and 0.196 and 1 dB for Landsat data.

TI  - Dynamic Characteristics of Aerosol Optical Properties over Dibrugarh City in the North-Eastern Indian Region during 2018-2021
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play an important role in the earth's environment across the globe through their involvement in various earth system cycles. The change in the aerosol properties may cause short and long-term impacts, the knowledge of such changes is useful in the estimation of the pollution sources of any region. We have carried out the analysis of the aerosols' optical and radiative properties using AERONET station data from 2018 to 2021 in Dibrugarh City. The higher Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values during winter and pre-monsoon months indicate high anthropogenic activities, and biomass burning in Dibrugarh. The impact of various sources and daily meteorological parameters help in understanding the diurnal variations of the AOD, Angstrom Exponent (AE), and column water (CW). Fine aerosol fractions dominate the aerosol volume, but sometimes the long-range transport of dust affects aerosol properties during pre-monsoon months (MAM). MODIS-derived AOD and AERONET AOD values show a good correlation, with R-2 = 0.68. The highest volume of the aerosols reaches up to 0.11 mu m(3) mu m(-2) during pre-monsoon months, whereas it lies below 0.05 mu m(3) mu m(-2) in other seasons. SSA values indicate the presence of scattering aerosols but in 2020, a sudden decline in the SSA values shows a strong rise in the absorbing aerosols. Throughout the study period (2018-2021), the positive radiative forcing indicates a rise in atmospheric heating.

TI  - Snow Cover Mapping Based on SNPP-VIIRS Day/Night Band: A Case Study in Xinjiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed snow cover maps are essential for estimating the earth's energy balance and hydrological cycle. Mapping the snow cover across spatially extensive and topographically complex areas with less or no cloud obscuration is challenging, but the SNPP-VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) nighttime light data offers a potential solution. This paper aims to map snow cover distribution at 750 m resolution across the diverse 1,664,900 km(2) of Xinjiang, China, based on SNPP-VIIRS DNB radiance. We implemented a swarm intelligent optimization technique Krill Herd algorithm, which finds the optimal threshold value by taking Otsu's method as the objective function. We derived SNPP-VIIRS DNB snow maps of 14 consecutive scenes in December 2021, compared our snow-covered area estimations with those from MODIS and AMSR2 standard snow cover products, and generated composite snow maps by merging MODIS and SNPP-VIIRS DNB data. Results show that SNPP-VIIRS DNB snow maps are capable of providing reliable snow cover maps superior to MODIS and AMSR2, with an overall accuracy level of 84.66%. The composite snow maps at 500 m spatial resolution provided 55.85% more information on snow cover distribution than standard MODIS products and achieved an overall accuracy of 84.69%. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of snow cover detection in Xinjiang based on SNPP-VIIRS DNB, which can serve as a supplementary dataset for MODIS estimations where clouded pixels are present.

TI  - Target Classification of Hyperspectral Lidar Based on Optimization Selection of Spatial-Spectral Features
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The refined target classification has always been a research hotspot in remote sensing and is also a prerequisite for studies on biomass calculation, global carbon cycle, and energy flow. With the continuous expansion and refinement in remote sensing detection, more effective and accurate target classification is becoming more complex and difficult. 3D spatial information and rich spectral information are typical attributes of a target, which is significant data support for target classification. Hyperspectral lidars have been successfully designed and structured for target classification to achieve the integrated acquisition of 3D spatial information and spectral information. With an aim at this new type of remote sensing data, how to develop and exploit its potential in target classification is of research significance. Therefore, to realize high-precision recognition and classification under complex scenes, we propose a target classification process of spatial-spectral feature optimization selection dependent on the hyperspectral lidar. This method can not only reduce feature redundancy and select the optimal feature combination for target classification but also reduce computational efficiency and save costs, thereby providing new research ideas for refined target classification with hyperspectral lidar.Methods With the continuous expansion of remote sensing detection, detection targets become more diversified and complicated. Constructing various spatial-spectral features based on spectral information and spatial information is a mainstream method to improve the accuracy of target classification. Based on the technological advantages of the integrated imaging detection of high spatial resolution and hyperspectral resolution, we construct spectral index features of the vegetable index and color index, and geometric features for target classification. Extracting lots of spatial-spectral classification features can enhance the classification accuracy, yet it may produce feature redundancy, increase the calculation cost, affect the classification efficiency, and even lead to declining classification accuracy. Therefore, we put forward a target classification process of spatial-spectral features optimization selection dependent on the hyperspectral lidar. In the feature space built by the hyperspectral lidar, these spatial-spectral features with the best classification significance are determined based on the marine predator algorithm by iterative search and selection to minimize the classification error. Finally, considering the feature heterogeneity of the selected feature combination, the feature correlation is calculated to eliminate feature redundancy and determine the optimal feature combination, thereby improving classification accuracy.Results and Discussions To further explore the technological advantages of hyperspectral lidar for target classification under complex scenes, and to compare and verify the feasibility and universality of the proposed method, we design six different classification strategies with different feature combinations. Classification results of these feature combinations are determined by a random forest algorithm. Total accuracy, average accuracy, Kappa coefficient, accuracy rate, and recall rate are adopted to evaluate the classification results of each category. Table 4 shows that the six different classification strategies yield sound classification results with the total accuracy higher than 89%, the average accuracy of more than 68%, and Kappa coefficient greater than 0. 85. Compared with the results of the first three classification strategies, the classification results of the fourth strategy which integrates original spectral information, elevation value, index features, and geometrical features, have been greatly improved. Additionally, the overall accuracy can reach 95. 57% with the average accuracy of 84. 37% and the Kappa coefficient of 0. 9380, whereas the elapsed time is the longest at 5. 16 s. The predicted result of target labels is shown in Fig. 6( d). Based on the spatial-spectral feature optimization selection method, the optimal feature combination could be determined to eliminate feature redundancy and enhance classification accuracy. The overall accuracy and average accuracy are increased by 1. 56% and 4. 36%, respectively, and the elapsed time is reduced by 1. 55 s. The predicted results of target labels are shown in Fig. 8(f). The classification results demonstrate that this method can determine the optimal spatial-spectral features for target classification, and provide a new research idea for refined target classification with hyperspectral lidar.Conclusions As a new active remote sensing technology, the hyperspectral lidar can combine the technology advantages of passive hyperspectral imaging and lidar scanning imaging and has great application potential in refined target classification under complex scenes. Therefore, we propose a target classification process of spatial- spectral feature optimization selection dependent on the hyperspectral lidar. The index features constructed by the spectral band optimization and geometric features constructed by the local neighborhood surface fitting are extracted and employed to target classification. Finally, the optimal feature combination is determined by the proposed method to achieve highprecision target classification under complex scenes with the scanning scene of 14 different targets. Based on the spatialspectral feature optimization selection to determine the optimal spatial-spectral feature combination, it can effectively eliminate the characteristic redundancy. This increases the overall classification accuracy by 1. 56% and the average classification accuracy by 4. 36%, and the elapsed time is reduced by 1. 55 s. However, there is a certain degree of misclassification because the spatial structures of some targets are so complex that the laser irradiates to the edge of targets or only part of the laser irradiates to the surface of a target, thus leading to a large deviation in spectrum acquirement. The classification results could be smoothed by the boundary algorithm or conditional random field algorithm to eliminate the salt and pepper noise and improve the classification accuracy.

TI  - Evaluation the Performance of Three Types of Two-Source Evapotranspiration Models in Urban Woodland Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The determination of the evapotranspiration (ET) and its components in urban woodlands is crucial to mitigate the urban heat island effect and improve sustainable urban development. However, accurately estimating ET in urban areas is more difficult and challenging due to the heterogeneity of the underlying surface and the impact of human activities. In this study, we compared the performance of three types of classic two-source ET models on urban woodlands in Shenzhen, China. The three ET models include a pure physical and process-based ET model (Shuttleworth-Wallace model), a semi-empirical and physical process-based ET model (FAO dual-K-c model), and a purely statistical and process-based ET model (deep neural network). The performance of the three models was validated using an eddy correlation and stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope observations. The verification results suggested that the Shuttleworth-Wallace model achieved the best performance in the ET simulation at main urban area site (coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.75). The FAO-56 dual K-c model performed best in the ET simulation at the suburb area site (R-2 of 0.77). The deep neural network could better capture the nonlinear relationship between ET and various environmental variables and achieved the best simulation performance in both of the main urban and suburb sites (R-2 of 0.73 for the main urban and suburb sites, respectively). A correlation analysis showed that the simulation of urban ET is most sensitive to temperature and least sensitive to wind speed. This study further analyzed the causes for the varying performance of the three classic ET models from the model mechanism. The results of the study are of great significance for urban temperature cooling and sustainable urban development.

TI  - Retrieving the Kinematic Process of Repeated-Mining-Induced Landslides by Fusing SAR/InSAR Displacement, Logistic Model, and Probability Integral Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of underground minerals in hilly regions is highly susceptible to landslides, which requires the application of InSAR techniques to monitor the surface displacement. However, repeated mining for multiple coal seams can cause a large displacement beyond the detectable gradient of the traditional InSAR technique, making it difficult to explore the relationship between landslides and subsurface excavations in both temporal and spatial domains. In this study, the Tengqing landslide in Shuicheng, Guizhou, China, was chosen as the study area. Firstly, the large-gradient surface displacement in the line of sight was obtained by the fusion of SAR offset tracking and interferometric phase. Subsequently, a multi-segment logistic model was proposed to simulate the temporal effect induced by repeated mining activities. Next, a simplified probability integral method (SPIM) was utilized to invert the geometry of the mining tunnel and separate the displacement of the mining subsidence and landslide. Finally, the subsurface mining parameters and in situ investigation were carried out to assess the impact of mining and precipitation on the kinematic process of Tengqing landslides. Results showed that the repeated mining activities in Tengqing can not only cause land subsidence and rock avalanches at the top of the mountain, but also accelerate the landslide displacement. The technical approach presented in this study can provide new insights for monitoring and modeling the effects of repeated mining-induced landslides in mountainous areas.

TI  - Quantifying the Impact of Hydrological Connectivity on Salt Marsh Vegetation in the Liao River Delta Wetland
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes play a critical role in ecological functioning and have significant economic value. Hydrological elements are considered to be one of the major contributors to salt marsh degradation. However, how hydrological connectivity affects salt marshes remains poorly investigated at fine scales. This paper used spatial analysis and statistical methods to investigate the impact of hydrological connectivity on the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of salt marsh vegetation in two natural succession areas of the Liao River Delta wetland in 2020 and 2021 by selecting vegetation area, NDVI, tidal creeks area, distance to tidal creeks, and the Index of Connectivity, using 1 m Gaofen-2 data and 0.2 m aerial topographic data. The study found that the area and growth status of vegetation and the overall connectivity in 2021 were better than that in 2020, while the west bank of the Liao River was better than that on the east bank. Phragmites australis showed a round island distribution pattern primarily at the end of tidal creeks. The differences between different hydrological connectivity and vegetation area were significant in 2021. The vegetation area was the largest under poor and moderate connectivity. We also found that within a distance range of 0-6 m from tidal creeks, the vegetation area increased with increasing distance, but beyond 6 m, the vegetation area decreased with increasing distance. Our results showed that poor and moderate connectivity conditions were more suitable for vegetation growth. The threshold value of 6 m can provide an important reference for wetland vegetation restoration in the Liao River Delta wetland.

TI  - Analysis of the Characteristics and Ideas of Ancient Urban Land-Use Based on GIS and an Algorithm: A Case Study of Chang'an City in the Sui and Tang Dynasties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As ancient cities are spaces that represent the development of civilization, it is worth exploring and studying their characteristics and conceptions of land use. In this regard, the focus has turned to the issue of how to achieve the efficient mining of massive urban remote sensing data through human-computer collaboration. In this paper, a new intelligent method of analyzing urban land use characteristics and their cultural significance is proposed; it is feasible, effective, accurate, manageable, and portable. The method is based on a geographic information system (GIS) and a specific algorithm. The city plan was calibrated with the help of satellite remote sensing images and sites. By constructing the "urban element area acquisition and analysis model", various operations for areas in the city plan were realized, including an area value calculation, land use structure calculation, area modulus analysis, area ratio analysis between areas, and determination of the cultural significance of numbers and ratios. Taking the Sui and Tang dynasties capital city of Chang'an as an example, we found the existence of a set of urban planning techniques through area modulus (standard area units) for the first time; it took the market area as the modulus A and the area of Daxing Palace as the expanded modulus 2A, made the area of important areas in the city an integer multiplied by the modulus value (for example, the overall scope of the city is 100A, the rectangular urban area is 90A, and the small city area is 10A), and made the key values and numerical ratios have a cultural significance (such as 4.5, 5.5, 10, 25, 30, 100, 12:10, 1.618:1, 9:5, 45:1, 2:1), reflecting the planning and design concept of the capital city, into which the ancient Chinese deliberately integrated "number, shape and meaning". In addition, we carried out supplementary verification with the Roman city of Timgad and the Japanese city of Heijo-kyo, discovering that they also have design methods for area planning. We believe that land use planning can better meet the practical needs of urban resource distribution. Compared with urban form design, it might have chronological precedence. By setting the area modulus and the modulus value of each area, the grid-shaped city achieves the rational distribution of land and the establishment of order in an efficient way, and this thought and operation method greatly contributed to the advancement of ancient civilizations.

TI  - Relationship between Urban Spatial Pattern and Thermal Environment Response: Taking Hefei Urban Area as an Example
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - With the continuous expansion of cities, the land cover type of the region is transformed, a large number of natural landscapes are replaced by man-made landscapes, and the environmental temperature rises. The study of the response relationship between urban spatial pattern and thermal environment provides some guidance for improving the ecological environment and optimizing the urban spatial layout. Based on the Landsat 8 series remote sensing image data of Hefei City in 2020 and analysis platforms such as ENVI and ARCGIS, Pearson correlation and profile lines were used to reflect the correlation between the two. Then, the three spatial pattern components with the greatest correlation were selected to construct multiple regression functions to investigate the influence of urban spatial pattern on urban thermal environment and its mechanism of action. The results showed that: (1) the high temperature area of Hefei City increased significantly with the advance of time during 2013-2020. For different seasons, the urban heat island effect showed that summer >autumn >spring >winter. (2) In the central urban area, the building occupancy, building height, imperviousness occupancy, and population density were significantly higher than those in the suburbs, whereas fractional vegetation coverage presented a higher suburban than urban area and mainly showed a point distribution in the urban area and an irregular distribution of water bodies. (3) The urban high-temperature zone was mainly distributed in various development zones in urban areas, whereas other places in urban areas were dominated by medium-high temperature and above-temperature zoning, and suburban areas were dominated by medium-low temperature. (4) The Pearson coefficients between the spatial pattern of each element and the thermal environment were positively correlated with the building occupancy (0.395), impervious surface occupancy (0.333), population density (0.481), and building height (0.188) and negatively correlated with fractional vegetation coverage (-0.577) and water occupancy (-0.384). The coefficients of the constructed multiple regression functions, including building occupancy, population density, and fractional vegetation coverage, were 8.372, 0.295, and -5.639 respectively, with a constant of 38.555. The results of this study can provide a reference basis for optimizing urban spatial layouts and improving urban living quality.

TI  - High-Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth Retrieval in Urban Areas Based on Sentinel-2
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, an improved aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieval algorithm is proposed based on Sentinel-2 and AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data. The surface reflectance for AOD retrieval was estimated from the image that had minimal aerosol contamination in a temporal window determined by AERONET data. Validation of the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals was conducted against four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites located in Beijing. The results show that the Sentinel-2 AOD retrievals are highly consistent with the AERONET AOD measurements (R = 0.942), with 85.56% falling within the expected error. The mean absolute error and the root-mean-square error are 0.0688 and 0.0882, respectively. In addition, the AOD distribution map obtained by this algorithm well reflects the fine-spatial-resolution changes in AOD distribution. These results suggest that the improved high-resolution AOD retrieval algorithm is robust and has the potential advantage of retrieving high-resolution AOD over urban areas.

TI  - A diagrammatic summary of updated NICE melanoma guidance: A simple way to mitigate human factors in MDTs and clinics
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published an updated guideline on melanoma assessment and management in July 2022, which has included recommendation on BRAF analysis of primary melanoma tissue samples, staging with sentinel lymph node biopsy, guidance on patient follow-up as well as surveillance imaging requirement based on patients' melanoma stages. However, very often, assimilating this considerable amount of information in an efficient and accurate way can be challenging, especially in the setting of a busy multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting. Human factors are well recognised as a key principle to mitigate against mistakes and human errors and thereby aiming to optimise patient care. To date, there is very limited literature available on the subject of the role of human factors in the context of MDT meetings. In recent years, the numbers and complexity of patients in cancer MDT meetings have grown significantly. Long MDT meetings could lead to distraction, loss of attention span, miscommunication, missed information, and hence increasing the risk of clinical error. We present a diagrammatic summary of the most recent NICE guidance for melanoma follow-up that is currently being used locally in our department. This aims to offer clarity and ease of use to help health care professionals to check patients' treatment pathways. It can also be included in patients' medical record for annotation or reference in future follow-up clinics, which is a simple measure to mitigate the risks of human factors, as well as ensuring consistency in continuity of patient care.& COPY; 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

TI  - Trend Analysis of Vegetation Changes of Korean Fir<i> (Abies</i><i> koreana</i> Wilson) in Hallasan and Jirisan Using MODIS Imagery
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Korean fir (Abies koreana Wilson) is one of the most important environmental indicator tree species for assessing climate change impacts on coniferous forests in the Korean Peninsula. However, due to the nature of alpine and subalpine regions, it is difficult to conduct regular field surveys of Korean fir, which is mainly distributed in regions with altitudes greater than 1,000 m. Therefore, this study analyzed the vegetation change trend of Korean fir using regularly observed remote sensing data. Specifically, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), land surface temperature (LST), and precipitation data from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM from September 2003 to 2020 for Hallasan and Jirisan were used to analyze vegetation changes and their association with environmental variables. We identified a decrease in NDVI in 2020 compared to 2003 for both sites. Based on the NDVI difference maps, areas for healthy vegetation and high mortality of Korean fir were selected. Long-term NDVI time-series analysis demonstrated that both Hallasan and Jirisan had a decrease in NDVI at the high mortality areas (Hallasan: -0.46, Jirisan: -0.43). Furthermore, when analyzing the long-term fluctuations of Korean fir vegetation through the Hodrick-Prescott filter-applied NDVI, LST, and precipitation, the NDVI difference between the Korean fir healthy vegetation and high mortality sites increased with the increasing LST and decreasing precipitation in Hallasan. This suggests that the increase in LST and the decrease in precipitation contribute to the decline of Korean fir in Hallasan. In contrast, Jirisan confirmed a long-term trend of declining NDVI in the areas of Korean fir mortality but did not find a significant correlation between the changes in NDVI and environmental variables (LST and precipitation). Further analyses of environmental factors, such as soil moisture, insolation, and wind that have been identified to be related to Korean fir habitats in previous studies should be conducted. This study demonstrated the feasibility of using satellite data for long-term monitoring of Korean fir ecosystems and investigating their changes in conjunction with environmental conditions. This study provided the potential for satellite-based monitoring to improve our understanding of the ecology of Korean fir.

TI  - A Cross-Source Image Point Cloud Registration Method Combined with Graph Theory
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective With the development of optical photogrammetry technologies, there are more and more means to perceive three- dimensional (3D) point clouds that describe the same object or scene. Through satellite photogrammetry, we can quickly obtain dense urban point clouds in a wide area, but the surface information of the target is not clear because the sensor is too far away, and even the data collected by the close-range platform has fine structure and texture information. However, when there is no precise positioning system or absolute control points, the generated point cloud is in an arbitrary model coordinate system. The rapid and high- precision registration between large- scale point clouds of close-range images and point clouds of satellite images has great potential for applications such as smart city construction, disaster relief, and emergency response. However, there are many problems in this task, which makes it difficult to achieve efficient registration between the two. For example, the resolution of satellite images and close- range images is different, which leads to a large difference in the point density between the two point clouds. As the sensor's line of sight is blocked, there are many holes in point clouds of images. The scale difference in the coordinate system between the closerange point cloud and the satellite point cloud is arbitrary. The image point cloud contains a large number of noise points and outliers because of defects in the dense image-matching algorithm. To this end, an efficient cross- source image point cloud registration method is proposed on the basis of graph theory, which is automatic, fast, and robust. It is believed that the proposed basic registration strategy and graph-matching method can be helpful for the data fusion and reconstruction of large-scale satellite image point clouds and close- range image point clouds.Methods First of all, the ground plane direction in the point cloud is found through the geometric features of the point cloud. The rotation angle of the planar normal vector with respect to the vertical direction of the satellite point cloud is calculated so that the close-range point cloud is roughly aligned with the satellite point cloud on the ground. Then, the centers of the buildings are taken as the nodes, and the layout relationship of buildings in the point cloud is constructed into a graph, which transforms the point cloud registration problem into a graph-matching problem. Afterward, kernel triangles are constructed according to geometric constraints as registration primitives, and higher-order similarity information is used to find the global optimal match of graphs. Finally, the ICP algorithm is adopted for fine registration to obtain highprecision and cross-source point cloud registration results.Results and Discussions The point cloud of the Gaofen- 7 satellite images and the point cloud of UAV close-range images in three regions of Henan Province are selected for experiments to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. There are 22 pairs, 13 pairs, and 11 pairs of nodes that are matched in the three experiments (Fig. 3). In the three experiments with different numbers of holes and noise points, the graph with higher- order similarity information can accurately obtain a sufficient number of matching nodes, overcoming the density and scale differences. Upon the application of the ICP algorithm, the integrated point clouds are obtained, which not only show rich geometric structure and texture details but also have real geographic coordinates (Fig. 4). The coarse registration algorithm based on graph matching enables the ICP algorithm to avoid falling into a local optimal solution, which has good registration accuracy on three datasets of different scales, densities, and noise. The root- mean- square errors of the three experiments are only 5. 16 m, 6. 39 m, and 9. 02 m ( Table 2). Finally, the existing four algorithms are used to register three experimental datasets in this paper (Fig. 5) for the performance comparison with the proposed registration method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is independent of noise points and outliers. It can overcome the density differences of different point clouds and eliminate coordinate scale differences of about 939 times. The overall registration speed is improved by a factor of 51-184 compared to that of the comparison methods, and the proposed method is automatic, robust, and efficient.Conclusions This paper mainly studies the scale differences, density differences, noise points, and outlier problems in the registration of satellite-image point clouds and close- range image point clouds. A novel point cloud registration method is proposed, which transforms the point cloud registration problem into a graph- matching problem according to graph theory. The centers of buildings are taken as the nodes, and the layout relationship of buildings in the point cloud is constructed into a graph. Kernel triangles are constructed pursuant to geometric constraints as registration primitives. Then, a graph-matching method using the higher-order similarity information of the graph is presented to obtain the spatial transformation model, and the ICP algorithm is used for fine registration. Finally, experiments are conducted on highresolution satellite-image point clouds and close-range image point clouds in three different regions of Henan Province. The close-range point cloud containing structure and texture details is successfully converted to the spatial coordinate system of the satellite point cloud, and a refined 3D point cloud with real geographic coordinates is obtained. Multiple sets of experimental data show that the proposed method can robustly and quickly register cross-source image point clouds in contrast with other methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - A fish kill is characterised by the death of a large number of fish in a given area within a short period of time. This is an indicator that water quality and ecosystem conditions in general have deteriorated. Remote sensing data from the MODIS instrument on the Aqua and Merra-2 satellites were accessed from 18 to 22 March 2020, a period that spans before and after the fish kill was reported. Analysis of the remote sensing data shows that the fish kill was preceded by strong winds, i.e. major and sustained wind events. The maps of sea surface temperatures prior to the fish kill show that high-temperature water masses flowed from the equator toward the Bonny-Andoni coast. The dates of occurrence of the high-temperature surface water masses and high wind events around the Bonny-Andoni coastal area were consistent with the location and timing of the fish kill, as indicated by community reports. We hypothesise that the low-oxygen, high-temperature surface water masses passing from the equator on the windward side of the coast may have encountered migrating croakers and trapped an entire school of this benthopelagic fish species, causing acute respiratory distress. The results and hypothesis confirm local reports of gasping fish about 2 nautical miles off the Bonny-Andoni coast. This study confirms the relationship between wind patterns, temperature, and fish kills, providing the first empirical account of probable causes. Because fish kills occur episodically and often leave no trace, this report and future analyses of remote sensing data may be the best way to elucidate this event.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Covurlui Plateau, a subunit of the Moldavian Plateau located in eastern Romania, possesses a high natural agricultural potential, significantly impacted by soil erosion, particularly gully erosion. The only inventory in the Moldavian Plateau that comprises approximately 9000 gullies extracted from topographical maps was conducted during the 90s. Nowadays, with the advent of advanced techniques and geodata, such as GIS software, aerial photograms, high-resolution satellite images, and high-resolution digital elevation models, we aim to achieve an (1) up-to-date comprehensive inventory of gully head-cuts and (2) a very detailed mapping of the spatial distribution of gullied lands. Firstly, the gully head-cuts were inventoried for the entire region using platforms such as Google, Esri, and Bing, through the QuickMapService plugin within QGIS 3.16 software, with the assistance of Landsat and Sentinel satellite images. Secondly, the automatic mapping of gullies was carried out using a 5 m high-resolution Digital Elevation Model and the Topographic Openness module offered by SAGA GIS software through QGIS software. As a result, we identified 5868 gully head-cuts for the Covurlui Plateau, with an average density of 2.57 gully head-cuts per square kilometer. Additionally, the identified gullies occupy over 3570 hectares, representing 1.57% of the total area. Overall, the topographic openness index proves to be an efficient tool for the semi-automatic extraction of gullies from high-resolution digital elevation models.

TI  - Constructing of Tidal Flat Extraction Index in Coastal Zones Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to accurately determine the spatial distribution of tidal flats in intertidal zones due to periodic tidal inundation. Therefore, it is urgent to use remotely-sensed technology to detect the spectral variation characteristics of tidal flats, construct a tidal flat extraction index, and then provide methods and basic data support for flat tidal interpretation. Based on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images, this research analyzed the spectral reflectance differences of different land cover types in the high- and low-tide images and then determined the bands that can reflect flat tidal characteristics. Finally, a tidal flat recognition index was proposed by mathematical combination. The proposed tidal flat index is studied: (1) the proposed tidal flat recognition index was applied to three study areas with different tidal flat types, and the tidal flat recognition index' s separability and applicability to different tidal flat types are studied. The results showed that the proposed tidal flat recognition index showed a good performance on tidal flat separability compared with other land cover types and is applicable to different types of sandy and muddy tidal flats; (2) the applicability of the tidal flat recognition index to different classification methods (including minimum distance method, maximum likelihood method and support vector machine) is studied. The results showed that the overall accuracy is greater than 93% and the kappa coefficient is greater than 0. 85 for distinguishing tidal flats. The tidal flat recognition index is universal to different classification methods and can effectively improve the accuracy of distinguishing tidal flats; (3) the suitability of the tidal flat recognition index to different remotely-sensed data sources is studied. Compared the Sentinel-2 images with OHS images, the results showed that the tidal flats are distinguished, and the tidal flat recognition index proposed is applicable to different data sources, achieving a higher classification accuracy. This study improves the accuracy of distinguishing tidal flats using remote sensing data, enriches the theory of flat tidal interpretation, and provides theoretical guidance and significance for the scientific management and protection of the coastal.

TI  - An Analysis of the Spatial and Temporal Evolution of the Urban Heat Island in the City of Zhengzhou Using MODIS Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid increase in urbanization has caused severe urban heat island (UHI) effects in China over the past few years. Zhengzhou is one of the emerging cities of China where residents are facing strong impact of UHI. By utilizing MODIS data on land surface temperature (LST) and employing 3S technology, this study investigates the UHI phenomenon in Zhengzhou over a 10-year period (2012-2021), aiming to analyze the spatio-temporal evolution characteristics of the UHI effect and the associated land cover changes. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate annual and seasonal changes in different areas of Zhengzhou. It is noted that in the night-time, the intensity of the heat island is stronger than in daytime, which has moderate and weak heat island areas. Seasonal variation showed that in autumn, Zhengzhou has the strong heat island intensity, followed by summer, and the lowest is in winter and spring. The analysis reveals that built-up (construction) areas exhibit the highest LST, whereas forested land and water bodies have the lowest temperature levels. The findings of this study can serve as reference for reducing UHI and increasing thermal comfort in cities.

TI  - Estimation of aboveground biomass of arboreal species in the semi-arid region of Brazil using SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Caatinga biome is an important ecosystem in the semi-arid region of Brazil. It has significantly degraded due to human activities and is currently a region undergoing desertification. Thus, monitoring the variation in the Caatinga biome has become essential for its sustainable development. However, traditional methods for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) are time-consuming and destructive. Remote sensing, such as optical and radar imaging, can estimate and correlate with vegetation. Nevertheless, radar imaging is still a novelty to be applied in estimating the AGB of this biome, which is an area with little research. Therefore, this study aimed to use Sentinel-1 images to estimate the AGB of the Caatinga biome in Sergipe State (northeastern Brazil) and to verify its influencing factors. Nineteen sample plots (30 mx30 m) were selected, and the stems of individuals with a circumference at breast height (1.3 m above the ground) equal to or greater than 6.0 cm were measured, and the AGB through an allometric equation was estimated. The Sentinel-1 images from 3 different periods (green, intermediate, and dry periods) were used to consider the phenological conditions of the Caatinga biome. All the pre-processing and extraction of attributes (co-polarized VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive), cross-polarized VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive), and band ratio VH/VV backscatter, radar vegetation index, dual polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) vegetation index (DPSVI), entropy (H), and alpha angle (alpha)) were performed with Sentinel's Application Platform. These attributes were used to estimate the AGB through simple and multiple linear regressions and evaluated by the coefficients of determination (R-2), correlation (r), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The results showed that the attributes individually had little ability to estimate the AGB of the Caatinga biome in the three periods. Combined with multiple regression, we found that the intermediate period presented the equation with the best results among the observed and estimated variables (R-2=0.73; r=0.85; RMSE=8.33 Mg/hm(2)), followed by the greenness period (R-2=0.72; r=0.85; RMSE=8.40 Mg/hm(2)). The attributes contributing to these equations were VH/VV, DPSVI, H, alpha, and co-polarized VV for the green period and cross-polarized VH for the intermediate period. The study showed that the Sentinel-1 images could be used to estimate the AGB of the Caatinga biome in the green and intermediate phenological periods since the SAR attributes highly correlated with the estimated variable (i.e., AGB) through multiple linear equations.

TI  - Two decades of land cover change and forest fragmentation in Liberia: Consequences for the contribution of nature to people
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Guinean forests of West Africa have been identified as a global biodiversity hotspot due to its exceptional concentrations of endemic species and exceptional loss of habitats. The majority of what remains of the Guinean forests lies within Liberia, a country whose share of total wealth is nearly equally distributed into human and natural capital. The Liberian government seeks a more inclusive development agenda that forges a path for improved human capital while sustainably managing its natural capital wealth, which requires consistent data on land cover change and forest disturbance over time. To address this need, Landsat data were used to map and quantify land cover change and forest fragmentation in Liberia between 2000 and 2018. In addition, LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission were applied to assess the integrity of forest remnants. Between 2000 and 2018, only 1% of all forest cover classes (i.e., dense/primary, open/secondary and sparse/degraded) were converted into non-forest classes, with the most observed change being between these three forest classes. During the study period, 27% of the dense/primary forest class transitioned to either the open/secondary or sparse/degraded canopy classes through consistent fragmentation along the edges of the last large remaining blocks of dense/primary forest located in the north-west and south-east of Liberia and more than 14% of dense/primary forest areas identified in previous studies as "essential natural capital" for either biodiversity, forest carbon storage or provision of freshwater ecosystem services were degraded. The 2018 GEDI-based measurements show that the overall average height of dense/primary forest decreases by 24% and 48%, and canopy closure decreases by 33% and 59%, when transitioned to the open/secondary and sparse/degraded classes, respectively. The information derived from this analysis will be critical for informing the development of new policies and actions, leading to more sustainable forest management in Liberia.

TI  - A methodological proposal to analyze urban sprawl, negative environmental impacts, and land degradation in the case of Joao Pessoa City (Brazil) between 1991 and 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and changes in urban spaces have caused severe environmental and social problems in large Brazilian cities. As such, this study presents a methodological proposal to analyze urban sprawl, negative environmental impacts, and land degradation. The methodology employed involves a combination of remote sensing data, environmental modeling techniques, and mixed-method analyses of environmental impacts from 1991 to 2018. Analyzed variables included vegetation, surface temperature, water quality, and soil degradation within the study area. These variables were assessed based on an interaction matrix used to evaluate environmental impacts (low, medium, or high impacts). The obtained results show conflicts of land use and land cover (LULC), a lack of urban sanitation infrastructure, and an absence of environmental monitoring and inspection. A reduction of 24 km(2) of arboreal vegetation was observed from 1991 to 2018. High values of fecal coliforms were found in March across nearly all analyzed points, indicating a seasonal discharge of effluents. The interaction matrix presented various negative environmental impacts, including increased land surface temperature, soil degradation, inappropriate solid waste disposal, devastation of remaining vegetation, water pollution by domestic effluents, and the incidence of erosive processes. Ultimately, the impact quantification determined that the study area has a medium degree of significance in terms of environmental impacts. Thus, refining this quantification method will contribute to future research by making the analysis processes more objective and efficient.

TI  - A novel four-stage integrated GIS based fuzzy SWARA approach for solar site suitability with hydrogen storage system
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrogen storage system is a suitable solution to solve the periodic nature of solar energy. In this study, a new four stage comprehensive framework based on Geographical information system (GIS) and fuzzy multi -criteria decision-making (MCDM) is presented to identify suitable areas for developing solar power plant (SPP) in one of the dust-prone areas of Iran, Yazd province. High-resolution remote sensing data along with organization datasets are used to exclude inappropriate areas using GIS approach. Also, a new application of the SWARA method is introduced to prioritize solar sites by considering the uncertainty in the fuzzy environment. The considered criteria include economic (proximity to the settlements, roads and transmission lines), geography (slope and aspect) and technical criteria (global horizontal irradiance, temperature, dust optical thickness and dust deposition rate). The results showed that 55% of the area is unsuitable for the development of a SPP due to environmental, dust characteristics and topography limitations. Also, 13.8%of the area has a moderate suit-ability, 26.8% of it has a good suitability and only 4.5% of it has an excellent suitability. In addition, the building SPP in suitable areas in Yazd province has the potential to produce 6926.2 TWh/yr of electricity and 112 Mton/ yr of hydrogen.

TI  - Depth of the pedological profile as a conditioning factor of soil erodibility (RUSLE K-Factor) in Ecuadorian basins
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erodibility (K-Factor) is one of the fundamental parameters to estimate its rainfall erosion through mathematical models such as RUSLE. Carrying out an erodibility analysis at different pedological depths allows identifying what would be its susceptibility to erosion processes. Soil unit parcel data obtained by long-term field measurements are required, ensuring that the analyzed sections remain uncovered throughout observation period, investing large amounts of time and money. However, the lack of a good and extensive field database is the main limitation to apply this methodology. The objective of this work was to analyze the spatial distribution of soil erodibility in different pedological profiles, through the implementation of satellite data of soil characteristics. The methodology consisted in delimiting and analyzing the environmental characteristics of the Ecuadorian basins, obtaining the clay, silt, sand SOC contents of the analyzed depths, determining the K-Factor values and comparing them with environmental layers. Basins delimitation and environmental characteristics were extracted from regional literature; soil layer contents were obtained from SoilGrids; K-Factor calculation was made from soil characteristics using Software R and QGIS; results comparison against the elevation and land cover parameters were carried out using QGIS. The results allowed to identify very small variations between pedological profiles; determine that clay and silt are the most incident elements of K-Factor; identify that Crop and Grass are coverages that concentrate on the highest values of K-Factor as well as the highest areas. This allows the administrators of the territory to generate measures to reduce soil loss.

TI  - Algorithms and Predictors for Land Cover Classification of Polar Deserts: A Case Study Highlighting Challenges and Recommendations for Future Applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing for developing land cover maps in the Arctic has grown considerably in the last two decades, especially for monitoring the effects of climate change. The main challenge is to link information extracted from satellite imagery to ground covers due to the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity of Arctic ecosystems. There is currently no commonly accepted methodological scheme for high-latitude land cover mapping, but the use of remote sensing in Arctic ecosystem mapping would benefit from a coordinated sharing of lessons learned and best practices. Here, we aimed to produce a highly accurate land cover map of the surroundings of the Canadian Forces Station Alert, a polar desert on the northeastern tip of Ellesmere Island (Nunavut, Canada) by testing different predictors and classifiers. To account for the effect of the bare soil background and water limitations that are omnipresent at these latitudes, we included as predictors soil-adjusted vegetation indices and several hydrological predictors related to waterbodies and snowbanks. We compared the results obtained from an ensemble classifier based on a majority voting algorithm to eight commonly used classifiers. The distance to the nearest snowbank and soil-adjusted indices were the top predictors allowing the discrimination of land cover classes in our study area. The overall accuracy of the classifiers ranged between 75 and 88%, with the ensemble classifier also yielding a high accuracy (85%) and producing less bias than the individual classifiers. Some challenges remained, such as shadows created by boulders and snow covered by soil material. We provide recommendations for further improving classification methodology in the High Arctic, which is important for the monitoring of Arctic ecosystems exposed to ongoing polar amplification.

TI  - Out-of-year corn yield prediction at field-scale using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and machine learning methods
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield prediction for an ongoing season is crucial for food security interventions and commodity markets for decisions such as inventory management, understanding yield trends and variability. This work considers corn yield prediction at field-scale with input variables derived from satellite and environmental data. Crop yield data were obtained consecutively from 2017 to 2021 for a total of 1164 fields in the US states of Iowa and Nebraska. We forecast yield ``out-of-year'', i.e. we test year from using machine learning methods trained on data from other years. This study includes evaluating what spectral information derived from the raw Sentinel-2 bands best explains the observed variability in yields, but also how time is considered for temporal resampling. We found that resampling the annual time series on thermal time and using biophysical parameters estimates increased the..2 on average by 0.25 to 0.42 when extrapolate is performed on a different year from the ones covered by training samples, compared to using calendar time and other information derived from the Sentinel-2 spectrum.

TI  - Modeling LULC using Multi-Layer Perceptron Markov change (MLP-MC) and identifying local drivers of LULC in hilly district of Manipur, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and prediction of future land use and land cover (LULC) changes and their drivers are required for land resources management, formulation of better policy, practicing sustainable management strategies, and modeling future LULC. The present study has focused on the prediction of future LULC and assessment of local drivers of LULC change in the hill agroecosystem Senapati district of Manipur, Northeast India. The prediction of future LULC for 2029 was achieved based on LULC data of 1999, 2009, and 2019 satellite data using multi-layer perceptron Markov change (MLP-MC) of Land Change Modeler (LCM). The socio-economic survey and field observation were performed to identify local drivers of LULC changes in the study area. The total area covered by open and dense forests in 2029 was 69.06% of the total geographical area of the district, a slight increase from the 2019 assessment of 61.01 km(2). The drivers of LULC were categorized by assigning rank. The proximate drivers directly influence land use dynamics, such as increases in the settlement area, firewood collection, and construction. The underlying drivers-population growth and poverty-have also indirectly influenced LULC change in the district. It was observed that the livelihoods of local communities depend on forest products and agriculture. Therefore, the study finding will help create a future LULC information database and identification of local drivers of LULC. It will encourage the communities to participate in proper land resource management and create awareness for the sustainable use of the land.

TI  - Modifying the Contact Perimeter Approach for Measuring Urban Compactness Gradients in the Joglosemar Urban Region, Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and uncontrolled urbanization in developing countries creates new challenges for the government, as is the case with mega-urbanization in the Joglosemar Urban Region of Indonesia. This study employs remote sensing data to assess discrete compactness with a contact perimeter approach to measure the spatial pattern of three urban areas as the urban growth centers of the Joglosemar Urban Region: Semarang Metropolitan Region (SMR), Surakarta Urban Region (SUR), and Yogyakarta Urban Region (YUR). The contact perimeter approach for measuring urban compactness must be adjusted to accommodate complex shapes (cell arrangement). This study modifies discrete compactness (C1 and C2) to improve the applicability of urban compactness measurement. We use 2022 Sentinel satellite imagery data and 2000 Landsat 7 ETM + data. The results show that in 2022, the YUR has the most significant value of 0.26, followed by the SMR (0.24) and the SUR (0.23). Between 2002 and 2022, the SMR experienced a significant decrease of 0.1 in urban compactness, indicating that the SMR develops in a compact form. This study can support the government in controlling growth and suppressing sprawl development in the future.

TI  - Discharge-driven rapid bank-erosion and its impact on sediment budgeting in the lower Gangetic plains
T2  - EPISODES
M3  - Article
AB  - Riverbank erosion coupled with recurrent flooding has been a persistent problem in large parts of eastern India. Published data on bank erosion along the Ganges in the state of West Bengal suggests an annual average of 8 km(2) land-loss during 1969-1999 that potentially affected the lives of nearly a million people and destroyed various human establishments. In this study, we aim to constrain the annual to decadal-scale changes in the path of the Ganges and its impact on sediment reworking in the floodplain. To achieve this, we analyzed LANDSAT imagery from 1987 to 2019 via ArcGIS and a MATLAB-based toolbox called RivMAP. Over the last three decades, the mean reachaveraged migration rates of the Ganges in Malda district of West Bengal vary from 200-600 m/yr and it suffered a net land-loss of similar to 140 km(2), yielding an average annual loss of 4.5 km(2). First order mass estimate suggests similar to 30 Mt/yr sediment yield from Ganges riverbank in Malda, which is similar to 10-15% of the total annual sediment load of the Ganges expected in Farakka Barrage. Our analysis showcases positive correlation between riverbank erosion and peak annual discharge and therefore, highlights the role of climate on river migration and bank erosion.

T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The invasive blue crab Portunus segnis, which was collected from two sites on the Gulf of Gabes, is the subject of this work. This study is based on demonstrating the accumulation capacity of P. segnis by measuring the concentrations of cadmium, zinc, lead, and copper in the gills and hepatopancreas. The enzymatic activities of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, reduced glutathione, and lipid peroxidase were assessed in this region for the first time. The main results show that the metals have high bioaccumulation potentials in P. segnis tissues between different sites. The possible adaptation of P. segnis in the Gulf of Gabes and the variations in the studied biomarkers and metal concentrations at different sites confirm the usefulness of the invasive blue crab as a sentinel species.

TI  - Missing Plant Detection in Vineyards Using UAV Angled RGB Imagery Acquired in Dormant Period
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2010, more and more farmers have been using remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicles, which have a high spatial-temporal resolution, to determine the status of their crops and how their fields change. Imaging sensors, such as multispectral and RGB cameras, are the most widely used tool in vineyards to characterize the vegetative development of the canopy and detect the presence of missing vines along the rows. In this study, the authors propose different approaches to identify and locate each vine within a commercial vineyard using angled RGB images acquired during winter in the dormant period (without canopy leaves), thus minimizing any disturbance to the agronomic practices commonly conducted in the vegetative period. Using a combination of photogrammetric techniques and spatial analysis tools, a workflow was developed to extract each post and vine trunk from a dense point cloud and then assess the number and position of missing vines with high precision. In order to correctly identify the vines and missing vines, the performance of four methods was evaluated, and the best performing one achieved 95.10% precision and 92.72% overall accuracy. The results confirm that the methodology developed represents an effective support in the decision-making processes for the correct management of missing vines, which is essential for preserving a vineyard's productive capacity and, more importantly, to ensure the farmer's economic return.

AB  - A new fire danger index is proposed to overcome one of the most important limitations of current fire danger metrics. The fire occurrence probability index (FOPI) combines the Canadian fire weather index (FWI) with remote observations of vegetation characteristics to better predict landscape flammability. The FOPI is designed to improve fire danger predictions in all fuel-limited environments where fire is driven by the short-term drying of intermittently-available fuel. The FOPI considerably outperforms the FWI in arid biomes while remaining comparable to the FWI where fuel is abundant.

TI  - Recurrence of <i>Gonyaulax polygramma</i> bloom in the southeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gonyaulax polygramma, a bloom-forming dinoflagellate, has been repeatedly observed along the southeastern Arabian Sea in recent years. During our study in October 2021, a patch of reddish-brown water was observed in the nearshore waters off Kannur (southwest coast of India) and later identified as Gonyaulax polygramma using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and HPLC-based phytoplankton marker pigments. Gonyaulax polygramma accounted for 99.4% of the phytoplankton abundance at the bloom location, with high concentrations of peridinin and chlorophyll-a at the study site. High concentration of SiO42- was observed at the bloom site, while other nutrients were lower than the previously reported values. The bloom of Gonyaulax polygramma also resulted in high concentrations of dimethylsulfide, an anti-greenhouse gas, at the bloom site. In addition to onsite observation, Sentinel-3 satellite data was also used in the detection and validation of the observed bloom using the NDCI index. From the satellite image, it was evident that the bloom persisted at the mouth of the rivers during the study period. Since the red tide of Gonyaulax polygramma has been observed recurrently in the southeastern Arabian Sea, it is proposed to use satellites to detect and monitor the bloom on a routine basis.

TI  - Biocontrol Potential of Antagonistic Yeasts on In Vitro and In Vivo <i>Aspergillus</i> Growth and Its AFB<sub>1</sub> Production
T2  - TOXINS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aspergillus flavus is a major aflatoxin B-1, posing significant health concerns to humans, crops, and producer fungi. Due to the undesirable consequences of the usage of synthetic fungicides, biological control using yeasts has gained more attention. In this study, eight isolates of epiphytic yeasts belonging to Moesziomyces sp., Meyerozyma sp. and Metschnikowia sp., which have been identified as antagonists, were isolated from different plants, including grapes, blueberries, hawthorns, hoskiran, beans and grape leaf. While volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by Moesziomyces bullatus DN-FY, Metschnikowia aff. pulcherrima DN-MP and Metschnikowia aff. pulcherrima 32-AMM reduced in vitro A. flavus mycelial growth and sporulation, only VOCs produced by Metschnikowia aff. fructicola 1-UDM were found to be effective at reducing in vitro AFB(1) production. All yeasts reduced the mycelial growth of A. flavus by 76-91%, while AFB(1) production reduced to 1.26-10.15 ng/g and the control plates' growth was 1773 ng/g. The most effective yeast, Metschnikowia aff. Pulcherrima DN-HS, reduced Aspergillus flavus growth and aflatoxin B-1 production on hazelnuts. The AFB(1) content on hazelnuts reduced to 333.01 ng/g from 536.74 ng/g. To our knowledge, this is the first report of yeasts isolated from plants being tested as potential biological control agents to reduce AFB(1) production on hazelnuts.

TI  - The Potential Use of Global Evapotranspiration Products and Models to Estimate Lake Residence Time at Large Scale
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Water residence time (WRT) is an important lake attribute that influences almost all in-lake nutrient processes. However, information on WRT is often missing or outdated, especially in regions lacking lake inflow or outflow observations. Recent advances in global precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) products and calibration-free ET models provide the possibility of estimating lake WRT at large scales using estimated runoff from the water balance over the lake catchment. Here, we tested four global ET products and two calibration-free ET models for estimating the mean annual lake outflow and WRT of 67 globally distributed lakes using precipitation inputs from four global precipitation products. The results show that the WRT estimated using the water balance method and global ET estimates generally correlates well with reference WRT (R = 0.90 similar to 0.99) when using reliable precipitation inputs and is slightly more accurate than the estimates from the existing global WRT dataset and methods (R = 0.79 similar to 0.94). Despite the large relative error (RE) in the estimates of the WRT, the RE of the phosphorus retention derived from the estimated WRT is acceptable (RE < +/- 30%). The simplicity and versatility of this approach underline its potential applications to large-scale studies that require a fair estimation of WRT.

TI  - TP Concentration Inversion and Pollution Sources in Nanyi Lake Based on Landsat 8 Data and InVEST Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus is a limiting nutrient in freshwater ecosystems. Therefore, it is of great significance to use remote sensing technology to estimate the Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the lake body and identify the contribution of TP inflow load in the surrounding area of the lake body. In this study, two main frameworks (empirical method and machine learning algorithm) for TP estimation are proposed and applied to the development of the Nanyi Lake algorithm. Based on the remote sensing data and ground monitoring data, the results obtained by the two main algorithms are compared to explore whether the machine learning algorithm has better performance than the empirical method in the TP inversion prediction of Nanyi Lake. The Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model was used to simulate the TP inflow load in the Nanyi Lake Basin and determine the key pollution source areas. The results show that the accuracy of the machine learning algorithm is higher than that of the empirical method and has better performance. Among the four machine learning algorithms-support vector machines (SVR), artificial neural network (BP), extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost) and random forest regression (RF)-the TP concentration inversion model established by the XGBoost algorithm is more accurate and has strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The simulation results in the southern and northeastern parts of the Nanyi Lake Basin contribute the most to the pollution load of the lake area, and the simulation results can provide direction for the effective prevention and control of Nanyi Lake, help to further effectively identify the key source areas of TP pollution in the water body of Nanyi Lake, and provide a meaningful scientific reference for water quality monitoring and management, to comprehensively improve the water quality of Nanyi Lake.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol single scattering albedo using joint satellite and surface visibility measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) measuring the ratio of scattering to extinction is a critical parameter in determining aerosol radiative effect. However, the retrieval of SSA from satellite platforms is limited because most existing passive satellite sensors such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) only provide the measurements of reflected solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which are only capable of retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the basis of assumed SSA. In this study, we develop a machine learning based algorithm to retrieve SSA using joint surface visibility and satellite radiation measurements. With ancillary information such as meteorological condition, surface visibility can be regarded as a proxy of column AOD. By combining MODIS measured TOA apparent reflectance with ground visibility as well as other auxiliary parameters, we retrieve SSA at over 6000 visibility stations worldwide. The validation results during the period from 2010 to 2019 show high consistency with AERONET retrieved SSA, with daily, monthly, and seasonal retrievals all exhibiting high correlations of 0.68, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively. Daily, monthly, and seasonal RMSE values are 0.044, 0.012, and 0.011, respectively. The mean absolute bias (MAB) of daily retrievals is 0.031 and 62% of the samples fall within the uncertainty interval of & PLUSMN;0.03. Monthly and seasonal MAB values decrease to below 0.01. Over 97% of the monthly and seasonal retrievals are within the error envelope of & PLUSMN;0.03. Our work generates a global aerosol SSA dataset with extensive coverage over land, which can be used for validating and improving climate models and the estimation of aerosol radiative forcing.

TI  - Identifying Urban and Socio-Environmental Patterns of Brazilian Amazonian Cities by Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying urban patterns in the cities in the Brazilian Amazon can help to understand the impact of human actions on the environment, to protect local cultures, and secure the cultural heritage of the region. The objective of this study is to produce a classification of intra-urban patterns in Amazonian cities. Concretely, we produce a set of Urban and Socio-Environmental Patterns (USEPs) in the cities of Santarem and Cameta in Para, Brazilian Amazon. The contributions of this study are as follows: (1) we use a reproducible research framework based on remote sensing data and machine learning techniques; (2) we integrate spatial data from various sources into a cellular grid, separating the variables into environmental, urban morphological, and socioeconomic dimensions; (3) we generate variables specific to the Amazonian context; and (4) we validate these variables by means of a field visit to Cameta and comparison with patterns described in other works. Machine learning-based clustering is useful to identify seven urban patterns in Santarem and eight urban patterns in Cameta. The urban patterns are semantically explainable and are consistent with the existing scientific literature. The paper provides reproducible and open research that uses only open software and publicly available data sources, making the data product and code available for modification and further contributions to spatial data science analysis.

TI  - The origin of everything: "And there was evening and there was morning"
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Darwin's 18th century theory of evolution was an elegant, sensible, and logical explanation of observed data. It was embraced by the scientific community of the time since it offered an alternative to the creation narrative in the Bible. Proponents of the theory were convinced that the origin and multitude of life on earth could be fully explained by evolution and natural selection. Over time, the theory of evolution acquired normative status, which led to the totality of human knowledge being interpreted through a filter of random chance. Opponents of this materialistic view were in many cases branded as fringe figures.Subsequently, however, science and technology have developed dramatically, and new observations have led to a growing number of questions that cannot be explained by an unguided, random process. In this article (the first in a series of four on this topic), a few examples of such contemporary observations are presented. These include:& BULL; Origin of the universeSeminal work by scholars such as Slipher, Hubble, Lemaitre, Einstein and others indicate that the universe came into being at a specific moment. This was contrary to the idea of a perpetual universe, as believed by e.g., classical Greek scholars. The implication of a moment of creation is that there must have been a "cause of creation" (Creator) that is not bounded by, or subject to, matter, energy, space, or time, because none of these existed before the moment of creation.& BULL; Fine-tuning of the universeSince the 1950's, numerous scientific discoveries indicate that life depends on a highly unlikely combination of forces, characteristics, and balances in the universe, such as e.g., fundamental forces that have exactly the right magnitudes, contingent properties that exhibit exactly the right characteristics, as well as the initial configuration of matter and energy perfectly tuned to allow for anything to exist. These life-permitting properties of the universe fall within highly improbable, precise boundaries, commonly referred to as "anthropic contingencies" by materialist scientists. If any one of these properties were changed even in an infinitesimal way, the life-promoting conditions, found in the universe would not exist. Not only is the observed simultaneous, conditional accuracy highly improbable, but there appears to be no conceivable physical cause (reason) or philosophical necessity why these parameters exhibit the particular values they do. Contrary to scientists with a materialistic worldview, who attribute the fine-tuning to a happy accident (a random accident of physics), a growing number of scientists and philosophers conclude that the universe was designed with great care by a Creator who transcends time, matter, space, and energy in order to have achieved the fine-tuning of conditions before the moment of creation.& BULL; Age of the universeThe age of the universe extends from the time of the Big Bang, which is currently calculated to have occurred 13.8 billion years ago (& PLUSMN;0.020 billion years), according to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (?CDM) model. Contemporary empirical evidence indicates that the universe consists of approximately 68% dark energy, 27% dark matter and only 5% matter. This means that although the ?CDM theory has a thorough scientific basis, it still represents imperfect knowledge of only approximately 5% of everything that exists.& BULL; Origin of the earthThe conditions necessary for the earth to form have been determined before the moment of creation.A literal understanding of the narrative in Genesis is problematic since the sun and the moon were only created on day four. To summarily interpret the first 3 "days" of creation as 24-hour days is therefore without any justification, because the heavenly bodies that are responsible for 24-hour days as we know them, did not yet exist. From this it can be deduced that a 24-hour-a-day interpretation of the days of creation, is at most a human construct and that the repeated use of the words, "and there was evening, and there was morning", should rather be seen as a delimitation of events.& BULL; Age of the earthPre-scientific thinking about the age of the earth was dominated by a fundamentalist, biblical paradigm. This included calculating the age of the earth according to generations given in the Bible, which resulted in general consensus that the earth was created on "the entrance of the night preceding the 23rd day of October [...] the year before Christ 4004". Geological and paleontological evidence however made it clear that well over 6,000 years must have passed in the formation of the earth. This empirical evidence was ultimately the cause of the literal understanding of Genesis' six days of creation being openly questioned. Immanent 195 scientists such as Newton (1687), Hutton (1788) and Lyell (1830-1833) took a uniformitarian paradigm as point of departure in their calculations about the age of the earth. Contemporary evidence indicates that the earth's age is approximately 4,6 billion years.& BULL; Origin and age of lifeThe origin and age of humankind has been central in debates about evolution since the publication of the theory almost 200 years ago. Currently, however, sources of information such as genetics and genetically based studies (e.g., Ontogeny, Phylogeny and Evolutionary Biology) have, together with developments in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis since the early 1970's, substantially added to the knowledge obtained from the fossil record. A vast volume of data must have been generated to account for the multitude of life observed (including humankind). The visible range and depth of information, as well as the survival rate within the time available, make "coincidence" as a method of gathering the information, logically impossible. Only one out of every hundred species that could mutate survived, which means that to obtain the correct DNA information the mutation rate would have had to be 99% higher, or the period 99% longer than observed in natural science. The only plausible origin of such information is an intelligent designer.In conclusion, the central theoretical premise of this article series is that contemporary observations in all disciplines of natural science are best explained by the existence and involvement of God in creation. Academic integrity requires that scholars depart from a normative materialistic interpretation of empirical data (i.e., the a-priori exclusion of any metaphysical interpretations), which is currently still widely adhered to.The authors' point of departure is a Reformed3 understanding of reality. The four articles all have the same structure, namely a problem statement, a natural science discussion, an exploration of what information the Bible offers on the various topics, closed by a conclusion. The article series is supposed to provide a broad, critical overview of the topic of normative materialism in the natural sciences and no new research results per se are presented.However, the insights reached in the respective conclusions are unique, and the authors are of the opinion that they contribute to the existing knowledge about the relationship between faith and science.

TI  - Evil in humankind: "To dust you shall return"
T2  - TYDSKRIF VIR GEESTESWETENSKAPPE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the first three articles of this series, convincing arguments were put forward as to why contemporary natural scientific observations can best be explained if they are interpreted within a paradigm of an all-powerful Creator. In line with this observation, a growing number of eminent scholars fundamentally differ from the materialistic position that metaphysical theories deal with concepts that are not empirically observable and testable. Instead, these scholars postulate that metaphysical theories can indeed be used to make predictions about the natural world and that they are therefore falsifiable. A few examples include the fact that a theistic cosmology expects that the universe had a moment of beginning, which presupposes that a transcendent Creator must already have accurately established the physical conditions for all empirical observations, before the moment of creation. Empirical observations of the universe confirm this theory, as described in the first article of this series. More examples of the predictive value of a metaphysical theory, are the origin of information contained in DNA, as described in article 2, as well as in empirical data on the origin of humans (see article 3). The reference to metaphysical theories as pseudo-science has therefore been repudiated by recent empirical evidence and a growing number of authoritative researchers, do recognise the fact that a "God hypothesis" would appear to be scientifically accountable. Yet, there remains great opposition among mainstream natural scientists to any hint of metaphysical explanations for contemporary observations. Materialist scientists accuse religious scientists of approaching the Enlightenment and Modernism in reverse - of wanting to take science back to the dark ages, where the church dictated to science what may be believed. However, it is ironic that the "God of the gaps"-argument is replaced by normative materialism with a "science of the gaps"-argument, where it is argued that sooner or later science will provide humanity with a "theory of everything". To decide in advance that a certain explanation for empirical evidence may not be considered, is unacceptable in natural science. Yet mainstream science takes exactly this position regarding cosmology and the origin of life. In this article, the issue of normative materialism is scrutinised. What is the deepest origin of the reluctance of many researchers, to put forward a metaphysical explanation for scientifically observed data? Even the mere consideration of such a hypothesis is rejected. Why don't people even consider the possibility that a Creator played (and still plays) a role in the universe? The main conclusion, based on an expose of the scientific method, various ways of scientific reasoning and biblical evidence regarding creation and the origin of sin, is that the answer lies in mankind's sinful, self-willed nature. If a scientist, based on irrefutable evidence, admits that God exists and that His works are visible in creation, as well as that empirical observations can be reconciled with biblical descriptions of the cosmos, he/she must then also admit that the Bible represents the truth. The necessary consequence of such an admittance is that such a person must then live in submissive obedience to God. This giving up of the "own self" is, however, directly against the nature of sinful man - every person has the need to be master of his/her own salvation and to answer only to himself/herself; something that is embodied in the Postmodernist Zeitgeist in which we find ourselves.To rule out (and even formally forbid) one of the possible explanations for empirical observations in advance, only because it differs from a researcher's worldview, does not make that researcher a better scientist. On the contrary - normative materialism and the accompanying grasping at straws by formulating new, fantastic, and difficult-to-test theories as alternatives to the existence of God, simply represent poor, invalid scientific practice. Even though natural science overwhelmingly testifies to the presence and involvement of God in creation, there are still numerous questions that cannot be answered by natural scientists, or by theologians. Natural scientists should, however, consider all possible explanations for empirical data with an equal measure of respect and attention in order to practise science with integrity.

TI  - A Combined Deep Learning and Prior Knowledge Constraint Approach for Large-Scale Forest Disturbance Detection Using Time Series Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The scale and severity of forest disturbances across the globe are increasing due to climate change and human activities. Remote sensing analysis using time series data is a powerful approach for detecting large-scale forest disturbances and describing detailed forest dynamics. Various large-scale forest disturbance detection algorithms have been proposed, but most of them are only suitable for detecting high-magnitude forest disturbances (e.g., fire, harvest). Conversely, more continuous, subtle, and gradual lower-magnitude forest disturbances (e.g., thinning, pests, and diseases) have been subject to less focus. Deep learning (DL) can distinguish subtle differences in information within time series data, offering new opportunities to capture forest disturbances in a complete and detailed way. This study proposes an approach for analyzing forest dynamics across large areas and long time periods by combining DL time series classification and prior knowledge constraint. The approach consists of two stages: (1) an improved self-attention model used for time series classification to identify sequences with forest disturbance characteristics; (2) developed skip-disturbance recovery index (S-DRI) characterizing the temporal context, using prior knowledge constraint to identify forest disturbance years in time series with disturbance characteristics. In this study, the year of forest disturbances in five study areas located in the United States, Canada, and Poland from 2001 to 2020 was mapped. A total of 3082 manually interpreted test data with different disturbance causal agents (such as fire, harvest, conversion, hurricane, and pests) were sampled from five research areas for validation. Our approach was also evaluated against two forest disturbance benchmark datasets derived from LandTrendr and the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. The results demonstrate that our approach achieved an overall accuracy of 87.8%, surpassing the accuracy of LandTrendr (84.6%) and the Global Forest Change dataset (81.4%). Furthermore, our approach demonstrated lower omission rates (ranging from 10.0% to 67.4%) in detecting subtle to severe causal agents of forest disturbance, in comparison to LandTrendr (with a range of 18.0% to 81.6%) and GFC (with a range of 15.0% to 88.8%). This study, which involved mapping large-scale and long-term forest disturbance in multiple regions, revealed that our approach can be applied to new areas without a requirement for complex parameter adjustments. These results demonstrate the potential of our approach in generating comprehensive and detailed forest disturbance data, thus providing a new and effective method in this domain.

TI  - Quality evaluation of FY-4A/GIIRS atmospheric temperature profile
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - FY-4A of China carries the Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) to realize infrared hyper -spectral sounding on a geostationary orbit for the first time, which can continuously obtain information of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. Based on the conventional radiosonde data, the quality of FY-4A/GIIRS atmospheric temperature profile products in 2020 is evaluated from the aspects of detection capability and accuracy, providing refer-ence for product applications and algorithm research. The results show that the detection ability of the atmospheric tem-perature profile retrieved by FY-4A/GIIRS is greatly affected by cloud activity in the height level and monthly statistics. Under clear sky conditions, the root mean square error of the whole atmospheric layer is about 2 K, while the lower at-mospheric layer of 700-1000 hPa is relatively larger (about 2. 5 K). The bias of the whole atmospheric layer is mainly negative. The quality assessment of different months shows that summer and autumn are obviously better than winter and spring, which is conducive to observation in the season with the frequent disastrous weather. The temperature pro-file error of a single pixel is obviously large under cloudy conditions, and the multiple-pixel Cressman objective analysis can effectively improve the product availability. The product quality of temperature profiles in low altitude areas is sig-nificantly better than that in high altitude areas, which can greatly make up for the shortage of sounding data in the east-ern, southern regions of China and the vast ocean surface.

TI  - Robotic Pelvic Lymphadenectomy in Gynecological and Urological Malignancies
T2  - CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Pelvic lymphadenectomy is a crucial step in the management of different pelvic cancers for both prognostic and/or therapeutic goals. Robotic surgeries offered numerous benefits over open and/or laparoscopic surgeries such as better visualization, shorter hospital stay, less pain and better cosmoses. The aim of this narrative review is to evaluate the value and outcomes of robotic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND).Mechanism: The PubMed database was searched using the following keywords "Robotic" AND "pelvic lymph node dissection" to identify all the relevant articles concerned with the role and outcomes of robotic PLND. We included only English articles published between 2010 and 2022. Data from the retrieved articles were then used to formulate this review that highlight the introduction, the outcomes of robotic pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND), and the mapping of sentinel lymph node (SLN) in cervical, endometrial, prostate, and bladder cancers.Findings in Brief: PLND is an integral part of gynecological and urological oncology for its role in tumor staging and planning of further treatment plan. Furthermore, it may play an important therapeutic role in bladder cancer. Robotic approach to PLND is safe and efficient and can be potentially used for cervical, endometrial, prostate, and bladder cancers.Conclusions: Robotic PLND could be an alternative to open and laparoscopic approaches as it may decrease the associated morbidities without compromising the quality of Lymph node dissection (LND).

TI  - Identification of the Potential Coefficient in the Schrodinger Equation with Incomplete Initial Conditions from a Boundary Observation
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with an inverse problem of the Schrodinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we focus on incomplete data, where there are missing terms in the potential term and the initial condition. The potential term is a critical part of the equation, representing the potential energy of the system under investigation. Our objective is to obtain valuable information about this potential term without the need to determine the unknown initial condition. To achieve this, we employ the sentinel method, which is a functional that is sensitive to only one unknown and insensitive to others. Our research shows that the existence of this functional is connected to solving an optimal control problem, which we accomplish using the Hilbert Uniqueness Method. By using this approach, we are able to gain insights into the potential coefficient, which can provide significant benefits in a wide range of applications.

TI  - Beyond Violent Extremism: A 3N Perspective of Inceldom
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF MEN & MASCULINITIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Self-described "involuntary celibates" (incels) have become more visible in recent years, in part due to high-profile acts of mass violence committed by self-professed incels. Recent academic scholarship and journalism have suggested that the self-described incels may pose a threat not only to others, but to themselves, as well. What is unique about incels among other groups of individuals described as violent extremists is the way that the ideology of inceldom-the "black pill"-provides different narratives that lead adherents to behave differently. This article employs a cluster analysis of self-described incels residing in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania (Cluster 1, n = 50; Cluster 2, n = 97; Cluster 3, n = 113) to examine inceldom in accordance with the 3N theory of radicalization. Incels can be characterized as having an amplified need for significance. By engaging online with incel forums, they find a network that validates their feelings and introduces them to an overarching ideology. The ideology provides a worldview that allows them to move from self-blame for their failures with women into anger and violence turned inward or outward. Incels respond to this ideology by aligning along three differing narratives that define the appropriate means for gaining significance: An externalizing narrative that promotes violence as a means of fighting back against a society they believe has condemned them to celibacy and loneliness, an internalizing narrative that promotes suicide as the only useful means of gaining control over the painfulness of rejection, and a hopeful narrative that focuses on the possibility of moving out of inceldom.

TI  - Remote Sensing Analysis of the Surface Urban Heat Island Effect in Vitoria-Gasteiz, 1985 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vitoria-Gasteiz has taken several urban greening actions such as the introduction of a ring of parks that connect the city's surroundings, a sustainable mobility plan, and urban green structure strategies. Previous studies establish a connection to the importance of greening to mitigate the surface urban heat island (SUHI) and evaluate the effectiveness of these measures on urban climate. In this study, land surface temperature (LST), a remote sensing (RS) parameter, recorded by Landsat satellites (5, 7, and 8) was used to evaluate the effect of SUHI in Vitoria-Gasteiz between 1985-2021. The aim was to evaluate whether the urban greening actions influenced the local thermal conditions and, consequently, helped minimize the SUHI. Thirty sampling locations were identified, corresponding to different local climate zones (LCZ), at which LST data were extracted. A total of 218 images were processed and separated into summer and winter. Four of the 30 locations had, since 2003, on-site meteorological stations with regular air temperature (Tair) measurements which were used to validate the LST data. The results showed that Spearman's correlation between Tair and LST was higher than 0.88 in all locations. An amount of 21 points maintained the same LCZ classification throughout the analysed period and nine underwent a LCZ transformation. The highest average temperature was identified in the city centre (urbanized area), and the lowest average was in a forest on the outskirts of the city. SUHI was more intense during the summer. A significant increase in SUHI intensity was identified in areas transformed from natural to urban LCZs. However, SUHI during satellite data acquisition periods has shown a minimal change in areas where sustainable practices have been implemented. RS was valuable for analysing the thermal behaviour of the LCZs, despite the limitation inherent in the satellite's time of passage, in which the SUHI effect is not as evident.

TI  - Trajectory Planning for UAVs Equipped With RISs to Provide Aerial LoS Service for Mobile Nodes in 5G/Optical Wireless Communication Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern wireless communication systems are limited to line-of-sight (LoS) links due to high path loss and blockage issues in millimeter wave (5G) and beyond in optical/visible light communication networks. This letter proposes utilizing (optical) reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped UAV (RISeUAV) to support indirect aerial LoS (ALoS) links for mobile vehicles that deliver critical metropolitan emergency/security services. The RISeUAV performs as an aerial transponder and reflects optical and wireless communication signals in dense urban areas. The navigation problem of the RISeUAV is nontrivial where RISeUAV should be autonomously navigated through an energy-efficient obstacle-free path. Notably, the flight altitude should be relatively low to ensure the quality of ALoS service while the maximum possible ALoS links for vehicles are provided in an obstructed environment. However, designing the flight path for rendering valid ALoS service is an NP-hard problem that is not feasible in real-time for autonomous navigation. We model the RISeUAV navigation as an optimization problem and propose an efficient technique to make the problem computationally tractable in real-time using Benders' decomposition method and sequential convex programming. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Fast Pasture Classification Method using Ground-based Camera and the Modified Green Red Vegetation Index (MGRVI)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The assessment of aboveground biomass is important for achieving rational usage of pasture resources and for maximizing the quantity and quality of milk and meat production. This study presents a method for fast approximation of pastures' biomass. Unlike most similar studies, which rely on unmanned aerial vehicle and satellite obtained data, this study focuses on photos made by stationary or mobile ground-based visual spectrum camera. The developed methodology uses raster analysis, based on the MGRVI index, in order to classify the pasture into two categories: "grazed" and "ungrazed". Thereafter, the developed methodology accounts for the perspective in order to obtain the actual area of each class in square meters and in percent. The methodology was applied on an experimental pasture, located near the city of Troyan (Bulgaria). Two images were selected, with the first one representing a mostly ungrazed pasture and the second one - a mostly grazed one. Thereafter the images were analyzed using QGIS 3.0 as well as a specially developed software tool. An important advantage of the proposed methodology is that it does not require expensive equipment and technological knowledge, as it relies on commonly available tools, such as the camera of mobile phones.

TI  - Terrain Characterization via Machine vs. Deep Learning Using Remote Sensing
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrain traversability is critical for developing Go/No-Go maps for ground vehicles, which significantly impact a mission's success. To predict the mobility of terrain, one must understand the soil characteristics. In-situ measurements performed in the field are the current method of collecting this information, which is time-consuming, costly, and can be lethal for military operations. This paper investigates an alternative approach using thermal, multispectral, and hyperspectral remote sensing from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform. Remotely sensed data combined with machine learning (linear, ridge, lasso, partial least squares (PLS), support vector machines (SVM), and k nearest neighbors (KNN)) and deep learning (multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN)) are used to perform a comparative study to estimate the soil properties, such as the soil moisture and terrain strength, used to generate prediction maps of these terrain characteristics. This study found that deep learning outperformed machine learning. Specifically, a multi-layer perceptron performed the best for predicting the percent moisture content (R-2/RMSE = 0.97/1.55) and the soil strength (in PSI), as measured by a cone penetrometer for the averaged 0-6" (CP06) (R-2/RMSE = 0.95/67) and 0-12" depth (CP12) (R-2/RMSE = 0.92/94). A Polaris MRZR vehicle was used to test the application of these prediction maps for mobility purposes, and correlations were observed between the CP06 and the rear wheel slip and the CP12 and the vehicle speed. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of a more rapid, cost-efficient, and safer approach to predict terrain properties for mobility mapping using remote sensing data with machine and deep learning algorithms.

TI  - Factors associated with hospitalization for seasonal influenza in Morocco
T2  - EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN HEALTH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Morocco is actively working towards expanding its influenza vaccine policy to cover high-risk groups, as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).Aims: We assessed the risk factors for influenza-associated hospitalization for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) that occurred during the last 5 seasons.Methods: We conducted a retrospective, analytical study among patients recruited in the ambulatory and hospital sites of the influenza sentinel surveillance system in Morocco between 2014 and 2019. Using multiple logistic regression, we compared the characteristics of influenza-positive patients with SARI to those with influenza-like illness (ILI) to identify factors associated with severe disease.Results: We included 1323 positive influenza patients with either SARI (41.7%) or ILI diagnosis (58.3%). A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and influenza B, respectively, contributed 49.2%, 29.5% and 20.6% of the cases. The main risk factors considered in the bivariate analysis were found in the multivariate analysis to be significantly associated with influenza-related hospitalization (SARI): age < 2 years (aOR = 7.08, P < 0.001); age & GE; 65 years (aOR = 3.59, P < 0.001); diabetes (aOR = 1.98, P = 0.017); obesity (aOR = 2.94, P = 0.034); asthma or chronic respiratory disease (aOR = 4.99, P < 0.001); chronic renal failure (aOR = 4.74, P = 0.005); pregnancy (aOR = 7.49, P < 0.001); and the A(H1N1)pdm09 subtype (aOR = 1.82, P < 0.001).Conclusion: This study provides epidemiological evidence for the expected benefit of an influenza vaccination strategy for high-risk groups as recommended by the WHO.

TI  - Adapting an integrated acute respiratory infections sentinel surveillance to the COVID-19 pandemic requirements, Egypt, 2020-2022.
T2  - Public health in practice (Oxford, England)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objectives: In Egypt, an integrated surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was established in 2016 to identify the causes of ARIs. The surveillance system includes 19 governmental hospitals. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organisation (WHO) requested surveillance adaptation to address the emerging challenges. This study aims to describe the experience in Egypt of adapting ARI surveillance to the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods: WHO case definitions were used to identify patients with ARIs. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs were collected for SARS-CoV-2 and influenza testing. Demographic and clinical information were obtained by interviewing patients at the hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the first two outpatients daily and every fifth admitted patient were enrolled in the study. To determine the status of ARIs in Egypt during the pandemic, patient demographic, clinical and laboratory data from 2020 to 2022 were obtained and descriptive analyses were performed.Results: Overall, 18,160 patients were enrolled in the study, including 7923 (43.6%) seen at outpatient clinics and 10,237 (56.4%) inpatients. Of the study participants, 6453 (35.5%) tested positive for ARIs, including 5620 (87.1%) for SARS-CoV-2, 781 (12.1%) for influenza and 52 (0.8%) for SARS-CoV-2/influenza coinfection. SARS-CoV-2 was the cause for 95.3% of admitted patients and 65.4% of outpatients. Influenza subtypes included A/H3 (55.7%), Influenza-B (29.1%) and H1/pdm09 (14.2%). Compared with influenza, SARS-CoV-2 tended to infect the elderly, in warm weather and in urban governorates, and resulted in more hospitalisations, longer hospital stays and higher case fatalities (16.3% vs 6.6%, p<0.001).Conclusions: ARI surveillance in Egypt was successfully adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic and effectively described the clinical characteristics and severity of circulating viruses. Surveillance reported the re-emergence of influenza with a severe course and high fatality. Surveillance is essential for monitoring the activity of respiratory viruses with the aim of guiding clinical management, including preventative and control measures.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Satellite Investigation of gas Flaring in Iraq and Iran: The DAFI Porting on Collection 2 Landsat 8/9 and Sentinel 2A/B
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The synergic use of satellite data at moderate spatial resolution (i.e., 20-30 m) from the new Collection 2 (C2) Landsat-8/9 (L8/9) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) provides a new perspective in the remote sensing applications for gas flaring (GF) identification and monitoring, thanks to a significant improvement in the revisiting time (up to similar to 3 days). In this study, the daytime approach for gas flaring investigation (DAFI), recently developed for identifying, mapping and monitoring GF sites on a global scale using the L8 infrared radiances, has been ported on a virtual constellation (VC) (formed by C2 L8/9 + S2) to assess its capability in understanding the GF characteristics in the space-time domain. The findings achieved for the regions of Iraq and Iran, ranked at the second and third level among the top 10 gas flaring countries in 2022, demonstrate the reliability of the developed system, with improved levels of accuracy and sensitivity (+52%). As an outcome of this study, a more realistic picture of GF sites and their behavior is achieved. A new step aimed at quantifying the GFs radiative power (RP) has been added in the original DAFI configuration. The preliminary analysis of the daily OLI- and MSI-based RP, provided for all the sites by means of a modified RP formulation, revealed their good matching. An agreement of 90% and 70% between the annual RPs computed in Iraq and Iran and both their gas-flared volumes and carbon dioxide emissions were also recorded. Being that gas flaring is one of the main sources of greenhouse gases (GHG) worldwide, the RP products may concur to infer globally the GHGs GF emissions at finer spatial scales. For the presented achievements, DAFI can be seen as a powerful satellite tool able to automatically assess the gas flaring dimension on a global scale.

AB  - In this study, the vertical accuracy of the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model Version 2.0 (SRTM30), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global DEM Version 2.0 (ASTER GDEM2), and Advanced Land Observing Satellite World 3D Digital Surface Model Version 2.1 (ALOS AW3D30) was statistically assessed using GPS data. The Fergana Valley area was chosen as a study region, where the land surface can reflect tectonic processes. The values of ellipsoidal heights of 27 points of the regional GPS network were chosen as reference data. The geometric approach using GPS/leveling data and EGM96 global geopotential model-based geoid undulations was applied for geoid surface fitting. The geoid height corrections range ranged from -0.66 m to 0.87 m. Root-Mean-Square errors of similar to 10.0 m, similar to 16.4 m, and similar to 6.6 m was obtained for SRTM30, ASTER GDEM2, and ALOS AW3D30, respectively. It was found that compared with the reference model, all the global DEMs in mountainous areas generally overestimated elevation and the value of vertical accuracy at a 90% confidence level by 3-6 meters exceeded the declared by distributors. But ALOS AW3D30 proved to be the most accurate DEM that best represents the topography of the earth's surface and could be used for some engineering applications in Fergana Valley.

TI  - Holocene Erosional Processes in a Highly Exposed Intertidal Sandstone Reef Inferred from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An intertidal sandstone reef, named barra de Las Canteras, protects the western coast of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria city (Canary Islands, Spain). The beach-reef system of Las Canteras constitutes one of the most valuable coastal geomorphological sites in the archipelago. Stratigraphic studies have identified the formation of the reef in the Last Interglacial (MIS 5e) in a coastal sedimentary paleo-environment. The rock structure is highly exposed to the Atlantic swell and consists mainly of a sandstone beachrock with a medium resistance to erosional processes. However, the historical and current erosion rates and the original extent of the reef are not known to date. This paper explores the geomorphological structure of the reef by combining a topo-bathymetric analysis (obtained by differential GPS, multibeam echosounder and hyperspectral sensor) and the analysis of geomorphological features on high-resolution images, obtained with a hyperspectral camera mounted on a UAV. The results provide a comprehensive, high-resolution image of the subaerial and submerged morphology of the reef. The structure reflects the distribution of erosional fronts and the existence of collapsing submarine blockfields and nearshore, uneroded, remnant reliefs. Detailed analysis of these features allows to estimate the probable original extent of the sandstone reef and to relate the erosional retreat processes to the sea-level dynamics during the Holocene.

TI  - The national literacy program in Brazil and the educational elements in the basic reforms during Joao Goulart's government (1963-1964)
T2  - DIALOGO
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1961, after Janio Quadros's resignation as president, the vice president, Joao Goulart, returning from a trip to China, was prevented from taking offi ce by the Army's high command leaders. They were fearful that the politician would implement a communist government in Brazil, in a context of intense disputes promoted by the Cold War. After an agreement involving the consolidation of Parliamentarism, Joao Goulart was allowed to be president, and this system was maintained until 1963, after being revoked by a popular plebiscite. From then on, the government began to better structure the so-called Basic Reforms, which would be actions aimed at restructuring several areas of Brazil, with Agrarian Reform being the most discussed among them. However, Education was also one of the main aspects of these Reforms, and the main action was the creation, in early 1964, of the National Literacy Program, an adaptation of a literacy project implemented in some regions of the Northeast region by professor Paulo Freire, who used to work at Universidade de Recife. In this structured process at the regional level, the method consisted of providing literacy to a large group of adults in just 45 days, using elements such as the language and worldview of these people, combined with a political perspective in teaching, stimulating criticality and struggling for better living conditions for these groups. Thus, the main purpose of this article is to discuss the development of this Program in that political context. Besides, we also provide an overview of its ephemeral duration, since it was extinguished together with the government of Joao Goulart by a coup d 'etat in April 1964.

TI  - A Proposal for Automatic Coastline Extraction from Landsat 8 OLI Images Combining Modified Optimum Index Factor (MOIF) and K-Means
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal environment is a natural and economic resource of extraordinary value, but it is constantly modifying and susceptible to climate change, human activities and natural hazards. Remote sensing techniques have proved to be excellent for coastal area monitoring, but the main issue is to detect the borderline between water bodies (ocean, sea, lake or river) and land. This research aims to define a rapid and accurate methodological approach, based on the k-means algorithm, to classify the remotely sensed images in an unsupervised way to distinguish water body pixels and detect coastline. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) multispectral satellite images were considered. The proposal requires applying the k-means algorithm only to the most appropriate multispectral bands, rather than using the entire dataset. In fact, by using only suitable bands to detect the differences between water and no-water (vegetation and bare soil), more accurate results were obtained. For this scope, a new index based on the optimum index factor (OIF) was applied to identify the three best-performing bands for the purpose. The direct comparison between the automatically extracted coastline and the manually digitized one was used to evaluate the product accuracy. The results were very satisfactory and the combination involving bands B2 (blue), B5 (near infrared), and B6 (short-wave infrared-1) provided the best performance.

TI  - CONFIDENT-trial protocol: a pragmatic template for clinical implementation of artificial intelligence assistance in pathology
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) has been on the rise in the field of pathology. Despite promising results in retrospective studies, and several CE-IVD certified algorithms on the market, prospective clinical implementation studies of AI have yet to be performed, to the best of our knowledge. In this trial, we will explore the benefits of an AI-assisted pathology workflow, while maintaining diagnostic safety standards.Methods and analysisThis is a Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence compliant single-centre, controlled clinical trial, in a fully digital academic pathology laboratory. We will prospectively include prostate cancer patients who undergo prostate needle biopsies (CONFIDENT-P) and breast cancer patients who undergo a sentinel node procedure (CONFIDENT-B) in the University Medical Centre Utrecht. For both the CONFIDENT-B and CONFIDENT-P trials, the specific pathology specimens will be pseudo-randomised to be assessed by a pathologist with or without AI assistance in a pragmatic (bi-)weekly sequential design. In the intervention group, pathologists will assess whole slide images (WSI) of the standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections assisted by the output of the algorithm. In the control group, pathologists will assess H&E WSI according to the current clinical workflow. If no tumour cells are identified or when the pathologist is in doubt, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining will be performed. At least 80 patients in the CONFIDENT-P and 180 patients in the CONFIDENT-B trial will need to be enrolled to detect superiority, allocated as 1:1. Primary endpoint for both trials is the number of saved resources of IHC staining procedures for detecting tumour cells, since this will clarify tangible cost savings that will support the business case for AI.Ethics and disseminationThe ethics committee (MREC NedMec) waived the need of official ethical approval, since participants are not subjected to procedures nor are they required to follow rules. Results of both trials (CONFIDENT-B and CONFIDENT-P) will be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals.

TI  - Transreligiosity and Religious Revitalization in Modern Greece: Bridging Religion and Science through Geomythology
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines the revitalization of the ancient Greek religion in modern Greece and the way some of its adherents approach mythology. This religious movement challenges the dominant religious discourse in modern Greece by claiming legitimacy through indigeneity, while making important arguments regarding the perceived spiritual and value crisis in their culture. At a time that right-wing extremisms and fundamentalisms are rising globally, this religious movement places emphasis on worldview and imagines a kind of citizen who engages with universal ideals while maintaining a strong connection to a unique ethnic identity. At the same time, Ethnikoi Hellenes challenge prevailing understandings of religion by making 'logos' or reason central to their theology. Thus, they challenge the association of Indigenous religions with "irrationality", while pointing out the inconsistencies and irrationalities of monotheistic religions, which they consider responsible for the widespread "cultural" crisis facing humanity. The example of one group's engagement with geomythology has been used to demonstrate that they do not conceive religion and science as contradictory but complementary, thus exhibiting transreligiosity.

TI  - Multilayer Data and Artificial Intelligence for the Delineation of Homogeneous Management Zones in Maize Cultivation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variable rate application (VRA) is a crucial tool in precision agriculture, utilizing platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE) to access vast satellite image datasets and employ machine learning (ML) techniques for data processing. This research investigates the feasibility of implementing supervised ML models (random forest (RF), the support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting trees (GBT), classification and regression trees (CART)) and unsupervised k-means clustering in GEE to generate accurate management zones (MZs). By leveraging Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and yielding monitor data, these models calculate vegetation indices to monitor crop health and reveal hidden patterns. The achieved classification accuracy values (0.67 to 0.99) highlight the potential of GEE and ML models for creating precise MZs, enabling subsequent VRA implementation. This leads to enhanced farm profitability, improved natural resource efficiency, and reduced environmental impact.

TI  - Remote Sensing Surveillance of NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and AOD along the Suez Canal Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Lockdown Periods and during the Blockage
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ever Given ship blockage on the air quality in Suez Canal region. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and aerosol optical depth (AOD) were studied, and data were obtained from satellite instruments. The study compared monthly average data for 2020, 2021, and 2022 with a baseline period of 2017-2019 to investigate the pandemic's effect. The study also analyzed the corresponding period of the canal blockage to identify its impact on air pollution levels. The pandemic had a significant role in decreasing NO2 by 2.5 x 10(14) molecule/cm(2) and SO2 by 0.05 DU due to reduced car traffic and industrial activities. A reduction in AOD by 20% and CO concentration in the range from 3.5% to 4.7% was reported in early 2020. During the blockage, NO2 and SO2 levels decreased by 14.4% and 66.0%, respectively, while CO and AOD index increased by 12.68% and 51.0%, respectively. The study concludes that the containment measures during the pandemic had a positive impact on the environment, which shows how the reduction in the anthropogenic activities, especially industrial and transportation activities, have improved the air quality. Thus, stricter actions are needed to protect the environment; for example, the transition towards the using of electric vehicle is necessary, which is part of Egypt's strategy to transition towards a green economy. The government should also adopt a policy to trade carbon emissions reduction certificates to help reduce air pollution.

TI  - Near real-time detection of winter cover crop termination using harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) to support ecosystem assessment
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops are planted to reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, and improve watershed management. In the Delmarva Peninsula of the eastern United States, winter cover crops are essential for reducing nutrient and sediment losses from farmland. Cost-share programs have been created to incentivize cover crops to achieve conservation objectives. This program required that cover crops be planted and terminated within a specified time window. Usually, farmers report cover crop termination dates for each enrolled field (similar to 28,000 per year), and conservation district staff confirm the report with field visits within two weeks of termination. This verification process is labor-intensive and time-consuming and became restricted in 2020-2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study used Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS, version 2.0) time-series data and the within-season termination (WIST) algorithm to detect cover crop termination dates over Maryland and the Delmarva Peninsula. The estimated remote sensing termination dates were compared to roadside surveys and to farmer-reported termination dates from the Maryland Department of Agriculture database for the 2020-2021 cover crop season. The results show that the WIST algorithm using HLS detected 94% of terminations (statuses) for the enrolled fields (n = 28,190). Among the detected terminations, about 49%, 72%, 84%, and 90% of remote sensing detected termination dates were within one, two, three, and four weeks of agreement to farmer-reported dates, respectively. A real-time simulation showed that the termination dates could be detected one week after termination operation using routinely available HLS data, and termination dates detected after mid-May are more reliable than those from early spring when the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was low. We conclude that HLS imagery and the WIST algorithm provide a fast and consistent approach for generating near-real-time cover crop termination maps over large areas, which can be used to support cost-share program verification.

TI  - Ground-Validation and Error Attribution of Near-Surface Air Temperature From AIRS in North America
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of near-surface air temperature (TsurfAir) at fine spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for environmental applications, data assimilation into land surface models, and climate change studies. The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board the Aqua satellite measures TsurfAir twice a day at the global scale. In this study, the AIRS TsurfAir is validated using ground-based weather stations in North America. Owing to the high density of weather stations, spatial heterogeneity (<1 degrees) of TsurfAir is modeled using semi-variograms and further used to calculate the validation reference via ordinary kriging at AIRS retrieval footprints. This analysis intends to reveal error characteristics in cold and hot seasons by selecting six months of data in January and July of three years, along with a case study on two extreme events. Furthermore, MODIS-enabled land surface temperature and land cover are used to attribute the observed error in TsurfAir. Results show an overall warm bias of 0.11 K from AIRS TsurfAir and conditional bias over- and underestimating cold and hot temperatures, respectively. Spatial heterogeneity of TsurfAir is found to influence the variance of AIRS TsurfAir error. As a possible source of TsurfAir error, land surface temperatures (Tskin) from AIRS and MODIS are compared. Close match between the two Tskin products indicates a lesser influence of the Tskin difference on TsurfAir error. Overall, the ground validation of AIRS TsurfAir along with the error attribution can facilitate post-processing of AIRS products and uncertainty analysis for the wide range of applications of AIRS TsurfAir.

TI  - Do development zones increase urban land use intensity? Empirical analysis from 235 cities in China
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The development zone has been considered the engine of China's urban development in recent decades. However, the prosperity of development zones has also brought many land use problems. Given the lack of highresolution time-series land-use data, the impact of development zone construction on urban land use has not been adequately addressed within the existing literature. Employing new annual high-resolution satellite data, this article for the first time quantifies the impact of development zones on the expansion of urban areas and on changes in land-use intensity across China, identifying spatial and temporal differences in their impact using Propensity Score Matching with a Difference-in-Difference (PSM-DID) model. Using panel data for 235 Chinese cities from 1990 to 2015, we found that establishing development zones increased the expansion of urban areas and reduced the urban land-use intensity in the short term (usually 2 years). From spatial perspectives, the impact of development zones on land use displayed spatial heterogeneity. Finally, we put forward policy suggestions to improve the land use intensity of development zones in the context of sustainable development.

TI  - Human activities change suspended sediment concentration along rivers
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans have drastically disrupted the global sediment cycle. Suspended sediment flux and concentration are key controls over both river morphology and river ecosystems. Our ability to understand sediment dynamics within river corridors is limited by observations. Here, we present RivSed, a database of satellite observations of suspended sediment concentration (SSC) from 1984 to 2018 across 460 large (>60 m wide) US rivers that provides a new, spatially explicit view of river sediment. We found that 32% of US rivers have a declining temporal trend in sediment concentration, with a mean reduction of 40% since 1984, whereas only 2% have an increasing trend. Most rivers (52%) show decreasing sediment concentration longitudinally moving downstream, typically due to a few large dams rather than the accumulated effect of many small dams. Comparing our observations with modeled 'pre-dam' longitudinal SSC, most rivers (53%) show different patterns. However, contemporary longitudinal patterns in concentration are remarkably stable from year to year since 1984, with more stability in large, highly managed rivers with less cropland. RivSed has broad applications for river geomorphology and ecology and highlights anthropogenic effects on river corridors across the US.

TI  - Mapping Water Levels across a Region of the Cuvette Centrale Peatland Complex
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Inundation dynamics are the primary control on greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands. Situated in the central Congo Basin, the Cuvette Centrale is the largest tropical peatland complex. However, our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in its water levels is limited. By addressing this gap, we can quantify the relationship between the Cuvette Centrale's water levels and greenhouse gas emissions, and further provide a baseline from which deviations caused by climate or land-use change can be observed, and their impacts understood. We present here a novel approach that combines satellite-derived rainfall, evapotranspiration and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to estimate spatial and temporal changes in water level across a sub-region of the Cuvette Centrale. Our key outputs are a map showing the spatial distribution of rainfed and flood-prone locations and a daily, 100 m resolution map of peatland water levels. This map is validated using satellite altimetry data and in situ water table data from water loggers. We determine that 50% of peatlands within our study area are largely rainfed, and a further 22.5% are somewhat rainfed, receiving hydrological input mostly from rainfall (directly and via surface/sub-surface inputs in sloped areas). The remaining 27.5% of peatlands are mainly situated in riverine floodplain areas to the east of the Congo River and between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. The mean amplitude of the water level across our study area and over a 20-month period is 22.8 & PLUSMN; 10.1 cm to 1 standard deviation. Maximum temporal variations in water levels occur in the riverine floodplain areas and in the inter-fluvial region between the Ubangui and Congo rivers. Our results show that spatial and temporal changes in water levels can be successfully mapped over tropical peatlands using the pattern of net water input (rainfall minus evapotranspiration, not accounting for run-off) and L-band SAR data.

TI  - Monitoring Pontederia crassipes Mart. and Hydrocotyle ranunculoides L.f. invasion on a Mediterranean island using multi-temporal satellite images
T2  - MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the role of multispectral images from Sentinel-2 satellites to map and monitor in the Mediterranean island of Sardinia (Italy), from 2018 to 2021, Pontederia crassipes and Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, two aquatic macrophytes included in the list of invasive alien species of European Union concern. The vegetation index NDVI was used to assess the level of vigor of these species and the area of invasion on waterways to understand their expansion over time. At the same time, the correlation between recorded monthly mean air temperatures and NDVI values was calculated. The coverage, during this 4-yearstudy, affected almost entirely the study area, with high coverage values in the summer and autumn periods. This study demonstrates the usefulness of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in mapping and monitoring invasive alien macrophytes. In fact, large areas can be monitored and mapped quickly in a short time and have measurements every five days due to the images released by European Space Agency (ESA), unless there is excessive cloud covering. In combination with GIS and modelling tools, the tested multitemporal methodology could represent a suitable tool for prevention, drafting of dedicated action plans, priority setting for intervention both for P. crassipes and H. ranunculoides to meet the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 1143/2014 on Invasive Alien Species (the IAS Regulation).

TI  - Four-decade (1977-2017) landscape tale of tourist reservoir hotspot El Pinol-Guatape, Colombia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient management of land use/land cover (LULC) features is vital for a balanced sustainable ecosystem. Thus, this work aimed to document the LULC changes in the less studied El Penol-Guatape reservoir, Antioquia, Colombia, especially in the reservoir area due to the construction of a hydro-electric power plant. For this study, Landsat images of 1977, 1986, 1997, and 2017 were used and the results indicated an increase in the settlement area and road networks by 0.10 and 0.60%, respectively, while during 1986 to 2017, cropland, plantation, dense forest, and open forest areas presented an increase of 0.52, 1.06, 2.87 and 2.61%, respectively. However, the marshy vegetation, scrub forest and fallow land decreased to - 0.51, - 3.79 and - 4.29%, respectively, in the same period. The water body before and after the completion of reservoir project denoted an increase from 13.1 km(2) in 1977 to 45.7 km(2) in 1986. This study provides a first-hand report on LULC dynamics in this tourism dominated municipalities that will serve as a reference for ecosystem management to reconcile the conflicts between different LULC classes in ecologically enriched regions.

TI  - Contemporaneous Thick- and Thin-Skinned Seismotectonics in the External Zagros: The Case of the 2021 Fin Doublet, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we propose a geodetic model for the seismic sequence, with doublet earthquakes, that occurred in Bandar Abbas, Iran, in November 2021. A dataset of Sentinel-1 images, processed using the InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) technique, was employed to identify the surface deformation caused by the major events of the sequence and to constrain their geometry and kinematics using seismological constraints. A Coulomb stress transfer analysis was also applied to investigate the sequence's structural evolution in space and time. A linear inversion of the InSAR data provided a non-uniform distribution of slip over the fault planes. We also performed an accurate relocation of foreshocks and aftershocks recorded by locally established seismographs, thereby allowing us to determine the compressional tectonic stress regime affecting the crustal volume. Despite the very short time span of the sequence, our results clearly suggest that distinct blind structures that were previously unknown or only suspected were the causative faults. The first Mw 6.0 earthquake occurred on an NNE-dipping, intermediate-angle, reverse-oblique plane, while the Mw 6.4 earthquake occurred on almost horizontal or very low-angle (SSE-dipping) reverse segments with top-to-the-south kinematics. The former, which cut through and displaced the Pan-African pre-Palaeozoic basement, indicates a thick-skinned tectonic style, while the latter rupture(s), which occurred within the Palaeozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary succession and likely exploited the stratigraphic mechanical discontinuities, clearly depicts a thin-skinned style.

TI  - Detection of Zika Virus in <i>Aedes aegypti</i> and <i>Aedes albopictus</i> Mosquitoes Collected in Urban Forest Fragments in the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Zika virus (ZIKV) is an RNA flavivirus (Flaviviridae family) endemic in tropical and subtropical regions that is transmitted to humans by Aedes (Stegomyia) species mosquitoes. The two main urban vectors of ZIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which can be found throughout Brazil. This study investigated ZIKV infection in mosquito species sampled from urban forest fragments in Manaus (Brazilian Amazon). A total of 905 non-engorged female Ae. aegypti (22 specimens) and Ae. albopictus (883 specimens) were collected using BG-Sentinel traps, entomological hand nets, and Prokopack aspirators during the rainy and dry seasons between 2018 and 2021. All pools were macerated and used to inoculate C6/36 culture cells. Overall, 3/20 (15%) Ae. aegypti and 5/241 (2%) Ae. albopictus pools screened using RT-qPCR were positive for ZIKV. No supernatants from Ae. aegypti were positive for ZIKV (0%), and 15 out of 241 (6.2%) Ae. albopictus pools were positive. In this study, we provide the first-ever evidence of Ae. albopictus naturally infected with ZIKV in the Amazon region.

TI  - Assessing land use changes' effect on river water quality in the Dez Basin using land change modeler
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use due to urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture will adversely affect water quality at all scales. This study examined the possible effects of future land use on the water quality of the Dez River located in Iran. The QUAL2Kw dynamic model was used to simulate the water quality of the Dez River. Data and information available in July 2019 and 2013 were used for calibration and validation. According to the comparison of the RMSE, RMSE%, and percent bias error indices for the model during the calibration and validation period, the QUAL2Kw model of Dez River had high accuracy with acceptable values of errors. The land use changes in the Dez river basin were modeled and predicted by the LCM model after simulating water quality. The images from Landsat 8/OLI were used for 2013, 2016, and 2019, respectively. Based on the accurate evaluation of classified images, Kappa coefficients for 2013, 2016, and 2019 were 88.19, 87.46, and 89.91, respectively. Modeling land use and land cover changes was conducted to predict 2030. As a result of the study, agricultural and built-up areas and water bodies will increase in 2030. The possible effects of land use changes in 2030 on river water quality were examined as a final step. Based on the results of the water quality simulation in 2030, biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and NO3 parameters exceeded the maximum permissible level of drinking standard. This study recommends frequent water quality monitoring and LULC planning and management to reduce pollution in river basins.

TI  - Stubble-burning activities in north-western India in 2021: Contribution to air pollution in Delhi
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Stubble-burning in northern India is an important source of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) and trace gases, which significantly impact local and regional climate, in addition to causing severe health risks. Scientific research on assessing the impact of these burnings on the air quality over Delhi is still relatively sparse. The present study analyzes the satellite-retrieved stubbleburning activities in the year 2021, using the MODIS active fire count data for Punjab and Haryana, and assesses the contribution of CO and PM2.5 from such biomass-burning activities to the pollution load in Delhi. The analysis suggests that the satellite-retrieved fire counts in Punjab and Haryana were the highest among the last five years (2016-2021). Further, we note that the stubble-burning fires in the year 2021 are delayed by similar to 1 week compared to that in the year 2016. To quantify the contribution of the fires to the air pollution in Delhi, we use tagged tracers for CO and PM2.5 emissions from fire emissions in the regional air quality forecasting system. The modeling framework suggests a maximum daily mean contribution of the stubble-burning fires to the air pollution in Delhi in the months of October-November 2021 to be around 30-35%. We find that the contribution from stubble burning activities to the air quality in Delhi is maximum (minimum) during the turbulent hours of late morning to afternoon (calmer hours of evening to early morning). The quantification of this contribution is critical from the crop-residue and airquality management perspective for policymakers in the source and the receptors regions, respectively.

TI  - Retrieving Soil Moisture at the Field Scale from Sentinel-1 Data over a Semi-Arid Mediterranean Agricultural Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, superficial soil moisture is estimated from SAR data at the field scale on agricultural fields over which the relationship between the co-polarized backscattering coefficient (?(VV)(0)) and the measured soil moisture (SSMv) is both direct and inverse. An inversion algorithm is adapted to the charateristics of the single field and applied to SAR signal differences. The differences of SAR signal are obtained from a change detection (CD) method applied on the VV band of the Sentinel-1 SAR mission. In the CD method, the variations of the total backscattered signal due to sharp changes in vegetation and soil roughness are excluded from the dataset by using a machine learning algorithm. The retrieval method is applied on a low vegetated agricultural area in Spain, characterized by a semi-arid mediterranean climate and where in situ soil moisture data are available. Good results are obtained not only over fields characterized by direct ?0VV/SSMv relationship, reaching values of correlation coefficient and RMSE up to r=0.89 and RMSE=0.042 m(3)/m(3), but also over fields with inverse relationship, obtaining in this case values up to r=0.84 ad RMSE=0.026 m(3)/m(3). Although the inverse relationship between the backscattering coefficient and the measured soil moisture is not yet well understood in the field of soil moisture estimation from radar data, for the present case, checking the nature of this relationship was fundamental in order to accordingly adapt the soil moisture retrieval algorithm to the dataset characteristics.

TI  - Assessment of Regional Differences in the Implementation of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in China
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is still an important risk factor that endangers the health of Chinese people, leading the government to implement a series of policies to address air pollution. This study takes the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) proposed in 2013 as the object and uses the combined data set of China's 2000-2019 economic panel data and PM2.5 remote sensing data to analyse the implementation effect of the policy by the multiperiod difference-in-differences method, considering regional heterogeneity. The results show that the implementation of the APPCAP significantly reduced the PM2.5 concentration in China, and the effect was stronger in the Yangtze River Delta region. Future governance policies should further consider local characteristics and determine pollution control goals and measures according to local conditions.

TI  - Quantification of linear and nonlinear elasticity by compression optical coherence elastography for determining lymph node status in breast cancer
T2  - LASER PHYSICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report the first application of compression optical coherence elastography (C-OCE) to evaluate both linear and nonlinear elastic properties of lymph nodes (LNs) for assessing their status, which is an important factor for detecting metastasis and staging breast cancer. The reported study involved 27 excised sentinel and axillary LNs from 24 patients with breast cancer, including normal LNs (n = 6), reactive LNs with follicular hyperplasia (n = 7) and sinus histiocytosis (n = 8), and metastatic LNs (n = 6). C-OCE data were compared with co-registered gold-standard histopathology and demonstrated a significantly higher contrast in differentiation of LNs as compared to structural optical coherence tomography imaging. Normal LNs are characterized by low stiffness values in the areas of LN cortex (<200 kPa). C-OCE revealed that abnormal reactive LNs with follicular hyperplasia exhibit moderately increased stiffness (200-300 kPa) in the cortex areas and more pronounced stiffness increase (400-600 kPa) in the areas of sinus histiocytosis. LNs with total metastasis exhibit fairly uniformly distributed highest stiffness values (>600 kPa). Since in terms of the tangent Young's modulus there remained an appreciable overlap among these types of LNs, we also evaluated their elastic nonlinearity parameters. Complementary usage of both linear and nonlinear elastic parameters enabled very clear differentiation of all four main states of LNs. Thus, C-OCE imaging demonstrates high potential for future intraoperative usage to rapidly determine the LN status during breast-conserving surgery and to assess the extent of the cancer cells propagation in regional lymphatic collectors for preserving benign LNs. This is important for reducing the associated risks and complications (such as lymphedema) from excessive surgical removal of lymphoid structures.

TI  - THEISTIC COSMOLOGY OF RICHARD SWINBURNE AS A PHENOMENON OF THE THEOLOGICAL RENAISSANCE
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of this article is the theistic cosmology of Richard Swinburne, which was a noticeable phenomenon of the theological renaissance at the end of the last century, which even now enriches the present age with new theological meanings. Swinburn sees the main task of his work as a consistent systematic development of a new theological paradigm that would use the achievements of modern science. This mental experiment is carried out by the author from the positions of probabilism, is based on the selection of inductive evidence for the existence of God, and ultimately should demonstrate the proper probability of the central position of the religious worldview - 'God exists'. This, according to the author, is the core of his own 'hypothesis of theism', which explains the emergence of the Universe, the reasons for its appearance, the existence and functioning of its constantly operating laws, its focus on the emergence of animals and the emergence of man. Particular attention in the article was paid to the epistemology of Richard Swinburne, his understanding of the method, not only as a tool for finding and fixing the ultimate theological meanings, but already more as a certain way of building the entire theological system, a system that, in turn, became an intermediary between faith itself and culture.

TI  - Solar Salterns and Pollution: Valorization of Some Endemic Species as Sentinels in Ecotoxicology
T2  - TOXICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Solar salterns and salt marshes are unique ecosystems with special physicochemical features and characteristic biota. Currently, there are very few studies focused on the impacts of pollution on these economic and ecological systems. Unfortunately, diversified pollution (metals, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, etc.) has been detected in these complex ecosystems. These hypersaline environments are under increasing threat due to anthropogenic pressures. Despite this, they represent a valuable source of microbial diversity, with taxa displaying special features in terms of environmental remediation capacities as well as economical species such as Artemia spp. (Branchiopoda) and Dunaliella salina (Chlorophyta). In this review, we discuss the impacts of pollution on these semi-artificial systems. Therefore, we have indicated the sentinel species identified in plankton communities, which can be used in ecotoxicological investigations in solar salterns. In future, researchers should increase their interest in pollution assessment in solar salterns and salt marshes.

TI  - Change and Driving Factor Analysis of Eco-Environment of Typical Lakes in Arid Areas
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid regions with scarce water resources, lakes play an extremely vital role in maintaining the ecological environment. Therefore, the Chinese government has launched an ecological water conveyance project in the Tarim River basin in Xinjiang with the aim of restoring the ecological environment of the area. In previous studies, there was no complete evaluation system used to quantify changes in the ecological environment of arid regions after ecological water conveyance. In this paper, Lake Taitema was selected as the study area, which is both a terminal lake in the Tarim River basin and an object of the ecological water conveyance project. This study utilized Landsat TM/OLI satellite remote sensing images and MODIS datasets to build a remote sensing ecological index model and systematically evaluated the changes in the ecological environment and land use types in the Taitema Lake area. A structural equation model was constructed to analyze the correlation between the area of Taitema Lake and its driving factors. The results show that over the selected 20 years, the proportion of pixels with an upward trend (Zc > 0) of the RSEI was 56.5%, while the proportion of pixels with a downward trend (Zc < 0) of the RSEI was 43.5%. The area proportion of regions with poor ecological environment quality decreased by about 40%, and the area proportions of regions with moderate, good, and excellent ecological environment quality increased by 29.7%, 10%, and 0.6%, respectively. By comparing the land use data from 2000 and 2020, the proportion of grassland increased by 6%, the proportion of water area increased by 4.4%, and the proportion of unused land decreased by 9.6%. In summary, after the implementation of the ecological water conveyance project, the ecological environment quality of the Lake Taitema area gradually improved, and ecological water conveyance was the main driving factor of the area change in Lake Taitema.

TI  - Analysis of Precipitation Process and Operational Precipitation Enhancement in Panxi Region Based on Cloud Parameters Retrievals from China's Next-Generation Geostationary Meteorological Satellite FY-4A
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geostationary meteorological satellite data with high spatial and temporal resolution can be used to retrieve cloud physical parameters, which has significant advantages in tracking cloud evolution and development. Based on satellite multispectral RGB composite image and cloud physical analysis methods, we quantitatively analyze the evolution characteristics of cloud parameters in the pre-, mid- and post-artificially influenced weather process, explore the application potential benefits of satellite data in monitoring the operating conditions of the artificially influenced weather in the Panxi region, and verify the feasibility analysis of the evaluation of their effects. In this study, cloud parameters such as cloud particle effective radius (Re), cloud liquid water path (LWP), cloud ice water path (IWP), and cloud top height and temperature (CTH and CTT) are retrieved using FY-4A satellite data. For the Panxi region, the evolution characteristics of typical cloud parameters in the affected area before and after two aircraft artificial operational precipitation enhancements are analyzed. The results show that the satellite retrieval of cloud characteristic parameters in the Panxi region has good application value, which can be used to guide the artificial Operational Precipitation Enhancement. In this precipitation process, there are solid particles in the upper layer cloud and supercooled water in the lower layer cloud. After the cold cloud catalysis, the cloud top height, liquid water and ice water content, particle effective radius and ground precipitation in the operational area increased, and the cloud top temperature decreased. Thus, it effectively alleviated the drought in the Panxi region. The satellite retrieval of cloud characteristic parameters in the Panxi region has a good application value, which can provide a basis and guidance for future weather modification operations in the Panxi region.

TI  - Construction of the Global Reference Atmospheric Profile Database
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric profiles are important input parameters for atmospheric radiative transfer models and atmospheric parameter inversions. The construction of regionally representative reference atmospheric profiles can provide basic data for global atmospheric and environmental research. Most reference atmospheric profile databases commonly used lag behind in updating frequency. These databases usually have limited spatial and temporal resolution and differ greatly from the real atmospheric state. To present the real atmospheric state, this article constructs the Global Reference Atmospheric Profile Database (GRAP) based on ACE-FTS satellite products of 2021 and 2022, AIRS satellite products and ERA5 reanalysis data of 2022 u6sing a random forest regression model and a hierarchical mean algorithm. The radiance spectrum of FY-3E HIRAS-II using different profile databases was simulated and compared with the measured spectrum. The results show that GRAP spectral simulations fit better with the measured HIRAS-II spectrum. Comparing the CO2, CH4, O-3 and N2O profiles of GRAP, AFGL, MIPAS, RTTOV and NDACC ground station profiles in equatorial, mid-latitude summer and polar winter, the results show that GRAP has high spatial and temporal resolution and better fits the current real atmospheric state. Comparing the temperature profiles of eight regions in China, the results illustrate that GRAP is a better representation of the state of the atmosphere in the Chinese region. GRAP can provide fundamental atmospheric data for radiative transfer studies and atmospheric parameter inversions.

TI  - Monitoring spatio-temporal changes in wetlands with harmonized image series in Google Earth Engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Study of rapidly changing lakes and wetlands with remote sensing methods is critical for understanding the climatic and anthropogenic effects. However, most of the studies search for the change of water body in specific time periods. Although this approach reduces the workload related to downloading and processing a large number of satellite images in computer environment, it actually causes ignoring some critical changes that occurred out of specified time periods. On the other hand, this situation reduces the data volume and the limited data causes problems for the management of water resources. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform allows the opportunity to rapidly and practically process large-scale temporal data without downloading. In this study, areal changes in Lake Aksehir in Turkiye, from 1985 to 2020, were calculated and mapped by the GEE as a case. In order to calculate the changes, the Landsat 5 TM, 7 ETM + and 8 OLI&TIRS images were harmonized and created annual mosaics. The Normalized difference water index (NDWI) and the automated water extraction index (AWEI) were applied to these annual mosaics. By this approach, the change in the water area representing a shrank by 87% on average (according to the calculations 91% for the NDWI and 83% for the AWEI) from 1985 to 2020 was assessed practically and rapidly on annual mosaics created from all images between the studied period, instead of assessment based on images taken on only one date in the chosen years as in previous studies. Such an approach will provide time and labour savings and provide more meaningful and uninterrupted data for studies about changes in other wetland areas.

TI  - Historical Semantics of Confucianism during the Transitional Period of Modern Korea
T2  - REVIEW OF KOREAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The world order, in which the modernity of the West constitutes what is universal, touted the advancement of civilization as the common law of nature to justify colonialism. Western scholarship poured into the vacuum of worldview formed by the disintegration of Sino-centrism. The response of modern Korean Confucian intellectuals took various forms. This article focuses on the arguments related to Confucianism and the transformation of the Confucian knowledge system following the acceptance of Western concepts. The status of Confucianism, which had been the state religion during the transitional period to modernity, continued down a path of decline, and its knowledge system was unable to function as the leading principle of the society. The shock brought on by the West was a civilizational transition that could not be resolved by the restoration of morality. The stance to preserve Eastern ways, or moral values, while adopting Western means, or scientific technology, was proposed as a response to the situation. In the dispute over old and new learning, however, Confucianism had to prove whether it could be the proper knowledge system that would satisfy the demands of civilizational advancement and historical progress. Confucianism resorted to the re-appropriation of the existing notion of practical learning, which referred to the scientific technology of the West. From the stance of reformists, Confucian ethics was a universal practical learning. The scientification of learnings brought into the concept of philosophy, which accelerated the changes in the knowledge system centered on Confucianism. When the term gyeokchi, or the investigation of things and the extension of knowledge, and gungni, or the exhaustive search for the principle, were used together as translations of the terms philosophy and science, it was difficult to add the meaning of moral practice beyond the definition as the observation of things and the investigation of principle. Confucianism, which was once regarded to the counterpart to Western philosophy, was pointed as an obstacle to civilization and became a Confucian philosophy during the process of the deconstruction of the knowledge system. Similar to how the traditional knowledge system was rearranged under the name of philosophy, the acceptance of the concept of religion, in which Christianity was the universal religion of civilization, gave rise to skepticism of the religiosity of Confucianism. The social and political teachings of Confucianism were regarded to be closer to philosophy. Although there were many attempts to reform Confucianism from within including by Bak Eunsik as well as movements to make Confucianism into a religion, it was hard for these attempts to spread among the public and be socially influential. The colonial authorities instrumentalized Confucianism, relegating it to a moral resource for the loyal subjects of the Japanese Empire, recognized only Shintoism, Buddhism, and Christianity as religions, and did not acknowledge Confucianism as a religion. Although Confucianism of modern Korean is now regarded as part of the historical cultural heritage, the historical significance of Confucianism during the transitional period to modernity is essential in contemplating modernity.

TI  - Evaluating the Performance of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques to HyMap Imagery for Lithological Mapping in a Semi-Arid Region: Case Study from Western Anti-Atlas, Morocco
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate lithological mapping is a crucial juncture for geological studies and mineral exploration. Hyperspectral data provide the opportunity to extract detailed information about the geology and mineralogy of the Earth's surface. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques provide an accurate and effective mapping of various types of lithologies in arid and semi-arid regions. This article discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), random forest (RF), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), for lithological mapping in a complex area with strong hydrothermal alteration. The study evaluates the performance of the four algorithms in three different zones in the Ameln valley shear zone (AVSZ) area at eastern Kerdous inlier, Moroccan western Anti-Atlas. The results demonstrated that 1D-CNN achieved the best classification results for most lithological units. Additionally, the LK-SVM demonstrated good mapping results compared to the other SVM models, as well as RF and KNN. Our study concludes that the combination of the CNN and HyMap data can provide the most accurate lithologic mapping for the three selected region, with an overall accuracy of similar to 95%. However, this study highlights the challenges in identifying different lithological units using remotely sensed data due to spectrum similarities induced by similar chemical and mineralogical compositions. This study emphasizes the importance of carefully considering and evaluating ML and DL methods for lithological mapping studies, then recommends the high-resolution hyperspectral data and DL models for accurate results. The implications of this study would be fascinating to exploration geologists for Mineral Prospectivity Mapping (MPM), especially in selecting the most appropriate techniques for highly accurate mineral mapping in metallogenic provinces.

TI  - Temporal Cascade Model for Analyzing Spread in Evolving Networks
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SPATIAL ALGORITHMS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Current approaches for modeling propagation in networks (e.g., of diseases, computer viruses, rumors) cannot adequately capture temporal properties such as order/duration of evolving connections or dynamic likelihoods of propagation along connections. Temporal models on evolving networks are crucial in applications that need to analyze dynamic spread. For example, a disease spreading virus has varying transmissibility based on interactions between individuals occurring with different frequency, proximity, and venue population density. Similarly, propagation of information having a limited active period, such as rumors, depends on the temporal dynamics of social interactions. To capture such behaviors, we first develop the Temporal Independent Cascade (T-IC) model with a spread function that efficiently utilizes a hypergraph-based sampling strategy and dynamic propagation probabilities. We prove this function to be submodular, with guarantees of approximation quality. This enables scalable analysis on highly granular temporal networks where other models struggle, such as when the spread across connections exhibits arbitrary temporally evolving patterns. We then introduce the notion of "reverse spread" using the proposed T-IC processes, and develop novel solutions to identify both sentinel/detector nodes and highly susceptible nodes. Extensive analysis on real-world datasets shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the alternatives in modeling both if and how spread occurs, by considering evolving network topology alongside granular contact/interaction information. Our approach has numerous applications, such as virus/rumor/influence tracking. Utilizing T-IC, we explore vital challenges of monitoring the impact of various intervention strategies over real spatio-temporal contact networks where we show our approach to be highly effective.

TI  - Assessing and mapping spatial accessibility of peri-urban and rural neighborhood of Durgapur Municipal Corporation, India: A tool for transport planning
T2  - CASE STUDIES ON TRANSPORT POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban growth and its relation to transport network within the peri-urban zone were investigated in this paper. Using multi-temporal satellite imageries and road network data, the current study investigates a tool for transport planning and how it creates impact on the growth of built-up area. For the years 2001, 2011 and 2021, Landsat TM and OLI TIRS satellite images were used to create built-up area as well as the network data has been extracted from the different sources and create two 309*309 metrics table for the accessing of accessibility of peri-urban and rural neighborhood of Durgapur Municipal Corporation. From the above two metrics table alpha, beta, gamma, pi, grid tree pattern degree of connectivity, average shortest path length, shimbel index, connectivity index etc. have been calculated and mapped. Using the Open Root Service tools, the travel time from the peri-urban and rural neighborhood to city center has been also calculated. From the different above index, it has been observed that the along the NH-2, the accessibility is high. On the other hand, to show the built-up characteristics, direction and distance wise the built-up density and built-up expansion intensity index have been also analyzed. The highest expansion rate and intensity has been observed in the WNW, NNW, ESE and SSE direction. The geographical weightage regression also has been applied in this study to show the relation between built-up area and road density. The findings of this study could help regional planners assess the current state of active transportation options and pinpoint areas that need more attention to make them more accessible when allocating new urban facilities or reallocating those that are already there to lessen the negative effects that individual motorized transportation has on urban mobility.

TI  - Dynamicity of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) An analysis from peri-urban and rural neighbourhoods of Durgapur Municipal Corporation (DMC) in India
T2  - REGIONAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of better economic possibilities and well-connected transportation networks has attracted people to migrate to peri-urban and rural neighbourhoods, changing the landscape of regions outside the city and fostering the growth of physical infrastructure. Using multi-temporal satellite images, the dynamics of Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) changes, the impact of urban growth on LULC changes, and regional environmental implications were investigated in the periurban and rural neighbourhoods of Durgapur Municipal Corporation in India. The study used different case studies to highlight the study area's heterogeneity, as the phenomenon of change is not consistent. Landsat TM and OLI-TIRS satellite images in 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2021 were used to analyze the changes in LULC types. We used the relative deviation (RD), annual change intensity (ACI), uniform intensity (UI) to show the dynamicity of LULC types (agriculture land; built-up land; fallow land; vegetated land; mining area; and water bodies) during 1991-2021. This study also applied the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) to measure environmental sensitivity zones and find out the causes of LULC changes. According to LULC statistics, agriculture land, built-up land, and mining area increased by 51.7, 95.46, and 24.79 km2, respectively, feom 1991 to 2021. The results also suggested that built-up land and mining area had the greatest (LST), whereas water bodies and vegetated land showed the lowest LST. Moreover, this study looked at the relationships among LST, spectral indices (Normalized Differenced Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)), and environmental sensitivity. The results showed that all of the spectral indices have the strongest association with LST, indicating that built-up land had a far stronger influence on the LST. The spectral indices indicated that the decreasing trends of vegetated land and water bodies were 4.26 and 0.43 km2/a, respectively, during 1991-2021. In summary, this study can help the policy-makers to predict the increasing rate of temperature and the causes for the temperature increase with the rapid expansion of built-up land, thus making effective peri-urban planning decisions.

TI  - Forest Area and Structural Variable Estimation in Boreal Forest Using Suomi NPP VIIRS Data and a Sample from VHR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our objective was to develop a method for the assessment of forest area and structural variables for cases in which the availability of representative ground reference data is poor and these data are not collected from the whole area of interest. We implemented two independent approaches to the estimation of the forest variables of a European boreal forest: (i) the computation of wall-to-wall estimates using moderate- to low-resolution VIIRS imagery from the Suomi NPP mission; and (ii) the visual interpretation of plots of samples from very high resolution (VHR) satellite data obtained via a two-stage design. Our focus was on the statistical comparison of forest resources at a country or larger level. The study area was boreal forest ranging from Norway to the Ural Mountains in Russia. We computed a seamless mosaic from 111 VIIRS images. From the mosaic, we computed predictions for the forest area, growing stock volume, height of the dominating tree layer, proportion of conifers and broadleaved trees, site fertility class, and leaf area index. The reference data for the VIIRS imagery were national forest inventory (NFI)-based raster maps from Finland. The first stage sample of VHR data included 42 images; of these, a second stage sample of 2690 plots was visually interpreted for the same variables. The forest area prediction from VIIRS for the whole study area was 1.2% higher than the VHR-based result. All other structural variable predictions using VIIRS fitted within the 95% confidence intervals computed from the VHR sample except for estimates of the main tree species groups, which were outside the limits. A comparison of VIIRS-based forest area estimates using Finnish and Swedish NFI data indicated overestimations of 10.0% points and 4.6% points, whereas the total growing stock volumes were overestimated by 8% and underestimated by 3.4%, respectively. The correlation coefficients between the VIIRS and VHR image predictions at the 42 VHR image locations varied from 0.70 to 0.85. The VIIRS maps strongly averaged the local predictions due to their coarse spatial resolutions. Based on our findings, the approach using two independent estimations yielded similar figures for the central forest variables for the European boreal forest. A model computed using reference data from a small part of the area of interest can provide satisfactory predictions for a much larger area with a similar biome. Therefore, our concept is applicable to the estimation and overall mapping of a forest area and central structural variables at regional to national levels.

TI  - High-Frequency Observations of Cyanobacterial Blooms in Lake Taihu (China) from FY-4B/AGRI
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - China's FY-4B satellite, launched on 3 June 2021, is a new-generation geostationary meteorological satellite. The Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard FY-4B has 15 spectral channels, including 2 visible (470 and 650 nm), 1 near infrared (825 nm), and 3 shortwave infrared (1379, 1610, and 2225 nm) bands, which can be used to observe the Earth system with the highest spatial resolution of 500 m and 15 min temporal resolution. In this study, FY-4B/AGRI observations were applied for the first time to monitor cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Taihu, China. The AGRI reflectance at visible and near-infrared bands was first corrected to surface reflectance using the 6S radiative transfer model. Due to the similar spectral reflectance characteristics to those of land-based vegetation, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and some other remote sensing vegetation indices are usually used for the retrieval of cyanobacterial blooms. The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) of algae, defined as the fraction of green vegetation in the nadir view, was adopted to depict the status and trend of cyanobacterial blooms. NDVI and FVC, the two remote sensing indices developed for the retrieval of land vegetation, were used for the detection of cyanobacteria blooms in Lake Taihu. Finally, the FVC derived from AGRI measurements was compared with that obtained from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 satellite to validate the effectiveness of our method. It was found that atmospheric correction can substantially improve the determination of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values of cyanobacterial blooms in the lake. As a proof of the robustness of the algorithm, the NDVIs are both derived from both AGRI and AHI and their magnitudes are similar. In addition, the distribution of cyanobacterial blooms derived from AGRI FVC is highly consistent with that derived from FY-3D/MERSI and EOS/MODIS. While a lower spatial resolution of FY-4B/AGRI might restrict its capability in capturing some spatial details of cyanobacterial blooms, the high-frequency measurements can provide information for the timely and effective management of aquatic ecosystems and help researchers better quantify and understand the dynamics of cyanobacterial blooms. In particular, AGRI can provide greater details on the diurnal variation in the distribution of cyanobacterial blooms owing to the high temporal resolution.

TI  - Flying Laboratory of Imaging Systems: Fusion of Airborne Hyperspectral and Laser Scanning for Ecosystem Research
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synergies of optical, thermal and laser scanning remotely sensed data provide valuable information to study the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. One of the few fully operational airborne multi-sensor platforms for ecosystem research in Europe is the Flying Laboratory of Imaging Systems (FLIS), operated by the Global Change Research Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The system consists of three commercial imaging spectroradiometers. One spectroradiometer covers the visible and near-infrared, and the other covers the shortwave infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These two provide full spectral data between 380-2450 nm, mainly for the assessment of biochemical properties of vegetation, soil and water. The third spectroradiometer covers the thermal long-wave infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum and allows for mapping of surface emissivity and temperature properties. The fourth instrument onboard is the full waveform laser scanning system, which provides data on landscape orography and 3D structure. Here, we describe the FLIS design, data acquisition plan and primary data pre-processing. The synchronous acquisition of multiple data sources provides a complex analytical and data framework for the assessment of vegetation ecosystems (such as plant species composition, plant functional traits, biomass and carbon stocks), as well as for studying the role of greenery or blue-green infrastructure on the thermal behaviour of urban systems. In addition, the FLIS airborne infrastructure supports calibration and validation activities for existing and upcoming satellite missions (e.g., FLEX, PRISMA).

TI  - Temporal trends in equine sperm progressive motility: a systematic review and meta-regression
T2  - REPRODUCTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Adverse trends in reproductive function are a concern in humans, companion, livestock, and wildlife species. This study indicates that equine populations are at risk of a comparable decline in sperm progressive motility.There is increasing evidence reporting geographically sensitive adverse trends in human semen quality, with parallel trends observed in the dog sentinel. Despite significant economic and welfare complications associated with poor testicular function, trends in current equine populations are undetermined. Given the predictive value of sperm progressive motility (PMOT) in male factor infertility and fertilisation potential, research determining trends in this parameter is warranted. This research analysed trends in stallion sperm PMOT through systematic review and meta-regression. Using a comprehensive search strategy, Scopus, Embase (Ovid), Medline (Ovid), and VetMed (CAB direct) were scoped for eligible data. Using best practices, 230 meta-data points from 229 articles published from 1991 to 2021 were collated for meta-regression analysis. Sperm PMOT declined significantly between 1984 and 2019 (simple linear regression: b -0.340, P = 0.017; metaregression: b -0.610, P = 0.001). Overall and yearly PMOT declines were predicted at 33.51 and 0.96%, respectively (1984: 63.69 +/- 5.07%; 2019: 42.35 +/- 3.69%). Trends remained consistent irrespective of sensitivity analyses. Yearly and overall declines were stronger in western (yearly: 0.75%, overall: 26.29%) compared to non-western (yearly: 0.46%, overall: 10.65%) populations. Adverse trends contribute vital data to the debate surrounding declining semen quality, supporting the use of equines as novel comparative models for human reproduction. Results could have significant economic, health, and welfare consequences for equine breeding sectors. A comparable decline in human, dog, and horse sperm quality is indicative of a common environmental aetiology, indicating the need for a holistic One Health approach in determining causes and developing preventative strategies.

TI  - Temporal Changes in Land Cover, Land Surface Temperature, Soil Moisture, and Evapotranspiration Using Remote Sensing Techniques-a Case Study of Kutupalong Rohingya Refugee Camp in Bangladesh
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the land use and land cover (LULC), land surface temperature (LST), soil moisture (SM), and evapotranspiration (ET) in the Kutopalong Rohingya refugee camp of the Cox's Bazar District in Bangladesh and compare the results to their surrounding areas to determine the changes for the duration of 2014-2019. A mix of indices and spatial algorithm-based remote sensing methodologies were applied on Landsat 8 satellite images to extract information on the mentioned surface components and processes. The empirical study suggests that since 2017 land use has become progressively diverse in pattern. A decrease of 6.16% in vegetation cover, respectively, with increased grassland and built-up by 5.13% and 1.79% for the whole of Cox's Bazar, has been observed during the 5 years. The significant changes are evident in the Kutupalong campsite alone, experiencing an 80.32% decrease in its total forest lands resulting from more than a four-time increase in Rohingya settlements within 2 years. With an overall accuracy of 87%, the findings are consistent with global LULC change patterns. Statistical and correlation analyses were used to explore the LST, SM, and ET. The results illustrate that the highly populated areas are associated with the highest LST and lowest ET, and vice versa. The maximum temperature observed is during the peak refugee intrusion period of 2017, ranging between 20.29-35.89 degrees C and 20.87-34.96 degrees C, respectively, for January and December. SM content was estimated for bare lands, and the obtained information indicates that dense human settlement directly and negatively impacts this variable. As a result, land in the entire Rohingya campsite is subject to a shift from moderate to mostly dry soil conditions. Evapotranspiration showed a linear trend with SM change and has decreased over the period.

TI  - Dam Deformation Monitoring using Cloud-Based P-SBAS Algorithm: The Kramis Dam Case (Algeria)
T2  - ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the application of the Parallel Small Baseline Subset (P-SBAS) algorithm, provided by the Geohazards Exploitation Platform for the precise monitoring of an earth dam's ground deformation using C-band Sentinel-1 data. The test site object of this study was the Kramis dam, located in the Mostaganem State, Western Algeria. Among the multiple advanced DInSAR techniques, SBAS is very adequate for long-term displacement monitoring in areas with changing terrain and vegetation. Ten corner reflectors were installed as a backscattered radar signal amplification tool to reduce the effect of temporal decorrelation and delineate the dam area. Four Sentinel-1 A and B satellite tracks were available (T30, T37, T103, and T110) to measure displacements, in the Line of Site (LoS) direction, for two years since the installation of the CRs in July 2019. The results showed a subsiding area on the left bank of the dam dike, with a velocity of 4mm/yr, and an uplifting rate of 3-4mm/yr in the upper part of the dike. The entire 3-dimensional vector of displacement of the dam vicinity was estimated using the least-squares method, proving a better understanding of the dam's temporal deformation, particularly for dams with a high exposure factor and associated risk.

TI  - Assessment of the spatial extent of permafrost in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change differentially influences the frozen ground, a major dynamic component of the cryosphere, on a local and regional scale. Under the warming climate with pronounced effects reported at higher altitudes, the characterization of the frozen ground is very important in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), an important and critical region with respect to climate and hydro-glaciological dynamics. In this study, the efficiency and reliability of the surface frost number model are assessed in delineating the spatial extent of different classes of frozen ground in the region. The daily MODIS land surface temperature (LST) with ground surface temperature (GST) and surface geomorphological expressions as ground validation datasets are used jointly in efficiently determining the extent of different classes of frozen ground (continuous and discontinuous permafrost and seasonal frost). The LST and GST resonate with each other in the annual cycle of temperature variation, however, with mean annual LST exhibiting an offset (cold bias) of 5 to 7 & DEG;C relative to mean GST. This study shows that the highest permafrost extent is observed in areas where the lowest thinning rates of glacier ice are reported and vice versa. The surface frost number model categorizes an area of 38% & PLUSMN; 3% and 15%& PLUSMN; 3% in the UIB as permafrost and seasonal frost, respectively. Based on the altitude model, the lower limit of alpine permafrost is approximated at a mean altitude of 4919 & PLUSMN; 590 m a.s.l. in the UIB. The present study acts as preliminary work in the data sparse and inaccessible regions of the UIB in characterizing the frozen and unfrozen ground and may act as a promising input data source in glacio-hydro-meteorological models for the Himalaya and Karakoram. In addition, the study also underlines the consideration of this derelict cryospheric climatic variable in defining and accounting for the sustainable development of socio-economic systems through its intricate ramification on agricultural activity, landscape stability and infrastructure.

TI  - Brain Endothelial Cells Play a Central Role in the Development of Enlarged Perivascular Spaces in the Metabolic Syndrome
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Brain capillary endothelial cell(s) (BECs) have numerous functions, including their semipermeable interface-barrier (transfer and diffusion of solutes), trophic (metabolic homeostasis), tonic (vascular hemodynamics), and trafficking (vascular permeability, coagulation, and leukocyte extravasation) functions to provide brain homeostasis. BECs also serve as the brain's sentinel cell of the innate immune system and are capable of antigen presentation. In metabolic syndrome (MetS), there are two regions resulting in the proinflammatory signaling of BECs, namely visceral adipose tissue depots supplying excessive peripheral cytokines/chemokines (pCCs) and gut microbiota dysbiotic regions supplying excessive soluble lipopolysaccharide (sLPS), small LPS-enriched extracellular vesicle exosomes (lpsEVexos), and pCCs. This dual signaling of BECs at their receptor sites results in BEC activation and dysfunction (BECact/dys) and neuroinflammation. sLPS and lpsEVexos signal BECs' toll-like receptor 4, which then signals translocated nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB). Translocated NFkB promotes the synthesis and secretion of BEC proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Specifically, the chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) is capable of attracting microglia cells to BECs. BEC neuroinflammation activates perivascular space(s) (PVS) resident macrophages. Excessive phagocytosis by reactive resident PVS macrophages results in a stagnation-like obstruction, which along with increased capillary permeability due to BECact/dys could expand the fluid volume within the PVS to result in enlarged PVS (EPVS). Importantly, this remodeling may result in pre- and post-capillary EPVS that would contribute to their identification on T2-weighted MRI, which are considered to be biomarkers for cerebral small vessel disease.

TI  - Predicting fine-scale daily NO2 over Mexico city using an ensemble modeling approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing air pollution prediction models to reduce exposure measurement error in epidemiologic studies. However, efforts for localized, fine-scale prediction models have been predominantly focused in the United States and Europe. Furthermore, the availability of new satellite in-struments such as the TROPOsopheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides novel opportunities for modeling efforts. We estimated daily ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area at 1-km2 grids from 2005 to 2019 using a four-stage approach. In stage 1 (imputation stage), we imputed missing satellite NO2 column measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOMI using the random forest (RF) approach. In stage 2 (calibration stage), we calibrated the association of column NO2 to ground-level NO2 using ground monitors and meteorological features using RF and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. In stage 3 (prediction stage), we predicted the stage 2 model over each 1-km2 grid in our study area, then ensembled the results using a generalized additive model (GAM). In stage 4 (residual stage), we used XGBoost to model the local component at the 200-m2 scale. The cross-validated R2 of the RF and XGBoost models in stage 2 were 0.75 and 0.86 respectively, and 0.87 for the ensembled GAM. Cross-validated root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the GAM was 3.95 mu g/m3. Using novel approaches and newly available remote sensing data, our multi-stage model presented high cross-validated fits and reconstructs fine-scale NO2 estimates for further epidemiologic studies in Mexico City.

TI  - Tailored axillary surgery - A novel concept for clinically node positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary surgery in patients with breast cancer has been a history of de-escalation; however, surgery for clinically node-positive breast cancer remained at the dogmatic level of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). In these patients, currently the only way to avoid ALND is neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) with nodal pathologic complete response (pCR) as diagnosed by selective lymph node removal. However, pCR rates are highly dependent on tumor biology, with luminal tumors being most present yet showing the lowest pCR rates. Therefore, the TAXIS trial is investigating whether in clinically node-positive patients, either with residual disease after NST or in the upfront surgical setting, ALND can be safely omitted. All patients undergo tailored axillary surgery (TAS), which includes removal of the biopsied and clipped node, the sentinel lymph nodes as well as all palpably suspicious nodes, turning a clinically positive axilla into a clinically negative. Feasibility of TAS was recently confirmed in the first pre-specified TAXIS substudy. TAS is followed by axillary radiotherapy to treat any remaining nodal disease. Disease-free survival is the primary endpoint of this non-inferiority trial, and morbidity as well as quality of life are the main secondary endpoints, with ALND being known for having a relevant negative impact on both. Currently, 663 of 1500 patients were randomized; accrual completion is projected for 2025. The TAXIS trial stands out in including clinically node-positive patients in both the neoadjuvant and upfront surgery setting, thereby investigating surgical de-escalation at the far-end of the risk spectrum of patients with breast cancer.

TI  - A New Approach Combining a Multilayer Radiative Transfer Model with an Individual-Based Forest Model: Application to Boreal Forests in Finland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand forest dynamics under today's changing environmental conditions, it is important to analyze the state of forests at large scales. Forest inventories are not available for all regions, so it is important to use other additional methods, e.g., remote sensing observations. Increasingly, remotely sensed data based on optical instruments and airborne LIDAR are becoming widely available for forests. There is great potential in analyzing these measurements and gaining an understanding of forest states. In this work, we combine the new-generation radiative transfer model mScope with the individual-based forest model FORMIND to generate reflectance spectra for forests. Combining the two models allows us to account for species diversity at different height layers in the forest. We compare the generated reflectances for forest stands in Finland, in the region of North Karelia, with Sentinel-2 measurements. We investigate which level of forest representation gives the best results and explore the influence of different calculation methods of mean leaf parameters. For the majority of the forest stands, we generated good reflectances with all levels of forest representation compared to the measured reflectance. Good correlations were also found for the vegetation indices (especially NDVI with R-2 = 0.62). This work provides a forward modeling approach for relating forest reflectance to forest characteristics. With this tool, it is possible to analyze a large set of forest stands with corresponding reflectances. This opens up the possibility to understand how reflectance is related to succession and different forest conditions.

TI  - ESTIMATION OF SUNFLOWER CROP PRODUCTION BASED ON REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES
T2  - AGROLIFE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study used the remote sensing method (Sentinel 2) to analyze the sunflower crop and to estimate the production. The study area was within the DES, ULS "King Mihai I" from Timisoara, Romania. Eight series of images were taken (April 06 -August 07, 2022). Based on the spectral information, the NDMI, NDVI, NPCRI and NBR indexes were calculated. Spline models best described the variation of index values in relation to time (t, days) during the study period, 6 = -0.04286 for NDMI, 6= 0.01172 for NDVI, 6 = 0.00537 for NPCRI, respectively 6 = -0.08481 for NBR. Very strong correlations were found between NDVI and NDMI (r=0.975), between NBR and NDMI (r=0.997), and between NBR and NDVI (r=0.967), p<0.001. Strong correlation was recorded between NDVI and NPCRI (r=-0.881), p<0.01. Moderate correlations were found between NDMI and t (r=0.729), between NBR and t (r=0.752), between NPCRI and NDMI (r=-0.776), and between NBR and NPCRI (r=-0.762), p<0.05. The regression analysis facilitated the estimation of the production based on calculated indices, under conditions of statistical safety.

TI  - Moving beyond ontological (worldview) supremacy: Indigenous insights and a recovery guide for settler-colonial scientists
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Greater engagement and representation of Indigenous voices, knowledges and worldviews in the biological sciences is growing globally through efforts to bring more Indigenous academics into scientific research and teaching institutions. Although the intentions of such efforts may be admirable, these spaces often become sites of great personal tension for the Indigenous scholars who must 'bridge' or 'facilitate' a dialogue between Indigenous and settler-colonial (predominantly Western) knowledge traditions and worldviews. We are a small collective of early career Indigenous scholars from Australia, the United States and Aotearoa New Zealand, and we have gained insights into this situation through the unique experiential learning afforded by navigating such tensions. Here, we discuss tensions that bear remarkable similarities across geographies, cultures and settler-colonial contexts. In doing so, we aim to support other Indigenous scientists and scholars navigating settler colonial and Western research institutions, while offering guidance, suggestions and reflections for the scientific community to allow the development of more nuanced strategies to support Indigenous academics than simply increasing Indigenous representation. We imagine transformed, innovative research and teaching agendas where Indigenous knowledges can thrive, and Indigenous scientists can apply themselves with mutual and balanced respect and reciprocity.

TI  - Exploring Spatiotemporal Variations in Land Surface Temperature Based on Local Climate Zones in Shanghai from 2008 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding changes in urban internal structure and land surface temperature (LST) is essential. The local climate zone (LCZ) scheme has been extensively applied to characterize urban spatial structure, which has potential for urban climate research. We combined optical imagery and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data (Landsat-5 and PALSAR for 2008; Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 for 2020) to map the LCZs in Shanghai, China. The results showed that the areas of open high-rise and open mid-rise buildings significantly increased from 2008 to 2020. Then, we investigated the spatiotemporal variations in LST based on the LCZ data from 2008 to 2020 using the grid method. The mean daytime LST (obtained from Landsat-5 and Landsat-8) was higher in 2020 than in 2008 for each LCZ type in spring. The mean daytime LSTs of compact mid-rise, compact low-rise, large low-rise and heavy industry zones were higher than those of other LCZ types in spring and summer. The mean nighttime LST (obtained from ASTER) in the downtown area was higher than that in the suburbs in summer. Furthermore, the mean nighttime LST of the built types was also generally higher than that of the natural types in summer. A comparison of the mean daytime LSTs in 2008 and 2020 revealed that the expansion trend of the higher LST areas in spring and summer is consistent with the expansion areas of the mid-rise and high-rise built types.

TI  - SAR and InSAR data linked to soil moisture changes on a temperate raised peatland subjected to a wildfire
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometry of Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) can potentially contribute to the cost-effective regional or global monitoring of the degradation and restoration of peatlands. However, there are uncertainties about the links between InSAR results and peatland ecohydrological parameters, especially soil moisture. Here, we analyse the relationships between the temporal evolutions of InSAR coherence, ground displacements, and in-situ soil moisture measurements for a temperate raised bog at Ballynafagh, Co. Kildare, Ireland, in the period 2017-mid2021. We also investigate the effects of a wildfire in June-July 2019 on those relationships. InSAR-derived ground displacements from Sentinel-1 C-band radar data indicate long-term subsidence of the intact and Active Raised Bog. Superimposed on the long-term displacement trends are annual oscillations that are linked to variations in rainfall and temperature and that are in phase with changes in soil moisture. We show that InSAR coherence is directly related to the change in soil moisture, with large changes causing coherence decrease or loss. The wildfire removed a 10-20 cm thick mossy vegetation layer across 60-70% of the intact bog area. The SAR backscatter intensity in VV polarisation increased after the wildfire, but the InSAR coherence, the InSARderived surface displacements and the soil moisture were not noticeably affected. We therefore infer that Cband radar waves attenuate in the active vegetation layer, but penetrate through it into the upper few cm of the underlying peat. The SAR backscatter occurs primarily at this level in the peat, where its coherence is controlled by the soil moisture. These findings underpin application and interpretation of radar for monitoring of peatlands, even if affected by wildfires, which are forecast to increase in both frequency and intensity due to global warming.

TI  - Multi-Dimensional Spatial and Temporal Variations of Ecosystem Service Values in the Li River Basin, 1990-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing landscape patterns would alter ecosystem components and functions, affecting the supply of ecosystem services. Understanding the spatial and temporal variations of ecosystem services is an important basis for ecosystem management and planning decisions and is of great significance for the realization of regional sustainable development. Based on Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 in the Li River Basin, we explored the spatial and temporal variabilities of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin over the past 30 years, from both horizontal and vertical dimensions, using modified equivalence factor method and spatial autocorrelation analysis. The research findings are as follows: (1) Forestland has consistently been the dominant landscape type in the Li River Basin, with its area continuously increasing, while farmland, water bodies, and grassland have decreased, and construction land and bare land have increased. (2) The value of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin exhibited an initial increase followed by a decrease trend, with a net increase of 9.20 x 10(8) yuan. Forestland contributed the most to the value of ecosystem services. (3) Hydrological regulation and climate regulation are the dominant functions of the Li River Basin's ecosystems, accounting for over 50% of the total contribution. (4) The value of ecosystem services per unit area increases with increasing slope and elevation. The segments with slopes ranging from 15 to 25 degrees and elevation zones between 200 and 500 m have the highest total value of ecosystem services. (5) The overall level of ecosystem services in the Li River Basin is relatively high and continues to rise, but areas with a low ecosystem service value are gradually concentrated. (6) The Moran's I values for ecosystem services in all four periods are greater than 0, indicating a significant positive spatial autocorrelation. The overall pattern of ecosystem services is relatively stable, but there are significant spatial variations, which are characterized by lower values in the central area and higher values in the surrounding areas. The research findings provide a scientific basis for watershed ecological environment construction, optimal allocation of land resources, and sustainable landscape management.

TI  - Observations of different populations of radiation belt electrons by FengYun 3C: An analysis of the 17 March 2015 geomagnetic storm event
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The energetic particle (electrons, protons and heavy ions) fluxes measured by FengYun 3C satellite at the Low Earth Orbit provide a crucial independent data source for space environment monitoring. It is of great importance to comprehensively investigate variation features of distinct populations of energetic electrons for radiation belt research and space weather forecasting. In this study, using the particle flux data measured by FengYun 3C, the evolution features and dominant physical mechanisms of trapped, quasi-trapped, and untrapped energetic electrons during the 17 Marth 2015 storm are investigated systematically. The results show that in the main phase of the geomagnetic storm, outer radiation belt electron fluxes (E2: 0. 35 similar to 0. 65 MeV, E3: 0. 65 similar to 1. 2 MeV) promptly decreased two orders of magnitude and electron fluxes at El channel (El: 0. 15 similar to 0. 35 MeV) increased firstly at L<5 due to substorm injections and then reduced obviously at L>4. In the recovery phase, electron fluxes at El channel recovered first (within five hours), covered 2<L<8 spatial range, reaching 10(5) cm (2) . sr (1) . s (1) flux level at the end of this storm due to electron accelerations driven by chorus waves. Regarding the higher energy channel, electron fluxes increased later (E2: within ten hours; E3: within one day) and covered narrow spatial range (E2: 2<L<7; E3: 2. 5<L<6. 5). Based on the distinct variation features of precipitation, quasi-trapped, and trapped electrons, we found that untrapped electron fluxes do not increase when trapped electron (El, E2, E3 channel) fluxes decrease significantly during the main phase of the 17 March 2015 storm, indicating that the main loss mechanism of energetic electrons (El, E2, E3 channel) is magnetopause shadowing rather than loss into the atmosphere. Chorus waves are mainly responsible for the electron flux enhancements during the recovery phase, since the fluxes of three type electrons enhanced significantly in the recovery phase and chorus waves produce both acceleration and scattering effects on electrons. These results indicate that electrons in the radiation belts exhibit complex dynamic characteristics, and particle measurements at the LEO orbit measured by FengYun 3C can provide critical clues regarding the dominant loss and source mechanisms of radiation belt electrons.

TI  - PRRSV Elimination in a Farrow-to-Finish Pig Herd Using Herd Closure and Rollover Approach
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well established that PRRSV elimination is an effective strategy for PRRS control, but published reports concerning successful PRRSV elimination cases in farrow-to-finishing herds are rare. Here, we have reported a successful PRRSV elimination case in a farrow-to-finish herd by employing a "herd closure and rollover" approach with some modifications. Briefly, the introduction of pigs to the herd was stopped and normal production processes were maintained until the herd reached a PRRSV provisional negative status. During the herd closure, strict biosecurity protocols were implemented to prevent transmission between nursery pigs and sows. In the current case, introducing gilts before herd closure and live PRRSV exposure were skipped. In the 23rd week post-outbreak, the pre-weaning piglets started to show 100% PRRSV negativity in qPCR tests. In the 27th week, nursery and fattening barns fully launched depopulation. In the 28th week, nursery and fattening houses reopened and sentinel gilts were introduced into gestation barns. Sixty days post-sentinel gilt introduction, the sentinel pigs maintained being PRRSV antibody negative, manifesting that the herd matched the standard of the provisional negative status. The production performance of the herd took 5 months to bounce back to normal. Overall, the current study provided additional information for PRRSV elimination in farrow-to-finish pig herds.

TI  - Analysis and Validation of the Aerosol Optical Depth of MODIS Products in Gansu Province, Northwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate determination of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is of great importance for climate change research and environmental monitoring. To understand the applicability of the MODIS aerosol product inversion algorithm in Gansu Province, this work uses ground-based solar photometer AOD observation data to validate the MODIS C6 version of the AOD product. Additionally, the retrieval accuracy of MODIS C6 Deep Blue (DB) algorithm AOD products and Deep Blue and Dark Target Fusion (DB-DT combined) algorithm AOD products for Gansu Province when setting different spatial sampling windows is compared and analyzed. Meanwhile, the monitoring effects of these two AOD algorithms in typical polluted atmospheric conditions in Gansu Province are compared. The results show that (1) the correlation between the MODIS AOD products of the two algorithms and the ground-based observation data decreases with an increasing spatial sampling window size. When the spatial sampling window of the two algorithms is set at 30 km x 30 km, it is more representative of the AOD value in Gansu Province, thus reflecting local characteristics. (2) When the spatial sampling window is set at 30 km x 30 km, the inversion effect of the DB algorithm AOD is better than that of the DB-DT combined algorithm AOD on different underlying surfaces. (3) The seasonal variability in the inversion accuracy of the DB algorithm AOD is less than that of the DB-DT combined algorithm, and it has inversion advantages in spring, autumn and winter, while the DB-DT combined algorithm outperforms the DB algorithm only in winter. The inversion effect of the two algorithms on AOD is influenced by the spatial sampling window setting. (4) Both the DB algorithm AOD and the DB-DT combined algorithm AOD can monitor the distribution of AOD in the central and western regions of Gansu, especially for high values of AOD under polluted atmospheric conditions, which represents a good monitoring effect. However, the two algorithms perform poorly in monitoring the southeast region of Gansu, while there is a discontinuous AOD distribution in the northwest region of Gansu. Overall, the MODIS DB algorithm AOD product has higher applicability in Gansu Province. This work provides a good reference for local air pollution and climate prediction.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Change in Conflict from the Perspective of Optical and SAR Satellites: The Case of Mariupol, a City in the Conflict between RUS and UKR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern armed conflicts can cause serious humanitarian disasters, and remote sensing technology is critical in monitoring war crimes and assessing post-war damage. In this study, a constrained energy minimization algorithm incorporating the feature bands (IFB-CEM) is designed to detect urban burning areas in optical images. Due to the difficulty of obtaining the ground survey data of the battlefield, the dual-polarization normalized coherence index (DPNCI) is designed based on the multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, and the quantitative inversion and evaluation of the destruction of urban architecture are combined with the public images on the Internet. The results show that the burning area is widely distributed in the armed conflict region, and the distribution is most concentrated around the Azovstal steel and iron works. The burning area reached its peak around 22 March, and its change is consistent with the conflict process in time and space. About 79.2% of the buildings in the city were severely damaged or completely destroyed, and there was a significant correlation with burning exposure. The results of this study show that publicly available medium-resolution remote sensing data and Internet information have the ability to respond quickly to the damage assessment of armed conflict and can provide preliminary reference information for dealing with humanitarian disasters.

TI  - Exploring the Influence of Forest Tenure and Protection Status on Post-Fire Recovery in Southeast Australia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Changing fire regimes put forests in southeast Australia under increasing pressure. Our investigation aimed to explore the impact of different forest management structures on a forest's resilience to fire by looking at the post-fire recovery duration. Materials and Methods: The analysis included a total of 60.6 Mha of land containing 25.4 Mha of forest in southeast Australia. Multispectral time series data from Landsat satellites and a local reference dataset were used to model attributes of disturbance and recovery over a period of 33 years. Results: Protected public forest spectrally recovered 0.4 years faster than protected private forest. No other significant effects in relation to different tenure and protection status were found. Climatic and topographic variables were found to have much greater influence on post-fire spectral recovery. Conclusions: Protected area status in public forests resulted in slightly faster recovery, compared with the private protected forest estate. However, factors outside the control of land managers and policy makers, i.e., climatic and topographic variables, appear to have a much greater impact on post-fire recovery.

TI  - Endorsement of scientific inquiry promotes better evaluation of climate policy evidence
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Public and scientific consensus about climate change do not align. Problematically, higher scientific knowledge has been associated with lower acceptance of climate information among those with more conservative socio-political ideologies. Positive attitudes towards science can attenuate this effect. We investigated the association between endorsement of scientific inquiry (ESI) and decision-making with scientific evidence about climate policies. Participants rated support for 16 climate policies accompanied by weaker or stronger evidence. In study 1 (N = 503), higher ESI was associated with greater discernment between strongly and weakly evidenced climate policies, irrespective of worldview. In studies 2 (N = 402) and 3 (N = 600), an ESI intervention improved discrimination, and, in study 3, increased ESI specifically for hierarchical/individualistic participants. Unlike ESI, the link between scientific knowledge and evaluation of evidence was influenced by worldview. Increasing ESI might improve the evaluation of scientific evidence and increase public support for evidence-based climate policies.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Faulting in the Danakil Depression Rift of Afar: The Importance of Faulting in the Final Stages of Magma-Rich Rifting
T2  - TECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magmatic intrusion and faulting both accommodate crustal extension in magma-rich rifts. However, quantitative constraints on the contribution of faulting to total extension and along-rift variations of faulting during the final stages of break-up are lacking. We targeted the Danakil Depression (Afar, Ethiopia) to conduct a quantitative, high-resolution study of fault activity and interaction in a magma-rich rift near break-up. Quantitative analysis of >500 rift axis faults, identified using remote sensing data (satellite imagery, DEMs), shows an increase in fault density, length and connectivity away from magmatic segments. Kinematic and earthquake focal mechanism data demonstrate a transition from transtensional opening in the northern and central sub-regions of the rift to oblique opening in the southern Giulietti Plain and Tat-Ali sub-regions. Oblique opening is attributed to the along-axis step between the Erta-Ale and Harak sub-regions. Integration of seismic reflection and borehole data with the mapped faults shows that extension is primarily accommodated by magmatism within the rift center, with faulting more significant toward the ends of the rift. similar to 30% of crustal extension is accommodated by axial faulting in areas of low magmatism, highlighting the importance of faulting even in the final stages of magma-rich rifting. Comparing our findings with spreading ridge morphology and structure, relevant due to the rift maturity and extensive magmatism, we conclude that the Danakil Depression is in a transitional stage between continental rifting and seafloor spreading. Spatial changes in the importance of faulting and magmatism in accommodating extension, alongside rift morphology, resemble the relationships observed along spreading ridges.

TI  - Landslide susceptibility mapping of Penang Island, Malaysia, using remote sensing and multi-geophysical methods
T2  - EARTH SCIENCES RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Malaysia is one of the countries in the world that experiences landslides yearly due to natural events and human activities. Penang Island is Malaysia's second most developed state and the largest by population. It is prone to landslides with devastating environmental impacts. Hence, the need to characterize its near-surface soil-rock conditions. This study uses remotely sensed data, with frequency ratio (FR) analysis, to identify landslide-prone areas based on different categories of landslide causative factors. To further understand the conditions and hy-drodynamics of the soil-rock profiles causing landslides, electrical resistivity tomography and seismic refraction tomography were carried out at a landslide-suspected section in the study area. Also, satellite-derived Bouguer gravity anomaly modeling was performed to map the varied gravity anomalies associated with landslide -trigge-ring factors in lithologic units. The multi-geophysical models offer strongly correlated results with the remote sensing causative factor maps and the landslide susceptibility index (LSI) map. The likelihood of landslides oc-curring in the area, as suggested by the area under curve modeling of LSI data, yielded a high predicted success rate of 83.47%. Hence, prospective landslides were identified in the hilly and elevated sections, while the less susceptible sections were identified on flat reliefs. Landslides may also be triggered, for instance, at steep sections with varied contractive soil bodies and shallow structures. Most importantly, leveraging the LSI map would help the necessary agencies forestall and mitigate future landslide occurrences in the area.

TI  - Assessing Forest Vulnerability to Climate Change Combining Remote Sensing and Tree-Ring Data: Issues, Needs and Avenues
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Forests around the world are facing climate change. Increased drought stress and severe heat waves in recent decades have negatively impacted on forest health, making them more vulnerable and prone to dieback and mortality phenomena. Although the term vulnerability is used to indicate an increased susceptibility of forests to climate change with a worsening of their vigour status that can compromise their ability to respond to further climate extreme events, there are still uncertainties on how to evaluate it. Indeed, evaluation of forest vulnerability is complex both because of some critical issues in the estimation methods used and because of the multiple factors influencing the response of forests to ongoing climate change. A way to assess the vulnerability to environmental stresses is by combining remote sensing and dendroecological data. However, these two approaches entail multiple uncertainties, including growth/photosynthetic relationships, carbon allocation dynamics, biases of tree-ring data and noisy remote sensing data, which require further clarification for proper monitoring of pre- and post-drought forest trajectories. Our review aims to create an overview of the current literature and knowledge to understand the critical issues, needs and possible solutions that forest vulnerability research is addressing. We focus on Mediterranean forests located in a climate warming hotspot and showing a high vulnerability to increased aridification.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Detection in Breast Cancer: An Innovative Technique
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - (1) Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is important in the search for metastases, especially in patients with malignant breast disease. Our study proposed new techniques to prevent complications such as possible postoperative seroma formation, pain or hypoesthesia of the axillary cord and medial arm surface, as well as motor deficits, to avoid disabling outcomes and presents initial data from our experience with the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique. (2) Methods: We mainly used two radioactive tracer detection techniques and a new technique using a radiotracer called Sentimag-magtrace. The positive lymph node was located and removed to perform histologic analysis. In our study, we evaluate 100 patients who underwent breast cancer surgery. (3) Results: We calculated the identification rates of the different methods of sentinel lymph node detection and found that it was 88.9% using radioactive tracers vs. 89.5% using the magnetic tracer technology (Sentimag). (4) Conclusions: Thus, this technique avoids radiation exposure for both patients and health care providers, and can reduce costs and time.

TI  - Drivers of Physical and Biological Frontal Variability in the Northern California Current System
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic fronts mark the boundary between two water masses and are often sites of complex bio-physical processes and multi-trophic level interactions, making them particularly important features in marine ecosystems. As global climate change induces multi-scale shifts in the driving physical mechanisms of fronts, spatiotemporal tracking of frontal variability can aid in efforts to understand the downstream effects on marine biodiversity and ecosystem structure. Here we focus on fronts within the dynamic northern extent of the California Current System (NCC). We derived mesoscale sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) fronts across the NCC region from 4-km MODIS-Aqua L3 daily fields over 2003-2019. Mesoscale physical (SST) and biological (chl-a) fronts were often adjacent and coherent in their seasonal and interannual occurrence frequencies, but were spatially decoupled. SST fronts were most frequent and broadly distributed offshore while chl-a fronts mostly occurred along the continental shelf break, particularly from Vancouver Island to central Oregon. Additionally, we employed a standardized multiple linear regression analysis to quantify the relative influence of local- and basin-scale processes on frontal variability in the NCC. Local wind stress and wind stress curl variability were the most influential drivers of fronts over the shelf, while basin-scale climate variability (i.e., climate oscillations) significantly drove frontal occurrences along the shelf break and offshore. Given predictions in the intensification of coastal upwelling in systems such as the NCC, our results indicate that oceanic response to climate change driven atmospheric variability will significantly impact the NCC marine ecosystem on the mesoscale.

TI  - The Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using Radiocolloid in First Stage Endometrial Cancer
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Detection of a sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with endometrial cancer (EC) reduces the rate of unnecessary systemic lymph dissection. The aim of this study was to assess the SLN detection rate, accuracy of the method using Tc-99m-SENTI-SCINT and the rate of metastatic nodal involvement in patients with preoperative first stage EC. Methods: A prospective study of SLN biopsy of 41 patients with stage I EC was conducted after cervical application of 4mCi Tc-99m-SENTI-SCINT. Planar lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) of the pelvis were performed, followed by site-specific lymphadenectomy in intermediate-risk patients if no SLN was detected per hemipelvis and pelvic lymphadenectomy in all high-risk patients. Results: Pre-operative detection rate of planar lymphoscintigraphy was 80.49 [95% confidence interval (CI): 68.36-92.62] and of SPECT/CT 95.12 (95% CI: 88.52-101.7). The total intraoperative SLN detection rate was 95.12 (95% CI: 88.52-101.7) per patient and 26.83 (95% CI: 19.91-33.75) bilaterally. The average number of SLNs removed was 1.6 & PLUSMN;0.8. The most common anatomical location of SLN was the right external iliac region. The SLN metastatic rate was 17%. Both sensitivity and negative predictive value regarding metastatic involvement were 100%. Conclusion: The SLN detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value using Tc-99m-SENTI-SCINT in patients with EC in our study were high. The application of ultra-staging in the histopathological analysis of SLN increases the detection of nodal metastases and improves the staging in these patients.

TI  - Spatial Evaluation of a Natural Flood Management Project Using SAR Change Detection
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an evaluation method using C-band Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to provide evidence of flood characteristic changes after the restoration of a floodplain. A portable, flexible evaluation framework has replicated previous change detection research approaches to analyse a Natural Flood Management (NFM) project on the Sussex Ouse river in southern England, conducted by the Sussex Flow Initiative (SFI), to ascertain how control measures have helped mitigate flood risk. GIS operations were conducted on the mapped results of the change detection procedure to identify how flood area, form and compactness have been affected after the NFM installation restored a floodplain to slow river flow and how these changes relate to the overall aims of the project. Innovative means were employed to verify the change detection methodology by sampling flood records from internet-published drone footage. The overall accuracy achieved using the Change Detection and Thresholding (CDAT) technique was 75%. The use of SAR data provides evidence of how NFM features function during significant flood events, providing a mapped delineation of the actual flood extent. A comprehensive scorecard has been developed to evaluate the positive and negative outcomes of the spatial changes that have manifested in post-restoration floods, in comparison to inundation before the installation. Results from this study have been included in the annual report of the SFI project to demonstrate how key features have attenuated flood waters in accordance with design intentions.

TI  - Prognosis of polypoid melanoma: a comparative study with non-polypoid melanomas
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Polypoid melanoma is considered an exophytic and frequently non-pigmented variant of nodular melanoma with an adverse prognosis; however, very few studies have been published about it with contradictory results. Therefore, our objective was to determine the prognostic value of this configuration in melanomas. A transversal retrospective study of 724 cases was analyzed according to the main configuration (polypoid vs. non-polypoid) regarding their clinicopathologic characteristics and survival analysis. Of the 724 cases, 35 (4.8%) met the definition of polypoid melanoma; such cases, compared with non-polypoid melanomas, were associated with a high Breslow thickness (7 mm vs. 3 mm), 68.6% had a Breslow >4 mm; showed different clinical stages of presentation, and presented more ulceration (77.1 vs. 51.4%). In the 5-year overall survival (OS) analysis, polypoid melanoma is associated with a lower 5-year OS, together with lymph node metastasis, Breslow thickness, clinical stage, mitoses per mm(2), vertical growth phase, ulceration, and state of the surgical margins; however, in the multivariate analysis, the factors that remained independent predictors of death were the Breslow thickness groups, the clinical stage, the presence of ulceration, and the state of the surgical margins. Polypoid melanoma was not an independent predictor of OS. We found a prevalence of 4.8% of polypoid melanomas, which showed a worse prognosis than non-polypoid melanomas, explained by a higher proportion of ulcerated cases, greater Breslow thickness, and ulceration. However, polypoid melanoma was not an independent predictor of death.

TI  - Hydrological Dynamics of the Pantanal, a Large Tropical Floodplain in Brazil, Revealed by Analysis of Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive tropical floodplain wetlands, such as the Brazilian Pantanal, are complex ecosystems composed of mosaics of permanently and seasonally flooded habitats and are increasingly threatened by land use and climate change. Spatial and interannual variability in the seasonal flood pulse is a fundamental ecological driver in these ecosystems. This study analyzes optical imagery from the Sentinel-2 satellite to determine the extent and seasonal patterns of inundation over five years in the northern Pantanal, a Ramsar site renowned for its wildlife. The study site is bordered by the Cuiaba and Sao Lourenco rivers, each with distinct flow regimes. Inundation patterns were revealed with a combination of water indices, supervised classification of land cover, and a digital elevation model. Total extent of flooding was underestimated by the optical imagery, but open water bodies were readily delineated with the land cover classification.

AB  - The research discusses the formal transformation in urban structure, all the cities around the world have undergone a series of formal transformations, resulting in radical transformations to their functions. And to calculate this transformation the descriptive analytical method was applied to this research. First, local urban management data and Landsat-9 visual data were used after processing by GIS. Then, the data were processed mathematically based on their engineering sequences. The aims of this research were as follows: to explore the formal transformations in cities, their dimensions and their consequences and impacts; to identify the underlying causes of their occurrence by deriving realistic results from trends in such degrees of transformation; and to reduce the adverse effects and to establish a sustainable urban structure by taking Kufa City as a model. The research covered the following two time periods: 2002-2012 and 2012-2022, as they represent the time during which Kufa City experienced remarkable formal transformation in urban structure as a result of urbanisation and random growth. Different forms of land use were identified, and formal transformations were analysed. The results showed that the largest transformation occurred when the agricultural land transformed into construction land; which was used in different ways than the original intent. The land uses were visualised digitally at high resolution. The transformation in land use led to formal transformations in the city structure, both planned and randomly implemented. The other objective of this research is to address misuse of the city's infrastructure; however, sustainability was not considered for several reasons. The agricultural land represents the nutritional value of the city as it provides Kufa and nearby cities with agricultural products. It also represents the green barrier as the environmental conduit for the city. This research recommends managing population growth by using basic city schemes of planning and predicting formal transformations. This approach is the basis for transforming city structures by identifying future structural features in sustainable ways.

TI  - Multi-Supervised Feature Fusion Attention Network for Clouds and Shadows Detection
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow detection are essential in remote sensing imagery applications. Few semantic segmentation models were designed specifically for clouds and their shadows. Based on the visual and distribution characteristics of clouds and their shadows in remote sensing imagery, this paper provides a multi-supervised feature fusion attention network. We design a multi-scale feature fusion block (FFB) for the problems caused by the complex distribution and irregular boundaries of clouds and shadows. The block consists of a fusion convolution block (FCB), a channel attention block (CAB), and a spatial attention block (SPA). By multi-scale convolution, FCB reduces excessive semantic differences between shallow and deep feature maps. CAB focuses on global and local features through multi-scale channel attention. Meanwhile, it fuses deep and shallow feature maps with non-linear weighting to optimize fusion performance. SPA focuses on task-relevant areas through spatial attention. With the three blocks above, FCB alleviates the difficulties of fusing multi-scale features. Additionally, it makes the network resistant to background interference while optimizing boundary detection. Our proposed model designs a class feature attention block (CFAB) to increase the robustness of cloud detection. The network achieves good performance on the self-made cloud and shadow dataset. This dataset is taken from Google Earth and contains remote sensing imagery from several satellites. The proposed model achieved a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 94.10% on our dataset, which is 0.44% higher than the other models. Moreover, it shows high generalization capability due to its superior prediction results on HRC_WHU and SPARCS datasets.

TI  - Cropland Data Extraction in Mekong Delta Based on Time Series Sentinel-1 Dual-Polarized Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been a widely used data source in the remote sensing field due to its ability to work all day and in all weather conditions. Among SAR satellites, Sentinel-1 is frequently used to monitor large-scale ground objects. The Mekong Delta is a major agricultural region in Southeast Asia, so monitoring its cropland is of great importance. However, it is a challenge to distinguish cropland from other ground objects, such as aquaculture and wetland, in this region. To address this problem, the study proposes a statistical feature combination from the Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric (dual-pol) data time series based on the m/? decomposition method. Then the feature combination is put into the proposed Omni-dimensional Dynamic Convolution Residual Segmentation Model (ODCRS Model) of high fitting speed and classification accuracy to realize the cropland extraction of the Mekong Delta region. Experiments show that the ODCRS model achieves an overall accuracy of 93.85%, a MIoU of 88.04%, and a MPA of 93.70%. The extraction results show that our method can effectively distinguish cropland from aquaculture areas and wetlands.

TI  - An Enhanced Algorithm for Active Fire Detection in Croplands Using Landsat-8 OLI Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Burning biomass exacerbates or directly causes severe air pollution. The traditional active fire detection (AFD) methods are limited by the thresholds of the algorithms and the spatial resolution of remote sensing images, which misclassify some small-scale fires. AFD for burning straw is interfered with by highly reflective buildings around urban and rural areas, resulting in high commission error (CE). To solve these problems, we developed a multicriteria threshold AFD for burning straw (SAFD) based on Landsat-8 imagery in the context of croplands. In solving the problem of the high CE of highly reflective buildings around urban and rural areas, the SAFD algorithm, which was based on the LightGBM machine learning method (SAFD-LightGBM), was proposed to differentiate active fires from highly reflective buildings with a sample dataset of buildings and active fires and an optimal feature combining spectral features and texture features using the ReliefF feature selection method. The results revealed that the SAFD-LightGBM method performed better than the traditional threshold method, with CE and omission error (OE) of 13.2% and 11.5%, respectively. The proposed method could effectively reduce the interference of highly reflective buildings for active fire detection, and it has general applicability and stability for detecting discrete, small-scale fires in urban and rural areas.

TI  - Mineral Exploration Based on Quantified Spatial Relationships between Gold Deposits and Ore Genesis in Malaysia
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an essential tool for gathering vital information for the mining industry. With the latest advances in the field of remote sensing and the invention of software such as GIS (Geographic Information Systems), it is now the task of researchers to come up with different approaches of finding minerals that can reduce the cost of exploration. This research applied remote sensing techniques to Landsat 8 satellite imagery to extract geological information in southern Kelantan, Malaysia. The results produced images such as single band combination (RGB 6,5,2 and 5,4,2), band ratio (RGB 4/2, 6/7, 6/5) and principal component analysis (RBG from PC 123). The spatial survey revealed that the NE-SW line patterns and igneous rock distributions controlled the occurrence of the gold deposits. The generated map highlighted 2.40% of the total area as high potential zones recommended for further exploration.

TI  - A systematic review on predicting PV system parameters using machine learning
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Review
AB  - Due to the growing demand, assessing performance has become obligatory for photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting systems. Performance assessment involves estimating different PV system parameters. Traditional ways, such as calculating solar radiation using satellite data and the IV characteristics approach as assessment methods, are no longer reliable enough to provide a reasonable projection of PV system parameters. Estimating system parameters using machine learning (ML) approaches has become a reliable and popular method because of its speed and accuracy. This paper systematically reviewed ML-based PV parameter estimation studies published in the last three years (2020 - 2022). Studies were analyzed using several criteria, including ML algorithm, outcome, experimental setup, sample data size, and error metric. The analysis revealed several interesting factors. The neural network was the most popular ML method (32.55%), followed by random vector functional link (13.95%) and support vector machine (9.30%). Dataset was sourced from hardware tests and computer-based simulations: 66% of the studies used data from only computer simulation, 18% used data from only hardware setup, and the 16% experiments used data from both hardware and simulations to evaluate different system parameters. The top three most commonly used error metrics were root mean square error (29.1%), mean absolute error (17.5%), and coefficient of determination (15.9%). Our systematic review will help researchers assess ML algorithms' projection in PV system parameters estimation. Consequently, scopes shall be created to establish more robust governmental frameworks, expand private financing in the PV industry, and optimize PV system parameters.

TI  - Statistical Study of EMIC Waves and Related Proton Distributions Observed by the Arase Satellite
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We performed a statistical study of electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) wave distributions and their coupling with energetic protons in the inner magnetosphere using the Arase satellite data from May 2017 to December 2020. We investigated the energetic proton pitch-angle distributions and partial thermal pressures associated with EMIC waves using inter-calibrated proton data in the energy range of 30 eV/q-187 keV/q. With a cold plasma approximation, we computed the proton minimum resonance energies using the observed EMIC wave frequency and plasma density values. We found that the EMIC waves had left-handed polarization near the magnetic equator close to the threshold of proton cyclotron instability, and propagated to higher latitudes along the field line with polarization reversal. H-EMIC waves showed two peak occurrence regions in the morning and noon sectors at L = 7.5-9 outside the plasmasphere. The flux enhancements associated with morning side H-EMIC waves appeared at E < 1 keV/q among all pitch angles, while H-EMIC waves in the noon sector exhibited flux enhancement in field-aligned directions at E = 1-100 keV/q. He-EMIC waves showed a broad occurrence region from 12 to 20 magnetic local time at L = 5.5-8.5 inside the plasmasphere with strong flux enhancements at all pitch-angle ranges at E = 1-100 keV/q. The proton minimum resonance energy using the obtained central frequency was consistent with the observed flux enhancements at different peak occurrence regions. We conclude that the free energy sources of EMIC waves in different geomagnetic environments drive various types of EMIC waves, and they interact with energetic protons at different energy ranges.

We conclude that the free energy sources of EMIC waves in different geomagnetic environments drive various types of EMIC waves, and they interact with energetic protons at different energy ranges.Plain Language Summary Electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves are considered to play an important role in controlling magnetospheric plasma dynamics. Specifically, EMIC wave-particle interactions can cause the loss of energetic protons and relativistic electrons in the Earth's magnetosphere, and the scattered particles precipitate into the ionosphere, creating isolated proton auroras at sub-auroral latitudes (55-65 geomagnetic latitudes). To understand the coupling of EMIC waves with energetic protons in the inner magnetosphere, we performed a statistical study of proton distributions associated with EMIC waves using a 4-year in-situ observation obtained by the Arase satellite. We observed dawn-dusk asymmetric EMIC wave distributions depending on the wavebands. We also found three significantly different regions of EMIC waves showing different characteristics. EMIC waves were inferred to be generated near the magnetic equator and propagate to higher magnetic latitudes along the field line. Furthermore, EMIC waves in different regions were proposed to interact with energetic protons at different energy ranges. The Arase satellite observations used in this study provided new insights into the dynamics of EMIC waves in the inner magnetosphere.

TI  - Metaphoric construction of corruption in Nigerian media discourse
T2  - TOPICS IN LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) and cultural linguistics (CL), which form the chief theoretical anchor for this study, express the role of language, culture and cognition in the construal and expression of human experiences. The approaches posit that the metaphorical use of language by an individual or group is shaped by their ideological orientation, knowledge of their natural and social world, and their cultural worldview. This study investigates the metaphorical use of language by the Nigerian print media in their attempts to express ideation on corruption in the Nigerian public sector. There has not been any deliberate and rigorous attempt to study the metaphorical representation of corruption in the Nigerian media discourse, hence this study aims at addressing the lacuna. Thus, this study uses insights from CMT and CL to identify, classify and analyse some of these metaphors in six Nigerian newspapers, namely; The Guardian, Punch, Daily Trust, The Nation, Vanguard and The Sun. The study shows that print media reports of corruption in Nigeria involving powerful social actors such as politicians, government appointees, career civil servants, academics, the military, the media and others have often used metaphorical frames that emanate from the domains of disease, war and conflict, enmity, impediment to movement, violent natural forces, monstrosity, among others, to describe the incidence, scope, effects and consequences of public sector corruption in Nigeria.

TI  - The image of the motherland in the language consciousness of school-age Shorians of Kuzbass (on the example of the associative fields "Homeland" and "Mountain Shoria")

M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the national self-consciousness of representatives of indigenous minorities is relevant due to globalization processes accompanied by blurring of national identities. The study of the national identity of indigenous minorities in multi-ethnic states such as Russia is important as it helps to identify and correct the preservation of their ethnic identities, preserve the cultural diversity of the country. The article presents the results of a study of associative images of the Rodina [Homeland] and Gornaya Shoria [Mountain Shoria] in Shorians' linguistic consciousness. A psycholinguistic experiment was conducted to do the research. One hundred people participated in the experiment. The survey was conducted at boarding school No. 19 and the orphanage school Rodnik in Tashtagol District of Kemerovo Oblast. All the respondents are bilingual Shorian children. They are taught in Russian, and the Shorian language is a curriculum subject for children from the city and villages of Tashtagol District. The respondents are Shorian children of primary and secondary school aged 7 to 16. The respondents were asked to write down, within 1-3 minutes, the four words that came to their minds in response to the word "Rodina" and the phrase "Gornaya Shoria". To ensure that each subsequent word-association was not related to the previous response, but was triggered by the original stimulus, the participants were offered to arrange their reactions in the form of a vertical list. This resulted in 397 reactions to the stimulus word "Rodina" and 417 reactions to the phrase "Gornaya Shoria". The data were collected in January-February 2022. The result of the psycholinguistic experiment with the stimuli "Rodina" and "Gornaya Shoria" showed that the national self-identification of young Shorians of Kuzbass has a clearly formed state-citizen identity. The participants of the experiment associate the homeland with the country, citizens of which they are: the homeland is Kemerovo Oblast, Kuzbass is the region where they were born, and the homeland is the city, village or settlement where they were born and live. The data obtained correlate with the data provided by ethnographers and local historians. They claim that in the Shor national consciousness homeland is both the place, home where their family lives and the family, the clan itself. This suggests that the younger generation of Shorians also has this correlation in their linguistic consciousness. The image of Gornaya Shoria in the linguistic consciousness of school-age Shorians, on the one hand, includes a clear idea of the territorial and landscape features of the region. For young Shorians it is taiga, forest, mountains. On the other hand, for the respondents Gornaya Shoria is the territory of their ancestors, their people, their family, it is their home and their small motherland. This, in turn, correlates with the data of ethnographers and local historians that national and local-territorial levels of national consciousness in the ethnic self-consciousness of the Shorians should be distinguished.

T2  - Bulletin of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute
M3  - Article
AB  - From April 2000 to January 2005, we monitored the chemistry of rainfall, throughfall, stemflow, O layer leachate, soil-percolating water, seepage water, and stream water in the Yamashiro Experimental Forest (YMS) in southern Kyoto Prefecture, Japan. To clarify the characteristics of YMS water quality, comparison was made with the data in the Forest Atmospheric Deposition and Stream Chemistry Database (FASC-DB) of the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute (FFPRI). Rainfall acidity, and inorganic nitrogen and non-sea salt sulfate levels in precipitation were the same in the YMS as those at monitoring sites nationwide. However, throughfall and stemflow had a higher pH and percentage of K+ in total cations at the YMS compared to other monitoring sites. Seasonal variations in pH and K+ concentration were observed in the throughfall; both were high during the foliated period and low during the defoliated period. The O layer leachate was acidic and had high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), Ca2+, and NO3-. Their concentrations were also high in the soil-percolating waters, and no decrease in DOC concentration with depth was observed. Compared to the other monitoring sites in the FFPRI, the stream water in the YMS had slightly higher electrical conductivity, and higher concentrations of NO3- and other ions. We speculate that the dissolved constituents are concentrated by evapotranspiration in the YMS watershed due to its warm, lowprecipitation climate. The high NO3- concentration may be related to the large supply of nitrogen compounds from the densely populated areas in the Kyoto-Osaka area, in addition to the supply of nitrogen from dead trees in the watershed.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture for Different Crops Using SAR Polarimetric Data
T2  - CIVIL ENGINEERING JOURNAL-TEHRAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an essential factor that influences agricultural productivity and hydrological processes. Soil moisture estimation using field detection methods takes time and is challenging. However, using Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, soil moisture parameters become easier to detect. In microwave remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data helps to retrieve soil moisture from more considerable depths because of its high penetration capability and the illumination power of its light source. This study aims to process the SAR Sentinel-1A data and estimate soil moisture using the Water Cloud Model (WCM). Many physical and empirical models have been developed to determine soil moisture from microwave remote sensing platforms. However, the Water Cloud Model gives more accurate results. In this study, the WCM model is used for mixed crop types. The experimental soil moisture was determined from in-situ soil samples collected from various agricultural areas. The soil backscattering values corresponding to the different soil sampling locations were derived from Sentinel SAR data. Using linear regression analysis, the laboratory's soil moisture results and soil backscattering values were correlated to arrive at a model. The model was validated using a secondary set of in-situ moisture content values taken during the same period. The R2 and RMSE of the model were observed to be 0.825 and 0.0274, respectively, proving a strong correlation between the experimental soil moisture and satellite-derived soil moisture for mixed crop field types. This paper explains the methodology for arriving at a model for soil moisture estimation. This model helps to recommend suitable crop types in large, complex areas based on predicted moisture content.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Minimum Chip Thickness, Surface Quality and Burr Formation in Micro-Milling of Wrought and Selective Laser Melted Ti64
T2  - MICROMACHINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective laser melting (SLM) is a three-dimensional (3D) printing process that can manufacture functional parts with complex geometries as an alternative to using traditional processes, such as machining wrought metal. If precision and a high surface finish are required, particularly for creating miniature channels or geometries smaller than 1 mm, the fabricated parts can be further machined. Therefore, micro milling plays a significant role in the production of such miniscule geometries. This experimental study compares the micro machinability of Ti-6Al-4V (Ti64) parts produced via SLM compared with wrought Ti64. The aim is to investigate the effect of micro milling parameters on the resulting cutting forces (F-x, F-y, and F-z), surface roughness (R-a and R-z), and burr width. In the study, a wide range of feed rates was considered to determine the minimum chip thickness. Additionally, the effects of the depth of cut and spindle speed were observed by taking into account four different parameters. The manufacturing method for the Ti64 alloy does not affect the minimum chip thickness (MCT) and the MCT for both the SLM and wrought is 1 & mu;m/tooth. SLM parts exhibit acicular & alpha; martensitic grains, which result in higher hardness and tensile strength. This phenomenon prolongs the transition zone of micro-milling for the formation of minimum chip thickness. Additionally, the average cutting force values for SLM and wrought Ti64 fluctuated between 0.072 N and 1.96 N, depending on the micro milling parameters used. Finally, it is worth noting that micro-milled SLM workpieces exhibit lower areal surface roughness than wrought ones.

TI  - Monitoring spatiotemporal impacts of changes in land surface temperature on near eastern fire salamander<i> (Salamandra</i><i> infraimmaculata)</i> in the Middle East
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Persistence and coexistence of many pond-breeding amphibians depend on seasonality. Temperature, as a seasonal climate component, affects numerous physical and biological processes of pond-breeding amphibians. Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is the radiative skin temperature of the land surface, which has received less attention in spatiotemporal seasonal habitat monitoring. The present study aims to evaluate the increasing and decreasing effects of LST trends at two levels: (1) habitat suitability and connectivity; (2) individual population sites and their longitudinal distribution (with increasing longitude).Habitat suitability modeling was conducted based on an ensemble species distribution model (eSDM). Using electrical circuit theory, the connectivity of interior and intact habitat cores was investigated. An average seasonal LST was prepared separately for each season from 2003 to 2021 and entered into Mann-Kendall (MK) analysis to determine the spatiotemporal effects of LST changes using the Z-Score (ZMK) at two confidence levels of 95 and 99%. Based on the results, in winter, 28.12% and 70.70% of the suitable habitat were affected by an increasing trend of LST at 95% and 99% confidence levels, respectively. The highest spatial overlap of the decreasing trend of LST with the suitable habitat occurred in summer and was 6.4% at the 95% confidence level and 4.2% at the 99% confidence level. Considering population site at 95% confidence interval, the increasing trend of LST was calculated to be 20.2%, 9.5%, 4.2%, and 6.3% of localities in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. At the 99% confidence level, these percentages reduced to 8.5%, 3.1%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. During winter and summer, based on the results of the longitudinal trend, an increasing trend of LST was observed in sites. Localities of Hatay and Iica village in Turkey experienced seasonally asynchronous climate change regimes. The approach used in this study allowed us to create a link between the life cycle and seasonal changes on a micro-scale (breeding sites) and macro-scale (distribution and connectivity). Findings of this paper can be effectively used by conservation managers to preserve S. infraimmaculata's metapopulation.

TI  - Global Cloudiness and Cloud Top Information from AVHRR in the 42-Year CLARA-A3 Climate Data Record Covering the Period 1979-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the quality of global cloud fraction and cloud-top height products provided by the third edition of the CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and surface RAdiation dataset from the AVHRR data (CLARA-A3) climate data record (CDR) produced by the EUMETSAT Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF). Compared with with CALIPSO-CALIOP cloud lidar data and six other cloud CDRs, including the predecessor CLARA-A2, CLARA-A3 has improved cloud detection, especially over ocean surfaces, and improved geographical variation and cloud detection efficiency. In addition, CLARA-A3 exhibits remarkable improvements in the accuracy of its global cloud-top height measurements. For example, in tropical regions, previous underestimations for high-level clouds are reduced by more than 2 km. By taking advantage of more realistic descriptions of global cloudiness, this study attempted to estimate trends in the observable fraction of low-level clouds, acknowledging their importance in producing a net climate cooling effect. The results were generally inconclusive in the tropics, mainly due to the interference of El Nino modes during the period under study. However, the analysis found small negative trends over oceanic surfaces outside the core tropical region. Further studies are needed to verify the significance of these results.

TI  - Dangerous liaisons: how helminths manipulate the intestinal epithelium
T2  - TRENDS IN PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Intestinal helminths remain highly pervasive throughout the animal kingdom by modulating multiple aspects of the host immune response. The intestinal epithelium functions as a physical barrier as well as a sentinel innate immune tissue with the ability to sense and respond to infectious agents. Although helminths form intimate interactions with the epithelium, comprehensive knowledge about host-helminth interactions at this dynamic interface is lacking. In addition, little is known about the ability of helminths to directly shape the fate of this barrier tissue. Here, we review the diverse pathways by which helminths regulate the epithelium and highlight the emerging field of direct helminth regulation of intestinal stem cell (ISC) fate and function.

TI  - A Framework for Crop Yield Estimation and Change Detection Using Image Fusion of Microwave and Optical Satellite Dataset
T2  - QUATERNARY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield prediction is one of the crucial components of agriculture that plays an important role in the decision-making process for sustainable agriculture. Remote sensing provides the most efficient and cost-effective solution for the measurement of important agricultural parameters such as soil moisture level, but retrieval of the soil moisture contents from coarse resolution datasets, especially microwave datasets, remains a challenging task. In the present work, a machine learning-based framework is proposed to generate the enhanced resolution soil moisture products, i.e., classified maps and change maps, using an optical-based moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and microwave-based scatterometer satellite (SCATSAT-1) datasets. In the proposed framework, nearest-neighbor-based image fusion (NNIF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and post-classification-based change detection (PCCD) have been integrated to generate thematic and change maps. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework, random forest post-classification-based change detection (RFPCD) has also been implemented, and it is concluded that the proposed framework achieved better results (88.67-91.80%) as compared to the RFPCD (86.80-87.80%) in the computation of change maps with & sigma;& DEG;-HH. This study is important in terms of crop yield prediction analysis via the delivery of enhanced-resolution soil moisture products under all weather conditions.

TI  - Development of High Dynamic Range Six-Axis Force Sensor with Simple Structure
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS AND MECHATRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a six-axis force sensor with a simple struc-ture that can measure small forces while affording a high load capacity. For a robot to perform complex motions in an unknown environment, the force sen-sor used must exhibit a high resolution and high load rating. Various studies have been conducted to si-multaneously satisfy these two requirements. How-ever, the high processing cost due to the complicated sensor structure is problematic. Therefore, we de-velop a column-type high dynamic range (HDR) six -axis force sensor using two types of strain gauges. The sensor was composed of a drawn pipe to solve struc-tural problems that arise during manufacturing. By attaching strain gauges to the surface of the drawn pipe, the forces and torques in the six axes can be mea-sured. HDR measurement was realizable using a semi-conductor strain gauge for small loads and a metallic foil strain gauge for large loads. Based on the simula-tion results, the rated loads of the sensor were 1400 N in the Fx and Fy directions, 9000 N in the Fz direc-tion, and 120 Nm in the Mx, My, and Mz directions. The performance of the fabricated force sensor was evaluated. The maximum nonlinearity errors of the semiconductor strain gauge and the metallic foil strain gauges were 1.21% and 1.81%, respectively. In ad-dition, when comparing the S/N ratios, the minimum measurable values were 0.035 N and 0.13 N for Fy and Fz, respectively.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Inadvertent lead misplacement in the left ventricle can lead to thromboembolic events, valvular damage, and endocarditis. We present a case of an inadvertently placed transarterial pacemaker lead in the left ventricle in a patient who underwent percutaneous lead removal. After a multidisciplinary team discussion involving cardiac electrophysiology and interventional cardiology as well as a discussion of treatment options with the patient, it was decided to proceed with pacemaker lead removal with the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) to prevent thromboembolic events. The patient tolerated the procedure well without post-procedural complications and was discharged the next day on oral anticoagulation. We also present a step-by-step approach to perform lead removal with the use of Sentinel, emphasizing mitigating the stroke and bleeding risks in this patient setting.

TI  - Integration of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Imagery with Landsat Imagery for Better Watershed Scale ET Prediction
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical component of the water cycle, and an accurate prediction of ET is essential for water resource management, irrigation scheduling, and agricultural productivity. Traditionally, ET has been estimated using satellite-based remote sensing, which provides synoptic coverage but can be limited in spatial resolution and accuracy. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer improved ET prediction by providing high-resolution imagery of the Earth's surface but are limited to a small area. Therefore, UAV and satellite images provide complementary data, but the integration of these two data for ET prediction has received limited attention. This paper presents a method that integrates UAV and satellite imagery for improved ET prediction and applies it to five crops (corn, rye grass, wheat, and alfalfa) from agricultural fields in the Walla Walla of eastern Washington State. We collected UAV and satellite data for five crops and used the combination of remote sensing models and statistical techniques to estimate ET. We show that UAV-based ET can be integrated with the Landsat-based ET with the application of integration factors. Our result shows that the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of daily ET for corn (Zea mays), rye grass (Lolium perenne), wheat (Triticum aestivum), peas (Pisum sativum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) can be improved by the application of the integration factor to the Landsat based ET in the range of (35.75-65.52%). We also explore the variability and effect of partial cloud on UAV-based ET estimation. Our findings have implications for the use of UAVs in water resource management and highlight the importance of considering multiple sources of data in ET prediction.

TI  - Temporal Variability in Gas Emissions at Bagana Volcano Revealed by Aerial, Ground, and Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bagana is a remote, highly active volcano, located on Bougainville Island in southeastern Papua New Guinea. The volcano has exhibited sustained and prodigious sulfur dioxide gas emissions in recent decades, accompanied by frequent episodes of lava extrusion. The remote location of Bagana and its persistent activity have made it a valuable case study for satellite observations of active volcanism. This remoteness has also left many features of Bagana relatively unexplored. Here, we present the first measurements of volcanic gas composition, achieved by unoccupied aerial system (UAS) flights through the volcano's summit plume, and a payload comprising a miniaturized MultiGAS. We combine our measurements of the molar CO2/SO2 ratio in the plume with coincident remote sensing measurements (ground- and satellite-based) of SO2 emission rate to compute the first estimate of CO2 flux at Bagana. We report low SO2 and CO2 fluxes at Bagana from our fieldwork in September 2019, similar to 320 +/- 76 td(-1) and similar to 320 +/- 84 td(-1), respectively, which we attribute to the volcano's low level of activity at the time of our visit. We use satellite observations to demonstrate that Bagana's activity and emissions behavior are highly variable and advance the argument that such variability is likely an inherent feature of many volcanoes worldwide and yet is inadequately captured by our extant volcanic gas inventories, which are often biased to sporadic measurements. We argue that there is great value in the use of UAS combined with MultiGAS-type instruments for remote monitoring of gas emissions from other inaccessible volcanoes.Plain Language Summary Bagana is a remote and highly active volcano in southeastern Papua New Guinea (PNG). Historically, it has been among the most active volcanoes in PNG, notable for its long-lived eruptions and sustained gas emissions. Bagana has only been infrequently studied before now. We use unoccupied aerial systems (drones) along with ground- and satellite-based remote sensing data to characterize the chemical composition and flux of Bagana's gas emissions and place these in the context of global volcanic emissions. Owing to low activity during the time of our fieldwork, we report lower than anticipated emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide from Bagana. We argue that characterizing highly variable volcanic emissions is challenging without long-term continuous observations and that, for remote volcanoes like Bagana, both drones and satellite observations are powerful tools to undertake these observations.

T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill accidents can cause various environmental issues, so it is important to quickly assess the extent and changes in the area and location of the spilled oil. In the case of oil spill detection using satellite imagery, it is possible to detect a wide range of oil spill areas by utilizing the information collected from various sensors equipped on the satellite. Previous studies have analyzed the reflectance of oil at specific wavelengths and have developed an oil spill index using bands within the specific wavelength ranges. When analyzing multiple images before and after an oil spill for monitoring purposes, a significant amount of time and computing resources are consumed due to the large volume of data. By utilizing Google Earth Engine, which allows for the analysis of large volumes of satellite imagery through a web browser, it is possible to efficiently detect oil spills. In this study, we evaluated the applicability of four types of oil spill indices in the area of various land cover using Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument data and the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. We assessed the separability of oil spill areas by comparing the index values for different land covers. The results of this study demonstrated the efficient utilization of Google Earth Engine in oil spill detection research and indicated that the use of oil spill index B ((B3+B4)/B2) and oil spill index C (R: B3/B2, G: (B3+B4)/B2, B: (B6+B7)/B5) can contribute to effective oil spill monitoring in other regions with complex land covers.

TI  - Evaluation of Spectral Band Adjustment Factor Applicability for Near Infrared Channel of Sentinel-2A Using Landsat-8
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various earth observation satellites need to provide accurate and high-quality data after launch. To maintain and enhance the quality of satellite data, it is crucial to employ a cross-calibration process that accounts for differences in sensor characteristics, such as the spectral band adjustment factor (SBAF). In this study, we utilized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery collected from desert sites in Libya4, Algeria3, and Mauritania2 among pseudo-invariant calibration sites to calculate and apply SBAF, thereby compensating the uncertainties arising from variations in bandwidths. We quantitatively compared the reflectance differences based on the similarity of bandwidths, including Blue, Green, Red, and both the near-infrared (NIR) narrow, and NIR bands of Sentinel-2A. Following the application of SBAF, significant results with reflectance differences of approximately 1% or less were observed for all bands except NIR. In the case of the Sentinel-2A NIR band, it exhibited a significantly larger bandwidth difference compared to the NIR narrow band. However, after applying SBAF, the reflectance difference fell within the acceptable error range (5%) of 1-2%. It indicates that SBAF can be applied even when there is a substantial difference in the bandwidths of the two sensors, particularly in situations where satellite utilization is limited. Therefore, it was determined that SBAF could be applied even when the bandwidth difference between the two sensors is large in a situation where satellite utilization is limited. It is expected to be helpful in research utilizing the quality and continuity of satellite data.

TI  - Satellite Sensed Data-Dose Response Functions: A Totally New Approach for Estimating Materials' Deterioration from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When construction materials are exposed to the atmospheric environment, they are subject to deterioration, which varies according to the time period of exposure and the location. A tool named Dose-Response Functions (DRFs) has been developed to estimate this deterioration. DRFs use specific air pollutants and climatic parameters as input data. Existing DRFs in the literature use only ground-based measurements as input data. This fact constitutes a limitation for the application of this tool because it is too expensive to establish and maintain such a large network of ground-based stations for pollution monitoring. In this study, we present the development of new DRFs using only satellite data as an input named Satellite Sensed Data Dose-Response Functions (SSD-DRFs). Due to the global coverage provided by satellites, this new tool for monitoring the corrosion/soiling of materials overcomes the previous limitation because it can be applied to any area of interest. To develop SSD-DRFs, we used measurements from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) on board Aqua and OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) on Aura. According to the obtained results, SSD-DRFs were developed for the case of carbon steel, zinc, limestone and modern glass materials. SSD-DRFs are shown to produce more reliable corrosion/soiling estimates than "traditional" DRFs using ground-based data. Furthermore, research into the development of the SSD-DRFs revealed that the different corrosion mechanisms taking place on the surface of a material do not act additively with each other but rather synergistically.

TI  - Rooftop Photovoltaic Energy Production Estimations in India Using Remotely Sensed Data and Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the possibility of estimating global horizontal irradiance (GHI) in parallel to photovoltaic (PV) power production in India using a radiative transfer model (RTM) called libRadtran fed with satellite information on the cloud and aerosol conditions. For the assessment of PV energy production, we exploited one year's (January-December 2018) ground-based real-time measurements of solar irradiation GHI via silicon irradiance sensors (Si sensor), along with cloud optical thickness (COT). The data used in this method was taken from two different sources, which are EUMETSAT's Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Services (CAMS). The COT and AOD are used as the main input parameters to the RTM along with other ones (such as solar zenith angle, & ANGS;ngstrom exponent, single scattering albedo, etc.) in order to simulate the GHI under all sky, clear (no clouds), and clear-clean (no clouds and no aerosols) conditions. This enabled us to quantify the cloud modification factor (CMF) and aerosol modification factor (AMF), respectively. Subsequently, the whole simulation is compared with the actual recorded data at four solar power plants, i.e., Kazaria Thanagazi, Kazaria Ceramics, Chopanki, and Bhiwadi in the Alwar district of Rajasthan state, India. The maximum monthly average attenuation due to the clouds and aerosols are 24.4% and 11.3%, respectively. The energy and economic impact of clouds and aerosols are presented in terms of energy loss (EL) and financial loss (FL). We found that the maximum EL in the year 2018 due to clouds and aerosols were 458 kWh m(-2) and 230 kWh m(-2), respectively, observed at Thanagazi location. The results of this study highlight the capabilities of Earth observations (EO), in terms not only of accuracy but also resolution, in precise quantification of atmospheric effect parameters. Simulations of PV energy production using EO data and techniques are therefore useful for real-time estimates of PV energy outputs and can improve energy management and production inspection. Success in such important venture, energy management, and production inspections will become much easier and more effective.

AB  - Despite not emerging as a written work, the Book of Dede Korkut contains the codes of various dimensions of Turkish civilization (Gokyay, 1976). The oral transfer of Dede Korkut's stories from Turkestan to Anatolia, their transformation to the Islamic worldview, and their subsequent commitment to paper have enriched and expanded the understanding of Turks. All researchers who've studied the Book of Dede Korkut agree that it is a masterpiece (Bulduk, 1995; Ergin, 2005; Sakaoglu, 1998). However, what makes the Book of Dede Korkut so invaluable is not the period in which its stories take place, the language used, or the literary value of the text, but rather its versatile structure that covers all of these aspects.Like many classical texts, the Book of Dede Korkut has attracted the attention of scholars from the fields of literature, language, anthropology, and sociology. However, only a relatively small number of studies have read the texts from the perspective of management thought or leadership (Baysal & Goktas, 2015; cakir, 2020). Leadership research has expanded systematically since the 19th century and has been fed by classical texts from many different cultures (Bragues, 2008; Cheng, Takala, 1998). However, the lack of texts from Turkish civilization, which has profoundly contributed to the management tradition throughout history, constitutes the starting point of this research.

TI  - Visible and SWIR Satellite Image Fusion Using Multi-Resolution Transform Method Based on Haze-Guided Weight Map
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of sensor and satellite technology, numerous high-resolution and multi-spectral satellite images have been available. Due to their wavelength-dependent reflection, transmission, and scattering characteristics, multi-spectral satellite images can provide complementary information for earth observation. In particular, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band can penetrate certain types of atmospheric aerosols from the benefit of the reduced Rayleigh scattering effect, which allows for a clearer view and more detailed information to be captured from hazed surfaces compared to the visible band. In this study, we proposed a multi-resolution transform-based image fusion method to combine visible and SWIR satellite images. The purpose of the fusion method is to generate a single integrated image that incorporates complementary information such as detailed background information from the visible band and land cover information in the haze region from the SWIR band. For this purpose, this study applied the Laplacian pyramid-based multi-resolution transform method, which is a representative image decomposition approach for image fusion. Additionally, we modified the multiresolution fusion method by combining a haze-guided weight map based on the prior knowledge that SWIR bands contain more information in pixels from the haze region. The proposed method was validated using very high-resolution satellite images from Worldview-3, containing multi-spectral visible and SWIR bands. The experimental data including hazed areas with limited visibility caused by smoke from wildfires was utilized to validate the penetration properties of the proposed fusion method. Both quantitative and visual evaluations were conducted using image quality assessment indices. The results showed that the bright features from the SWIR bands in the hazed areas were successfully fused into the integrated feature maps without any loss of detailed information from the visible bands.

TI  - Evaluation of MERRA-2 data for aerosols patterns over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol is one of the major climate-forcing parameters which affect the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in particular. The most relevant consideration that characterizes the aerosol properties and distribution is the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). In this study Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) AOD product from the year 1980-2021 is used to investigate aerosols pattern over the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The validation of the MERRA-2 AOD product is made by using AOD data retrieved from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) stations located at Solar Village (SV) and at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Various statistical analyses are performed to test the reliability of MERRA-2 data in the study region. The results of the statistical analysis indicate that MERRA-2 is highly correlated with both AERONET stations data. Thus, annual and seasonal aerosol climatology maps based on 41 years of MERRA-2 data are prepared and analyzed over the study region. The annual and seasonal aerosol climatology analysis of MERRA-2 data shows high density of AOD at southern and eastern regions while the low density emerges over the western and northern regions of the country during the study period. The results of the study are very encouraging, which increases our confidence level to use historical MERRA-2 AOD product to improve the knowledge on aerosols distribution over the region in future.

TI  - MAPPING HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATIONS AND LINEAMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH EPITHERMAL AND MASSIVE SULPHIDES DEPOSITS OF TIFRAOUINE (NORTHWEST ALGERIAN COAST): USE OF LANDSAT 8 OLI DATA AND REMOTE SENSING
T2  - REVISTA DE LA SOCIEDAD GEOLOGICA DE ESPANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the context of studying mineralizations related to the Miocene volcanic rocks from the northern part of Algeria, Landsat 8 OLI data and remote sensing techniques are carried out to characterize and map hydrothermal alteration outcrops in the Miocene volcanic rocks of Tifraouine on the northwestern Algerian coast, where several indications of mineralization are known. Short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands allowed for the identification of clay alterations, while the visible and near-infrared bands help in the detection of iron alterations. Red-green-blue color combination images of 6/7, 4/2 and 5/6 ratios were produced. Principal component analysis ( PCA) was computed to characterise altered zones and extract lineaments. Matched filtering technique (MF) allows direct detection after applying minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformation and pixel purity index to the spectra in order to obtain a distribution map of the target mineral species in studied area. The remote sensing results combined with the structural geological data determine a relationship between mineralization and structural features and show that hydrothermal alterations are clearly controlled by tectonic. They are highly concentrated in the calderas zone and extend towards the Bouzedjar area which allowed checking the map performed according to the field studies. This will contribute to preliminary studies related to mineral exploration and enhance the mining potential of Tifraouine. The acquisition of supplementary data would allow us to extend this study in coming works.

TI  - Serological screening for tick-borne encephalitis virus in eight Norwegian herds of semi-domesticated reindeer (<i>Rangifer tarandus tarandus</i>)
T2  - ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is found in Ixodes ricinus ticks throughout the area where viable tick populations exist. In Norway, TBEV is found in I. ricinus from the south coast until Bronnoy municipality in Nordland County and the range of the vector is expanding due to changes in climate, vegetation, host animals and environmental conditions. TBEV might thus have the potential to establish in new areas when I. ricinus expand its geographical distribution. At present, there is little knowledge on the status of the virus in high-altitude areas of inland regions in Norway. It has previously been indicated that reindeer may be an important sentinel species and indicator of the spread of ticks and TBEV in high-altitude regions. In this study, 408 semi-domesticated Eurasian tundra reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) from eight herds, from Tana in Troms and Finnmark County in northern Norway to Filefjell in Innlandet and Viken Counties in southern Norway, were screened for TBEV antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found 16 TBEV reactive reindeer samples by ELISA; however, these results could not be confirmed by the serum neutralization test (SNT). This could indicate that a flavivirusand not necessarily TBEV, may be circulating among Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer. The results also indicate that TBEV was not enzootic in Norwegian semi-domesticated reindeer in 2013-2015. This knowledge is important as an information base for future TBEV and flavivirus surveillance in Norway.

TI  - External Dynamic Mechanisms Controlling the Periodic Offshore Blooms in Beibu Gulf
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Since offshore waters are less affected by human activities and nutrient-rich water masses, existing theories on periodic offshore blooms (POB) consider that the POB is proportional to the intensity of ocean fronts (nutrient supply from enhancing vertical mixing), ignoring external nutrient supply and external forcing (climatic oscillations). This study proposes an external dynamic mechanism of the POB on the basis of field observations and long-term satellite remote sensing data (1981-2022) in Beibu Gulf, which is influenced by remarkable external forcing. A strong thermal front with an inverted-V structure occurred in the central gulf every winter due to the strong wind stress. The intensity of the front on the east side is weaker due to the intrusion of the west-Guangdong coastal current (WGCC). However, nutrient supply variation resulted in the POB's different intensity in different areas of the inverted-V front. Chlorophyll a concentrations in the eastern (nutrients supplied by WGCC) and northern (nutrients supplied by vertical mixing) were obviously higher than that in the western front (limited nutrient supply) in winter. On an interannual scale, the intensity of POB in La Nina years is remarkably stronger than in El Nino years due to the stronger WGCC supplying more nutrients in La Nina. This study suggests that the intensity and range of POB are not proportional to the frontal intensity in the gulf, but are directly driven by the internal forcing (fronts and nutrient supply from WGCC), which is controlled by the external forcing.

TI  - A Collaborative Approach to Address Racism in a Community-Academic Partnership
T2  - PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - The HERCULES Exposome Research Center at Emory Uni-versity uses an exposome approach to study the environment's ef-fect on health and community well-being. HERCULES is guided by a Stakeholder Advisory Board (SAB) that includes representat-ives of neighborhoods, nonprofit organizations, government agen-cies, and academic institutions in the Atlanta metropolitan region. This region (and the SAB) has a large proportion of Black resid-ents, many of whom live in areas experiencing environmental in-justices. Historic and current racial injustices in Atlanta and pub-lic health research made it imperative to initiate dialogue and im-plement actions to address racism and power dynamics that may impact research and partnerships between affected communities and our institution.After initial discussion, the HERCULES Community Engagement Core and SAB members formed a workgroup to develop an intern-al anti-racism process. The workgroup drafted an Anti-Racism Commitment, hosted a Racism and Equity Dialogue Series, and initiated a strategic planning process to implement the resulting re-commendations, which fell into the following categories: anti -racist guidance/policies and recommendations for research, com-munity engagement, and the department. Center leadership and the SAB were engaged throughout the iterative process.This deliberate and ongoing process allows HERCULES to identi-fy and begin implementing action items that go beyond a written proclamation to address racialized power imbalances and system-ic inequities. HERCULES is committed to working collaborat-ively to earn community trust while addressing systemic issues, recognizing that these are essential to forming research partner-ships that address health inequities.

TI  - Integrating Community Ecology into Models of Vector-Borne Virus Transmission
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Vector-borne plant viruses are a diverse and dynamic threat to agriculture with hundreds of economically damaging viruses and insect vector species. Mathematical models have greatly increased our understanding of how alterations of vector life history and host-vector-pathogen interactions can affect virus transmission. However, insect vectors also interact with species such as predators and competitors in food webs, and these interactions affect vector population size and behaviors in ways that mediate virus transmission. Studies assessing how species' interactions affect vector-borne pathogen transmission are limited in both number and scale, hampering the development of models that appropriately capture community-level effects on virus prevalence. Here, we review vector traits and community factors that affect virus transmission, explore the existing models of vector-borne virus transmission and areas where the principles of community ecology could improve the models and management, and finally evaluate virus transmission in agricultural systems. We conclude that models have expanded our understanding of disease dynamics through simulations of transmission but are limited in their ability to reflect the complexity of ecological interactions in real systems. We also document a need for experiments in agroecosystems, where the high availability of historical and remote-sensing data could serve to validate and improve vector-borne virus transmission models.

TI  - Improved gross primary production estimation in rice fields through integrated multi-scale methodologies.
T2  - Plant-environment interactions (Hoboken, N.J.)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Understanding productivity in agricultural ecosystems is important, as it plays a significant role in modifying regional carbon balances and capturing carbon in the form of agricultural yield. This study in particular combines information from flux determinations using the eddy covariance (EC) methodology, process-based modeling of carbon gain, remotely (satellite) sensed vegetation indices (VIs), and field surveys to assess the gross primary production (GPP) of rice, which is a primary food crop worldwide. This study relates two major variables determining GPP. The first is leaf area index (LAI) and carboxylation capacity of the rice canopy (Vcuptake), and the second being MODIS remotely sensed vegetation indices (VIs). Success in applying such derived relationships has allowed GPP to be remotely determined over the seasonal course of rice development. The relationship to VIs of both LAI and Vcuptake was analyzed first by using the regression approaches commonly applied in remote sensing studies. However, the resultant GPP estimations derived from these generic models were not consistently accurate and led to a large proportion of underestimations. The new, alternative approach developed to estimate LAI and Vcuptake uses consistent development curves for rice (i.e., relies on consistent biological regulations of plant development). The modeled GPP based on this consistent development curve for both LAI and Vcuptake agreed with R 2 from 0.76 to 0.92 (within the 95% confidence interval). The results of this study demonstrate that improved linkages between ground-based survey data, eddy flux measurements, process-based models, and remote sensing data can be constructed to estimate GPP in rice paddies. This study suggests further that the conceptual application of the consistent development curve, such as the combining of different scale measurements, has the potential to predict GPP better than the common practice of utilizing simple linear models, when seeking to estimate the critical parameters that influence carbon gain and agricultural yields.

TI  - Ice Velocity Variations of the Cook Ice Shelf, East Antarctica, from 2017 to 2022 from Sentinel-1 SAR Time-Series Offset Tracking
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cook Glacier drains a significant portion of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, the largest subglacial basin in East Antarctica-which feeds the Cook Ice Shelf. The ice velocity of the Cook Ice Shelf needs to be monitored precisely and accurately, as it plays a critical role in determining the ice discharge from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. In this study, we measured the annual ice velocities of the Cook Ice Shelf using the offset tracking technique on Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images obtained from 2017 to 2022. Time-series offsets in the range and azimuth directions were determined from the offset tracking pairs with a temporal baseline of 36 days obtained from January to December of each year. Statistical evaluations of the spatiotemporal variations of the time-series offsets effectively eliminated the erroneous offsets in the original offset fields; the remaining offsets were then used to produce two-dimensional annual ice velocities. The direction of the ice flow of the Cook Ice Shelf was almost constant during the period 2017-2022, and the variations in the magnitude of annual ice velocities were investigated. The annual ice velocities of the Cook East Ice Shelf (CEIS) stayed constant and showed a gradual increase from the grounding line to the ice front, except in the western part. Ice velocities of the western part of the CEIS have not changed much at the grounding line during the 6-year period, while in the dynamic shelf ice zone, ice velocities accelerated by up to 22% because of the development of numerous crevasses and fractures. The ice velocities of the Cook West Ice Shelf (CWIS) were about two times higher than those of the CEIS and tended to increase rapidly from the grounding line to the ice front. The annual ice velocities at the grounding line of CWIS increased rapidly from 1330 to 1450 m/a over 6 years, with 70% of this acceleration observed after 2021. This was attributed to a reduction in the ice shelf volume because of the evolution of surface crevasses and rifts, leading to a decrease in the ice shelf's buttressing potential. In particular, the loss of a portion of the dynamic shelf ice zone due to a series of ice front collapses in February 2022 likely caused the rapid speed-up of the ice shelf. The results of this study indicate that the buttressing potential of the CWIS and the western part of the CEIS has been significantly reduced, which could mean serious instability of the marine ice sheet in this region.

TI  - A Machine Learning-Based Multiple Cloud Vertical Structure Parameter Prediction Algorithm Only Using OCO-2 Oxygen A-Band Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of the global cloud vertical structure (CVS) are critical to better understanding the effects of the CVS on climate. Current CVS algorithms based on OCO-2 have to be combined with cloud top height products from CALIPSO and CloudSat, which are no longer available after these two satellites left A-Train in 2018. In this paper, we derive a machine learning-based algorithm using only OCO-2 oxygen A-band hyperspectral measurements to simultaneously predict the cloud optical depth (COD), cloud top pressure (p_top), and cloud pressure thickness (CPT) of single-layer liquid clouds. For validation of real observations, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the COD, p_top, and CPT are 7.31 (versus the MYD06_L2), 35.06 hPa, and 26.66 hPa (versus the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR). The new algorithm can also predict CVS parameters trained with p_tops from CALIPSO/CloudSat or CODs from MODIS. Controlled experiments show that known p_tops are more conducive to CPT prediction than known CODs, and experiments with both known CODs and p_tops obtain the best accuracy of RMSE = 20.82 hPa. Moreover, a comparison with OCO2CLD-LIDAR-AUX products that rely on CALIPSO shows that our CVS predictions only using OCO-2 measurements have better CODs for all clouds, better p_tops for clouds with a p_top < 900 hPa, and better CPTs for clouds with a CPT > 30 hPa.

T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic zone of West Siberia (Yamal and Gydan peninsulas) is an area with continuous permafrost and tabular ground ice close to the surface, active thermodenudation, and related landforms: retrogressive thaw slumps (RTS); in Russian referred to as thermocirques (TC). The dimensions of most TCs have not been determined so far. We use Sentinel 2 imagery to measure each TC area ranging from 0.55 to 38 ha with a median of 2.5 ha. Around 95% of TCs have an area of less than 10 ha. The largest areas are gained due to the merging of several neighboring TCs. The ArcticDEM is used to determine TC edge elevation and slope angle. In general, the Median TC of the Yamal peninsula has an area of 1.8 ha, an elevation of the edge of 17.7 m, and a slope angle of 2.5 & DEG;. The Median TC of the Gydan peninsula has an area of 2.6 ha, elevation of the edge of 29.4 m, and slope angle of 3 & DEG;. TCs of the Gydan peninsula occupy higher positions and slightly steeper slopes compared to TCs of the Yamal peninsula. The ranges of the median and the largest TC areas are consistent with the reported RTS dimensions in North America.

TI  - Seasonal Spatiotemporal Changes in the NDVI and Its Driving Forces in Wuliangsu Lake Basin, Northern China from 1990 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global climate change, many studies have focused on the interannual vegetation variation trends and their response to precipitation and temperature, but ignored the effects of seasonal variability. This study explored the relationship between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and seasonal climate elements in the Wuliangsu Lake Basin area from 1990 to 2020, and quantified the impacts of human activities on vegetation dynamics. We used Landsat series data to analyze the spatial and temporal variation of the NDVI using the trend analysis method, the Theil-Sen median, the Mann-Kendall test, and the Hurst index. Then, we used meteorological data and land use data to quantify the effects of human activities using residual analysis, and correlation methods to determine the driving forces of NDVI variations. The results showed that the NDVI changes presented obvious regional characteristics, with a decreasing trend from southeast to northwest in Wuliangsu Lake Basin. Due to global warming, the start of the growing season (SOS) is 4.3 days (2001 to 2010) and 6.8 days (2011 to 2020) earlier compared with 1990 to 2000. The end of the season (EOS) is advanced by 3.6 days (2001 to 2010), and delayed by 8.9 days (2011 to 2020). Seasonal (spring, summer, autumn, and winter) NDVIs with precipitation and temperature show spatial heterogeneity. Further, changes in grasslands and woodlands were vulnerable to climate change and human activities. Since the beginning of the 21st century, human activity was the driving force for vegetation improvement in the Dengkou, west-central, north and southwest regions, where ecological instability is weak. This finding can provide a theoretical basis for the implementation of the same type of ecological restoration projects and the construction of ecological civilization, and contribute to the regional green and sustainable development.

AB  - The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) is situated on the permafrost boundary in the northeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which is an area highly sensitive to climate change. As a result of increasing global temperatures, the permafrost in this region has undergone significant degradation. In this study, we utilized Sentinel-1 to obtain ground surface deformation data in the SRYR from June 2017 to January 2022. We then analyzed the differences in terrain deformation under various environmental conditions. Our findings indicated an overall subsidence trend in the SRYR, with a long-term deformation velocity of -4.2 mm/a and seasonal deformation of 8.85 mm. Furthermore, the results showed that terrain deformation varied considerably from region to region, and that the Huanghe' yan sub-basin with the highest permafrost coverage among all sub-basins significantly higher subsidence rates than other regions. Topography strongly influenced ground surface deformation, with flat slopes exhibiting much higher subsidence rates and seasonal deformation. Moreover, the ground temperature and ground ice richness played a certain role in the deformation pattern. This study also analyzed regional deformation details from eight boreholes and one profile line covering different surface conditions, revealing the potential for refining the permafrost boundary. Overall, the results of this study provide valuable insights into the evolution of permafrost in the SRYR region.

TI  - Morphology Dynamics of Ice Cover in a River Bend Revealed by the UAV-GPR and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After the formation of the bend ice cover, the ice thickness of the bend is not uniformly distributed, and an open-water area is usually formed downstream of the bend. The spatial and temporal variation of the ice thickness in seven cross sections was determined via Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Ground Penetrating Radar (UAV-GPR) technology and traditional borehole measurements. The plane morphology change of the open water was observed by Sentinel-2. The results show that the average dielectric permittivity of GPR was 3.231, 3.249, and 3.317 on three surveys (5 January 2022, 16 February 2022, and 25 February 2022) of the Yellow River ice growing period, respectively. The average ice thickness of the three surveys was 0.402 m, 0.509 m, and 0.633 m, respectively. The ice thickness of the concave bank was larger than that of the convex bank. The plane morphology of the open water first shrinks rapidly longitudinally and then shrinks slowly transversely. The vertical boundary of the open water was composed of two arcs, in which the slope of Arc I (close to the water surface) was steeper than that of Arc II, and the hazardous distance of the open-water boundary was 10.3 m. The increased flow mostly affected the slope change of Arc I. Finally, we discuss the variation of hummocky ice and flat ice in GPR images and the physical factors affecting GPR detection accuracy, as well as the ice-thickness variation of concave and convex banks in relation to channel curvature.

TI  - Solid Angle Geometry-Based Modeling of Volume Scattering with Application in the Adaptive Decomposition of GF-3 Data of Sea Ice in Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, spaceborne polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has been widely used to penetrate sea ice surfaces to achieve fully polarimetric high-resolution imaging at all times of day and in a range of weather conditions. Model-based polarimetric decomposition is a powerful tool used to extract useful physical and geometric information about sea ice from the matrix datasets acquired by PolSAR. The volume scattering of sea ice is usually modeled as the incoherent average of scatterings of a large volume of oriented ellipsoid particles that are uniformly distributed in 3D space. This uniform spatial distribution is often approximated as a uniform orientation distribution (UOD), i.e., the particles are uniformly oriented in all directions. This is achieved in the existing literature by ensuring the canting angle f and tilt angle t of particles uniformly distributed in their respective ranges and introducing a factor cost in the ensemble average. However, we find this implementation of UOD is not always effective, while a real UOD can be realized by distributing the solid angles of particles uniformly in 3D space. By deriving the total solid angle of the canting-tilt cell spanned by particles and combining the differential relationship between solid angle and Euler angles f and t, a complete expression of the joint probability density function p(f,t) that can always ensure the uniform orientation of particles of sea ice is realized. By ensemble integrating the coherency matrix of (f,t)-oriented particle with p(f,t), a generalized modeling of the volume coherency matrix of 3D uniformly oriented spheroid particles is obtained, which covers factors such as radar observation geometry, particle shape, canting geometry, tilt geometry and transmission effect in a multiplicative way. The existing volume scattering models of sea ice constitute special cases. The performance of the model in the characterization of the volume behaviors was investigated via simulations on a volume of oblate and prolate particles with the differential reflectivity ZDR, polarimetric entropy H and scattering a angle as descriptors. Based on the model, several interesting orientation geometries were also studied, including the aligned orientation, complement tilt geometry and reflection symmetry, among which the complement tilt geometry is specifically highlighted. It involves three volume models that correspond to the horizontal tilt, vertical tilt and random tilt of particles within sea ice, respectively. To match the models to PolSAR data for adaptive decomposition, two selection strategies are provided. One is based on ZDR, and the other is based on the maximum power fitting. The scattering power that reduces the rank of coherency matrix by exactly one without violating the physical realizability condition is obtained to make full use of the polarimetric scattering information. Both the models and decomposition were finally validated on the Gaofen-3 PolSAR data of a young ice area in Prydz Bay, Antarctica. The adaptive decomposition result demonstrates not only the dominant vertical tilt preference of brine inclusions within sea ice, but also the subordinate random tilt preference and non-negligible horizontal tilt preference, which are consistent with the geometric selection mechanism that the c-axes of polycrystallines within sea ice would gradually align with depth.

TI  - Using C2X to Explore the Uncertainty of In Situ Chlorophyll-a and Improve the Accuracy of Inversion Models
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Quality water plays a huge role in human life. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in water bodies is a direct reflection of the population size of the primary productivity of various phytoplankton species in the water body and can provide critical information on the health of water ecosystems and the pollution status of water quality. Case 2 Regional CoastColour (C2RCC) is a networked atmospheric correction processor introduced by the Sentinel Application Platform for various remote sensing products. Among them, the Extreme Case-2 Waters (C2X) process has demonstrated advantages in inland complex waters, enabling the generation of band data, conc_chl product for Chl-a, and kd_z90max product for Secchi Depth (SD). Accurate in situ data are essential for the development of reliable Chl-a models, while in situ data measurement is limited by many factors. To explore and improve the uncertainties involved, we combined the C2X method with Sentinel-2 imagery and water quality data, taking lakes in Wuhan from 2018 to 2021 as a case. A Chl-a model was developed and validated using an empirical SD model and a neural network incorporating Trophic Level Index (TLI) to derive the predicted correction result, Chl-a_t. The results indicated that (1) the conc_chl product measured by C2X and in situ Chl-a exhibited consistent overall trends, with the highest correlation observed in the range of 2-10 & mu;g/L. (2) The corrected Chl-a_t using the conc_chl product had a mean absolute error of approximately 10-15 & mu;g/L and a root-mean-square error of approximately 8-10 & mu;g/L, while using in situ Chl-a had a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximately 15 & mu;g/L and a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 20 & mu;g/L; both errors decreased by double after correction. (3) The correlation coefficient (R) between Chl-a_t and each data point in the Chl-a model results was lower than that of SD-a_t with each data point in the SD model results. Additionally, the difference in R-value between Chl-a_t and each data point (0.45-0.60) was larger than that of SD-a_t with each data point (0.35-0.5). (4) When using corrected Chl-a_t data to calculate the TLI estimation model, both RMSE and MAE decreased, which were 1 & mu;g/L lower than those derived from uncorrected data, while R increased, indicating an improvement in accuracy and reliability. These findings demonstrated the presence of in situ errors in Chl-a measurements, which must be acknowledged during research. This study holds practical significance as some of these errors can be effectively corrected through the use of C2X atmospheric correction on spectral bands.

TI  - Construction of High Spatiotemporal Continuity Surface Water Bodies Dataset in the Haihe River Basin
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water bodies exhibit high dynamic variability on seasonal and interannual scales, and high spatiotemporal resolution water bodies extent data are crucial for studying surface water bodies' evolution. Existing surface water bodies datasets are mainly based on optical data acquisition, which has the advantages of long temporal coverage and convenience but is susceptible to cloud contamination, leading to low spatiotemporal continuity. Although microwave remote sensing data are not affected by clouds, early SAR acquisition and short temporal coverage limit its use. Therefore, existing surface water bodies datasets face the problem of insufficient spatiotemporal resolution or low continuity. This research integrates Sentinel-2 optical data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations to reconstruct the surface water bodies dataset with a 6-day and 10-meter spatiotemporal resolution. Then, the proposed method introduces a spatiotemporal correlation model and predicts the land cover (water or land) of Sentinel-2 cloudy pixels, which improves the spatiotemporal continuity of the reconstructed surface water bodies dataset further. Based on the proposed method, we construct the Haihe River Water Dataset (HRWD) from 2016 to 2020 with a 6-day and 10-meter spatiotemporal resolution. Compared with the European Commission's Joint Research Centre's (JRC's) Global Surface Water Explorer and Global Surface Water Extent Dataset (GSWED), the HRWD shows a rational accuracy (e.g., the overall accuracy of the HRWD is more than 93%) and a better spatiotemporal continuity, which provide an improved performance in identifying and monitoring surface water bodies in the Haihe River Basin. This indicates that the proposed method can improve the spatiotemporal continuity of surface water body mapping and meet the needs of accurate and long-term quantitative observation of the distribution of large-scale and high spatiotemporal continuity surface water bodies.

TI  - Integrating ecosystem service value into the evaluation of sustainable land use in fast-growing cities: A case study of Qingdao, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating ecosystem service value (ESV) into the evaluation system for sustainable land use (SLU) in fast-growing cities is an effective way to implement Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 15 and 11 of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Taking ESV as the intermediate parameter, six sustainability indicators were developed to evaluate SLU from two dimensions: sustainable land ecosystem services and economic development. These indicators are the total supply and demand index (RT) of ecosystem services, the potential supply and demand index (RP) of ecosystem services, the ecological cost index per unit of GDP (RC), the eco-economic coordination index (RD), the eco-economic equilibrium index (RE), and the ESV-based sustainable land use index (RS). Empirical research was conducted in Qingdao, a fast-growing city in eastern China, to verify the validity of the indicators. Five sets of Landsat TM/ETM/OLI remote sensing images from 1996, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2017 were used to analyze the land use and ESV changes in Qingdao. The results indicate that land use changes in fast-growing cities significantly affect the ESV. The decrease in the area of ecological land and the expansion of construction land caused by rapid urbanization reduced ESV. The RC and RD of Qingdao were sustainable, while the RT and RP were unsustainable, and the RE showed volatility, which reduced the evaluation level of SLU in Qingdao from extremely strongly sustainable (L1) to moderately sus-tainable (L3). Thus, it is necessary to improve the ESV of Qingdao. Optimization strategies for promoting SLU in Qingdao are proposed based on the results, confirming that the evaluation provides guidance for land use management.

TI  - Prelaunch Radiometric Characterization and Calibration for Long Wave Infrared Band of FY-4B GHI
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Calibration is the process of describing the parameters needed to understand and quantify the expected application performance of a sensor. In the prelaunch radiometric characterization and calibration, the on-orbit environment should be simulated as much as possible, and the tests are performed in a controlled environment using a standard source of known radiation. The measurements made during the prelaunch radiometric calibration are used to verify whether the instrument status is correct, quantify the calibration equation and radiometric measurement model parameters, and estimate the measurement uncertainty. The measurement performance and limitations are determined, and whether the sensor meets the mission requirements are verified. By identifying and characterizing unique sensor performance characteristics, the influence of sensor behavior on expected measurement is minimized. The Geostationary High- speed Imager (GHI) is one of the main payloads of Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) satellite, the research in this paper is an important basis of the on orbit quantitative application for long wave infrared (LWIR) band of GHI.Methods The commonly used radiometric calibration methods in the laboratory are the distant small source combined with the collimator method and the near extended source method. The distant small source combined with collimator method is to place the point source blackbody at the focal plane of the collimator to realize the beam expansion and collimation of the calibration beam, so that the calibration beam can fill the instrument's entrance pupil and field of view. The near extended source method can provide a standard calibration source with good stability, uniformity, Lambertian and large aperture, and does not require expensive low-temperature collimators and accurate collimator calibration parameters. In this paper, the large- area and near extended source blackbody calibration method is used, which can realize the full field of view and full aperture radiometric calibration of GHI. GHI, external blackbody, deep low temperature cold screen and other equipment are placed in the vacuum tank. The cold screen and external blackbody are placed along the direction of the sub-satellite point, directly above the optical aperture of the instrument, and the blackbody is placed behind the cold screen (Fig. 2). The vacuum in the tank is better than 1. 3x10-3 Pa, the heat sink temperature is lower than 100 K, and the effective emissivity of the tank wall surface is better than 0. 9. The effective emissivity of the external blackbody is about 0. 99, and the temperature control range is 180- 330 K. Within this range, the radiance levels of 16 temperature points are set (Table 2). During the experiment, the on-board blackbody observation will be performed simultaneously. The cold screen is used to simulate the 4K space view in orbit, as the "zero radiation" standard for instrument observation, the temperature of the cold screen is lower than 85 K, and the effective emissivity of the surface is better than 0. 9.Results and Discussions The quadratic polynomial can be used to describe the radiometric response model of GHI LWIR, and the calibration equation has good goodness of fit (Fig. 4 and Table 3). At the typical temperature of 300 K, the fitting accuracy of radiometric response model is better than 0. 23 K (Table 4). The analysis and evaluation of various error values in the calibration process show that the prelaunch calibration uncertainty is better than 0. 670 K ( coverage factor is 2) at 300 K (Table 5). The spatial noise characteristics are measured and studied, and the relationship between the fixed pattern noise ( original signal, dark current and response signal) and the radiance is analyzed (Fig. 5). For the problem of unavailable detector on LWIR focal plane, GHI adopts 256x4 to realize mutual backup of 4 line arrays and select the best imaging detector ( Fig. 6). Through the research and analysis of the experimental data, two kinds of the best imaging detector selection criteria are proposed, namely, the principle of maximizing the signal-to- noise ratio and the principle of minimizing the fixed pattern noise of response signal. Thus, two kinds of the best imaging detector combination line arrays are given ( Fig. 7). The detection sensitivity at a typical temperature of 300 K is measured ( Fig. 10). The detection sensitivity of the two new line arrays mentioned above meets the mission requirements (better than 0. 2 K). In particular, for the new line array based on maximizing the signal-to- noise ratio, the overall detection sensitivity at 300 K is better than 0. 1 K, and the average level is about 50 mK. The on- board blackbody reference standard is validated according to the full dynamic range (180- 330 K) radiometric calibration equation obtained from the external blackbody (Fig. 11). Linear fitting between the true brightness temperature and the nominal brightness temperature at the five temperature points ( 290, 295, 300, 305, 310 K) of the on- board blackbody is performed ( Fig. 12 and Table 6). The nominal brightness temperature of the on- board blackbody is slightly lower than the true brightness temperature. At the typical temperature of 300 K, the nominal brightness temperature is about 0. 42 K lower than the true brightness temperature (the average value of the line array). Through the preliminary analysis and judgment of the structural components around the on-board blackbody of GHI and the calibration correction algorithm of the on-board blackbody of similar remote sensing instruments, the main reason why the nominal brightness temperature of the on-board blackbody is lower than the true brightness temperature is that the blackbody is not an ideal blackbody (emissivity is less than 1). When the instrument observes the non-ideal on-board blackbody, the radiation received is not only from the blackbody, but also includes the thermal radiation from the surrounding structural components reflected by the blackbody.Conclusions In view of the mission requirements and design characteristics of the LWIR band of the FY- 4B GHI, the prelaunch calibration and radiometric characteristic measurement methods based on the large-area and near extended blackbody radiation source are studied, and the corresponding calibration device is built to achieve calibration parameter measurement and radiometric characteristic characterization. Through the effective control of the error source of the prelaunch calibration process, the calibration uncertainty is better than 0. 67 K@ 300 K. The spatial noise characteristics and detection sensitivity are measured and studied. According to the characteristics of spatial noise and temporal noise, two methods to select the best imaging detector are proposed, which are based on maximizing the signal- to-noise ratio and minimizing the fixed pattern noise of response signal. Through the selection of the best imaging detector, the problem of no non-effective detector imaging on the satellite image of the long linear focal plane array can be solved. At the same time, the temperature detection sensitivity (average) can reach 50- 60 mK@ 300 K. According to the full dynamic range radiometric calibration equation obtained from the external blackbody measurement, the accuracy of the on-board blackbody reference standard is evaluated. The nominal brightness temperature of the on-board blackbody is slightly lower than the true brightness temperature, approximately 0. 42 K lower at the typical temperature of 300 K. It is preliminarily analyzed and judged that this phenomenon may be caused by the reflection of thermal radiation from the surrounding structural components by the on-board blackbody. Subsequently, the research on the calibration correction algorithm of the on- board blackbody will be performed according to the on-orbit data.

TI  - Zoning Prediction and Mapping of Three-Dimensional Forest Soil Organic Carbon: A Case Study of Subtropical Forests in Southern China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate soil organic carbon (SOC) maps are helpful for guiding forestry production and management. Different ecological landscape areas within a large region may have different soil-landscape relationships, so models specifically for these areas may capture these relationships more accurately than the global model for the entire study area. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zonal modelling in predicting forest SOC and to produce highly accurate forest SOC distribution maps. The prediction objects were SOC at five soil depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm). First, the forest type map and soil texture class map were used to divide the relative homogeneous regions in Shaoguan City, Guangdong Province, China. Second, seven terrain variables derived from a 12.5-m digital elevation model (DEM) and five vegetation variables generated from 10-m Sentinel-2 remote sensing images were used as predictors to develop regional artificial neural network (ANN) models for each homogeneous region, as well as a global ANN model for the entire study area (1000 sample points). Finally, 10-fold cross-validation was used to assess the ANN prediction model performance, and independent validation was used to evaluate the produced forest SOC prediction maps (194 additional samples). The cross-validation results showed that the accuracies of the regional models were better than that of the global model. Independent validation results also showed that the precision (R-2) of 0- to 100-cm forest SOC maps generated by forest type modelling had an improvement of 0.05-0.15, and that by soil texture class modelling had an improvement of 0.07-0.13 compared to the map generated by the global model. In conclusion, delineating relatively homogeneous regions via simple methods can improve prediction accuracy when undertaking soil predictions over large areas, especially with complex forest landscapes. In addition, SOC in the study area is generally more abundant in broadleaf forest and clay areas, with overall levels decreasing with soil depth. Accurate SOC distribution information can provide references for fertilization and planting. Plants with particularly high soil fertility requirements may perhaps be planted in broadleaf forests or clay areas, and plants with particularly developed roots may require furrow application of a small amount of SOC.

TI  - Analyzing On-Farm Spatiotemporal Distribution of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Populations from a Precision Agriculture Perspective
T2  - PLANTS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys Stal (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is native to Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea. Its dispersion from Asia to the United States of America and Europe caused serious damage to fruit, vegetables, and high-value crops. In Greece, damages are reported in kiwi orchards in the regions of Pieria and Imathia, which are the main production areas of kiwifruit. Greek kiwifruit production is expected to increase twofold within the next years. The aim of this research is to study the terrain and canopy properties that may have an impact on the development of H. halys populations. Thus, five kiwi orchards in total were selected in the regions of Pieria and Imathia. & tau;en traps were installed from early June to late October within each selected kiwi orchard-two types of traps at every side of the orchards and the center. The installed traps were examined weekly and the number of the captured H. halys was recorded. During the same days, sentinel satellite images were analyzed to calculate the vegetation index, NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index), and NDWI (Normalised Difference Water Index). The results showed population variability within the kiwi orchards since the population of H. halys was higher in areas with high NDVI and NDWI values. Additionally, our research revealed that H. halys prefers to develop populations at higher altitudes at both regional and field scales. The results of this research can be used to reduce damages by H. halys in kiwi orchards using different rates of pesticides depending on the prediction of the population size. There are multiple benefits of the proposed practice, such as a reduction in the production cost of kiwifruits, an increase in farmers' profit, and environmental protection.

TI  - An Advanced Non-Interrupted Internal Calibration Model Based on Azimuth Modulation and Waveform Diversity for SAR Systems
T2  - ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal calibration, designed for obtaining the gain and phase errors introduced by the fluctuations of the electronic instruments, is an essential operation to guarantee the imaging performance of modern synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. However, in most of the current internal calibration schemes, the internal calibration processes interrupt the normal SAR data acquisition, which results in a loss of azimuth samples and degradation of the SAR image quality. To this end, an advanced non-interrupted internal calibration model is proposed, performing the internal calibration during nominal data acquisitions. The calibration signals and echoes are orthogonal and are received simultaneously. Then, they can be separated by postprocessing via the waveform diversity concept. Two schemes based on the proposed model are demonstrated via theoretical analysis and simulation experiments. The proposed model can achieve a considerable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduce the influence of calibration signals on echoes, which have some potential applications for future SAR missions.

TI  - Using Enhanced Gap-Filling and Whittaker Smoothing to Reconstruct High Spatiotemporal Resolution NDVI Time Series Based on Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and MODIS Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series data, derived from optical images, play a crucial role for crop mapping and growth monitoring. Nevertheless, optical images frequently exhibit spatial and temporal discontinuities due to cloudy and rainy weather conditions. Existing algorithms for reconstructing NDVI time series using multi-source remote sensing data still face several challenges. In this study, we proposed a novel method, an enhanced gap-filling and Whittaker smoothing (EGF-WS), to reconstruct NDVI time series (EGF-NDVI) using Google Earth Engine. In EGF-WS, NDVI calculated from MODIS, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 satellites were combined to generate high-resolution and continuous NDVI time series data. The MODIS NDVI was employed as reference data to fill missing pixels in the Sentinel-Landsat NDVI (SL-NDVI) using the gap-filling method. Subsequently, the filled NDVI was smoothed using a Whittaker smoothing filter to reduce residual noise in the SL-NDVI time series. With reference to the all-round performance assessment (APA) metrics, the performance of EGF-WS was compared with the conventional gap-filling and Savitzky-Golay filter approach (GF-SG) in Fusui County of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The experimental results have demonstrated that the EGF-WS can capture more accurate spatial details compared with GF-SG. Moreover, EGF-NDVI of Fusui County exhibited a low root mean square error (RMSE) and a high coefficient of determination (R-2). In conclusion, EGF-WS holds significant promise in providing NDVI time series images with a spatial resolution of 10 m and a temporal resolution of 8 days, thereby benefiting crop mapping, land use change monitoring, and various ecosystems, among other applications.

TI  - A study on optical properties, classification, and transport of aerosols during the smog period over South Asia using remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few years, South Asian region has experienced frequent and thick smog events because of rapid population growth and enhanced anthropogenic activities, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). Therefore, the present study investigates aerosol properties such as aerosol optical depth (AOD) (500 nm), Angstrom exponent (AE) (440-870 nm), single scattering albedo (SSA), fine-mode fraction (FMF), absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD), and absorption aerosol exponent (AAE) over selected AERONET sites namely Bhola (2012-2021), Dhaka (2012-2021), Jaipur (2011-2021), Kanpur (2011-2021), Karachi (2011-2021), Lahore (2011-2021), and Pokhara (2011-2021) in the IGP during the smog period (October, November, and December). Additionally, different aerosol types were categorized using AERONET direct sun (AOD, AE) and inversion products (VSD, SSA, RI, FMF, and ASY). The monthly mean AOD, AE, and FMF varied from similar to 0.33 to 1.07, similar to 0.3 to 1.4, and 0.6-0.9 mu m over all selected AERONET sites during the smog period. Moreover, the outcomes revealed the dominance of biomass-burning and urban/ industrial aerosols over Lahore, Karachi, Dhaka, and Bhola during the smog period. Contrary to this, dust and mixed aerosols were abundant over Jaipur and Karachi, respectively. Furthermore, HYSPLIT cluster analysis is used to trace the transmission paths and potential sources of aerosols over selected sites.

TI  - Exploring the Applications of Indocyanine Green in Robot-Assisted Urological Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence-Guided Techniques
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - This comprehensive review aims to explore the applications of indocyanine green (ICG) in robot-assisted urological surgery through a detailed examination of fluorescence-guided techniques. An extensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Scopus, using keywords such as "indocyanine green," "ICG", "NIRF", "Near Infrared Fluorescence", "robot-assisted", and "urology". Additional suitable articles were collected by manually cross-referencing the bibliography of previously selected papers. The integration of the Firefly(& REG;) technology in the Da Vinci(& REG;) robotic system has opened new avenues for the advancement and exploration of different urological procedures. ICG is a fluorophore widely used in near-infrared fluorescence-guided techniques. The synergistic combination of intraoperative support, safety profiles and widespread availability comprises an additional asset that empowers ICG-guided robotic surgery. This overview of the current state of the art illustrates the potential advantages and broad applications of combining ICG-fluorescence guidance with robotic-assisted urological surgery.

TI  - Characterizing Post-Fire Forest Structure Recovery in the Great Xing'an Mountain Using GEDI and Time Series Landsat Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding post-fire forest recovery is critical to the study of forest carbon dynamics. Many previous studies have used multispectral imagery to estimate post-fire recovery, yet post-fire forest structural development has rarely been evaluated in the Great Xing'an Mountain. In this study, we extracted the historical fire events from 1987 to 2019 based on a classification of Landsat imagery and assessed post-fire forest structure for these burned patches using Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI)-derived metrics from 2019 to 2021. Two drivers were assessed for the influence on post-fire structure recovery, these being pre-fire canopy cover (i.e., dense forest and open forest) and burn severity levels (i.e., low, moderate, and high). We used these burnt patches to establish a 25-year chronosequence of forest structural succession by a space-for-time substitution method. Our result showed that the structural indices suggested delayed recovery following the fire, indicating a successional process from the decomposition of residual structures to the regeneration of new tree species in the post-fire forest. Across the past 25-years, the dense forest tends toward greater recovery than open forest, and the recovery rate was faster for low severity, followed by moderate severity and high severity. Specifically, in the recovery trajectory, the recovery indices were 21.7% and 17.4% for dense forest and open forest, and were 27.1%, 25.8%, and 25.4% for low, moderate, and high burn severity, respectively. Additionally, a different response to the fire was found in the canopy structure and height structure since total canopy cover (TCC) and plant area index (PAI) recovered faster than relative height (i.e., RH75 and RH95). Our results provide valuable information on forest structural restoration status, that can be used to support the formulation of post-fire forest management strategies in Great Xing'an Mountain.

TI  - Attention Mechanism-Combined LSTM for Grain Yield Prediction in China Using Multi-Source Satellite Imagery
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grain yield prediction affects policy making in various aspects such as agricultural production planning, food security assurance, and adjustment of foreign trade. Accurately predicting grain yield is of great significance in ensuring global food security. This paper is based on the MODIS remote sensing image data products from 2010 to 2020, and adds band information such as vegetation index and temperature to form composite remote sensing data as a dataset. Aiming at the lack of models for large-scale forecasting and the need for human intervention in traditional models, this paper proposes a grain production estimation model based on deep learning. First, image cropping and yield mapping techniques are used to process the data to generate training samples. Then the channel and spatial attention mechanism (convolutional block attention module, CBAM) is added to extract spatial information in different remote sensing bands to improve the efficiency of the model. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are added to obtain feature information in the time dimension. Finally, a national-scale grain yield prediction model is constructed. After the study, it was found that the LSTM model using a combination of multi-source satellite images and an attention mechanism can effectively predict grain yield in China. Furthermore, the proposed model was tested on data from 2018 to 2020 showing an average R-2 of 0.940 and an average RMSE of 80,020 tons, indicating that it can predict Chinese grain yield better. The model proposed in this paper extracts grain yield information directly from the composite remote sensing data, and solves the problem of small-scale research and imprecise yield prediction in an end-to-end manner.

TI  - Improved Vegetation Photosynthetic Phenology Monitoring in the Northern Ecosystems Using Total Canopy Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence Derived From TROPOMI
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with substantially improved spatiotemporal resolutions provides a new potential to improve satellite-based phenology monitoring. The performance of TROPOMI SIF for tracking vegetation photosynthetic phenology, and how it compares to conventional vegetation indices (VIs)-based approaches, however, have not been adequately assessed. Total canopy SIF, as a better proxy of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) than original directional SIF, is a new SIF to estimate phenology while its performance has not been investigated. This study assesses the capability of TROPOMI SIF before and after canopy correction for phenology monitoring and improves our understanding of these questions. Benchmarked by tower-based GPP, TROPOMI SIF generally performed better than VIs, especially for capturing the End Of Season (EOS) of vegetation photosynthetic activity at deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF), evergreen forest (ENF), and croplands (CRO) sites, but not for Start Of Season (SOS). This suggested that the advantage of SIF over VIs depended on phenological metrics. The total canopy SIF emission obtained through canopy correction generally performed better than the original SIF retrievals, especially in estimating the EOS of forest sites (DBF, MF, ENF), but soil correction did not further improve the accuracy of phenological monitoring. When comparing SIF- and VI-based phenological metrics over northern terrestrial ecosystems, SIF showed earlier senescence date widely, while the differences in onset date were region dependent. These results indicate the necessity of canopy correction to convert directional SIF to canopy total SIF when using satellite SIF products to estimate phenological metrics.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - To fully mine information regarding differences among various tree species from remote sensing data and improve the accuracy of tree species recognition, this study utilized the spectral reflection value, wavelength, and time as parameters and employed three algorithms to create an expression for the spectral volume index (SVI). Then, data were obtained by applying RedEdge-MX to four phases, SVI features were extracted, and a mixed feature set of spectral band + texture + digital surface model + SVI was constructed. A random forest algorithm was employed to determine the importance of the SVI features and derive the optimal feature set for tree species classification. The additional objectives were to determine if the SVI features have an active role in tree species classification and which algorithm is more conducive for extracting useful SVI features. The SVI features extracted with volume constraints exhibit better performance in tree species recognition than those extracted without volume constraints. Moreover, the SVI features extracted using a variable-constrained volume were better than those extracted using a constant-constrained volume. The combination of SVI features could improve the accuracy of tree species recognition (the highest overall accuracy was 92.76%), but the improvement effect was limited (the value was 92.16% when SVI features were not combined). These findings show that the SVI obtained using this method could be used to mine the difference information of tree species in images to a certain extent and hence, could be used in tree species identification.

TI  - Spatial Morphology Evolution of Rural Settlements in the Lower Yellow River Plain: The Case of Menggang Town in Changyuan City, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the spatial pattern evolution of the rural settlement system in the town of Menggang, China, based on settlement patches extracted from remote sensing data for four time points between 1990 and 2018. Five typical villages were selected to study their spatial textures from point to surface. The reasons for the evolution of the rural settlements were examined as well. The results indicated that the number of settlement patches in Menggang decreased, the area of a single patch expanded, and the scale of the rural settlements continued to expand. Settlements were distributed randomly, but an agglomeration trend began to appear. The plain terrain had little restriction on settlement site selection. Cofferdams and embankments were the limiting factors for settlement expansion, which led to the compact development of the settlements. Economic development, population growth, and family miniaturization were positive factors for the expansion of the rural settlements. In the typical villages, cluster settlements and cluster settlements with a banded tendency had higher spatial utilization efficiency. Several high-density building centers were formed in the settlements, and the trend of residential buildings was mainly northeast-southwest. The plain terrain had little effect on the orientation of buildings, single-building areas, or the public spaces of the settlements. Traditional culture and traffic routes affected the orientation of the main buildings of folk houses. This study has theoretical and reference value for the structure optimization and sustainable development of rural settlements in the lower Yellow River plain.

TI  - Large-scale characteristics of thermokarst lakes across the source area of the Yellow River on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As significant evidence of permafrost degradation, thermokarst lakes play an important role in the permafrost regions by regulating hydrology, ecology, and biogeochemistry. In the Sources Area of the Yellow River (SAYR), permafrost degradation has accelerated since the 1980s, and numerous thermokarst lakes have been discovered. In this paper, we use Sentinel-2 images to extract thermokarst lake boundaries and perform a regional-scale study on their geometry across the permafrost region in the SAYR. We also explored the spatiotemporal variations and potential drivers from the perspectives of the permafrost, climate, terrain and vegetation conditions. The results showed that there were 47,518 thermokarst lakes in 2021 with a total area of 190.22x10(6) m(2), with an average size of 4,003.3 m(2). The 44,928 ponds (& LE;10,000 m(2)) predominated the whole lake number (94.1%) but contributed to a small portion of the total lake area (28.8%). With 2,590 features (5.9%), small-sized (10,000 to 100,000 m(2)) and large-sized lakes (>100,000 m(2)) constituted up to 71.2% of the total lake area. Thermokarst lakes developed more significantly in warm permafrost regions than in cold permafrost areas; 74.1% of lakes with a total area of 119.6x10(6) m(2) (62.9%), were distributed in warm permafrost regions. Most thermokarst lakes were likely to develop within the elevation range of 4,500 & SIM;4,800 m, on flat terrain (slope<10 & DEG;), on SE and S aspects and in alpine meadow areas. The thermokarst lakes in the study region experienced significant shrinkage between 1990 and 2021, characterized by obvious lake drainage; the lake numbers decreased by 5418 (56.1%), with a decreasing area of 58.63x1o(6) m(2) (49.0%). This shrinkage of the thermokarst lake area was attributable mainly to the intensified degradation of rich-ice permafrost thawing arising from continued climate warming, despite the wetting climatic trend.

TI  - Responses of the Sea Surface Temperature and Suspended Matter Concentration to ENSO Events in the Bohai Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface suspended matter concentration data in the Bohai Sea were collected by multiple NOAA satellites from 1985 to 2018. The background calibration method was used to correct the systematic errors caused by the long-term observations through multiple NOAA satellites in this paper. Then, we studied the long-term variations of the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface suspended matter concentration (SSC) and their response to ENSO events in the Bohai Sea. Our results show that the SST and SSC of the Bohai Sea have been increasing since 1985, with an average rate of 0.04 degrees C per year for SST, which is higher than the global average. The average increasing rate of SSC was 0.51 mg L-1 yr(-1), which may be mainly due to the enhancement of winter monsoon in the Bohai. In winter, the SST and SSC of the Bohai Sea were higher in El Nino years than in La Nina years. In El Nino years, the ocean circulations were the main factor affecting the variation in SST. The robust circulation system caused by the strong winter monsoon enhances the water exchange between the cold water of the Bohai Sea and the warm water of the Yellow Sea, resulting in a higher SST in La Nina years. In summer, the SSTs of the Bohai Sea were lower in El Nino years than those in the La Nina years because of the decrease of the SST in the Western Pacific Ocean, the weakening of the subtropical high in the western Pacific, and its eastward shift caused by the El Nino events.

TI  - Combination Strategies of Variables with Various Spatial Resolutions Derived from GF-2 Images for Mapping Forest Stock Volume
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral features (SFs) and texture features (TFs) extracted from optical remote sensing images can capture the structural composition and growth information of forests, and combining remote sensing variables with a few ground measurement samples is a common method for mapping forest stock volume (FSV). However, the accuracy of mapping FSV using optical images with a high spatial resolution (one meter or sub-meters) is often lower than medium resolutions (larger than 10 m) using the same types of features and approaches. To overcome the limitations of high spatial resolution images in mapping FSV, down-scaled images with spatial resolution ranging from 1 to 30 m were obtained by GF-2 image to interpret the relationships between spatial resolutions of features and the accuracy of mapping FSV, and combination strategies of variables with various spatial resolutions were proposed to improve the accuracy of mapping FSV. The results show that the spatial resolution of features significantly affects the performance of employed models in estimating FSV, the sensitivity between SFs and FSV gradually increases with the decreasing of spatial resolution, and the optimal spatial resolutions of two types of features (SFs and TFs) are not synchronized in mapping forest FSV. After using combination strategies of variables with various spatial resolutions, the accuracy of mapping FSV is significantly higher than those derived from variable sets with the same spatial resolutions. It is proved that TFs derived from GF-2 images have great potential to improve the accuracy of mapping FSV, and the contribution of features depends on the approaches of extracting and combination strategies.

TI  - Bias correction of 20 years of IMERG satellite precipitation data over Canada and Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: We define two northern study areas: one covering all of Canada and Alaska and a second, smaller subregion surrounding the Peace-Athabasca Delta for testing.Study focus: This study aims to use bias correction to improve satellite precipitation data over a relatively data-sparse high latitude region using a network of in-situ rain gauges. We evaluate the satellite data and derive a linear bias-elevation relationship and apply the correction with a digital elevation model at a monthly scale, and further disaggregate it to produce corrected data at a daily scale.New hydrological insights for the region: We find that the underestimation in the satellite data increases linearly with increasing elevation, above 500 m a.s.l. at the continental scale and for all elevations at the regional scale. Bias also varies seasonally, with higher bias in summer and lower bias in winter. Compared with uncalibrated data, the monthly continental correction reduces absolute bias by 16% and the root mean squared error by 6%, while the daily continental correction improves absolute bias by 17% but degrades root mean squared error slightly by 2%. We conclude that applying elevation-based bias correction reduces systematic elevational bias in northern high-latitude satellite precipitation data.

TI  - Evolution of Landscape Ecological Risk and Identification of Critical Areas in the Yellow River Source Area Based on LUCC
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - A reasonable evaluation of the ecological risk status of the landscape in the Yellow River source area is of practical significance for optimizing the regional landscape pattern and maintaining ecosystem function. To explore the regional heterogeneity of ecological risk in the watershed landscape, a landscape ecological risk evaluation model is constructed to evaluate the ecological risk status of the watershed for 20 years, and correlation analysis is used to further reveal the characteristics of the relationship between ecological risk and land use. The results show that the rapid expansion of urbanization and the increasing intensity of land development and use has caused significant changes in the Yellow River source area ecological environment and various land use types. The area of grassland decreased the most, by a total of 6160.04 km(2), while the area of unused land increased the most, by a total of 2930.27 km(2). A total of 12,453.11 km(2) of land in the Yellow River source area was transformed, accounting for 9.52% of the total area. The most significant area of grassland was transferred out, accounting for 49.47% of the transferred area. During the study period, the proportion of area in the low-risk zone decreased from 54.75% to 36.35%, the proportion of area in the medium-low-risk zone increased from 21.75% to 31.74%, and the proportion of area in the medium-high-risk and high-risk zones increased from 10.63% to 14.38%. The high-risk areas are mainly located in areas with fragmented landscapes and are vulnerable to human activities. The mean ecological risk values in the study area show an increasing trend, and the spatial distribution shows a hierarchical distribution of "lower around the center and higher in the center". The global Moran's I index is higher than 0.68, which indicates that the ecological risk values have a significant positive correlation in space, the area of cold spots of ecological risk varies significantly, and the spatial pattern fluctuates frequently, while the spatial distribution of hot spots is relatively stable. Therefore, the landscape ecological risk in the Yellow River source area is rising, but the different risk levels and their spatial aggregation patterns and cold and hot spot areas continue to transform, which requires continuous planning of the landscape pattern to enhance the safety and stability of the regional ecosystem.

TI  - Lymphatic Mapping in Colon Cancer Depending on Injection Time and Tracing Agent: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Prospective Designed Studies
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Simple Summary Lymphatic spreading is a main driver of metastasis and, thus, associated death in colon cancer. Therefore, resecting all metastatic lymph nodes is vital for cancer-free survival. Although resection within established resection lines provides a good lymph node yield, aberrant lymphatic drainage pathways may be missed. Lymphatic mapping can compensate for this shortcoming. Different methods for tracing lymphatic drainage exist, such as radiocolloid tracers, ink, and fluorescent tracers. Tracers can be applicated either during surgery or before surgery through colonoscopy, giving the tracer more time to travel through the lymphatic system and highlighting more distant tumor-draining lymph nodes. This review aims to assess which protocol best maps the lymphatic drainage pathway and thus enables an optimized, personalized approach for curative resection. An optimized lymph node yield leads to better survival in colon cancer, but extended lymphadenectomy is not associated with survival benefits. Lymphatic mapping shows several colon cancers feature aberrant drainage pathways inducing local recurrence when not resected. Currently, different protocols exist for lymphatic mapping procedures. This meta-analysis assessed which protocol has the best capacity to detect tumor-draining and possibly metastatic lymph nodes. A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, including prospective trials with in vivo tracer application. The risk of bias was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. Traced lymph nodes, total resected lymph nodes, and aberrant drainage detection rate were analyzed. Fifty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 42 searched for aberrant drainage. While a preoperative tracer injection significantly increased the traced lymph node rates compared to intraoperative tracing (30.1% (15.4, 47.3) vs. 14.1% (11.9, 16.5), p = 0.03), no effect was shown for the tracer used (p = 0.740) or the application sites comparing submucosal and subserosal injection (22.9% (14.1, 33.1) vs. 14.3% (12.1, 16.8), p = 0.07). Preoperative tracer injection resulted in a significantly higher rate of detected aberrant lymph nodes compared to intraoperative injection (26.3% [95% CI 11.5, 44.0] vs. 2.5% [95% CI 0.8, 4.7], p < 0.001). Analyzing 112 individual patient datasets from eight studies revealed a significant impact on aberrant drainage detection for injection timing, favoring preoperative over intraoperative injection (OR 0.050 [95% CI 0.010-0.176], p < 0.001) while indocyanine green presented itself as the superior tracer (OR 0.127 [95% CI 0.018-0.528], p = 0.012). Optimized lymphatic mapping techniques result in significantly higher detection of aberrant lymphatic drainage patterns and thus enable a personalized approach to reducing local recurrence.

TI  - CONFLICTS IN THE FAMILIES OF PARISH PRIESTS IN 18<SUP>TH</SUP> CENTURY UKRAINE
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study demonstrates how the religious worldview of early modern humans influenced the formation of family values and relationships in the clergy families and the church. The paper is based on the analysis of religious texts that were the basis of the contemporary Orthodox idea of the ideal family, comparing them with notes on the daily life of religious figures of the early modern period, with archival sources. The thesis analyses the conflicts in priests' families in Ukraine in the early modern society which was lenient concerning "dosed" violence by the father in the family. In this time period, the priest decided what the "normal" patterns of behavior were, ignoring or interpreting in his own way the instructions of the bishop and the canonical precepts. More than 7% of the priests were unable to resolve family quarrels on their own, and they moved to the public sphere for conflict resolution. The majority of these conflicts were between the son-in-law and mother-in-law of the priest. The least frequently reported conflicts were between the priest and his wife. The archival sources contained reports of conflicts involving every family member role. The disputes took place over material values and personal animosity, and within the context of "professional" activities, as family members often held all positions in the parish.

TI  - DAFCNN: A Dual-Channel Feature Extraction and Attention Feature Fusion Convolution Neural Network for SAR Image and MS Image Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the field of image fusion, spatial detail blurring and color distortion appear in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and multispectral (MS) during the traditional fusion process due to the difference in sensor imaging mechanisms. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a fusion method for SAR images and MS images based on a convolutional neural network. In order to make use of the spatial information and different scale feature information of high-resolution SAR image, a dual-channel feature extraction module is constructed to obtain a SAR image feature map. In addition, different from the common direct addition strategy, an attention-based feature fusion module is designed to achieve spectral fidelity of the fused images. In order to obtain better spectral and spatial retention ability of the network, an unsupervised joint loss function is designed to train the network. In this paper, the Sentinel 1 SAR images and Landsat 8 MS images are used as datasets for experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has better performance in quantitative and visual representation when compared with traditional fusion methods and deep learning algorithms.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Change Pattern Investigation of PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Jiangsu Province with MODIS Time Series Products
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last decade, the spatio-temporal patterns of PM2.5 on various scales, ranging from global, continent, and country to regional levels, has been the focus of considerable studies. However, these studies on spatio-temporal variability have concentrated primarily on changes in the spatial distribution patterns of regional PM2.5 concentrations and ignored temporal characteristics at a local site from a heterogeneous surface, such as local variability, persistence, and stability of PM2.5 exposure. Understanding the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentration changes at the local scale will help determine the local impacts of PM2.5, such as local exposure risk and vulnerability to PM2.5. This study aims to reveal the local characteristics of temporal variation at the scale of a prefecture-level city and its distinct-varying patterns from those at the provincial scale by using the annual satellite-derived PM2.5 concentration product from 2000 to 2015. The evolutionary trends, stability, and persistence of annual changes were discovered with a set of time series analysis methods, such as linear regression analysis + F-test, coefficient of variation method, and Hurst index. This study uses PM2.5 product data for a total of 16 years, from 2000 to 2015, and uses time series analysis methods, such as Theil-Sen median trend analysis + Mann-Kendall test, one-dimensional linear regression analysis + F-test, coefficient of variation method, and Hurst index, to reveal the temporal variation characteristics and spatial patterns of PM2.5 in Jiangsu Province. The results show that the increasing trends or slopes of annual averaged PM2.5 concentrations in Jiangsu Province are not consistent at the prefecture-level city scale, but they are consistent in northern, central and southern Jiangsu at a larger upward trend since 2000. The areas with significant increasing trends are concentrated in Xuzhou and Lianyungang and other northern cities. From the viewpoint of variability, the areas in medium and high variability are mainly aggregated in the areas north of the Yangtze River. According to the combination of persistence analysis and trend analysis, future variation in PM2.5 concentrations indicates an inverse persistence for an increasing trend, meaning the air quality decline in Jiangsu will slow.

TI  - Regional Representativeness Analysis of Ground-Monitoring PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentration Based on Satellite Remote Sensing Imagery and Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The issue of urban air quality in China has become increasingly significant due to industrialization and rapid urbanization. Although PM2.5 is the major air pollutant in most cities of northern China and has a direct negative impact on human health, there is a problem of under-representativeness at Chinese monitoring stations. In some cities, due to the relatively fewer national control stations and the fact that the stations are located closer to pollution sources, under the current assessment system, the monitoring data are not sufficient for the fairness of air quality assessment in different cities. In this article, the multispectral data of Landsat 8 data, air quality data, and meteorological data from ground monitoring stations have been integrated together and imported to different PM2.5-estimation models established based on the multi-layer back propagation neural network (MLBPN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF), respectively. According to the evaluation indices of R-2, RMSE, and ME, the estimation model based on the MLBPN revealed the best PM2.5 estimation results and was therefore employed for the regional representativeness analysis in the study area of Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. The annual average PM2.5 concentration in the study area is depicted after error correction using Kriging interpolation, which can be further used to evaluate and analyze the representativeness of monitoring stations in Xi'an. By calculating the difference between the actual station annual average and the annual average of estimated PM2.5 concentration in the whole region, it can be found that the regional annual average value of PM2.5 in Xi'an is overestimated. To sum up, this article proposes a feasible method for the spatial positioning of the air quality monitoring stations to be established.

TI  - Influence and Quantitative Analysis of Coal Dust Retention on Reflectance Spectra and Vegetation Index of Leaves
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coal resources in China are mainly concentrated in the arid and rain-less northern areas. Open-pit mining and transportation can easily cause the diffusion and pollution of coal dust. After the dust diffuses, some of them settle and cover the surrounding vegetation under gravity, leading to the common phenomenon of dust falling on vegetation. When remote sensing is used to monitor vegetation growth and health status, the dust fall effect will affect the spectral purity of vegetation so that the signal obtained by remote sensing is the mixed spectral signal of vegetation and dust fall, which seriously affects the quantitative remote sensing accuracy of vegetation. In order to study the dust retention effect of coal dust in vegetation remote sensing, the experiment of spectral measurement for dusty leaf was carried out, and the change of spectrum and vegetation index was studied. On this basis, sentinel-2A remote sensing images with red-edge bands were used to compare vegetation indices in the coal dust affected area and control area in Huolinhe open-pit mining area, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, respectively, to verify the experimental results of ground spectral measurement. In this experiment, vegetation leaves were selected from a coal mining area in Shenyang. The coal dust was evenly sprayed on the leaf surface with a level difference of 2 g center dot m(-2) to simulate the effect of dust retention on the actual leaf surface. Spad-502 chlorophyll meter was used to measure the spectrum of dust retention on the leaf surface, and the spectrum and vegetation index variation rules were explored. Since the red edge band was used for the vegetation index in this experiment, sentinel-2A remote sensing images were selected. Huolinhe Open-pit mine in NeiMengGu province and its surrounding areas were selected as the verification area. The coal-dust-affected area, and the control area were selected for vegetation index comparison to verify the experimental results of ground spectral measurement. The results show that, with the increase of dust retention (0 similar to 36 g center dot m(-2)), coal dust on the surface of the leaves will gradually reduce the overall reflectance of the leaves, and the change amplitude of the reflectance at the peak of the leaf spectrum (560, 720, 860, 1 680, 2 220 nm) is significantly higher than that at the trough (445, 681, 1 940 nm). With the increase in dust retention, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), SR705 (simple ratio), and ND705 (normalized difference index) decreased significantly. However, MTCI (the medium resolution imaging spectrometer terrestrial chlorophyll index), mSR(705) (modified simple ratio) and mND(705) ( modified normalized difference index) are unchanged, showing the characteristics of coal dust resistance. The reflectivity at 445 and 681 nm in these indices play an important role. By using Sentinel-2A remote sensing image in Huolinhe open pit coal mine area and comparing the coal dust affected area with the control area, MTCI, mSR(705), and mND(705) indices show the characteristics of coal dust resistance, verifying the results of ground experiments. The study would lay a foundation for vegetation remote sensing in the area of coal dust pollution and ensure the accuracy of vegetation remote sensing inversion.

TI  - An overview of fast calculation to clear atmospheric absorption transmittance of satellite channel
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric transmittance is the core of the infrared radiation transmission calculation and fast and accurate calculation approaches in channel transmittance make it possible for infrared remote sensing and satellite data assimilation. This paper firstly comprehensively reviews the progress of fast simulation techniques of satellite channel transmittance in terms of the Taylor expansion, the optimal sampling, the principal component analysis and the theory of machine learning, together with the basic principle, precision and problems of different typical simulation models. For rapid correction of transmittance simulation, this paper analyzes and discusses those approaches by cloud water absorption in microwave channel transmittance, radiative transfer optical path, channel spectra overlapping of gas absorption and gas content in aspects of continuous absorption. Then it discusses the progress and problems related to the rapid simulation of satellite channel transmittance and transmittance correction technologies in China. It points out that the essence of rapid transmittance simulation is to transfer the complex physics processes, such as absorption intensity and spectral lines, into a highly simplified mathematical space, and the fast calculation based on the Taylor expansion and the effective optical thickness by the optimal spectrum sampling are the current mainstream of fast channel transmittance calculations. It also points out that the future direction of RTTOV (Radiative Transfer for TIROS the Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS)) is how to redefine those forecast factors which can be independent on the zenith Angle of the satellite, how to separate more variable gases from mixing gases, and how to define the forecast factors in perfect precision. Finally, this paper puts forward the orientations of fast simulations of current and future satellite channel transmittance for Chinese satellites.

TI  - A Framework for Retrieving Soil Organic Matter by Coupling Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images and Variable Selection in the Sanjiang Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic matter (SOM) is an important soil property for agricultural production. Rising grain demand has increased the intensity of cultivated land development in the Sanjiang Plain of China, and there is a strong demand for SOM monitoring in this region. Therefore, Baoqing County of the Sanjiang Plain, an important grain production area, was considered the study area. In the study, we proposed a framework for high-accuracy SOM retrieval by coupling multi-temporal remote sensing (RS) images and variable selection algorithms. A total of 73 surface soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected in 2010, and Landsat 5 images acquired during the bare soil period (April, May, and June) were selected from 2008 to 2011. Three variable selection algorithms, namely, Genetic Algorithm, Random Frog and Competitive Adaptive Reweighted Sampling (CARS), were combined with Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) to build SOM retrieval models on the spectral bands and indices of the images. The results using a single-date image showed that the combination of variable selection algorithms and PLSR outperformed using PLSR alone, and CARS showed the best performance (R-2 = 0.34, RMSE = 15.66 g/kg) among all the algorithms. Therefore, only CARS was applied to SOM retrieval in the different year interval groups. To investigate the effect of the image acquisition time, all images were divided into various year interval groups, and the resulting images were then stacked. The results using multi-temporal images showed that the SOM retrieval accuracy improved as the year interval lengthened. The optimal result (R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 11.81 g/kg) was obtained from the 2008-2011 group, wherein the difference indices derived from the images of 2009, 2010, and 2011 dominated the selected spectral variables. Moreover, the spatial prediction of SOM based on the optimal model was consistent with the distribution of SOM. Our study suggested that the proposed framework that couples stacked multi-temporal RS images with variable selection algorithms has potential for SOM retrieval.

TI  - Characterizing the Development of Photovoltaic Power Stations and Their Impacts on Vegetation Conditions from Landsat Time Series during 1990-2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality in China, photovoltaic (PV) power generation has become increasingly important for promoting a low-carbon transition. The central and western desert areas of China have been identified as major areas for the construction of large PV bases. Remote sensing technology has been used to map the spatial distribution and development status of PV power stations quickly and accurately in ecologically fragile areas, as well as assess the ecological and environmental impact of their construction. However, current remote sensing monitoring of PV power stations focuses mainly on mapping and time series analysis to measure their development process and assess the environmental conditions on a large scale over a long period of time. Therefore, we constructed a random forest model based on image spectral and texture features and mapped 2022 PV power stations in the junction area of Hobq Desert, Ulan Buh Desert, Tengger Desert, and Mu Us Sands in China. Following that, we identified the construction time of the PV power stations by identifying the turning points of the normalized construction land index (NDBI) time series from 1990-2022 using the LandTrendr method. To assess the ecological impact of PV power stations, we used the NDVI to measure the change in vegetation condition before and after the construction of PV power stations and constructed NDVI changes for PV power stations constructed in different years. The results showed that this mapping method achieved an overall classification accuracy of 96.65% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.92. The root mean square error (RMSE) for construction year identification was less than 0.5, and the number of new PV power stations increased significantly after 2010, reaching a total area of 14.52 km(2) by 2016, which is consistent with the trend driven by national and regional development plans. Furthermore, the study found that the vegetation cover level could be restored to the average level before construction within 5-6 years and continued to increase after that. These findings may help government policymakers and practitioners make decisions on PV power station planning and ecological environment protection, thus contributing promptly to the achievement of China's dual carbon goals.

TI  - Evaluation of CAMEL over the Taklimakan Desert Using Field Observations
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Infrared (IR) land surface emissivity (LSE) plays an important role in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models through the satellite radiance assimilation. However, due to the large uncertainties in LSE over the desert, many land-surface sensitive channels of satellite IR sensors are not assimilated. This calls for further assessments of the quality of satellite-retrieved LSE in these desert regions. A set of LSE observations were made from field experiments conducted on 16-18 October 2013 along a south/north desert road in the Taklimakan Desert (TD), China. The observed LSEs (EOBS) are thus used in this study as the reference values to evaluate the quality of Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) data. Analysis of these data shows four main results. First, the CAMEL datasets appear to sufficiently capture the spatial variations in LSE from the oasis to the hinterland of the TD (this is especially the case in the quartz reststrahlen band). From site 1 at the southern edge of the Taklimakan Desert to site 10 at the northern edge, the measured LSE and the corresponding CAMEL observation in the quartz reststrahlen band first decrease and reach their minimum around sites 4-6 in the hinterland of the Taklimakan Desert. Then, the LSE increases gradually and finally reaches its maximum at site 10, which has a clay ground surface, showing that the LSE is higher at the edges of the desert and lower in the center. Second, the CAMEL values at 11.3 & mu;m have a zonal distribution characterized by a northeast-southwest strike, though such an artifact might have been introduced by ASTER LSE data during the merging process that created the CAMEL dataset. Third, the unrealistic variation of the original EOBS can be filtered out with useful signals, as identified by the first six principal components of the PCA conducted on the laboratory-measured hyperspectral emissivity spectra (ELAB). Fourth, the CAMEL results correlate well with the measured LSE at the 10 observation sites, with the observed LSE being slightly smaller than the CAMEL values in general.

TI  - Anatomy Versus Physiology: Is Breast Lymphatic Drainage to the Internal Thoracic (Internal Mammary) Lymphatic System Clinically Relevant?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Approximately 15%-25% of breast lymphatic drainage passes through the internal thoracic (internal mammary) lymphatic system, draining the inner quadrants of the breast. This study aimed to use lymphosonography to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in the axillary and internal thoracic lymphatic systems in patients with breast cancer. Seventy-nine patients received subcutaneous ultrasound contrast agent injections around the tumor. Lymphosonography was used to identify SLNs. In 14 of the 79 patients (17.7%), the tumor was located in the inner quadrant of the breast. Lymphosonography identified 217 SLNs in 79 patients, averaging 2.7 SLNs per patient. The 217 identified SLNs in the 79 patients were located in the axillary lymphatic system; none were located in the internal thoracic (internal mammary) lymphatic system, although it was expected in two to four patients (i.e., 4-11 SLNs). These results implied that SLNs associated with breast cancer are predominantly located in the axillary lymphatic system.

TI  - Developing PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> prediction models on a national and regional scale using open-source remote sensing data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clean air is the precursor to a healthy life. Air quality is an issue that has been getting under its well-deserved spotlight in the last few years. From a remote sensing point of view, the first Copernicus mission with the main purpose of monitoring the atmosphere and tracking air pollutants, the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI mission, has been widely used worldwide. Particulate matter of a diameter smaller than 2.5 and 10 mu m (PM2.5 and PM10) significantly determines air quality. Still, there are no available satellite sensors that allow us to track them remotely with high accuracy, but only using ground stations. This research aims to estimate PM2.5 and PM10 using Sentinel-5P and other open-source remote sensing data available on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for heating (December 2021, January, and February 2022) and non-heating seasons (June, July, and August 2021) on the territory of the Republic of Croatia. Ground stations of the National Network for Continuous Air Quality Monitoring were used as a starting point and as ground truth data. Raw hourly data were matched to remote sensing data, and seasonal models were trained at the national and regional scale using machine learning. The proposed approach uses a random forest algorithm with a percentage split of 70% and gives moderate to high accuracy regarding the temporal frame of the data. The mapping gives us visual insight between the ground and remote sensing data and shows the seasonal variations of PM2.5 and PM10. The results showed that the proposed approach and models could efficiently estimate air quality.

TI  - Dynamics and future prediction of LULC on Pare River basin of Arunachal Pradesh using machine learning techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic disturbances caused by increasing population densities are a significant concern as they accelerate climate change. Thus, regular monitoring of land use/land cover (LULC) is essential to mitigate these effects. Pare River basin of Arunachala Pradesh situated in the foothills of Eastern Himalayas was selected for this study. Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI data from 2000 (T-1), 2015 (T-2), and 2020 (T-3) were used to prepare the LULC map. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) environment was utilized for classification of LULC, while the TerrSet software environment was used for change analysis and projection using the CA-MC model. The SVM classifier produced overall all classification accuracies of 0.91, 0.85, and 0.91 with kappa values of 0.88, 0.82, and 0.89 for T-1, T-2, and T-3, respectively. The CA-MC model, which combines Markov chain and hybrid cellular automata, was calibrated with various predictor variables, including natural, proximity, and demographic variables along with T-1 and T-2 LULC and validated using T-3 LULC. The MLP was used for calibration, and an accuracy rate of above 0.70 was employed to generate transition potential maps (TPMs). The TPMs were used to project future LULC for 2030, 2040, and 2050. Validation analysis produced satisfactory results, with K-no, K-location, K-quality, and K-standard values of 0.96, 0.95, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis showed an excellent area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.87. The findings of this study provide important insights to decision-makers and stakeholders in addressing the impacts of LULC changes.

TI  - Investigation of the Effect of Three Commercial Water Acidifiers on the Performance, Gut Health, and <i>Campylobacter jejuni</i> Colonization in Experimentally Challenged Broiler Chicks
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Campylobacter jejuni is considered the most common causative agent of human bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis worldwide with poultry products, and especially broilers meat, being the most common source. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the continuous application of three commercial water acidifiers (ProPhorce & TRADE; SA Exclusive, Premium acid, and Salgard(& REG;) Liquid) on the performance, gut health, and C. jejuni colonization in experimentally challenged broiler chicks. The experimental findings demonstrated that acidification of the drinking water by the tested products did not affect the transmission of C. jejuni from the seeder to sentinel birds, under the conditions used in this study. However, all the products ameliorated the adverse effects induced by C. jejuni infection in the physicochemical characteristics of the intestinal content. Finally, the continuous use of certain products from the first days of life evoked undesirable effects on broilers' performance and induced severe gross lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract, leading to the need to modify the dosage scheme in future investigations. This study investigated the effect of three commercial water acidifiers on the performance, gut health, and C. jejuni colonization in experimentally challenged broiler chicks. A total of 192 one-day-old broiler chicks (Ross 308(& REG;)) were randomly allocated into 6 treatment groups with 4 replicates according to the following experimental design: group A, birds were not challenged and received tap water; group B, birds were challenged and received tap water; groups C, D, E, and F, birds were challenged and received tap water treated with 0.1% v/v SPECTRON & REG;, with 0.1-0.2% v/v ProPhorce & TRADE; SA Exclusive, with 0.1-0.2% v/v Premium acid, and with 0.1-0.2% v/v Salgard(& REG;) Liquid, respectively. The continuous water acidification evoked undesirable effects on broilers' performance and to an increased number of birds with ulcers and erosions in the oral cavity and the upper esophageal area. ProPhorce & TRADE; SA Exclusive and Premium acid significantly reduced the C. jejuni counts in the crop, whereas Salgard(& REG;) Liquid significantly reduced the C. jejuni counts in the ceca of birds. At slaughter age, only Premium acid significantly reduced C. jejuni counts in the ceca of birds. All the tested products ameliorated the changes induced by C. jejuni infection in the pH in the ceca of birds. It can be concluded that besides the effectiveness of the tested products in controlling C. jejuni in broilers, their continuous application evoked undesirable effects on broilers' performance, leading to the need to modify the dosage scheme in future investigations.

TI  - Data on New Intermediate and Accidental Hosts Naturally Infected with <i>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</i> in La Gomera and Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain)
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The rat lungworm, Angiostrongylus cantonensis, is the world's leading cause of eosinophilic meningitis in humans. It is an emerging zoonotic parasite endemic to Asia and the Pacific Islands that has spread to all continents except Antarctica. In the Canary Islands, its presence was first detected in 2010 on the island of Tenerife. Numerous studies demonstrated the high capacity of A. cantonensis to colonize new areas, especially its ability to parasitize a wide range of animals. Due to the similarity of the ecosystems that we can find between the islands that make up the Canary Archipelago and the great diversity of species of both vertebrates and terrestrial gastropods, the objective of this study was to analyze several species as possible hosts of A. cantonensis on other islands in the Canary Islands, with the use of molecular tools. The present study confirmed the presence of A. cantonensis in two mammalian species, Mus musculus and Felis catus, and in four terrestrial gastropod species, Limacus flavus, Milax gagates, Insulivitrina emmersoni, and Insulivitrina oromii. The presence of A. cantonensis implies a possible risk to humans and other animals, which justifies the need for control measures to control the possible risk of infection and, thus, prevent public health and veterinary problems. Angiostrongylus cantonensis is a metastrongyloid nematode and the etiologic agent of angiostrongyliasis, a disease characterized by eosinophilic meningitis. This emerging zoonotic parasite has undergone great expansion, including in some regions of Europe and America. In the Canary Islands, the parasite was first discovered parasitizing Rattus rattus on the island of Tenerife in 2010. To date, the distribution of this parasite in the Canary Islands has been restricted to the northern zone and the main cities of Tenerife. Using molecular tools for the sentinel species present in the Canary Islands, this study confirmed the presence of the nematode on two other islands in the Canary Archipelago: La Gomera and Gran Canaria. Furthermore, this emerging parasite was detected, besides in the common definitive host R. rattus, in wild Mus musculus and Felis catus and in four terrestrial gastropod species, Limacus flavus, Milax gagates, Insulivitrina emmersoni, and Insulivitrina oromii, two of them endemic to La Gomera, for the first time, increasing the number of non-definitive host species. This study reinforces the expansion character of A. cantonensis and highlights the importance of knowledge about sentinel species for identifying new transmission locations that help prevent and control the transmission of the parasite and, thus, prevent public health problems.

TI  - Recommendations for clinical practice, Nice/Saint-Paul-de-Vence 2022-2023: Management of localized endometrial cancer
T2  - BULLETIN DU CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most frequent gynecological cancers in industrialized countries and its incidence increases. The new molecular classification allows determination of the risk of recurrence and helps orienting therapeutic management. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment. Minimally invasive approach must be preferred for stages I and II. Surgery includes hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy, sentinel lymph node biopsy even in high risk diseases and omentectomy for non-endometrioid tumors (except in case of clear cells tumors). Fertility preservation can be proposed in low grade, stage I tumors without myometrial involvement. In stage III/IV disease, lymph node debulking without total lymphadenectomy is indicated. In case of peritoneal carcinomatosis, first-line cytoreductive surgery is recommended if complete resection can be achieved. Adjuvant therapy is not recommended in low risk tumors. In intermediate risk tumors, curietherapy is indicated. In tumors with high-intermediate risk, curietherapy and external radiotherapy are indicated according to prognostic factors (stage II, lymphovascular invasion); adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered on a case-by-case basis. In high risk tumors, chemotherapy and external radiotherapy are recommended using a concomitant or sequential approach.

TI  - Impact of precipitation on the prevalence of schistosomiasis mekongi in Lao PDR: Structural equation modelling using Earth observation satellite data
T2  - ONE HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing attention is being given to the effect of climate change on schistosomiasis, but the impact is currently unknown. As the intermediate snail host (Neotricula aperta) of Schistosoma mekongi inhabits the Mekong River, it is thought that environmental factors affecting the area of water will have an impact on the occurrence of schistosomiasis mekongi. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of precipitation on the prevalence of human schistosomiasis mekongi using epidemiological data and Earth observation satellite data in Khong district, Champasak province, Lao PDR. Structural equation modelling (SEM) using epidemiological data and Earth observation satellite data was conducted to determine the factors associated with the number of schisto-somiasis mekongi patients. As a result, SEM identified 3 significant factors independently associated with schistosomiasis mekongi: (1) a negative association with mass drug administration (MDA); (2) negative asso-ciation with total precipitation per year; and (3) positive association with precipitation during the dry season. Precisely, regardless of MDA, the increase in total yearly precipitation was suggested to decrease the number of schistosomiasis patients, whereas an increase in precipitation in the dry season increased the number of schis-tosomiasis patients. This is probably because when total precipitation increases, the water level of the Mekong River rises, thus decreasing the density of infected larvae, cercaria, in the water, and the frequency of humans entering the river would also decrease. In contrast, when precipitation in the dry season is higher, the water level of the Mekong River also rises, which expands the snail habitant, and thus water contact between humans and the snails would also increase. The present study results suggest that increasing precipitation would impact the prevalence of schistosomiasis both positively and negatively, and precipitation should also be considered in the policy to eliminate schistosomiasis mekongi in Lao PDR.

TI  - Inference of age-dependent case-fatality ratios for seasonal influenza virus subtypes A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 and B lineages using data from the Netherlands
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDespite the known relatively high disease burden of influenza, data are lacking regarding a critical epidemiological indicator, the case-fatality ratio. Our objective was to infer age-group and influenza (sub)type specific values by combining modelled estimates of symptomatic incidence and influenza-attributable mortality. MethodsThe setting was the Netherlands, 2011/2012 through 2019/2020 seasons. Sentinel surveillance data from general practitioners and laboratory testing were synthesised to supply age-group specific estimates of incidence of symptomatic infection, and ecological additive modelling was used to estimate influenza-attributable deaths. These were combined in an Bayesian inferential framework to estimate case-fatality ratios for influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B, per 5-year age-group. ResultsCase-fatality estimates were highest for influenza A(H3N2) followed by influenza B and then A(H1N1)pdm09 and were highest for the 85+ years age-group, at 4.76% (95% credible interval [CrI]: 4.52-5.01%) for A(H3N2), followed by influenza B at 4.08% (95% CrI: 3.77-4.39%) and A(H1N1)pdm09 at 2.51% (95% CrI: 2.09-2.94%). For 55-59 through 85+ years, the case-fatality risk was estimated to double with every 3.7 years of age. ConclusionsThese estimated case-fatality ratios, per influenza sub(type) and per age-group, constitute valuable information for public health decision-making, for assessing the retrospective and prospective value of preventative interventions such as vaccination and for health economic evaluations.

TI  - Surface subsidence disasters over Xuzhou city, China 2014-2018 revealed by InSAR and Peck model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Xuzhou is a city with frequent geological disasters in Jiangsu province, China. There are many types and wide distribution of geological disasters, including coal mining subsidence, karst ground collapse and soil consolidation settlement. It is of great significance to explore the surface subsidence disasters induced by adverse geological processes for urban development. Therefore, we firstly use 51-scene TerraSAR-X images and StaMPS technology to acquire surface deformation in Xuzhou from 2014 to 2018. The results show that the spatial heterogeneity of surface deformation (- 43 to 18 mm/year) is obvious. Then, the spatial-temporal evolution patterns of surface deformation are investigated by combining mining goaf, old Yellow River fault and geology along the metro. The main disaster-caused factors of surface subsidence are mining goaf, followed by the metro construction. Meanwhile, the subsidence trough in Gongnong Road metro station are analyzed based on Peck model, which shows that the maximum subsidence and width of subsidence trough are -36.8 mm and 310 m, respectively. The Yellow River fault zone is relatively stable because Xuzhou government controls the exploitation of karst groundwater. However, there are many intersections between the metro lines and old Yellow River fault, which may induce karst ground collapse. Therefore, periodic monitoring of surface deformation in Xuzhou is necessary to prevent hazards.

TI  - Flood prediction and vulnerability assessment at the south-western region of Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is a frequent experience for the people living in Bangladesh, especially in the south-western region. But due to its complexity and multidisciplinary nature, flood management remains a very difficult task. This research focused on finding the most vulnerable areas to flooding for each polder within the Khulna and Satkhira districts since those areas can be identified as one of the most vulnerable areas to flooding. Water level data from fourteen stations of seven rivers (Sibsa, Rupsa-Pasur, Kobadak, Bhadra, Kobadak, Ichamati (Western Border), Betna-Kholpetua, and Satkhira Khal) were analyzed to calculate water levels for 2, 5, 10, 25, and 100-year return period applying normal distribution, extreme value type-I (EV-I), and log person type-III (LP-III) distribution methods. The EV-I distribution method was showing the best fit. The study revealed that station SW243 (Rupsa-Pasur River) in the Dacope region has the most extreme water level, station SW259 (Sibsa River) has the second-highest water level, and station SW254.5 (Satkhira Khal) in Satkhira Sadar has the third-highest water level for the return period of 100 years. A flood inundation map was prepared using the EV-I method's 10-year return period value. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to demonstrate the polders' vulnerability depending on several factors. Overall, polder15 (Ghubra, Satkhira) is the most vulnerable polder, while polder 33 and polder 32 respectively are the second and third most vulnerable polders for flooding, both located in the Dacope region.

TI  - Mapping cropland evolution based on biophysical data and cropping history in the Borana rangelands, Southern Ethiopia
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many smallholder farmers grow crops using low-intensity management in the different rangelands of Eastern Africa. This crop cultivation also substantially contributes to the income of farmers. However, the extent of cropland expansion, the driving factors and the impacts have not been mapped on smaller scales. We obtained this information by interviewing farmers in the Borana rangeland who started cultivating in 1984-2014, and we demarcated samples of crop fields acquired using a handheld global positioning system (GPS) data collector device. We integrated layers of soil type, drainage, slope and elevation data into a Geographical Information System (GIS) to determine how and why cropland expansion changed over time. An overlay and surface analyses showed that farmers converted low-lying wet areas in the Borana rangeland into cropland fields. We detected that cropland expansion has since been possible because of the flat elevation, gentle slopes and moist soils along the seasonal river valley. Cropland expansion in low-lying wet areas of the rangelands contributes to the reduction of dry-season grazing reserves and forage availability for livestock. If the impacts of cropland expansion are to be minimized, rangeland managers must identify the land cover prone to degradation and revise pastoral land use plan. While this study focused on the Borana rangeland, the methodology is vigorous and generic enough to allow analysing retrospective changes in cropland expansion in other regions. In future studies, integrating information about wood density would increase the diagnostic power of this method.

TI  - Defending humankind: Anthropocentric bias in the appreciation of AI art
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
M3  - Article
AB  - We argue that recent advances of artificial intelligence (AI) in the domain of art (e.g., music, painting) pose a profound ontological threat to anthropocentric worldviews because they challenge one of the last frontiers of the human uniqueness narrative: artistic creativity. Four experiments (N = 1708), including a high-powered pre-registered experiment, consistently reveal a pervasive bias against AI-made artworks and shed light on its psy-chological underpinnings. The same artwork is preferred less when labeled as AI-made (vs. human-made) because it is perceived as less creative and subsequently induces less awe, an emotional response typically associated with the aesthetic appreciation of art. These effects are more pronounced among people with stronger anthropocentric creativity beliefs (i.e., who believe that creativity is a uniquely human characteristic). Sys-tematic depreciation of AI-made art (assignment of lower creative value, suppression of emotional reactions) appears to serve a shaken anthropocentric worldview whereby creativity is exclusively reserved for humans.

T2  - STUDIES IN PEOPLES HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spate of the descriptions of omens in medieval literature, including chronicles, seems to be poorly researched. The purpose of this article is to trace the omens that were looked for in medieval times, how people reacted to them, and how these are recorded in the Ukrainian chronicles. Fragments of the Chronicle of Novgorod describing various celestial omens are analysed here. This may fill a gap in historical research since the omens recorded in these chronicles have not been adequately researched so far.

TI  - Glacier inventory and glacier changes (1994-2020) in the Upper Alaknanda Basin, Central Himalaya
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Himalayan glaciers have been shrinking and losing mass rapidly since 1970s with an enhanced rate after 2000. The shrinkage is, however, quite heterogeneous and it is important to document individual glacier characteristics and their changes at the basin scale. We present an updated glacier inventory of the Upper Alaknanda Basin (UAB), Central Himalaya for the year 2020 and report area, debris cover and length changes for the periods 1994-2006 and 2006-2020 based on remote-sensing data. We identified 198 glaciers, comprising an area of 354.6 +/- 8.5 km(2), and classified them according to their size and morphology. The glaciers of the basin lost 4.2 +/- 2.9% (0.16 +/- 0.11% a(-1)) of their frontal area (from 368.6 +/- 9.2 to 353.0 +/- 5.3 km(2)) from 1994 to 2020. The average retreat rate was higher in the period 2006-2020 (13.3 +/- 1.8 m a(-1)) in comparison to 1994-2006 (9.3 +/- 1.9 m a(-1)). However, the area change rate was similar for the two periods (0.14 +/- 0.27% a(-1) for 1994-2006 and 0.16 +/- 0.19% a(-1) for 2006-2020). The debris-covered area has increased by 13.4 +/- 4.4% from 1994 to 2020. A comparison with previous studies in UAB indicates consistent area loss of similar to 0.15% a(-1) since the 1960s.

TI  - Field and Technical Report THE POTENTIAL FOR LIDAR USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) TO DETECT ARCHAEOLOGICAL STONE-WALLED STRUCTURES IN KHUTWANENG, BOKONI
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Interest in precolonial stone-walled structures in Mpumalanga began in the 19th century AD when European settlers and travellers encountered these stone-walled complexes. Since then these sites, which are associated with African farming communities, have been investigated using ground-based surveys and aircraft-based remote sensing, including LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). Remote sensing using aerial photographs has been central to research in Bokoni since the 1970s. Through this, stone-walled structures of various shapes, sizes and functions have been identified. These include circular homesteads, agricultural terraces and stone-walled roads. This study employed machine learning - support vector machines (SVM) - to determine whether such structures can be automatically extracted from LiDAR data and classified using computerised techniques. In this paper, we present our innovative research on the use of machine learning applications for the detection of stone-walled structures in the Bokoni village of Khutwaneng, Thaba-Chweu, Mpumalanga Province. The results show that the total (overall) accuracy of the auto detection of stone-walled structures is 95% and the Kappa coefficient (K) accuracy is 91%, which is acceptable in terms of both overall and K accuracy. The object-oriented machine learning technique was found to have good classification accuracies for detecting stone-walled structures.

TI  - Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of Merkel cell carcinoma: a single-center retrospective study in Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMerkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor of the skin with high mortality. However, its clinical characteristics in Asian patients remain uncertain owing to its low incidence.ObjectiveTo analyze the clinicopathological features of MCC and identify factors associated with its prognosis.MethodsThe medical records of 62 patients with MCC were retrospectively reviewed. Data on clinical features, survival outcomes, prognostic factors, histopathology and immunohistochemical profile of the patients were collected and analyzed. Merkel cell polyomavirus status was evaluated using immunohistochemistry.ResultsThe incidence of MCC significantly increased over time. The mean duration of follow-up was 51.2 months, with an overall 5-year survival of 80.6%. More female patients with MCC were identified than male patients (1.3:1). Approximately half of the patients had stage I disease at the time of initial presentation. The primary tumor was frequently located in the lower extremities (40.3%), followed by the head and neck (32.3%), upper extremities (22.6%), and the trunk (4.8%). Male sex was associated with poorer overall survival (p = 0.003). Post-resection adjuvant radiotherapy significantly improved the overall survival (p = 0.023). Sentinel lymph node biopsy during surgery ameliorated the progression-free survival (p = 0.036) in patients with stage I or II cancer. Lymphovascular and perineural invasion were associated with a poor prognosis. Old age, immunohistochemical profiles, and Merkel cell polyomavirus-positivity were not associated with prognosis.ConclusionPost-surgical adjuvant radiotherapy and sentinel lymph node biopsy significantly improve the course of MCC.

TI  - Modeling and Analysis of Sediment Trapping Efficiency of Large Dams Using Remote Sensing
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the role of sediment trapping by dams is important due to its control on fluvial and coastal geomorphology, aquatic ecology, water quality, and human water uses. Sediment trapping behind dams is a major source of bias in large-scale hydrogeomorphic models, hindering robust analyses of anthropogenic influences on sediment fluxes in freshwater and coastal systems. This study focuses on developing a new reservoir trapping efficiency (Te) parameter to account for the impacts of dams in hydrological models. This goal was achieved by harnessing a novel remote sensing data product which offers high-resolution and spatially continuous maps of suspended sediment concentration across the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Validation of remote sensing-derived surface sediment fluxes against USGS depth-averaged sediment fluxes showed that this remote sensing data set can be used to calculate Te with high accuracy (R-2 = 0.98). Te calculated for 222 dams across the CONUS, using incoming and outgoing sediment fluxes from their reservoirs, range from 0.13% to 98.3% with a mean of 45.8%. Contrary to the previous understanding that large reservoirs have larger Te, remote sensing data show that large reservoirs can have a wide range of Te values. A suite of 22 explanatory variables were used to develop an empirical Te model. The strongest model predicts Te using four variables: incoming sediment flux, outgoing water discharge, reservoir length, and reservoir storage. A global model was also developed using explanatory variables obtained from a global dam database.

TI  - Climate change, large fires, and cultural landscapes in the mediterranean basin: An analysis in southern Spain
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the factors that influence fire regimes in Mediterranean climates is essential to reduce their risk. This research uses Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite resources to evaluate recent changes in land surface temperature, precipitation, and vegetation and their ef-fects in the occurrence of large fires in the Mediterranean Basin. The results of the analysis of 335 fire events occurred in southern Spain from 2001 to 2020 show an increase in hazardous mete-orological factors linked to droughts and thermal anomalies. The study also examines the po-tential of preserving traditional landscapes to minimize such risk. In fact, the maintenance and recovering of traditional agro-pastoral activities is an effective option to reduce flammability and increase the resilience of cultural landscapes in hazardous climatic conditions.

TI  - The Seismotectonic Consequences of the Strong Maule Earthquake (February 27, 2010, <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>=8.8) in Chile: Digital Modeling of the Stress-Strain State of the Western Margin of the South American Plate
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents the seismotectonic consequences of the strong Maule earthquake in Chile, which occurred on February 27, 2010 at M-w = 8.8. The consequences are considered as a manifestation of a large-scale fragment of the general seismotectonic process on the western edge of the South American plate (Chilean sector). Our study shows that manifestations of postseismic processes of the Maule earthquake cover a much larger area compared to the epicentral zone of the aftershocks. Based on the comparison of the results of numerical modeling of the stress-strain state before and after the earthquake, seismological, geodetic, and satellite data, an alternative model of the development of the seismotectonic process in the Chilean sector of the South American plate was proposed. Stress-strain modeling was performed by the finite-element method. The source of the Maule earthquake, at a depth of 33 km, falls into the region of relatively high values of compression stresses and positive maximum shear stresses. It was shown that other strong earthquakes of the Chilean sector in the interval of depths from 20 to 50 km are caused by high concentration of tectonic stresses in the region of transition from oceanic to continental lithosphere. Within the framework of the proposed model of the seismotectonic process ruptures weaken the contact between the oceanic and continental lithosphere after strong earthquakes. Abrupt sinking of the continental lithosphere into the mantle causes an increase in viscous melt pressure, promotes penetration into mega-cracks, and rises to the surface, causing subsequent volcanic eruptions. The results obtained in comparison with the coseismic consequences of earthquakes do not contradict these results of numerical modeling and give new insights into the structure of the lithosphere in the continent-ocean transition zone and the development of the seismotectonic process.

TI  - Evaluation of the Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on Air Pollution in Russia's Largest Cities
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Governments around the world took unprecedented measures, such as social distancing and the minimization of public/industrial activity, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. This provided a unique chance to assess the relationships between key air pollutant emissions and track the reductions in these emissions in various countries during the lockdown. This study considers atmospheric air pollution in the 78 largest Russian cities (with populations over 250,000) in March-June of 2019-2021. This is the first such study for the largest cities in Russia. The initial data were the TROPOMI measurements (Sentinel-5P satellite) of such pollutants as carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are the main anthropogenic pollutants. The data were downloaded from the Google Earth Engine's cloud-based geospatial data platform. This provided L3-level information for subsequent analysis. The TROPOMI data indicated a decrease in the atmospheric content of the air pollutants in the largest Russian cities during the lockdown compared to the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The reduced economic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic had the greatest impact on NO2 concentrations. The average reduction was -30.7%, while the maximum reduction was found within Moscow city limits that existed before 01.07.2012 (-41% with respect to the 2019 level). For sulfur dioxide, the average decrease was only 7%, with a further drop in 2021 (almost 20% relative to 2019). For formaldehyde and carbon monoxide, there were no reductions during the 2020 lockdown period (99.4% and 100.9%, respectively, with respect to 2019). The identified impacts of the COVID-19 lockdown on NO2, SO2, HCHO, and CO NO2 concentrations in major Russian cities generally followed the patterns observed in other industrialized cities in China, India, Turkey, and European countries. The COVID-19 pandemic had a local impact on NO2 concentration reductions in major Russian cities. The differences leveled off over time, and the baseline pollution level for each pollutant was restored.

TI  - Operational Mapping of Salinization Areas in Agricultural Fields Using Machine Learning Models Based on Low-Altitude Multispectral Images
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization of cultivated soil is an important negative factor that reduces crop yields. Obtaining accurate and timely data on the salinity of soil horizons allows for planning the agrotechnical measures to reduce this negative impact. The method of soil salinity mapping of the 0-30 cm layer on irrigated arable land with the help of multispectral data received from the UAV is described in this article. The research was carried out in the south of the Almaty region of Kazakhstan. In May 2022, 80 soil samples were taken from the ground survey, and overflight of two adjacent fields was performed. The flight was carried out using a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera. The data preprocessing method is proposed herein, and several machine learning algorithms are compared (XGBoost, LightGBM, random forest, support vector machines, ridge regression, elastic net, etc.). Machine learning methods provided regression reconstruction to predict the electrical conductivity of the 0-30 cm soil layer based on an optimized list of spectral indices. The XGB regressor model showed the best quality results: the coefficient of determination was 0.701, the mean-squared error was 0.508, and the mean absolute error was 0.514. A comparison with the results obtained based on Landsat 8 data using a similar model was performed. Soil salinity mapping using UAVs provides much better spatial detailing than satellite data and has the possibility of an arbitrary selection of the survey time, less dependence on the conditions of cloud cover, and a comparable degree of accuracy of estimates.

TI  - Decoding the Vitality of Earth Observation for Flood Monitoring in the Lower Godavari River Basin, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The entire Indian subcontinent experienced devastating floods in the year 2022. The central section of the Godavari river basin (GRB) received torrential rainfall from the southwest monsoon during the second week of July 2022. This study exhibits how Earth observation (EO) datasets and cloud platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) can be used for swift, lucid and accurate decoding of the flood inundation signatures. Geospatial analysts can estimate concurrent floods using high-resolution C-band SAR/Sentinel-1 images, gridded precipitation and streamflow forecast datasets. The GPM (IMERG) precipitation data showed an incremental trend with prime hotspots, rainfall dissemination and retrieval from 01-20 July 2022 in the mid-GRB. The flood inundation layers were derived based on Otsu's method with selective topographic conditions from Sentinel-1 in GEE. Five significant flood affected case sites were identified in the lower GRB from Kothapalli to Yanam town, where the Godavari river meets the Bay of Bengal. Large stretches of agricultural lands were found to be inundated, resulting in extensive economic losses. Such flooded farmlands surrounding Kothapalli, Bhadrachalam, Kunavaram, Polavaram and Yanam towns were estimated as 60, 91, 86, 170 and 142 km(2) on 16 and 21 July 2022, respectively. The results were validated and cross-verified using bulletins and maps issued by various national agencies. Hence, EO, GEE and cloud analytical techniques are modern untapped potential e-assets vital for incorporation in policy frameworks helping disaster managers with comprehensive flood condition analysis.

TI  - Classification of Garlic Land Based on Growth Phase using Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesian Government needs to monitor the realization of garlic land with production plans in several production areas at growth season. A previous study, which used Sentinel-1A satellite imagery and Convolutional Neural Networks to classify garlic land, needed more information on growth phases. The study aims to address that limitation by creating a garlic land classification model based on the growth phase using Convolutional Neural Networks. The dataset comprises 446 preprocessed Sentinel-2 images cross-referenced with drone ground truth data. The model used both VGG16 and VGG19 architectures. Hyperparameter tuning was applied to obtain optimal values. After evaluating three scenarios (VGG16 base model, modified VGG16, and modified VGG19), the best model was obtained from the modified VGG19, which had an accuracy rate of 81.81% and a loss function of 0.71. The study successfully classified garlic land based on growth phase, with a precision rate of 0.43 for initial growth and vegetation classes, and 0.22 for the harvest class. The study offers an alternative to monitoring garlic production throughout growth phases with satellite imagery and deep learning.

AB  - Malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast are uncommon and complex to treat. This case involves a 39-year-old woman with a rapidly growing mass in her right breast measuring 32cm. The patient underwent a bilateral mastectomy with a right sentinel node biopsy and right chest wall reconstruction. The final pathology of the tumor revealed a malignant phyllodes tumor, with one of two right axillary lymph nodes positive for metastatic phyllodes tumor. Malignant phyllodes tumors should be taken into consideration in any rapidly growing breast mass. Further studies analyzing the treatment of malignant phyllodes tumors are necessary to reduce the risk of tumor recurrence and metastasis.

T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Remote sensing data play a crucial role in precision agriculture and natural resource monitoring. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide solutions to challenges faced by farmers and natural resource managers due to its high spatial resolution and flexibility compared to satellite remote sensing. This paper presents UAV and spectral datasets collected from different provinces in South Africa, covering different crops at the farm level as well as natural resources. UAV datasets consist of five multispectral bands corrected for atmospheric effects using the PIX4D mapper software to produce surface reflectance images. The spectral datasets are filtered using a Savitzky-Golay filter, corrected for Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC). The first and second derivatives and the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) spectra are also calculated. These datasets can provide baseline information for developing solutions for precision agriculture and natural resource challenges. For example, UAV and spectral data of different crop fields captured at spatial and temporal resolutions can contribute towards calibrating satellite images, thus improving the accuracy of the derived satellite products. Dataset: Available on request to munghemezuluc@arc.agric.za. The ARC (Agricultural Research Council) is in the process of developing an interface that will allow users to have access to the data directly from our server in line with our policies on data sharing. Therefore, in the meantime, users can request the data. Dataset License: CC BY-NC 4.0

M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses Sentinel-3 SLSTR data to analyze short-term drought events between 2019 and 2021. It investigates the crucial role of vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and water vapor amount associated with drought over Kenya's lower eastern counties. Therefore, three essential climate variables (ECVs) of interest were derived, namely Land Surface Temperature (LST), Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Total Column Water Vapor (TCWV). These features were analyzed for four counties between the wettest and driest episodes in 2019 and 2021. The study showed that Makueni and Taita Taveta counties had the highest density of FVC values (60-80%) in April 2019 and 2021. Machakos and Kitui counties had the lowest FVC estimates of 0% to 20% in September for both periods and between 40% and 60% during wet seasons. As FVC is a crucial land parameter for sequestering carbon and detecting soil moisture and vegetation density losses, its variation is strongly related to drought magnitude. The land surface temperature has drastically changed over time, with Kitui and Taita Taveta counties having the highest estimates above 20 & DEG;C in 2019. A significant spatial variation of TCWV was observed across different counties, with values less than 26 mm in Machakos county during the dry season of 2019, while Kitui and Taita Taveta counties had the highest estimates, greater than 36 mm during the wet season in 2021. Land surface temperature variation is negatively proportional to vegetation density and soil moisture content, as non-vegetated areas are expected to have lower moisture content. Overall, Sentinel-3 SLSTR products provide an efficient and promising data source for short-term drought monitoring, especially in cases where in situ measurement data are scarce. ECVs-produced maps will assist decision-makers with a better understanding of short-term drought events as well as soil moisture loss episodes that influence agriculture under arid and semi-arid climates. Furthermore, Sentinel-3 data can be used to interpret hydrological, ecological, and environmental changes and their implications under different environmental conditions.

TI  - Lateral Thoracic Vessel as a Recipient Vessel in Immediate Breast Reconstruction after Nipple/Skin-Sparing Mastectomy: Experience with 270 Flaps
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 75th Congress of the Korean Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons (PRS)
CL  - Seoul, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Background:The selection of recipient vessels for free-flap breast reconstruction is important for the success of the surgery and the aesthetics of the breast mound. The thoracodorsal artery and vein (TDA/V) allow reconstruction without noticeable scars from the anterior view, but TDA/V exposure is an invasive and time-consuming process on sentinel node biopsy. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the lateral thoracic artery and vein (LTA/V) as recipient vessels by comparing them with the TDA/V. Methods:This study included 270 flaps that underwent immediate free-flap breast reconstruction after nipple/skin-sparing mastectomy by lateral incision. The patients were categorized into two groups (LTA and TDA) based on the recipient vessel selected. Results:The LTA and TDA groups comprised 78 and 192 flaps, respectively. Among the 131 short and small pedicle flaps, such as gluteal artery perforator flap and profunda artery perforator flap, 65 (50%) used the LTA as the recipient vessel. The external diameters of the LTA/LTV (median, 1.2 mm/1.5 mm) were significantly lower than those of the TDA/TDV (median, 1.65 mm/2.0 mm). The LTV was present in 94%, and the second vein was present in 49% of cases with anastomosis. No significant differences in flap-related complications were observed between the two groups. Conclusions:The LTA/V can be used as recipient vessels for immediate free-flap reconstruction. Because of their superficial location and small caliber, they are easily accessible and suitable for short and small pedicle flaps.

TI  - Assessment of Climate Change Impact on Water Requirement and Rice Productivity
T2  - RICE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Assessing the impact of climate change (CC) on agricultural production systems is mainly done using crop models associated with climate model outputs. This review is one of the few, with the main objective of providing a recent compendium of CC impact studies on irrigation needs and rice yields for a better understanding and use of climate and crop models. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of climate impact studies on agricultural production systems, with a particular focus on uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of crop models. Although the new generation global climate models (GCMs) are more robust than previous ones, there is still a need to consider the effect of climate uncertainty on estimates when using them. Current GCMs cannot directly simulate the agro-climatic variables of interest for future irrigation assessment, hence the use of intelligent climate tools. Therefore, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses must be applied to crop models, especially for their calibration under different conditions. The impacts of CC on irrigation needs and rice yields vary across regions, seasons, varieties and crop models. Finally, integrated assessments, the use of remote sensing data, climate smart tools, CO2 enrichment experiments, consideration of changing crop management practices and multi-scale crop modeling, seem to be the approaches to be pursued for future climate impact assessments for agricultural systems.

TI  - Mediterranean basin vegetation forecasting approaches: accuracy analysis & climate-land cover-sensor nexus impacts
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - From land degradation and desertification to cyclones and tropical storms, and so on, the repercussions of global change have become increasingly severe in recent years. Such environmental impacts require continuous assessment and monitoring. Thus, to study and analyse these impacts, a variety of time-series forecasting approaches have been developed, including statistical ones [i.e. Moving Average (MA), Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), etc.], and machine-learning approaches such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long-Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In this study, accuracy of the most used forecasting approaches (i.e. MA, LSTM and Conv-LSTM) has been quantified, and three impacts (i.e. climate regions, land cover and satellite sensors) have been brought to light. Firstly, eight Mediterranean regions were selected (i.e. two hot arid regions, two cold arid regions, two regions with temperate hot summers and two regions with temperate warm summers) based on Koppen climate classification. Secondly, 654 hyperspectral images retrieved from three different satellites (i.e. Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 and MODIS) from 2016 to 2022 were computed in order to predict 29 vegetation biophysical indices (i.e. NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, CVI, etc.). Accordingly, more than 18,000 images were computed, resulting in 696 time series forecasted using the aforementioned approaches. Finally, 2088 forecasted time series have been determined, and their accuracy has been compared. As a result, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images had the highest forecasting accuracy in the three approaches, reaching 86% of the computed indices being over 50% accurately predicted in LSTM model, while MODIS data had the highest forecasting accuracy only in MA model, with a percentage of 72% of the computed indices being over 50% accurately predicted. Furthermore, we have identified that region climate impacts vegetation forecasting accuracy. For instance, arid regions showed low accuracies across all models, while temperate regions showed higher accuracies in the Mediterranean region.

TI  - Effects of land use land cover change on streamflow of Akaki catchment, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the hydrological impact of urbanization-induced land use land cover (LULC) changes for medium to large catchments is still an important research topic due to the lack of evidence to conclude about how local changes translate to impacts across scales. This study aims to provide evidence on the effects of LULC change on the streamflow of the Akaki catchment that hosts Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. Since the comparative performance of classification algorithms is poorly understood, we compared the performance of one parametric and five non-parametric machine learning methods for LULC mapping using Landsat imageries. To investigate the effect of LULC changes on streamflow, a semi-distributed HEC-HMS model was calibrated and validated using daily discharge data at multiple sites. Findings of this study showed that: (i) the accuracy of classification and regression tree (CART) was superior to the other classifiers, (ii) from 1990 to 2020, urban and forest cover increased at the expense of agricultural and bare land, (iii) the performance of the HEC-HMS model was acceptable at all stations during both the calibration and validation periods, and (iv) the mean annual and main rainy seasonal streamflow of the catchment experienced significant increases due to LULC change but the simulated streamflow changes highly varied with the type of LULC classifier. This study contributes to the limited evidence on how catchments, with rapidly developing cities are prone to hydrological regime changes that need to be recognized, understood and quantified, and incorporated into urban planning and development.

TI  - Quantitative Analysis of Desertification-Driving Mechanisms in the Shiyang River Basin: Examining Interactive Effects of Key Factors through the Geographic Detector Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a global eco-environmental hazard exacerbated by environmental and anthropogenic factors. However, comprehensive quantification of each driving factor's relative impact poses significant challenges and remains poorly understood. The present research applied a GIS-based and geographic detector model to quantitatively analyze interactive effects between environmental and anthropogenic factors on desertification in the Shiyang River Basin. A MODIS-based aridity index was used as a dependent variable, while elevation, near-surface air temperature, precipitation, wind velocity, land cover change, soil salinity, road buffers, waterway buffers, and soil types were independent variables for the GeoDetector model. A trend analysis revealed increased aridity in the central parts of the middle reach and most parts of the Minqin oasis and a significant decrease in some regions where ecological rehabilitation projects are underway. The GeoDetector model yielded a power determinant (q) ranging from 0.004 to 0.270, revealing elevation and soil types as the region's highest contributing factors to desertification. Precipitation, soil salinity, waterway buffer, and wind velocity contributed moderately, while near-surface air temperature, road buffer, and land cover dynamics exhibited a lower impact. In addition, the interaction between driving factors often resulted in mutual or non-linear enhancements, thus aggravating desertification impacts. The prominent linear and mutual enhancement occurred between elevation and soil salinity and between elevation and precipitation. On the other hand, the results exhibited a non-linear enhancement among diverse variables, namely, near-surface air temperature and elevation, soil types and precipitation, and land cover dynamics and soil types, as well as between wind velocity and land cover dynamics. These findings suggest that environmental factors are the primary drivers of desertification and highlight the region's need for sustainable policy interventions.

TI  - The Merging of a Coronal Dimming and the Southern Polar Coronal Hole
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We report on the merging between the southern polar coronal hole and an adjacent coronal dimming induced by a coronal mass ejection on 2022 March 18, resulting in the merged region persisting for at least 72 hr. We use remote sensing data from multiple co-observing spacecraft to understand the physical processes during this merging event. The evolution of the merger is examined using Extreme-UltraViolet (EUV) images obtained from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamic Observatory and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, which is on board the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. The plasma dynamics are quantified using spectroscopic data obtained from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer on board Hinode. The photospheric magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager are used to derive the magnetic field properties. To our knowledge, this work is the first spectroscopical analysis of the merging of two open-field structures. We find that the coronal hole and the coronal dimming become indistinguishable after the merging. The upflow speeds inside the coronal dimming become more similar to that of a coronal hole, with a mixture of plasma upflows and downflows observable after the merging. The brightening of the bright points and the appearance of coronal jets inside the merged region further imply ongoing reconnection processes. We propose that component reconnection between the coronal hole and coronal dimming fields plays an important role during this merging event because the footpoint switching resulting from the reconnection allows the coronal dimming to intrude onto the boundary of the southern polar coronal hole.

TI  - A case of cutaneous psoriasis vulgaris achieving complete remission post major breast reconstructive surgery<SUP>&DAG;</SUP>
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Psoriasis is a debilitating chronic inflammatory systemic condition largely affecting the skin. Major surgery is relatively contraindicated due to the propensity for triggering psoriatic flares and koebnerization of the surgical scars. We detail an interesting case of complete psoriasis remission following a right nipple-sparing mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy with vascular augmented pedicled transverse rectus abdominal myocutaneous (TRAM) flap in a patient with systemic psoriasis vulgaris and arthropathy. Intra-operatively, majority of the psoriatic plaques were excised or de-epithelized and used as part of the ipsilateral TRAM flap. Post-operatively, koebnerization did not occur and her psoriasis was cured completely even after cancer chemotherapy. One of several hypotheses include excision with de-epithelization of most of the psoriatic plaques reduces disease and inflammatory burden leading to complete remission. Perhaps, surgery could one day play a supporting role to existing treatment options to achieve psoriasis remission.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations of Potential and Actual Evapotranspiration and the Driving Mechanism over Equatorial Africa Using Satellite and Reanalysis-Based Observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the actual evapotranspiration (AET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) seasonality, trends, abrupt changes, and driving mechanisms with global sea surface temperature (SST) and atmospheric circulation patterns over Equatorial Africa (EQA) during 1980-2020. The spatiotemporal characteristics of mean ET were computed based on a 40-year average at annual and seasonal scales. The Mann-Kendall statistical test, the Sen slope test, and the Bayesian test were used to analyze trends and detect abrupt changes. The results showed that the mean annual PET (AET) for 1980-2020 was 110 (70) mm. Seasonal mean PET (AET) values were 112 (72) in summer, 110 (85) in autumn, 109 (84) in winter, and 110 (58) in spring. The MK test showed an increasing (decreasing) rate, and the Sen slope identified upward (downward) at a rate of 0.35 (0.05) mm yr(-10). The PET and AET abrupt change points were observed to happen in 1995 and 2000. Both dry and wet regions showed observed weak (strong) correlation coefficient values of 0.3 (0.8) between PET/AET and climate factors, but significant spatiotemporal differences existed. Generally, air temperature, soil moisture, and relative humidity best explain ET dynamics rather than precipitation and wind speed. The regional atmospheric circulation patterns are directly linked to ET but vary significantly in space and time. From a policy perspective, these findings may have implications for future water resource management.

TI  - A comprehensive analysis of different geometric correction methods for the Pleiades-1A and Spot-6 satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images have been widely used in the production of geospatial information such as land use and land cover mapping and the generation of several thematic layers via image processing techniques. The systematic sensor and platform-induced geometry errors influence images acquired by sensors onboard various satellite platforms. Thus, geometric correction of satellite images is essential for image pre-processing to extract accurate and reliable locational information. Geometric correction of satellite images obtained from two different satellites, Pleiades 1A (PHR) and SPOT-6, was performed within the scope of this study using empirical models and a physical model. The 2D polynomial model, 3D rational function model with calculated RPCs from GCPs, 3D rational function model with RPCs from satellite, RPC refinement model using GCPs, and Toutin's physical model were used. Several experiments were carried out to investigate the effects of various parameters on the performance of the geometric correction procedure, such as GCP reference data source, GCP number and distribution, DEM source, spatial resolution, and model. Our results showed that lower RMSE values could be achieved with the model that uses RPC from data providers for PHR and SPOT, followed by the RPC refinement method for PHR and Toutin method for SPOT. In general, GCPs from the HGM data source and ALOS DEM combination provided better results. Lastly, lower RMSE values, thus better locational accuracy values, were observed with the PHR image except for a single test.

TI  - Enabling Regenerative Agriculture Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The emergence of cloud computing, big data analytics, and machine learning has catalysed the use of remote sensing technologies to enable more timely management of sustainability indicators, given the uncertainty of future climate conditions. Here, we examine the potential of "regenerative agriculture", as an adaptive grazing management strategy to minimise bare ground exposure while improving pasture productivity. High-intensity sheep grazing treatments were conducted in small fields (less than 1 ha) for short durations (typically less than 1 day). Paddocks were subsequently spelled to allow pasture biomass recovery (treatments comprising 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months), with each compared with controls characterised by lighter stocking rates for longer periods (2000 DSE/ha). Pastures were composed of wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia species), kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), Phalaris (Phalaris aquatica), and cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata), and were destructively sampled to estimate total standing dry matter (TSDM), standing green biomass, standing dry biomass and trampled biomass. We invoked a machine learning model forced with Sentinel-2 imagery to quantify TSDM, standing green and dry biomass. Faced with La Nina conditions, regenerative grazing did not significantly impact pasture productivity, with all treatments showing similar TSDM, green biomass and recovery. However, regenerative treatments significantly impacted litterfall and trampled material, with high-intensity grazing treatments trampling more biomass, increasing litter, enhancing surface organic matter and decomposition rates thereof. Pasture digestibility and sward uniformity were greatest for treatments with minimal spelling (3 months), whereas both standing senescent and trampled material were greater for the 15-month spelling treatment. TSDM prognostics from machine learning were lower than measured TSDM, although predictions from the machine learning approach closely matched observed spatiotemporal variability within and across treatments. The root mean square error between the measured and modelled TSDM was 903 kg DM/ha, which was less than the variability measured in the field. We conclude that regenerative grazing with short recovery periods (3-6 months) was more conducive to increasing pasture production under high rainfall conditions, and we speculate that - in this environment - high-intensity grazing with 3-month spelling is likely to improve soil organic carbon through increased litterfall and trampling. Our study paves the way for using machine learning with satellite imagery to quantify pasture biomass at small scales, enabling the management of pastures within small fields from afar.

TI  - Watershed prioritization of Kailali district through morphometric parameters and landuse/landcover datasets using GIS
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed prioritization is considered an important tool for soil and watershed management. This study focuses on the watershed prioritization of the Kailali district in terms of soil erosion, considering morphometric parameters and land use/landcover (LULC) datasets using GIS. ALOS DEM of 30 m resolution was used to delineate sub-watersheds and calculate linear, areal, and relief morphometric parameters. Similarly, Esri LULC 2021 (Sentinel-2 imagery at 10 m resolution) was used to calculate LULC parameters. An integrated approach of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Weighted Sum Analysis (WSA) was used for prioritization. PCA was used to reduce selected parameters, calculate the correlation matrix, and define the significant parameters. WSA was used to define weightage value, and Compound Value (CV) was calculated for the ranking of sub-watersheds. 22 sub-watersheds with at least 3rd order stream and 15 parameters were selected for prioritization. PCA integrated with WSA was found to be effective for prioritization. The findings showed that about 61.58% of the watershed area is in the high-priority category, suggesting those areas are at a higher risk of erosion. Therefore, different land rehabilitation programs and bioengineering techniques should be focused on the sub-watershed of high-priority categories followed by medium and low-priority categories to control further soil erosion. The adopted methodology of prioritization can also be performed for multi-hazard mapping.

TI  - Design, Implementation, and Coordination of Malaria Therapeutic Efficacy Studies in Nigeria in 2018
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior to 2018, malaria therapeutic efficacy studies (TESs) in Nigeria were implemented separately at differ-ent sites, as assigned by the National Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP). In 2018, however, the NMEP engaged the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research to coordinate the 2018 TESs in 3 of 14 sentinel sites with the objective of stan-dardizing their conduct across all three sites: Enugu, Kano, and Plateau states in three of six geopolitical zones. Artemether-lumefantrine and artesunate-amodiaquine, the two first-line drugs for treatment of acute uncomplicated malaria in Nigeria, were tested in both Kano and Plateau states. In Enugu State, however, artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine were the test drugs, with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine being tested for potential inclu-sion in Nigerian treatment policy. The TES was conducted in 6-month to 8-year-old children and was funded by the Global Fund with additional support from the WHO. A multipartite core team comprised of the NMEP, the WHO, the U.S. Presidential Malaria Initiative, academia, and the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research was set up to oversee the execu-tion of the 2018 TES. This communication reports best practices adopted to guide its coordination, and lessons learned during in the process, including applying developed standard operating procedures, powering the sample size ade-quately for each site to report independently, training the investigating team for fieldwork, facilitating stratification of deci-sions, determining efficiencies derived from monitoring and quality assessment, and optimizing logistics. The planning and coordination of the 2018 TES activities is a model of a consultative process for the sustainability of antimalarial resis-tance surveillance in Nigeria.

TI  - Influence of the Relief on the Pyrogenic Disturbance of Geosystems of the Primorskii Range (Western Cisbaikalia)
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A morphometric analysis is made of the relief for the mountainous territory in Western Cisbaikalia: the Primorskii Range, the landscapes of which have been transformed for a long time under the influence of the pyrogenic factor. Under such conditions, it becomes relevant to determine the relationships between the geomorphological conditions of the territory and the distribution of postpyrogenic landscapes, as well as the possibility of using the results in landscape mapping. The basis for maps of surface curvature is provided by a digital elevation model based on ALOS radiometer data with a resolution of 30 m. Using geoinformation analysis, maps of the steepness and exposure of slopes and horizontal and vertical curvature are obtained and the statistical coefficients of these indicators for the study area are determined. To determine the degree of influence of geomorphological conditions on the distribution of postpyrogenic landscapes, a geomorphological map is compiled, a typification of the relief is carried out according to the altitudinal layers, and a correlation with corresponding types of locations is determined. At this stage of research, the following connections are revealed between the geomorphological heterogeneity of the local relief and the nature of the spread of fire: in some cases, river valleys become barriers to the spread of fire (their summits are usually not affected by fire). Another option for barriers are the ridges located across slopes; thus, the orientation of orographic relief elements can be designated as a limiting factor in the spread of fires. The prevailing southeastward exposure of the macroslope of the Primorskii Range, which coincided with the northwestward direction of the main air transport, becomes an intensifying factor in the spread.

TI  - Assessing Land Degradation and its Drivers across the Rainfed Areas in Jordan during the Past two Decades Using Physical and Biophysical Satellite Metrics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Mediterranean has been experiencing aridification and a warming trend during the past two decades which could bring about land degradation. Physical and biophysical indices extracted from Landsat images were implemented to identify land degradation (LD) across the entire rainfed areas in Jordan during the growing seasons of 1998 through 2021. The study area was subdivided into three subzones to capture the unique interaction between climate gradient and LD. The NDVI and surface albedo were implemented to identify LD across the study area. Results show that LD, as demonstrated by the two metrics, increases as aridity increases, confirming the widely accepted notion that LD becomes more noticeable in marginal climate zones. These results are in line with the general drop of precipitation and the rise in air temperature observed across the study area. It is found that seasonal surface albedo is a robust satellite metric that can be used to monitor LD in semiarid areas because of its high dynamic stability compared to the NDVI which exhibits large interannual variations. An energy balance model shows that LD increases surface temperature which in turn enhances actual evapotranspiration losses and the risk of forest fires. The availability of archived satellite images makes it feasible to track different land surface processes like LD over an extended period of time, enabling the tracking of climate change over synoptic scenes. Satellite metrics have the potential to establish LD maps for countries where such maps are not available or are hard to obtain.

TI  - Quantifying Uncertainties in OC-SMART Ocean Color Retrievals: A Bayesian Inversion Algorithm
T2  - ALGORITHMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean Color-Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART) is a robust data processing platform that supports a large array of multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors. It provides accurate aerosol optical depths and remote sensing reflectances (Rrs estimates) that can be used to generate products such as absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton and detritus/Gelbstoff as well as backscattering coefficients due to particulate matter. The OC-SMART platform yields improved performance in complex environments by utilizing scientific machine learning (SciML) in conjunction with comprehensive radiative transfer computations. This paper expands the capability of OC-SMART by quantifying uncertainties in ocean color retrievals. Bayesian inversion is used to relate measured top of atmosphere radiances and a priori data to estimate posterior probability density functions and associated uncertainties. A framework of the methodology and implementation strategy is presented and uncertainty estimates for Rrs retrievals are provided to demonstrate the approach by applying it to MODIS, OLCI Sentinel-3, and VIIRS sensor data.

TI  - Shoreline Analysis and Extraction Tool (SAET): A New Tool for the Automatic Extraction of Satellite-Derived Shorelines with Subpixel Accuracy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - SAET (Shoreline Analysis and Extraction Tool) is a novel open-source tool to enable the completely automatic detection of shoreline position changes using the optical imagery acquired by the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 and 9 satellites. SAET has been developed within the ECFAS (European Coastal Flood Awareness System) project, which is intended to be the first European service for coastal flood forecasting, management, and recovery analysis. The tool is developed to characterise the shoreline response associated with punctual events such as coastal storms as well as any other phenomenon. For a given beach segment, SAET facilitates the selection of the satellite images closest in time to the analysed events that offer an adequate cloud coverage level for analysing the shoreline change. Subsequently, the tool automatically downloads the images from their official repositories, pre-processes them and extracts the shoreline position with sub-pixel accuracy. In order to do so, an initial approximate definition of the shoreline is carried out at the pixel level using a water index thresholding, followed by an accurate extraction operating on the shortwave infrared bands to produce a sub-pixel line in vector formats (points and lines). The tool offers different settings to be adapted to the different coastal environments and beach typologies. Its main advantages refer to its autonomy, its efficiency in extracting complete satellite scenes, its flexibility in adapting to different environments and conditions, and its high subpixel accuracy. This work presents an accuracy assessment on a long Mediterranean sandy beach of SDSs extracted from L8 and S2 imagery against coincident alongshore reference lines, showing an accuracy of about 3 m RMSE. At the same time, the work shows an example of the usage of SAET for characterising the response to Storm Gloria (January 2020) on the beaches of Valencia (E Spain). SAET provides an efficient and completely automatic workflow that leads to accurate SDSs while only relying on publicly available information. The tool appears to be a useful extraction tool for beach monitoring, both for public administrations and individual users.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of evapotranspiration and its linkage with environmental factors in the largest freshwater lake wetland in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Poyang lake wetlandStudy focus: Evapotranspiration (ET) is a critical parameter in the hydrologic and energy budget, and it is important for understanding spatio-temporal variations in ET in large lake wetlands. Monthly ET in the Poyang Lake wetland during 2008-2017 was estimated by the remote sensing ET retrieval model based on a Nonparametric approach (RS-NP). And the spatio-temporal variation of ET and the influencing factors were analyzed.New hydrological insights for the region: The validation revealed the usefulness of the RS-NP model in a moist region and yielded a relative error of 6 % (12 %) in the wet (dry) season. Temporally, the average yearly ET was 884 mm with ET/P (precipitation) of 55 %-65 %. The monthly ET/P ratio increased significantly from 40 %-50 % from January to May to 90 %-130 % from July to October. ET in June was lower by over 20 % than that in May and July with the lowest ET/P value (33 %). Spatially, relatively larger and lower ET occurred in the northern and southern parts, respectively. The main factors affecting ET variability were downwelling shortwave radiation (similar to 2/3 contribution) and water area (similar to 1/3 contribution) at the monthly scale. Precipitation and surface temperature dominantly controlled the hysteresis effects with a lag of one month and regulated LE monthly variations. This study improves our understanding of complicated water atmosphere interactions and their linkages with environmental factors in large lake systems.

TI  - Deformation Monitoring and Analysis of Reservoir Dams Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology-Banqiao Reservoir
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most dams in China have been operating for a long time and are products of the economic and technical limitations at the time of construction. Due to decades of aging engineering and ancillary problems, these reservoirs pose great threats to the safety of local people and the development of the surrounding economy. In this study, the surface deformation information for the Banqiao Reservoir is monitored with the small baseline subset-synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SBAS-InSAR) method using 80 Sentinel-1A images acquired from 3 January 2020 to 20 August 2022. Additionally, ground measurements from the BeiDou ground-based deformation monitoring stations were collected to validate the InSAR results. Based on the InSAR results, the spatiotemporal deformation features of the dam were analyzed in detail. The results show that the deformation in most areas, including the dam in the study area, is relatively stable, and the regional deformation velocity of the Banqiao Reservoir dam and other hydraulic engineering facilities varies between -1 mm/y and -4 mm/y. The Ru River area has a relatively obvious subsidence trend, and the maximum subsidence velocity reaches 30 mm/y. The InSAR monitoring results are consistent with the change trend in the BeiDou ground-based deformation measurement results. The monitoring results for the reservoir dam area provide a reference for local sustainable development and geological disaster prevention.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change, especially the increase in artificial surfaces, leads to the change in heat balance components, such as an increase in sensible heat (H) flux versus a decrease in latent heat (lambda E) flux. Hence, detecting heat flux changes can reveal the effects of LULC changes. We measured Landscape Surface Functional parameters (LSF) and Surface Heat Balance parameters (SHB) on Dezful plain using Landsat images and Surface Energy Balance Index (SEBI) algorithm at three-time points over 32 years (1987, 2000, and 2019). Spatio-temporal trends of LSF and SHB parameters were analyzed using standard statistics and examined in three vegetation cover classes. The results illustrate a significant difference in the increased rate of sensible heat and latent heat fluxes, which can authenticate land use changes. Negative sensible heat flux areas were reduced by 99% in 2019 and confined to the riverbank. In other words, the places with thermal comfort have dramatically decreased. In 2019, the normalized LSF and SHB parameters gradients were fixed at a shorter distance from the urban area in 1987. As a result, the expansion of built-up areas has led to a spatial similarity in surface heat flux which is a potential threat to our environment.

T2  - IZVESTIYA ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in the snow cover extent S in Eurasia have been analyzed using the results of simulations with an ensemble of global climate models of the CMIP6 international project under the SSP2-4.5 scenario of anthropogenic impacts for the 21st century. Features of S variability in relation to changes in surface air temperature T in different seasons are revealed by comparing ensemble model calculations for the historical scenario to CDR satellite data against the background of a general decrease in the snow cover extent in Eurasia during contemporary warming. It is noted that the multimodel ensemble mean estimates of the sensitivity parameter dS/dT for the transitional seasons in spring and autumn can be significantly lower in absolute values than those for the individual models and those derived from satellite data. A comparison of model estimates with satellite observation data has shown that the models generally reproduce the observations from the snow cover area in Eurasia, while variations in the area may be underestimated for individual models. According to ensemble model calculations, the rate of snow cover reduction in Eurasia in the second half of the 21st century decreases when compared to the first half of the 21st century for all seasons. At the same time, the maximum values of the rate of reduction of snow cover extent in Eurasia are inherent in transitional seasons (autumn and spring).

AB  - With rapid developments in the satellite data services market, the demand for low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is increasing. Advancements in designing lightweight satellites are essential to maximize profits from the mass production of LEO satellites in private companies. This article proposes a new direct charging control suitable for electrical power systems for lightweight and highly reliable LEO satellites. Moreover, an analysis of the proposed solar array regulator (SAR) in terms of weight, efficiency, and reliability is presented. Additionally, the advantages of the proposed SAR in terms of lifespan and state of health of Li-ion batteries are presented because the peak value of the battery charging current and the temperature changes during the battery charging operation are relatively small.

TI  - Recovery of western black-legged tick and vertebrate populations after a destructive wildfire in an intensively-studied woodland in northern California
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite increasing severity and frequency of wildfires, knowledge about how fire impacts the ecology of tick borne pathogens is limited. In 2018, the River Fire burned a forest in the far-western U.S.A. where the ecology of tick-borne pathogens had been studied for decades. Forest structure, avifauna, large and small mammals, lizards, ticks, and tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi) were assessed after the wildfire in 2019 and 2020. Burning reduced canopy cover and eliminated the layer of thick leaf litter that hosted free-living ticks, which over time was replaced by forbs and grasses. Tick abundance and the vertebrate host community changed dramatically. Avian species adapted to cavity nesting became most prevalent, while the number of foliage-foraging species increased by 83% as vegetation regenerated. Nine mammalian species were observed on camera traps, including sentinel (black-tailed jackrabbits) and reservoir hosts (western gray squirrels) of B. burgdorferi. One Peromyscus sp. mouse was captured in 2019 but by 2020, numbers were rebounding (n=37), although tick infestations on rodents remained sparse (0.2/rodent). However, western fence lizards (n=19) hosted 8.6 ticks on average in 2020. Assays for pathogens found no B. miyamotoi in either questing or host-feeding ticks, A. phagocytophilum DNA in 4% (1/23) in 2019, and 17% (29/173) in 2020 for questing and host-feeding ticks combined, and B. burgdorferi DNA in just 1% of all ticks collected in 2020 (2/173). We conclude that a moderately severe wildfire can have dramatic impacts on the ecology of tick-borne pathogens, with changes posited to continue for multiple years.

TI  - G 68-34: A Double-lined M-dwarf Eclipsing Binary in a Hierarchical Triple System
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Using high-resolution spectra from the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph and photometry from sector 56 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, we report that the nearby M dwarf G 68-34 is a double-lined eclipsing binary. The pair is spin-orbit synchronized with a period of 0.655 days. The light curve shows significant spot modulation with a larger photometric amplitude than that of the grazing eclipses. We perform a joint fit to the spectroscopic and photometric data, obtaining masses of 0.3280 +/- 0.0034M (circle dot) and 0.3207 +/- 0.0036M (circle dot) and radii of 0.345 +/- 0.014R (circle dot) and 0.342 +/- 0.014R (circle dot) after marginalizing over unknowns in the starspot distribution. This system adds to the small but growing population of fully convective M dwarfs with precisely measured masses and radii that can be used to test models of stellar structure. The pair also has a white-dwarf primary at 9 '' separation, with the system known to be older than 5 Gyr from the white-dwarf cooling age. The binarity of G 68-34 confirms our hypothesis from Pass et al.: in that work, we noted that G 68-34 was both rapidly rotating and old, highly unusual given our understanding of the spin-down of M dwarfs, and that a close binary companion may be responsible.

AB  - Floods occur throughout the world and are becoming increasingly frequent and dangerous. This is due to different factors, among which climate change and land use stand out. In Mexico, they occur every year in different areas. Tabasco is a periodically flooded region, causing losses and negative consequences for the rural, urban, livestock, agricultural, and service industries. Consequently, it is necessary to create strategies to intervene effectively in the affected areas. Different strategies and techniques have been developed to mitigate the damage caused by this phenomenon. Satellite programs provide a large amount of data on the Earth's surface and geospatial information processing tools useful for environmental and forest monitoring, climate change impacts, risk analysis, and natural disasters. This paper presents a strategy for the classification of flooded areas using satellite images obtained from synthetic aperture radar, as well as the U-Net neural network and ArcGIS platform. The study area is located in Los Rios, a region of Tabasco, Mexico. The results show that U-Net performs well despite the limited number of training samples. As the training data and epochs increase, its precision increases.

TI  - Modeling the Topside Ionosphere Effective Scale Height through In Situ Electron Density Observations by Low-Earth-Orbit Satellites
T2  - UNIVERSE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we aim to characterize the effective scale height at the ionosphere F2-layer peak (H-0) by using in situ electron density (N-e) observations by Langmuir Probes (LPs) onboard the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01). CSES-01 is a sun-synchronous satellite orbiting at an altitude of similar to 500 km, with descending and ascending nodes at similar to 14:00 local time (LT) and similar to 02:00 LT, respectively. Calibrated CSES-01 LPs N-e observations for the years 2019-2021 provide information in the topside ionosphere, whereas the International Reference Ionosphere model (IRI) provides N-e values at the F2-layer peak altitude for the same time and geographical coordinates as CSES-01. CSES-01 and IRI N-e datasets are used as anchor points to infer H-0 by assuming a linear scale height in the topside representation given by the NeQuick model. COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3 (COSMIC-1) radio occultation (RO) data are used to constrain the vertical gradient of the effective scale height in the topside ionosphere in the linear approximation. With the CSES-01 dataset, we studied the global behavior of H-0 for daytime (similar to 14:00 LT) and nighttime (similar to 02:00 LT) conditions, different seasons, and low solar activity. Results from CSES-01 observations are compared with those obtained through Swarm B satellite N-e-calibrated measurements and validated against those from COSMIC-1 RO for similar diurnal, seasonal, and solar activity conditions. H-0 values modeled by using CSES-01 and Swarm B-calibrated observations during daytime both agree with corresponding values obtained directly from COSMIC-1 RO profiles. Differently, H-0 modeling for nighttime conditions deserves further investigation because values obtained from both CSES-01 and Swarm B-calibrated observations show remarkable and spatially localized differences compared to those obtained through COSMIC-1. Most of the H-0 mismodeling for nighttime conditions can probably to be attributed to a sub-optimal spatial representation of the F2-layer peak density made by the underlying IRI model. For comparison, H-0 values obtained with non-calibrated CSES-01 and Swarm B N-e observations are also calculated and discussed. The methodology developed in this study for the topside effective scale height modeling turns out to be applicable not only to CSES-01 satellite data but to any in situ N-e observation by low-Earth-orbit satellites orbiting in the topside ionosphere.

TI  - Assessing the Magnitude of the Amazonian Forest Blowdowns and Post-Disturbance Recovery Using Landsat-8 and Time Series of PlanetScope Satellite Constellation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Blowdown events are a major natural disturbance in the central Amazon Forest, but their impact and subsequent vegetation recovery have been poorly understood. This study aimed to track post-disturbance regeneration after blowdown events in the Amazon Forest. We analyzed 45 blowdown sites identified after September 2020 at Amazonas, Mato Grosso, and Colombia jurisdictions using Landsat-8 and PlanetScope NICFI satellite imagery. Non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), green vegetation (GV), and shade fractions were calculated for each image and sensor using spectral mixture analysis in Google Earth Engine. The results showed that PlanetScope NICFI data provided more regular and higher-spatial-resolution observations of blowdown areas than Landsat-8, allowing for more accurate characterization of post-disturbance vegetation recovery. Specifically, NICFI data indicated that just four months after the blowdown event, nearly half of & UDelta;NPV, which represents the difference between the NPV after blowdown and the NPV before blowdown, had disappeared. & UDelta;NPV and GV values recovered to pre-blowdown levels after approximately 15 months of regeneration. Our findings highlight that the precise timing of blowdown detection has huge implications on quantification of the magnitude of damage. Landsat data may miss important changes in signal due to the difficulty of obtaining regular monthly observations. These findings provide valuable insights into vegetation recovery dynamics following blowdown events.

TI  - Ice Freeze-Up and Break-Up in Arctic Rivers Observed With Satellite L-Band Passive Microwave Data From 2010 to 2020
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The timing of ice freeze-up and break-up in the Arctic may be responding to climate change. Passive microwave remote sensing is a powerful technique for monitoring this timing. We processed low-frequency microwave time series from the European Space Agency Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission for a set of 31 satellite gauging reaches (SGRs) above 65 degrees N between 2010 and 2020 to determine timing of freeze-up and break-up and annual river ice durations. We found indication of progressive ice cover reduction over more than half of the monitored river reaches, with possibly the fastest rate occurring over northeast Russia. Some rivers in high-latitude North America experienced a slight increase in ice cover. Across the data set, we observed an average 2.2 days shift toward later ice freeze-up in autumn and an average 0.6 days shift toward earlier ice break-up in spring, resulting in an average decrease of 3.4 days in ice duration between 2010 and 2020. River reaches with the longest duration of ice cover appeared to have experienced the fastest rate of decrease. A possible reduction of the time lag between air temperature rise or fall and corresponding river ice break-up and freeze-up was also observed. Yet results on variability are carefuly interpreted given the short length of the time series (2010-2020) and the low statistical confidence rates calculated for the decadal tendency. Still outcomes are consistent with increases in global and Arctic surface air temperature. Following these time series over the next decade using passive microwave satellite sensors can monitor ice cover duration in the Arctic and will further determine temporal and regional trends.

TI  - Variations in Penile Cancer Management: Results From the Global Society of Rare Genitourinary Tumors Survey
T2  - CLINICAL GENITOURINARY CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the rarity of penile cancer, the Global Society of Rare Genitourinary Tumors (GSRGT) conducted a survey to identify the global variations in disease presentation and various aspects of its management. The results of this survey help identify research areas for multinational collaborative efforts which is a key mission of the Introduction: There is paucity of evidence and consensus on various aspects of management of penile cancer (PeCa), which is intuitive considering the rarity of this disease. We present here the details of an online survey conducted by the Global Society of Rare Genito-urinary Tumors (GSRGT) with the aim of capturing the variations in PeCa care across different regions of the world. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was developed by experts within the GSRGT and then circulated via email in English and Spanish versions to clinicians dealing with PeCa. Respondents were allowed 8 weeks to reply. Results: We received 102 responses; the majority of them were from South America (37.2%) followed by North America and Asia (17.6% each). Only 11.7% of the respondents treated more than 25 patients with PeCa annually. Total penectomy is performed by 21.5% of the respondents in > 50% of their patients. Less than a fifth of the experts (19.6%) responded that > 50% of their patients are clinically node-negative (cN0) at presentation. For intermediate-risk cN0 patients (T1 G2 cancer), about a third of the experts chose surveillance. For invasive inguinal staging, the options of Dynamic Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (DSNB), Modified Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection (MILD), Superficial Inguinal Lymph Node Dissection (SILD), and Video-Endoscopic Inguinal Lymphadenectomy (VEIL) were chosen by 28.4%, 26.4%, 31.3%, and 13.7% of the respondents respectively. Considerable variation was seen in the worldwide use of these techniques. For clinically node-positive patients, respondents were in favor of giving adjuvant chemotherapy instead of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, except for cN3 patients. Conclusion: The results of this questionnaire objectified the variations in global practices in the management of PeCa. This serves as the baseline information which can help pr ior itize research areas for multinational collaborative efforts, a key mission of the GSRGT.

TI  - Assessment of NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over industrial state Jharkhand, at the time frame of pre, concurrent, and post-COVID-19 lockdown along with the meteorological behaviour: an overview from satellite and ground approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Burning of fossil fuels in the form of coal or gasoline in thermal power plants, industries, and automobiles is a prime source of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a major air pollutant causing health problems. In this paper, spatio-temporal unevenness of NO2 concentrations via both spaceborne Sentinel-5P and ground-based in situ data have been studied for the period of 2017-2021. Annual and seasonal distribution of TROPOMI-NO2 depict consistency over the Jharkhand region, highlighting six hotspot regions. As compared to 2019, a notable dip of 11% in the spatial annual average TROPOMI-NO2 was achieved in 2020, which were elevated again by 22% in 2021 as the lockdown gradually goes out of the picture. Among eight ground-monitoring stations, Tata and Golmuri stations always displayed a higher level of TROPOMI-NO2 ranges up to 15.2 x10(15)molecules.cm(-2) and 16.9 x10(15)molecules.cm(-2) respectively, as being located in the highly industrialised district of Jamshedpur. A big percentage reduction of up to 30% in TROPOMI-NO2 has been reported in Jharia and Bastacola stations in Dhanbad in the lockdown phase of 2020 compared to 2019. Good agreement between TROPOMI-NO2 and surface-NO2 has been achieved with R = 0.8 and R = 0.71 during winter and post-monsoon respectively. Among four meteorological parameters, TROPOMI-NO2 was majorly found to be influenced by precipitation, having R = 0.6-0.8 for almost all stations. More advanced satellite algorithms and ground-based data may be used to estimate NO2 in places where monitoring facilities are limited and thus can help in air pollution control policy.

TI  - Methane Concentration Forecasting Based on Sentinel-5P Products and Recurrent Neural Networks
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase in the concentration of geological gas emissions in the atmosphere and particularly the increase of methane is considered by the majority of the scientific community as the main cause of global climate change. The main reasons that place methane at the center of interest, lie in its high global warming potential (GWP) and its lifetime in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic processes, like engineering geology ones, highly affect the daily profile of gasses in the atmosphere. Should direct measures be taken to reduce emissions of methane, immediate global warming mitigation could be achieved. Due to its significance, methane has been monitored by many space missions over the years and as of 2017 by the Sentinel-5P mission. Considering the above, we conclude that monitoring and predicting future methane concentration based on past data is of vital importance for the course of climate change over the next decades. To that end, we introduce a method exploiting state-of-the-art recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which have been proven particularly effective in regression problems, such as time-series forecasting. Aligned with the green artificial intelligence (AI) initiative, the paper at hand investigates the ability of different RNN architectures to predict future methane concentration in the most active regions of Texas, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, by using Sentinel-5P methane data and focusing on computational and complexity efficiency. We conduct several empirical studies and utilize the obtained results to conclude the most effective architecture for the specific use case, establishing a competitive prediction performance that reaches up to a 0.7578 mean squared error on the evaluation set. Yet, taking into consideration the overall efficiency of the investigated models, we conclude that the exploitation of RNN architectures with less number of layers and a restricted number of units, i.e., one recurrent layer with 8 neurons, is able to better compensate for competitive prediction performance, meanwhile sustaining lower computational complexity and execution time. Finally, we compare RNN models against deep neural networks along with the well-established support vector regression, clearly highlighting the supremacy of the recurrent ones, as well as discuss future extensions of the introduced work.

TI  - Implementation of the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline: Estimating State-Level Increases in Call Demand Costs and Financing
T2  - JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH POLICY AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th NIMH Mental Health Services Research (MHSR) Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Background: Per federal law, "988" became the new three-digit dialing code for the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline on July 16, 2022 (previously reached by dialing "1-800-283-TALK").Aims of the Study: This study aimed to produce state-level estimates of: (i) annual increases in 988 Lifeline call volume following 988 implementation, (ii) the cost of these increases, and (iii) the ex-tent to which state and federal funding earmarked for increases in 988 Lifeline call volume are sufficient to meet call demand.Method: A 50 state pre-post policy implementation design was used. State-level Lifeline call volume data were obtained. For each state, we calculated the absolute difference in number of Lifeline calls in the four-month periods between August-November 2021 (pre-988 implementation) and August-November 2022 (post-988 implemen-tation), and also expressed this difference as percent change and rate per 100,000 population. The difference call volume was multiplied by a published estimate of the cost of a single 988 Lifeline call ($82), and then by multiplied by three to produce annual, 12-month state-level cost increase estimates. These figures were then divided by each state's population size to generate cost estimates per state resident. State-level information on the amount of state (FY 2023) and federal SAMHSA (FY 2022) funding earmarked for 988 Life-line centers in response to 988 implementation were obtained from legal databases and government websites and expressed as dollars per state resident. State-level differences between per state resident estimates of increased cost and funding were calculated to assess the extent to which state and federal funding earmarked for increases in 988 Lifeline call volume were sufficient to meet call demand.Results: 988 Lifeline call volume increased in all states post-988 implementation (within-state mean percent change = +32.8%, SD = +20.5%). The total estimated cost needed annually to accom-modate increases in 988 Lifeline call volume nationally was approx-imately $46 million. The within-state mean estimate of additional cost per state resident was +$0.16 (SD = +$0.11). The additional annual cost per state resident exceeded $0.40 in three states, was between $0.40-$0.30 in three states, and between $0.30-$0.20 in seven states. Twenty-two states earmarked FY 2023 appropriations for 988 Lifeline centers in response to 988 (within-state mean per state resident = $1.51, SD = $1.52) and 49 states received SAMHSA 988 capacity building grants (within-state mean per state resident = $0.36, SD = $0.39). State funding increases exceeded the estimated cost increases in about half of states.Conclusions: The Lifeline's transition to 988 increased 988 Lifeline call volume in all states, but the magnitude of the increase and asso-ciated cost was heterogenous across states. State funding earmarked for increases in 988 Lifeline center costs is sufficient in about half of states. Sustained federal funding, and/or increases in state funding, earmarked for 988 Lifeline centers is likely important to ensuring that 988 Lifeline centers have the capacity to meet call demand in the post-988 implementation environment.

TI  - Determination of the Stability of a High and Steep Highway Slope in a Basalt Area Based on Iron Staining Anomalies
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, geological disasters have frequently occurred on basarlt highway slopes. Studying the stability of highway slopes in this type of area is of great significance for traffic safety. However, due to the high cost and low efficiency of traditional monitoring and experimental methods for slope engineering, these methods are not conducive to the quick and comprehensive identification of regional slope stability. Due to the high iron content of basalt, iron staining anomalies in the ore prospecting field are reinterpreted from an engineering perspective in this study. Taking the S3K section of a highway in Changbai County, China, as an example, Landsat8 remote sensing (RS) images from 2014, 2016, 2018, 2020, and 2021 are selected, and principal component analysis is used to extract iron staining anomalies in the region. Combined with field investigation and evidence collection, the corresponding rock mass fragmentation is distinguished via iron staining anomalies. Then, according to previous research results, eight indexes including annual rainfall, slope, topographic relief, surface roughness, vegetation index, leaf area index (LAI), root depth of vegetation, and human activity intensity are selected for investigation. The artificial neural network-cellular automata (ANN-CA) model is established, and the rock fragmentation classification data obtained based on iron staining anomalies are used to simulate the area. Next, the calculation formula of slope stability is determined based on the simulation results, and the stability of a high and steep slope in the area is calculated and analyzed. Finally, a comparison with an actual field investigation shows that the effect of the proposed method is good. The research findings reveal that it is feasible to judge the stability of a high and steep slope in a basalt area via the use of iron staining anomalies as an indicator. The findings are tantamount to expanding the application scope of RS in practical engineering.

TI  - Spatial Network of Thermal Environment in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration Based on MSPA and Circuit Theory
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization has increased the complexity of the urban heat environment system, which has negative impacts on the health of the urban ecological system and the human habitat. By combining theories and technologies such as geographic information systems, remote sensing, morphological spatial pattern analysis, and circuit theory with data from MODIS land surface temperature production, urban heat island patches in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration were quantitatively identified in terms of their spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and their spatial and temporal transfer paths. This foundation revealed the geographical network structure of the urban heat environment as well as the spatial and temporal evolution process of critical corridors. According to the findings, urban heat island patches covered 16610 km2 in 2020, accounting for 7.68% of the study area. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, both the area and the number of urban heat island patches considerably increased between 2005 and 2020, going from being dominated by isolated island types of urban heat island patches in 2005 to being dominated by core types in 2020. In particular, the non-urban heat island patches, core type, and edge type of urban heat island patches in 2005 were the major ancestors of the core type and edge type urban heat island patches in 2020. In the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration, there were more urban heat environment source sites, corridor length, densities, and present densities in 2020 than there were in 2005. The sensitive corridor was found to be the predominant type of urban heat island corridor in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration in 2020. The number of sensitive corridors increased the highest in the period from 2005-2020. As the coefficient of urban heat environment corridors increased concurrently, it was apparent that the urban heat environment corridor had a propensity to grow continuously in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration. The active adaptation and mitigation measures of the urban heat environment were proposed, and a spatial network model of the urban heat environment was finally provided. To adapt to, mitigate, and promote urban sustainable development risks, these research findings will serve as a paradigm for the identification of the urban heat environment spatial network actively and methodically.

TI  - First Experience with Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Data for Urban Dominant Tree Species Classification in Shenzhen, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate spatial distribution map of the urban dominant tree species is crucial for evaluating the ecosystem service value of urban forests and formulating urban sustainable development strategies. Spaceborne hyperspectral remote sensing has been utilized to distinguish tree species, but these hyperspectral data have a low spatial resolution (pixel size & GE; 30 m), which limits their ability to differentiate tree species in urban areas characterized by fragmented patches and robust spatial heterogeneity. Zhuhai-1 is a new hyperspectral satellite sensor with a higher spatial resolution of 10 m. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery for classifying the urban dominant tree species. We first extracted 32 reflectance bands and 18 vegetation indices from Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral data. We then used the random forest classifier to differentiate 28 dominant tree species in Shenzhen based on these hyperspectral features. Finally, we analyzed the effects of the classification paradigm, classifier, and species number on the classification accuracy. We found that combining the hyperspectral reflectance bands and vegetation indices could effectively distinguish the 28 dominant tree species in Shenzhen, obtaining an overall accuracy of 76.8%. Sensitivity analysis results indicated that the pixel-based classification paradigm was slightly superior to the object-based paradigm. The random forest classifier proved to be the optimal classifier for distinguishing tree species using Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery. Moreover, reducing the species number could slowly improve the classification accuracy. These findings suggest that Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral data can identify the urban dominant tree species with accuracy and holds potential for application in other cities.

TI  - Deep-Learning-Based Rice Phenological Stage Recognition
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop phenology is an important attribute of crops, not only reflecting the growth and development of crops, but also affecting crop yield. By observing the phenological stages, agricultural production losses can be reduced and corresponding systems and plans can be formulated according to their changes, having guiding significance for agricultural production activities. Traditionally, crop phenological stages are determined mainly by manual analysis of remote sensing data collected by UAVs, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may lead to data loss. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes a deep-learning-based method for rice phenological stage recognition. Firstly, we use a weather station equipped with RGB cameras to collect image data of the whole life cycle of rice and build a dataset. Secondly, we use object detection technology to clean the dataset and divide it into six subsets. Finally, we use ResNet-50 as the backbone network to extract spatial feature information from image data and achieve accurate recognition of six rice phenological stages, including seedling, tillering, booting jointing, heading flowering, grain filling, and maturity. Compared with the existing solutions, our method guarantees long-term, continuous, and accurate phenology monitoring. The experimental results show that our method can achieve an accuracy of around 87.33%, providing a new research direction for crop phenological stage recognition.

TI  - Spatial-temporal changes of air pollution in Lanzhou during the outbreak of COVID-19
T2  - Huanjing Huaxue-Environmental Chemistry
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2020, the Corona Virus Disease 2019(COVID-19) swept the world. The Chinese government has adopted a series of policies and measures for pandemic prevention and control, which further reduced the discharge of air pollutants. This special period provides a good opportunity for studying the impact of human activities on air pollution. Based on the in situ Data, satellite remote sensing data and meteorological data, this paper analyzed the change of air pollutant concentration in Lanzhou during this period from the perspective of time and space. The Pearson correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the correlations among 6 kinds of air pollutants and the correlation between these pollutants and the meteorological factors. In addition, the variation of air pollutant concentration during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Lanzhou in October 2021 was analyzed and compared with the situation in 2020. The results show that :(1) in 2020, the concentration of NO2, CO, PM2.5 and SO2 decreased significantly. Especially for the concentration of PM2.5, it dropped by 20.5%, which was followed by the decrease of NO2 and CO concentration that mostly distributed in urban areas with dense population. (2) Compared with the situation of the same period in previous years, the concentration of SO2 decreased by 26.8%, which was greatly affected by industry. (3) CO, NO2 and SO2 presents strongly correlation with each other, and their variation trends are consistent. The change of NO2 and SO2 concentration affects the concentration of PM2.5. In addition, O3 is negatively correlated with the other 5 kinds of air pollutants. When the concentration of the other 5 pollutants increases, the solar radiation decreases, which restrains the concentration of O3. (4) The meteorological factors also affect the concentration of these air pollutants. Temperature is negatively correlated with the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO, and presents strongly positively correlation with the concentration of O3. Humidity is negatively correlated with all these air pollutants. Wind speed is negatively correlated with the concentration of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO, and positively correlated with O3 concentration. However, when wind speed is too high, the concentration of O3 also decreases. (5) During the outbreak of COVID-19 in October 2021, the concentration of NO2 and CO decreased significantly, and the PM2.5 concentration was also affected. However, the concentration of PM10 and O3 presented little change. SO2 concentration was not affected significantly, since factories were still working.

TI  - Flood cascading on critical infrastructure with climate change: A spatial analysis of the extreme weather event in Xinxiang, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods caused by extreme weather events and climate change have increased in occurrence and severity all over the world, resulting in devastation and disruption of activities. Researchers and policy practitioners have increasingly paid attention to the role of critical infrastructure (CI) in disaster risk reduction, flood resilience and climate change adaptation in terms of its backbone functions in maintaining societal services in hazard attacks. The analysed city in this study, Xinxiang (Henan province, China), was affected by an extreme flood event that occurred on 17-23 July 2021, which caused great socio-economic losses. However, few studies have focused on medium-sized cities and the flood cascading effects on CI during this event. Therefore, this study explores the damages caused by this flooding event with links to CI, such as health services, energy supply stations, shelters and transport facilities (HEST infrastructure). To achieve this, the study first combines RGB (red, green blue) composition and supervised classification for flood detection to monitor and map flood inundation areas. Second, it manages a multiscenario simulation and evaluates the cascading effects on HEST infrastructure. Diverse open-source data are employed, including Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and Landsat-8 OIL data, point-of-interest (POI) and OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. The study reveals that this extreme flood event has profoundly affected croplands and villagers. Due to the revisiting period of Sentinel-1 SAR data, four scenarios are simulated to portray the retreated but 'omitted' floodwater: Scenario 0 is the flood inundation area on 27 July, and Scenarios 1, 2 and 3 are built based on this information with a buffer of 50, 100 and 150 m outwards, respectively. In the four scenarios, as the inundation areas expand, the affected HEST infrastructure becomes more clustered at the centre of the core study area, indicating that those located in the urban centre are more susceptible to flooding. Furthermore, the affected transport facilities assemble in the north and east of the core study area, implying that transport facilities located in the north and east of the core study area are more susceptible to flooding. The verification of the flood inundation maps and affected HEST infrastructure in the scenario simulation support the series method adopted in this study. The findings of this study can be used by flood managers, urban planners and other decision makers to better understand extreme historic weather events in China, improve flood resilience and decrease the negative impacts of such events on HEST infrastructure.

TI  - Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Based on Resampling Method and FR-CNN: A Case Study of Changdu
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning can extract complex and high-dimensional characteristic information with its deep structure, effectively exploring the complex relationship between landslides and their numerous influencing factors, and ultimately, more accurately predict future landslide disasters. This study builds a landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) method based on deep learning, compares the frequency ratio (FR) sampling method with a buffer random sampling method, and performs resampling operations of landslide and non-landslide samples to explore the applicability of deep learning in LSM. In addition, six indices, precision, accuracy, recall, ROC, and the harmonic mean F1 of accuracy and recall were selected for quantitative comparison. The results show that both the resampling method proposed in this paper and the non-landslide sample selection method based on FR can significantly improve the accuracy of the model, with the area under curve (AUC) increasing by 1.34-8.82% and 3.98-7.20%, respectively, and the AUC value can be improved by 5.32-9.66% by combining the FR selection and resampling methods. Furthermore, all the deep learning models constructed in this study can obtain accurate and reliable landslide susceptibility analysis results compared to traditional models.

TI  - Structural basis of mRNA binding by the human FERRY Rab5 effector complex
T2  - MOLECULAR CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - The pentameric FERRY Rab5 effector complex is a molecular link between mRNA and early endosomes in mRNA intracellular distribution. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structure of human FERRY. It reveals a unique clamp-like architecture that bears no resemblance to any known structure of Rab effectors. A com-bination of functional and mutational studies reveals that while the Fy-2 C-terminal coiled-coil acts as binding region for Fy-1/3 and Rab5, both coiled-coils and Fy-5 concur to bind mRNA. Mutations causing truncations of Fy-2 in patients with neurological disorders impair Rab5 binding or FERRY complex assembly. Thus, Fy-2 serves as a binding hub connecting all five complex subunits and mediating the binding to mRNA and early endosomes via Rab5. Our study provides mechanistic insights into long-distance mRNA transport and dem-onstrates that the particular architecture of FERRY is closely linked to a previously undescribed mode of RNA binding, involving coiled-coil domains.

TI  - Fluorescence Imaging to Identify and Preserve Fifth Intercostal Sensory Nerves during Bilateral Nipple-sparing Mastectomies
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY-GLOBAL OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of nipple-sparing mastectomies has increased steadily over the past 10-15 years. However, one major source of patient dissatisfaction with both skin- and nipple-sparing mastectomies is lost skin and/or nipple sensation postoperatively due to intraoperative, iatrogenic sensory nerve injury. We summarize the case of a 41-year-old woman with BRCA(+) breast cancer who underwent bilateral, risk-reducing nipple-sparing mastectomies, immediately followed by bilateral, direct-to-implant breast reconstruction, in whom a prototype fluorescent imaging camera was used to facilitate sensory nerve identification and preservation. Preoperatively, tactile and thermal quantitative sensory testing were performed using a 30-gauge needle to determine baseline sensory function over both breasts. Then, nipple-sparing mastectomies and direct-to-implant reconstruction were performed. Using a laterally-displaced submammary approach, the anterior intercostal artery perforator neurovascular pedicle was preserved. Then a prototype camera, which emits near-ultraviolet light, was used to detect nerve autofluorescence. Intraoperatively under near-ultraviolet light, both the fifth intercostal nerve and its sensory branches auto-fluoresced clearly, so that surgery was completed without apparent injury to the fifth intercostal nerve or any of its branches. Postoperatively, the patient reported full sensory function throughout both breasts and both nipple-areolar complexes, which was confirmed on both tactile and thermal sensory testing at 3-month follow-up. The patient experienced no complications and rated her overall satisfaction with surgery on both breasts as 10 out of 10. To our knowledge, this is the first time sensory nerve auto-fluorescence has been reported to reduce the likelihood of intraoperative, iatrogenic nerve injury and preserve sensory function.

TI  - Monitoring of drainage system and waterlogging area in the human-induced Ganges-Brahmaputra tidal delta plain of Bangladesh using MNDWI index
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Waterlogging is one of the major global problems which affects agro-economic activities around the world. In the coastal areas of Bangladesh, especially the southwestern coast, drainage congestion and waterlogging are very common which makes the area uninhabitable. Therefore, timely checking of drainage systems and surface water, and conveying data on the dynamics of drainages and surface water are important for plan and supervisory processes. The present study took an effort to illustrate the waterlogging and morphological change of the rivers in the southwestern coast of Bangladesh through the Modification Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) values which are valuable indicators for monitoring the water area and land use pattern change. Landsat images (Landsat L8 Oli TIRS, Landsat ETM+, Landsat TM) were used in the research. The study reveals that from 1989 to 2020, the shallow water area (mostly covered with rivers) decreased by (similar to)14.30 km(2) yr(-1), whereas the wet-land area (mostly covered with beels and water logging areas) increased by (similar to)67.12 km(2) yr(-1). The bare land area also increased at a rate of (similar to)36.90 km(2) yr(-1). On the other hand, the green vegetation decreased at a rate of (similar to)166.1 km(2) yr(-1), whereas the moderate green vegetation area increased by (similar to)69.77 km(2) yr(-1) for the same period. In the coastal zones of Bangladesh, the polders, embankments, upstream dams, etc., enhance more sedimentation within the channels rather than in the nearby tidal plains. As a result, the shallow water area which is mostly covered by rivers is gradually decreasing. Moreover, due to increase in wet-land areas with salinity intrusions which affect the vegetation. Therefore, the green vegetation area is regularly declining due to demolition or conversion to moderate green vegetation. The findings of the research will be supportive for coastal scientists worldwide, policy makers & planners, and finally supportive for sustainable management of the coastal areas including Bangladesh.

TI  - Respiratory syncytial virus surge in 2022 caused by lineages already present before the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2022, Austria experienced a severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemic with an earlier-than-usual start (Weeks 35/2021-45/2022) and increased numbers of pediatric patients in emergency departments. This surge came 2 years after a season with no cases detected as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 nonpharmaceutical interventions. We analyzed epidemiologic patterns and the phylodynamics of RSV based on approximately 30 800 respiratory specimens collected year-round over 10 years from ambulatory and hospitalized patients from 248 locations in Austria. Genomic surveillance and phylogenetic analysis of 186 RSV-A and 187 RSV-B partial glycoprotein sequences collected from 2018 to 2022 revealed that the 2022/2023 surge was driven by RSV-B in contrast to the surge in the 2021/2022 season that was driven by RSV-A. Whole-genome sequencing and phylodynamic analysis indicated that the RSV-B strain GB5.0.6a was the predominant genotype in the 2022/2023 season and emerged in late 2019. The results provide insight into RSV evolution and epidemiology that will be applicable to future monitoring efforts with the advent of novel vaccines and therapeutics.

TI  - NASA ICESat-2: Space-Borne LiDAR for Geological Education and Field Mapping of Aeolian Sand Dune Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites are launched frequently to monitor the Earth's dynamic surface processes. For example, the Landsat legacy has thrived for the past 50 years, spanning almost the entire application spectrum of Earth Sciences. On the other hand, fewer satellites are launched with a single specific mission to address pressing scientific questions, e.g., the study of polar icecaps and their response to climate change using Ice Cloud and the Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) program with ICESat-1 (decommissioned in 2009) and ICESat-2. ICESat-2 has been operational since 2018 and has provided unprecedented success in space-borne LiDAR technology. ICESat-2 provides exceptional details of topographies covering inland ice, snow, glaciers, land, inland waterbodies, and vegetation in three-dimensional (3D) space and time, offering the unique opportunity to quantify the Earth's surface processes. Nevertheless, ICESat-2 is not well known to some other disciplines, e.g., Geology and Geomorphology. This study, for the first time, introduces the use of ICESat-2 in aeolian sand dune studies, purely from an ICESat-2 remote sensing data perspective. Two objectives are investigated. first, a simplified approach to understanding ICESat-2 data products along with their application domains. Additionally, data processing methods and software applications are briefly explained to unify the information in a single article. Secondly, the exemplified use of ICESat-2 data in aeolian sand dune environments is analyzed compared to global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), e.g., Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM). Our investigation shows that ICESat-2 provides high-resolution topographic details in desert environments with significant improvements to the existing methods, thereby facilitating geological education and field mapping. Aeolian sand dune environments can be better understood, at present, using ICESat-2 data compared to traditional DEM-based methods.

TI  - Remote Sensing Data for Digital Soil Mapping in French Research-A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Soils are at the crossroads of many existential issues that humanity is currently facing. Soils are a finite resource that is under threat, mainly due to human pressure. There is an urgent need to map and monitor them at field, regional, and global scales in order to improve their management and prevent their degradation. This remains a challenge due to the high and often complex spatial variability inherent to soils. Over the last four decades, major research efforts in the field of pedometrics have led to the development of methods allowing to capture the complex nature of soils. As a result, digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches have been developed for quantifying soils in space and time. DSM and monitoring have become operational thanks to the harmonization of soil databases, advances in spatial modeling and machine learning, and the increasing availability of spatiotemporal covariates, including the exponential increase in freely available remote sensing (RS) data. The latter boosted research in DSM, allowing the mapping of soils at high resolution and assessing the changes through time. We present a review of the main contributions and developments of French (inter)national research, which has a long history in both RS and DSM. Thanks to the French SPOT satellite constellation that started in the early 1980s, the French RS and soil research communities have pioneered DSM using remote sensing. This review describes the data, tools, and methods using RS imagery to support the spatial predictions of a wide range of soil properties and discusses their pros and cons. The review demonstrates that RS data are frequently used in soil mapping (i) by considering them as a substitute for analytical measurements, or (ii) by considering them as covariates related to the controlling factors of soil formation and evolution. It further highlights the great potential of RS imagery to improve DSM, and provides an overview of the main challenges and prospects related to digital soil mapping and future sensors. This opens up broad prospects for the use of RS for DSM and natural resource monitoring.

TI  - Extending global river gauge records using satellite observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term, continuous, and real-time streamflow records are essential for understanding and managing freshwater resources. However, we find that 37% of publicly available global gauge records (N = 45 837) are discontinuous and 77% of gauge records do not contain real-time data. Historical periods of social upheaval are associated with declines in gauge data availability. Using river width observations from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites, we fill in missing records at 2168 gauge locations worldwide with more than 275 000 daily discharge estimates. This task is accomplished with a river width-based rating curve technique that optimizes measurement location and rating function (median relative bias = 1.4%, median Kling-Gupta efficiency = 0.46). The rating curves presented here can be used to generate near real-time discharge measurements as new satellite images are acquired, improving our capabilities for monitoring and managing river resources.

TI  - Monitoring autumn agriculture activities using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and coherence change detection
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Across Canada, farmers are encouraged to adopt beneficial management practices (BMPs) to protect soil heath, reduce green house gas emissions and mitigate off-site impacts from agriculture. Measuring the uptake of BMPs, including the implementation of conservation tillage, helps gauge the success of policies and programs to promote adoption. Satellites are one way to monitor BMP adoption and Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs) are of particular interest given their allweather data collection capability. This research investigated coherent change detection (CCD) to determine when farmers harvest and till their fields. A time series of both Sentinel-1 and RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) images was acquired over a site in the Canadian Lake Erie basin, during the autumn of 2021, when farmers were harvesting and tilling fields of corn, soybeans and wheat. 16 CCD pairs were created and coherence values were interpreted based on observations collected for 101 fields. An m-chi decomposition was applied to the RCM data, and the Volume/Surface (V/S) ratio was calculated as an additional source of information to interpret results. Change events due to harvest, tillage, autumn seeding and chemical termination resulted in coherence values below 0.20. The mean and standard deviation for fields with observed change was 0.18 & PLUSMN; 0.03. Coherence values were 0.42 & PLUSMN; 0.15 for fields where no change was noted. Tests confirmed that the coherence associated with changed and unchanged fields was significantly different. Coherence values could also differentiate between some types of management events, including tillage and harvest. CCD could also separate harvest as a function of crop type (corn or soybeans). V/S ratios declined after tillage events but increased after both harvesting and chemical termination. Narrowing the date of harvest and tillage is as important as detecting change. To meet this requirement, Sentinel-1 and RCM CCD products with values below 0.20 (indicating change had occurred), were graphically overlaid. With this approach, the timing of corn harvest was identified as occurring within a 5-day window. The tilling of corn, soybeans and wheat was narrowed to a 4-day window. The results of this research confirmed that CCD can be used to capture change due to autumn agricultural activities, and this technique can also separate change due to harvest and tillage. Finally, this study demonstrated that when data from different SAR missions are combined in a virtual constellation, timing of harvest and tillage can be more precisely defined.

TI  - New methodological approach to characterize dryland′s ecohydrological functionality on the basis of Balance between Connectivity and potential Water Retention Capacity (BalanCR)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY AND HYDROMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands are ecohydrologically-coupled ecosystems whose functioning depends on the interplay between hydrological connectivity between runoff source areas and the capacity of vegetation to retain water fluxes and associated resources. In this study we present a new easily applicable methodology for the ecohydrological characterization of dryland ecosystem functioning grounded in the balance between these two strongly interrelated processes using easily obtainable remote sensing data (e.g. UAV and SENTINEL-2 images), the BalanCR method (Balance between Connectivity and potential Water Retention Capacity). This methodology was first tested on synthetic hillslopes representing different configurations of the patchy and heterogenic distribution of vegetation in drylands. The analysis of these synthetic vegetation spatial patterns involving different vegetation patch densities, sizes, and fractional coverage values showed that BalanCR properly characterizes the expected ecohydrological interactions between potential conditions of runoff connectivity and water retention by plants operating in drylands. In a second step, we applied the BalanCR method on four semiarid hillslopes along an altitudinal aridity gradient covered by Mediterranean alpha steppes at very detailed spatial resolution (0.2 m) and at medium resolution (10 m). The obtained results were validated based on soil moisture data and vegetation greening and clearly recognized the four study sites as functional ecosystems, with very low water resource losses, and a pattern of increasing water redistribution processes as vegetation coverage declines. However, the sensitivity of methodology depends on the resolution of the input data (vegetation map and Digital Elevation Model; DEM), and the expected positive effect of small vegetation structures (vegetation patches smaller than the pixel size) on water redistribution is underestimated. Even in this case, the functionality and connectivity of the analyzed sites is correctly characterized as ecosystems showed similar values of both components for the methodology BalanC (hydrological connectivity component) and BalanR (potential water retention capacity component) than those obtained at very detailed scale, with a similar pattern of water allocation values in response to increased aridity. Thus, the proposed metric represents a promising tool for the proper evaluation of dryland conditions and to incorporate hillslope processes in climate change models, which is one of the main gaps to better understand the drylands response upon ongoing climate change.

TI  - Identification of Risk Areas of Dengue Transmission in Culiacan, Mexico
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dengue is a public health problem in more than 100 countries around the world and in virtually the entire region of the Americas, including Mexico. Mosquitoes of the genus Aedes aegypti transmit dengue; its reproduction requires certain geographical, epidemiological, demographic and socioeconomic conditions. Detailed information on socioeconomic, epidemiological and entomological data is available, but detailed meteorological information is not. The objective of this study was to identify the areas of risk of dengue transmission for each month of the year based on environmental, social, entomological and epidemiological information from 2010 to 2020, in Culiacan, Mexico. LST, NDVI and NDMI were calculated from Landsat 8 satellite images with remote sensing techniques. Additional variables were human population density and overcrowding; mosquito egg density from positive ovitraps; and probable cases of dengue. A descriptive analysis of the study variables and a multiple linear regression analysis were performed to determine the significant variables. In addition, a multicriteria spatial analysis was applied through the AHP technique to identify areas at risk of dengue transmission. The results revealed that the variables NDVI, NDMI and overcrowding were not significant; however, the LST, population density, egg density per positive ovitrap and probable cases were. The highest population in the transmission risk areas was in November, and the highest transmission area was identified in October. In conclusion, it was possible to identify which of the study variables were significant; in addition, monthly maps of risk areas of dengue transmission for Culiacan were obtained. Each geographical area had its own characteristics that influenced, in one way or another, the incidence of dengue, highlighting that the strategies for control of dengue must be specific to each region.

TI  - Fertility-Sparing Treatment for Early-Stage Cervical Cancer ≥ 2 cm: Can One Still Effectively Become a Mother? A Systematic Review of Fertility Outcomes
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundFertility-sparing treatments (FSTs) have played a crucial role in the management of early-stage cervical cancer (ECC); however, there is currently no standard of care for women with ECC >= 2 cm who wish to preserve their fertility. The current orientation of the scientific community comprises upfront surgical techniques and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by minor surgery such us conization. However these approaches are not standardized. This systematic review aimed to collect the evidence in the literature regarding the obstetric outcomes of the different techniques for applying FSTs in ECC >= 2 cm.MethodsA systematic review was performed in September 2022 using the Pubmed and Scopus databases, from the date of the first publication. We included all studies containing data regarding pregnancy, birth, and preterm rates.ResultsFifteen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, and 352 patients were analyzed regarding fertility outcomes. Surgery-based FST showed the pregnancy rate (22%), birth rate (11%), and preterm rate (10%). Papers regarding FST using the NACT approach showed a pregnancy rate of 44%, with a birth rate of 45% in patients who managed to get pregnant. The preterm rate amounted to 44%, and pregnancy rates and birth rates were significantly different between the two groups (p < 0.001).ConclusionFertility preservation in patients with ECC > 2 cm is challenging. The endpoint for evaluating the best treatment should include oncological and fertility outcomes together. From this prospective, NACT followed by less radical surgery could be a reasonable compromise.

TI  - Snow parameters modeling using remote sensing techniques and HEC-HMS hydrological modeling-case study: Kan Basin
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods occur yearly, with great property and human life damage worldwide due to severe climate changes. Snow cover dominates the mountainous areas in winter. Therefore, the river discharge increases significantly in spring, when the snow melts gradually and is accompanied by rain this season. This study aims to evaluate the snow parameters such as snow cover, monthly average snow cover, and snowmelt from early winter to late summer 2020 by using the Terra satellite, MODIS sensor, and the FLDAS model to estimate the amount of water equivalent to snowmelt in the Google Earth Engine system for Kan basin in Tehran province. The hydrological model HEC-HMS was used for assessing the effect of snow parameters on the amount of Kan River discharge in this study. The land use map was extracted by using the image of the Sentinel-2 satellite to acquire more accuracy in this study. Finally, Sentinel-1 radar images were used to evaluate the effect of flood on the area and monitor the changes.

TI  - A Literature Review of Geographical Information Systems Applications in UNESCO Global Geoparks
T2  - GEOHERITAGE
M3  - Review
AB  - The UNESCO Global Geoparks (UGGps) are territories that promote sustainable development through a territorial management plan focused on education, conservation, and local development. On this scope, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) could be an asset for the spatial planning required in the UGGps. Considering that the UGGps label is recent, a systematic literature review (SLR) about the application of GIS in UGGps can provide a baseline of opportunities for the current and potential utilization of GIS in management plans and spatial planning processes of these territories. The systematic literature review was on the following databases: Dimensions, RCAAP, Redalyc, SciELO, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science. Found 101 publications, and after different selection criteria, 32 publications were selected for the SLR. After the initial review, the characteristics and attributes of these publications were identified and described. This included the type and journal publication, the year, the geographic location of the studied area, the main keywords, and methods and tools used for the spatial analysis or planning in the UNESCO Global Geoparks and aspiring territories. Additionally, the countries with more developed work on these topics were Italy, Indonesia, and China. Majority of the papers referred to the use of GIS on land use, the processing of satellite data, and geomorphological mapping. This SLR exposed that these works are recent and still incipient. In this sense, the opportunities to apply geographic technologies to UGGps had enormous and vast potential. Together with this, applications implemented in UGGps for the improvement, adaptation, and actualization of the spatial planning and management of the territory can be the application of participative mapping strategies. This will help understand the dynamics, evolution, and transformation of the UGGps territories, permitting the action on the needs, issues, and requirements through community knowledge and citizen science. Bringing local communities closer to the management structures of the territories and involving them in the processes.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning and Neural Networks to Predict the Yield of Cereals, Legumes, Oilseeds and Forage Crops in Kazakhstan
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides an overview of the accuracy of various yield forecasting algorithms and offers a detailed explanation of the models and machine learning algorithms that are required for crop yield forecasting. A unified crop yield forecasting methodology is developed, which can be adjusted by adding new indicators and extensions. The proposed methodology is based on remote sensing data taken from free sources. Experiments were carried out on crops of cereals, legumes, oilseeds and forage crops in eastern Kazakhstan. Data on agricultural lands of the experimental farms were obtained using processed images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites (EO Browser) for the period of 2017-2022. In total, a dataset of 1600 indicators was collected with NDVI and MSAVI indices recorded at a frequency of once a week. Based on the results of this work, it is found that yields can be predicted from NDVI vegetation index data and meteorological data on average temperature, surface soil moisture and wind speed. A machine learning programming language can calculate the relationship between these indicators and build a neural network that predicts yield. The neural network produces predictions based on the constructed data weights, which are corrected using activation function algorithms. As a result of the research, the functions with the highest prediction accuracy during vegetative development for all crops presented in this paper are multi-layer perceptron, with a prediction accuracy of 66% to 99% (85% on average), and polynomial regression, with a prediction accuracy of 63% to 98% (82% on average). Thus, it is shown that the use of machine learning and neural networks for crop yield prediction has advantages over other mathematical modelling techniques. The use of machine learning (neural network) technologies makes it possible to predict crop yields on the basis of relevant data. The individual approach of machine learning to each crop allows for the determination of the optimal learning algorithms to obtain accurate predictions.

TI  - Intra- and interspecific variation in spectral properties of dominant <i>Sphagnum</i> moss species in boreal peatlands
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal peatlands store similar to 25 % of global soil organic carbon and host many endangered species; however, they face degradation due to climate change and anthropogenic drainage. In boreal peatlands, vegetation indicates ecohydrological conditions of the ecosystem. Applying remote sensing would enable spatially and temporally continuous monitoring of peatland vegetation. New multi- and hyperspectral satellite data offer promising approaches for understanding the spectral properties of peatland vegetation at high temporal and spectral resolutions. However, using spectral satellite data to their fullest potential requires detailed spectral analyses of dominant species in peatlands. A dominant feature of peatland vegetation is the genus Sphagnum mosses. We investigated how the reflectance spectra of common boreal Sphagnum mosses, collected from waterlogged natural conditions after snowmelt, change when the mosses are desiccated. We conducted a laboratory experiment where the reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) and the mass of 90 moss samples (representing nine species) were measured repetitively. Furthermore, we examined (i) their inter- and intraspecific spectral differences and (ii) whether the species or their respective habitats could be identified based on their spectral signatures in varying states of drying. Our findings show that the most informative spectral regions to retrieve information about the Sphagnum species and their state of desiccation are in the shortwave infrared region. Furthermore, the visible and near-infrared spectral regions contain less information on species and moisture content. Our results also indicate that hyperspectral data can, to a limited extent, be used to separate mosses belonging to meso- and ombrotrophic habitats. Overall, this study demonstrates the importance of including data especially from the shortwave infrared region (1100-2500 nm) in remote sensing applications of boreal peatlands. The spectral library of Sphagnum mosses collected in this study is available as open data and can be used to develop new methods for remote monitoring of boreal peatlands.

TI  - Autonomous UAS-based Water Fluorescence Mapping and Targeted Sampling
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT & ROBOTIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (UAS) are increasingly used in time-consuming and effort-heavy scientific exploration applications. One such application is the inspection of the physical, chemical, and biological properties of water in aquatic ecosystems. This paper presents a novel autonomous UAS capable of sensing water properties and collecting up to three 250 mL water samples from multiple sampling locations. The system features a customized UAS with an in-house built fluorescence sensor and pumping mechanism. The system does in situ fluorescence measurements to map the gradient of fluorescent content across the body of water and determine the best sampling spot for targeted sampling. To ensure safe near-water operation, multiple sensor fusion with an Extended Kalman Filter has been implemented for accurate altitude estimation within 1.5 m from the water surface. To validate the performance of the system, we present experimental results from deployment in two different water ecosystems, namely the Congaree River, SC and Lake Wateree, SC.

TI  - Mammalian Roadkill in a Semi-Arid Region of Brazil: Species, Landscape Patterns, Seasonality, and Hotspots
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Roadkill is one of the principal causes of the loss of biodiversity around the world. The effects of roads on mammals are still poorly understood in regions with a semi-arid climate, where many knowledge gaps persist. The present study provides an inventory of the mammalian species affected on highways in northeastern Brazil, as well as identifying roadkill hotspots and contributing to the understanding of how seasonality and the landscape may influence the roadkill patterns of wild mammals. A total of 6192.52 km of road were sampled in 53 field surveys conducted between 2013 and 2017. Landsat 8 satellite images and data from the MapBiomas platform were used to classify land use and cover for analysis. Buffers of 1 km, 5 km, and 10 km were created around the study roads to identify the landscape variables associated with roadkill events. Ripley's 2D K-Statistics and the 2D HotSpot test were used to identify roadkill aggregations and hotspots; GLMMs were generated for the landscape variables and evaluated using the Akaike Information Criterion. The Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to investigate the potential effects of seasonality. A total of 527 wild animal carcasses were recorded as a result of vehicular collision. The species with the highest roadkill records were Cerdocyon thous, Euphractus sexcinctus, and Procyon cancrivorus, while two species-Leopardus emiliae and Herpailurus yagouaroundi-are considered to be under threat of extinction. For mammals in general, the best GLMM indicated an increase in roadkills with increasing density of local vegetation areas, and a decrease as urban areas increased. The model also found that the mammals were less impacted in the vicinity of a protected area. In the specific case of C. thous, the roadkill rate was lower when urban infrastructure was more common than dense vegetation; the rate increased as areas of dense vegetation increased. In the case of P. cancrivorus and E. sexcinctus, the best models of roadkill patterns included an area of exposed soil and sparse vegetation, respectively. Roadkill rates were higher in the rainy season for all the mammals, with the exception of C. thous. These results reflect the ecological characteristics of the species with the highest roadkill rates. The findings of the present study raise concerns with regard to the impact of highways on the populations of C. thous, as well as the region's most threatened species. They also indicate the potential functionality of the local protected area, as well as identifying roadkill hotspots, which will support the development of effective mitigation measures.

TI  - Growth Monitoring and Yield Estimation of Maize Plant Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in a Hilly Region
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 66% of the Nepalese population has been actively dependent on agriculture for their day-to-day living. Maize is the largest cereal crop in Nepal, both in terms of production and cultivated area in the hilly and mountainous regions of Nepal. The traditional ground-based method for growth monitoring and yield estimation of maize plant is time consuming, especially when measuring large areas, and may not provide a comprehensive view of the entire crop. Estimation of yield can be performed using remote sensing technology such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), which is a rapid method for large area examination, providing detailed data on plant growth and yield estimation. This research paper aims to explore the capability of UAVs for plant growth monitoring and yield estimation in mountainous terrain. A multi-rotor UAV with a multi-spectral camera was used to obtain canopy spectral information of maize in five different stages of the maize plant life cycle. The images taken from the UAV were processed to obtain the result of the orthomosaic and the Digital Surface Model (DSM). The crop yield was estimated using different parameters such as Plant Height, Vegetation Indices, and biomass. A relationship was established in each sub-plot which was further used to calculate the yield of an individual plot. The estimated yield obtained from the model was validated against the ground-measured yield through statistical tests. A comparison of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) indicators of a Sentinel image was performed. GRVI was found to be the most important parameter and NDVI was found to be the least important parameter for yield determination besides their spatial resolution in a hilly region.

TI  - Comparison of West Nile Virus Disease in Humans and Horses: Exploiting Similarities for Enhancing Syndromic Surveillance
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - West Nile virus (WNV) neuroinvasive disease threatens the health and well-being of horses and humans worldwide. Disease in horses and humans is remarkably similar. The occurrence of WNV disease in these mammalian hosts has geographic overlap with shared macroscale and microscale drivers of risk. Importantly, intrahost virus dynamics, the evolution of the antibody response, and clinicopathology are similar. The goal of this review is to provide a comparison of WNV infection in humans and horses and to identify similarities that can be exploited to enhance surveillance methods for the early detection of WNV neuroinvasive disease.

TI  - Tipping Bucket Rain Gauges in Hydrological Research: Summary on Measurement Uncertainties, Calibration, and Error Reduction Strategies
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Tipping bucket rain gauges (TBRs) continue to be one of the most widely used pieces of equipment for rainfall monitoring; they are frequently used for the calibration, validation, and downscaling of radar and remote sensing data, due to their major advantages-low cost, simplicity and low-energy consumption. Thus, many works have focused and continue to focus on their main disadvantage-measurement biases (mainly in wind and mechanical underestimations). However, despite arduous scientific effort, calibration methodologies are not frequently implemented by monitoring networks' operators or data users, propagating bias in databases and in the different applications of such data, causing uncertainty in the modeling, management, and forecasting in hydrological research, mainly due to a lack of knowledge. Within this context, this work presents a review of the scientific advances in TBR measurement uncertainties, calibration, and error reduction strategies from a hydrological point of view, by describing different rainfall monitoring techniques, summarizing TBR measurement uncertainties, focusing on calibration and error reduction strategies, discussing the state of the art and providing future perspectives of the technology.

TI  - AgriSen-COG, a Multicountry, Multitemporal Large-Scale Sentinel-2 Benchmark Dataset for Crop Mapping Using Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing volume of collected Earth observation (EO) data, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become state-of-the-art in processing and analyzing them. However, there is still a lack of high-quality, large-scale EO datasets for training robust networks. This paper presents AgriSen-COG, a large-scale benchmark dataset for crop type mapping based on Sentinel-2 data. AgriSen-COG deals with the challenges of remote sensing (RS) datasets. First, it includes data from five different European countries (Austria, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, and the Netherlands), targeting the problem of domain adaptation. Second, it is multitemporal and multiyear (2019-2020), therefore enabling analysis based on the growth of crops in time and yearly variability. Third, AgriSen-COG includes an anomaly detection preprocessing step, which reduces the amount of mislabeled information. AgriSen-COG comprises 6,972,485 parcels, making it the most extensive available dataset for crop type mapping. It includes two types of data: pixel-level data and parcel aggregated information. By carrying this out, we target two computer vision (CV) problems: semantic segmentation and classification. To establish the validity of the proposed dataset, we conducted several experiments using state-of-the-art deep-learning models for temporal semantic segmentation with pixel-level data (U-Net and ConvStar networks) and time-series classification with parcel aggregated information (LSTM, Transformer, TempCNN networks). The most popular models (U-Net and LSTM) achieve the best performance in the Belgium region, with a weighted F1 score of 0.956 (U-Net) and 0.918 (LSTM).The proposed data are distributed as a cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG), together with a SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC), which makes AgriSen-COG a findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) dataset.

TI  - Epidemiology of Salmonellosis Among Infants in the United States: 1968-2015
T2  - PEDIATRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Describe characteristics of gastroenteritis, bacteremia, and meningitis caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella among US infants. METHODS: We analyze national surveillance data during 1968-2015 and active, sentinel surveillance data during 1996-2015 for culture-confirmed Salmonella infections by syndrome, year, serotype, age, and race. RESULTS: During 1968-2015, 190 627 culture-confirmed Salmonella infections among infants were reported, including 165 236 (86.7%) cases of gastroenteritis, 6767 (3.5%) bacteremia, 371 (0.2%) meningitis, and 18 253 (9.7%) with other or unknown specimen sources. Incidence increased during the late 1970s-1980s, declined during the 1990s-early 2000s, and has gradually increased since the mid-2000s. Infants' median age was 4 months for gastroenteritis and bacteremia and 2 months for meningitis. The most frequently reported serotypes were Typhimurium (35 468; 22%) for gastroenteritis and Heidelberg for bacteremia (1954; 29%) and meningitis (65; 18%). During 1996-2015 in sentinel site surveillance, median annual incidence of gastroenteritis was 120, bacteremia 6.2, and meningitis 0.25 per 100 000 infants. Boys had a higher incidence of each syndrome than girls in both surveillance systems, but most differences were not statistically significant. Overall, hospitalization and fatality rates were 26% and 0.1% for gastroenteritis, 70% and 1.6% for bacteremia, and 96% and 4% for meningitis. During 2004-2015, invasive salmonellosis incidence was higher for Black (incident rate ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-2.8) and Asian (incident rate ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.7-1.8) than white infants. CONCLUSIONS: Salmonellosis causes substantial infant morbidity and mortality; serotype heidelberg caused the most invasive infections. Infants with meningitis were younger than those with bacteremia or gastroenteritis. Research into risk factors for infection and invasive illness could inform prevention efforts.

TI  - Suspended sediment transport generated by non-hydrostatic hydrodynamics in Northern Waters of Aceh, Indonesia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended Sediment transport in the Northern Waters of Aceh is investigated in the domains between 5.4 & DEG; - 5.65 & DEG; N Latitude and 95.15 & DEG; - 95.45 & DEG; E. Therefore, this study aims to calculate the suspended sediment transport using a non-hydrostatic hydrodynamic model with an output distribution of total suspended sediment concentration. The model was run using tidal components of M2, S2, K1, O1, N2, K2, P1, Q1 and the wind every 6 h in February and August 2019 representing the North East and South West monsoons, as well as sea temperature and salinity data. The results of the model correlated with the Tide Model Driver data obtained, and the simulation results indicated the current in February 2019 is different than in August. The numerical simulation results show that the distribution of suspended sediments in Northern Waters of Aceh is driven by currents. Furthermore, the hydrodynamics and the designed model showed that the distribution value of the surface total suspended sediment concentration was lower in August than in February 2019. The verification results of the surface total suspended sediment concentration between the model and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite showed a good match. These results can facilitate the analysis of limited observation and remote sensing data.

TI  - The inequitable distribution of power interruptions during the 2021 Texas winter storm Uri
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH: INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change induced extreme weather events will increase in intensity and frequency, leading to longer and widespread electricity outages. As an example, Winter Storm Uri in Texas left over 4.5 million customers without power between 14 and 18 February 2021. The social justice consequences of these events remain an outstanding question, as outage data are, typically, only available at the county level, obscuring detailed experiences. We produce a first-of-its-kind unique spatially resolved dataset of interruptions using satellite data on nighttime lights to track blackouts at the census block group (CBG) level. Correlating this dataset with demographic data reveals that minority CBGs were 1.5-3 times more likely to suffer from interruptions compared to predominantly white CBGs, whereas income status was positively correlated with the likelihood of interruption. The presence of critical facilities-including police and fire stations, hospitals, and water treatment facilities-in a CBG reduced the chances of interruptions by around 16% , a small difference that does not otherwise explain the disparity among communities. We suggest explanations, test a subset of them, and propose further work needed to explain what drives these disparities.

TI  - Multi-scale estimation of poverty rate using night-time light imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Explicit poverty data are critical for policymaking and targeting humanitarian aid. Poverty rate is the most widely accepted definition of a poverty status. However, poverty rate data are commonly available at countrylevel. Here, we proposed an approach that estimates the poverty rate at different spatial scales with a consistent standard within a country. We first trained the model based on household survey data and publicly available remote sensing data to derive a wealth index map, and then we developed the relationship between the wealth index and the poverty rate at country-level. The relationship finally was applied to estimate the multi-spatial scale poverty rates in the study area. We made validation between the estimated and statistical province-level poverty rates using relative error and R-Square. A case study was carried out in Mozambique. The results showed that the proposed model has a good ability to estimate poverty rate with an overall accuracy of 85.21%, as well as an R-Square of 0.94. There was a huge gap within Mozambique, with the Northern Provinces holding high poverty rates and the Southern Provinces holding low poverty rates. The district-level poverty rate map might reflect the negative impact of climate disasters, as well as the positive influence of economic and trade exchange. Given that the data we use are publicly available, the proposed methodology can be applied to other countries to estimate poverty rates at various spatial scales.

TI  - Impact of DEMs for Improvement Sentinel 2 Lithological Mapping Utilizing Support Vector Machine: A Case Study of Mineralized Fe-Ti-Rich Gabbroic Rocks from the South Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - MINERALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fused remote sensing datasets have greatly contributed to enhancing lithological targets and providing significant information for mineral exploration. For instance, multispectral datasets can discriminate rock units through their unique spectral signatures. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) could be an effective tool boosting lithological discrimination based mainly on their topographic variations. Consequently, the current study applied the power of the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm and the integrated Phased Array L-type band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) DEM and multispectral Sentinel 2 data to: 1-Create an updated lithological map of a poorly mapped arid terrain (Khashir-Ras El-Kharit district, Eastern Desert of Egypt), and 2-Compare and assess the distribution of ferrogabbros with the aim of improving the localization of these rock bodies and investigating their mineral content. Our results enhanced the lithological mapping and revealed a better generalization of mineralized ferrogabbros when the input was a fused DEM with Sentinel 2 compared to the salt and pepper effect observed when adopting the Sentinel 2 solely as the input data. Additionally, the current research strongly recommends detailed exploration programs for Fe-Ti oxide ores within the gabbroic rocks delineated through the resultant thematic map. The ferrogabbros were subjected to a comprehensive analysis involving whole rock geochemistry, XRD, EDX, and light-reflecting investigations, which revealed the existence of magnetite, titanomagnetite, and hematite. The titanomagnetite crystals display subhedral morphology and exhibit fine- to medium-grained surfaces with irregular shapes. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed the presence of magnetite and hematite in the concentrated Fe-Ti oxides. Additionally, the whole rock geochemistry highlighted the origin of the ferrogabbros and their proposed tectonic setting as an alkaline to calc-alkaline magma type that developed in a continental arc setting.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 23 February 2023, an Mw 6.8 earthquake struck the border of Tajikistan and Xinjiang China, the source mechanism remains controversial according to different seismic inversions. To better comprehend the source characteristics and the surface deformation pattern, we used the ascending and descending orbital Sentinel-1A SAR data to obtain the coseismic deformation of this earthquake based on the traditional two-pass differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The source model is inverted from the InSAR coseismic deformation results. The possible Coulomb Failure Stress (CFS) transfer is analyzed based on the preferred source model. The results illustrate that the earthquake ruptured a blind left-lateral strike-slip fault of strike 28.1 & DEG; with a maximum slip of 1.53 m and the total geodetic moment is 1.99 x 10(19) N & BULL;m (Mw 6.83). The strike direction and the fault characteristics suggest the Seismogenic fault is a secondary fault of the Sarez-Karakul Fault System. The 2015 Mw 7.2 Sarez Earthquake plays a triggering role in the occurrence of the 2023 Tajikistan earthquake. Earthquake hazard on Sarez-Karakul Fault System and Sarez-Murghab Thrust System is enhanced due to the Coulomb stress loaded by the Tajikistan earthquake.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Petersburg diaries ("Blue Book,", "Black Notebooks," "Black Book," and "Gray Notepad") document the attitude of Z. N. Gippius to the events related to the historical upheavals in Russia in the early 20th century. Searching for new ideas about personal freedom and choice in the epoch of historical cataclysms, the writer asserts the principles of new spirituality allowing one withstand the great upheavals of the era and achieve true freedom, found in God as a guarantor of the harmonious personality development. This study has established that the writer solves the problems suggested in the diaries by comprehending the fate of Russia during the First World War and the February and October revolutions of 1917 and searching for new humanistic ideals. She condemns the destructive nature of the revolution that causes the loss of moral ideals. Of particular relevance to the writer is the assertion of a specific, effective and practical humanism that takes into account the moral component of human life, approves the moral way of life, and combines practical actions with a focus on the individual as the ultimate goal. For Gippius, the ideal is embodied in the Russian intelligentsia with humanistic ability to sympathy, compassion, sacrifice, and sanctity and potential to withstand the political cataclysms of Russia. The aesthetic findings of Gippius in her Petersburg diaries embrace the inclusion of various associative chains into the forms of auto-documentary literature, enrichment of particular historical images with universal symbols, and synthesis of lyrical self-expression and an epic worldview.

TI  - Genesis and spatio-temporal analysis of glacial lakes in the peri-glacial environment of Western Himalayas
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are retreating in the highest mountainous regions of the world, like Himalayan region as a result of climate change and global warming. This leads to the formation of different types of glacial lakes. These lakes are not only the source of fresh water but it also causes disaster in the form of Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF). Astore Drainage Basin is located in north eastern mountainous region of Himalayas. This area is prone to GLOFs because of the increasing number of glacial lakes and the growth of existing lakes as a result of global warming. To provide a detailed information about the spatial and temporal information of glacial lakes detailed inventories has been developed for the study area using Landsat images for the year 1989, 1999, 2009 and 2019. Glacial lakes were mapped and identified by using Normalized Different Water Index, Normalized Difference Snow Index and high-resolution Google Earth images. It was found from the analysis that the number of the glacial lakes increased from 120 to 128 in a period of thirty years (i.e., from 1989 to 2019). During the study period two lakes disappeared whereas ten new lakes were formed. There were 21 lakes which show area expansion more than 100% representing high susceptibility for GLOF. The results also showed that smaller lakes expanded more rapidly in area than the larger lakes.

TI  - Assessing the Impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on South Andaman's Coastal Shoreline: A Geospatial Analysis of Erosion and Accretion Patterns
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami significantly impacted the coastal shoreline of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, causing widespread destruction of infrastructure and ecological damage. This study aims to analyze the short- and long-term shoreline changes in South Andaman, focusing on 2004-2005 (pre- and post-tsunami) and 1990-2023 (to assess periodic changes). Using remote sensing techniques and geospatial tools such as the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS), shoreline change rates were calculated in four zones, revealing the extent of the tsunami's impact. During the pre- and post-tsunami periods, the maximum coastal erosion rate was -410.55 m/year, while the maximum accretion was 359.07 m/year in zone A, the island's east side. For the 1990-2023 period, the most significant coastal shoreline erosion rate was also recorded in zone A, which was recorded at -2.3 m/year. After analyzing the result, it can be seen that the tsunami severely affected the island's east side. To validate the coastal shoreline measurements, the root mean square error (RMSE) of Landsat-7 and Google Earth was 18.53 m, enabling comparisons of the accuracy of different models on the same dataset. The results demonstrate the extensive impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami on South Andaman's coastal shoreline and the value of analyzing shoreline changes to understand the short- and long-term consequences of such events on coastal ecosystems. This information can inform conservation efforts, management strategies, and disaster response plans to mitigate future damage and allocate resources more efficiently. By better understanding the impact of tsunamis on coastal shorelines, emergency responders, government agencies, and conservationists can develop more effective strategies to protect these fragile ecosystems and the communities that rely on them.

TI  - PARTICULARITY OF MODERN CHINESE BUSINESS CULTURE THROUGH THE PRISM OF TRADITIONAL CHINESE PHILOSOPHY (BASED ON THE TYPOLOGY OF CULTURAL DIMENSIONS OF HOFSTEDE)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a globalized world, an understanding of the national specifics of the business culture of another country, especially a culturally contrasting one, is paramount for successful joint business activities. However, this requires a deeper understanding of the socio-cultural patterns and cultural heritage of a country. In view of the ever-growing importance of the Chinese economy on the world stage, the modern business culture of mainland China deserves a particular cultural and philosophical reflection. China has a lot of its own specific characteristics, which is explained by its diverse historical and philosophical heritage, and in this article, business culture is discussed from the perspective of traditional philosophical foundations.The purpose of this article is to reveal the features of the business culture of China in the modern sociocultural space of Chinese society through the prism of ancient Chinese philosophy based on the typology of cultural dimensions of Hofstede. The Geert Hofstede's six cultural dimensions theory was chosen as a methodology for this cross-cultural analysis as the most researched and discussed.China has a rich philosophical heritage and in the patterns of business communication in China we can notice the influence of such teachings as Taoism, Buddhism, Legism and, of course, Confucianism. It is worth emphasizing that Confucianism comes to the fore when interpreting the traditions and practices of business interaction common in the modern business world of China.Based on the results of the last major study by Hofstede and Minkov, conducted in 2010, the following characteristics of Chinese business culture were identified: a pronounced distance of power (80 points out of 100), a prevailing orientation on collectivism (individualism level - 20 out of 100), an ambiguous attitude to avoid uncertainty (30 out of 100), masculinity of society (66 out of 100), focus on long-term (87 out of 100), and restraint in the pursuit of pleasures (level of indulgence - 24 out of 100). By a series of examples, it was shown that these features are connected with the philosophical worldview of the Chinese and allow us to form a common understanding of the functioning of the business environment of China.Special characteristics of business culture are deeply rooted in the cultural memory of Chinese society. According to the opinion of the author of the article, the relationship between philosophical heritage, especially Confucian, and Chinese business culture can be traced through the norms and patterns of business behavior. However, under the influence of modern sociocultural transformations, both domestic and transferred from the West, some of the foundations of Chinese business culture undergo a series of changes, and this requires a further analysis.

TI  - Analysis of the Observation Results for Preferentially Oriented Particles in High-Level Clouds According to the EARLINET Lidar Network and MODIS Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This analysis presents the results of observation episodes for high-level clouds consisting of ice crystals with different orientations in space, using the EARLINET lidar network and MODIS data over Europe from 2015 to 2022. The technique used involves identifying specular reflecting layers through ground-based laser soundings of the atmosphere and finding synchronous images from space, followed by the retrieval of cirrus cloud parameters. The study considers several properties of high-level clouds, including reflection ratio (& rho;), effective emissivity (& epsilon;), optical thickness, effective particle radius, water path, and top height, according to MODIS data. The results of retrieving these properties for cirrus clouds with different orientations of ice crystals over individual EARLINET lidar stations and over Europe as a whole are discussed. The study indicates that high-level clouds with & rho; & GE; 0.15 and & epsilon; & GE; 0.4 definitely contain specular reflecting layers.

TI  - On the Inheritance of Microbiome-Deficiency: Paediatric Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, the Immune System and the Gut-Brain Axis
T2  - GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Like the majority of non-communicable diseases that have recently gained attention, functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders (FGID) in both children and adults are caused by a variety of medical conditions. In general, while it is often thought that common conditions such as obesity may cause other problems, for example, asthma or mental health issues, more consideration needs to be given to the possibility that they could both be brought on by a single underlying problem. Based on the variations in non-communicable disease, in recent years, our group has been revisiting the exact role of the intestinal microbiome within the Vertebrata. While the metabolic products of the microbiome have a role to play in the adult, our tentative conclusion is that the fully functioning, mutualistic microbiome has a primary role: to transfer antigen information from the mother to the neonate in order to calibrate its immune system, allowing it to survive within the microbial environment into which it will emerge. Granted that the microbiome possesses such a function, logic suggests the need for a robust, flexible, mechanism allowing for the partition of nutrition in the mature animal, thus ensuring the continued existence of both the vertebrate host and microbial guest, even under potentially unfavourable conditions. It is feasible that this partition process acts by altering the rate of peristalsis following communication through the gut-brain axis. The final step of this animal-microbiota symbiosis would then be when key microbes are transferred from the female to her progeny, either live offspring or eggs. According to this scheme, each animal inherits twice, once from its parents' genetic material and once from the mother's microbiome with the aid of the father's seminal microbiome, which helps determine the expression of the parental genes. The key point is that the failure of this latter inheritance in humans leads to the distinctive manifestations of functional FGID disorders including inflammation and gut motility disturbances. Furthermore, it seems likely that the critical microbiome-gut association occurs in the first few hours of independent life, in a process that we term handshaking. Note that even if obvious disease in childhood is avoided, the underlying disorders may intrude later in youth or adulthood with immune system disruption coexisting with gut-brain axis issues such as excessive weight gain and poor mental health. In principle, investigating and perhaps supplementing the maternal microbiota provide clinicians with an unprecedented opportunity to intervene in long-term disease processes, even before the child is born.

TI  - Use of Landsat Satellite Images in the Assessment of the Variability in Ice Cover on Polish Lakes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite several decades of observations of ice cover in Polish lakes, researchers have not broadly applied satellite images to date. This paper presents a temporal and spatial analysis of the variability in the occurrence of ice cover on lakes in the Drawskie Lakeland in the hydrological years 1984-2022 based on satellite data from Landsat missions 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9. The range of occurrence of ice cover was determined based on the value of the Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and blue spectral band (rho(lambda)(blue)). The determination of ice cover extent adopted rho(lambda)(blue) values from 0.033 to 0.120 as the threshold values. The analysis covered 67 lakes with an area from 0.07 to 18.71 km(2). A total of 53 images were analysed, 14 and 39 out of which showed full and partial ice cover, respectively. The cluster analysis permitted the designation of two groups of lakes characterised by an approximate range of ice cover. The obtained results were analysed in the context of the morphometric parameters of the lakes. It was evidenced that the range of the ice cover on lakes is determined by the surface area of the lakes; their mean and maximum depth, volume, length, and width; and the height of the location above sea level. The results of analyses of the spatial range of ice cover in subsequent scenes allowed for the preparation of maps of probability of ice cover occurrence that permit the complete determination of its variability within each of the lakes. Monitoring of the spatial variability in ice cover within individual lakes as well as in reference to lakes not subject to traditional observations offers new research possibilities in many scientific disciplines focused on these ecosystems.

TI  - DLRW: Dual-Link Weight Random Walk Model for Aquaculture Boundary Extraction by Single-Polarized SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal aquaculture is undertaken in shallow and usually sheltered waters along the coast, delineated by aquaculture ponds. Illegal usage of coastal aquaculture can lead to conflicts with local communities and environmental problems. Thus, it is necessary to extract the aquaculture boundary to monitor the expansion of coastal aquaculture to the sea. However, it is challenging for most existing algorithms to extract the aquaculture boundary for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images under a high incident angle (>30 degree) with horizontal transmitted and received (HH) or vertical transmitted and received (VV) polarization. The difficulties come from the following: (1) seawater can be seen on both sides of such boundaries, (2) the contrast of such boundaries is uneven, and (3) the backscattering coefficients in some parts of such boundaries are low. In this paper, a novel dual-link weight random walk (DLRW)-based method is proposed to extract such boundaries. The proposed DLRW is composed of an automatic seed points generation strategy, and the establishment and solving of a random walk model with the dual-link weight. By a coarse-to-fine procedure, DLRW is used to extract the aquaculture boundaries in the whole imagery. Sentinel-1 and GF-3 images in Dalian and Liaodong Bay, China have been used in experiments. Mean offset (MO), root mean square error (RMSE), Overlapped, accuracy within one pixel (WOP), and accuracy within two pixels (WTP) have been used to evaluate the performance with existing methods. Experimental results have demonstrated the proposed DLRW-based method outperforms existing methods in the extraction on aquaculture boundaries. Under the low tide, the DLRW-based method is better than the other two methods with MO, RMSE, Overlapped, WOP, and WTP by at least 5.75 pixels, 10.43 pixels, 2.88%, 11.09%, and 18.04%, respectively. Under the high tide, the DLRW-based method is superior to the other two methods with MO, RMSE, and WTP by at least 3.8 pixels, 10.5 pixels, and 6.3%. In addition, the proposed DLRW-based method has a good ability to extract the shoreline with bedrock, ports, and silt. Therefore, the proposed DLRW-based method can be of great value to coastal aquaculture monitoring, coastal mapping, and other coastal applications.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Inversion of Evapotranspiration in the Lower Yangtze River Based on Landsat 8 Remote Sensing Data and Analysis of Driving Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the spatial and temporal variation patterns of surface evapotranspiration is important for understanding global climate change, promoting scientific deployment of regional water resources, and improving crop yield and water productivity. Based on Landsat 8 OIL_TIRS data and remote sensing image data of the lower Yangtze River urban cluster for the same period of 2016-2021, combined with soil and meteorological data of the study area, this paper constructed a multiple linear regression (MLR) model and an extreme learning machine (ELM) inversion model with evapotranspiration as the target and, based on the model inversion, quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed the spatial and temporal variability in surface evapotranspiration in the study area in the past six years. The results show that both models based on feature factors and spectral indices obtained a good inversion accuracy, with the fusion of feature factors effectively improving the inversion ability of the model for ET. The best model for ET in 2016, 2017, and 2021 was MLR, with an R-2 greater than 0.8; the best model for ET in 2018-2019 was ELM, with an R-2 of 0.83 and 0.62, respectively. The inter-annual ET in the study area showed a "double-peak" dynamic variation, with peaks in 2018 and 2020; the intra-annual ET showed a single-peak cycle, with peaks in July-August. Seasonal differences were obvious, and spatially high-ET areas were mainly found in rural areas north of the Yangtze River and central and western China where agricultural land is concentrated. The net solar radiation, soil heat flux, soil temperature and humidity, and fractional vegetation cover all had significant positive effects on ET, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.39 to 0.94. This study can provide methodological and scientific support for the quantitative and qualitative estimation of regional ET.

TI  - Spaceborne SAR-Based Detection of Ships in Suez Gulf to Analyze the Maritime Traffic Jam Caused Due to the Blockage of Egypt's Suez Canal
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the convenience and connectedness of the oceans in recent years, there has been an increase in naval traffic, which has prompted maritime surveillance to attract special attention due to its significant application in marine operations. Ships, because of their uneven and rugged design, appear as a brighter patch, which aids in their identification by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), an active remote sensing technique. In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets are used to detect vessels in the Gulf of Suez in order to examine the increasing maritime traffic induced by the Suez Canal blockage caused by the Ever Given ship becoming stranded in the canal on 23 March 2021 and being freed after 6 days on 29 March 2021. The usefulness of dual-pol spaceborne SAR datasets in ship detection is also determined. The analysis was performed within a time window spanning before, during, and after the blockage event. On the basis of the experimental results, Sentinel-1 images proved to be more effective compared to Sentinel-2 images for ship detection due to the all-weather capability of the Sentinel-1 dataset. Furthermore, the ship detection results obtained in dual polarization were substantially more accurate than the results obtained in a single polarization.

TI  - The impact of sentinel lymph node mapping with hybrid single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography in patients with melanoma. Comparison to planar radioisotopic lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the diagnostic value of 16 slices of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) in the anatomical localization, image interpretation and extra-sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) detection compared to dynamic and static planar radioisotopic lymphoscintigraphy (PLS) in patients with melanoma. Eighty-two patients with melanoma underwent dynamic PLS, static PLS and SPECT/CT. Data were obtained using a dual head SPECT/CT 16 slices gamma-camera. We evaluated the number and localization of SLNs detected with each imaging method. SPECT/CT demonstrated 48 additional SLNs in comparison with PLS in 29 patients. In five truncal and seven head-neck lesions, dynamic and static PLS failed to detect the SLNs found on SPECT/CT (false negative). In one case of truncal and one case of lower limb melanoma, the foci of increased activity interpreted on PLS as possible SLNs were confirmed to be non-nodal sites of uptake on SPECT/CT (false positive). PLS underestimated the number of SLNs detected, whereas SPECT/CT revealed higher agreement compared to the respective number from histological reports. SPECT/CT showed a better prediction of the number of SLNs and higher diagnostic parameters in comparison to planar imaging. SPECT/CT is an important complementary diagnostic modality to PLS, that improves detection, preoperative evaluation, anatomical landmarks of SLNs and surgical management of patients with melanoma.

TI  - Variation of Aerosol Optical Properties over Cluj-Napoca, Romania, Based on 10 Years of AERONET Data and MODIS MAIAC AOD Product
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosols play an important role in Earth's climate system, and thus long-time ground- based measurements of aerosol optical properties are useful in understanding this role. Ten years of quality-assured measurements between 2010 and 2020 are used to investigate the aerosol climatology in the Cluj-Napoca area, in North-Western Romania. In this study, we analyze the aerosol optical depth (AOD), single scattering albedo (SSA) and angstrom exponent obtained by the CIMEL sun photometer, part of the aerosol robotic network (AERONET), to extract the seasonality of aerosols in the region and investigate the aerosol climatology of the area. Higher aerosol loads are found during July and August. The angstrom exponent has the lowest values in April and May, and the highest in August. The classification of aerosols using AERONET data is performed to separate dust, biomass burning, polluted urban, marine and continental-dominant aerosol mixtures. In addition, the study presents the validation efforts of the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) dataset against AERONET AOD over a 10-year period.

TI  - Through eagle eyes-the potential of satellite-derived LAI time series to estimate masting events and tree-ring width of European beech
T2  - REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Masting is a well-known phenomenon in forest science in which trees recurrently produce exceptional high seed amounts throughout their lifespan. Occurring simultaneously across wide regions, masting may impact carbon sequestration and carbon cycling of forest ecosystems. To identify masting-induced changes in tree canopies, remote sensing methods may offer a suitable tool, though so far only few studies have used RS methods to investigate the relationship between masting and tree-ring width (TRW). Therefore, we employed a regional network of 19 European beech sites along a precipitation gradient in north-eastern Germany, providing time series of TRW (1961-2017) and categorical masting data (1992-2020). Combined with leaf area index (LAI) from the medium-resolution satellite sensors SPOT-VGT/PROBA-V and MODIS, we assessed the relationship between all three parameters by correlation analysis. Furthermore, we identified common climatic drivers and spatial masting patterns along gradients of water availability. We found negative relationships for both TRW and LAI with masting and a positive correlation for TRW with LAI for SPOT-VGT/PROBA-V data. Contrary, MODIS LAI provided no significant relationships. Water availability did not impact masting occurrence or intensity. The climate correlations showed that masting and TRW are commonly driven by summer climate in June and July, while we found no correlations between climate and LAI. We conclude that medium-resolved SPOT-VGT/PROBA-V LAI is suitable to observe masting but not to estimate TRW. Nonetheless, the results should be thoroughly interpreted in the context of uncertainties of RS measurements and complex interactions of different environmental drivers.

TI  - Toward a Holistic Pentecost Pentecostalism, Embodiment, and Social Justice
T2  - PNEUMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pentecostalism is often celebrated as a holistic or embodied spirituality that overcomes the dualisms inherent to modernity, and that juxtapose the body and the spiritual. However, historically and in the present, pentecostals struggle to address the problems of inequity and oppression that impact certain bodies in the church and the world. This article explores this tension in Classical Pentecostalism with a focus on Azusa Street and contemporary Pentecostalism in Britain. Through a case study of a "progressive" pentecostal church, I demonstrate that even in contexts that prioritize social engage-ment, the realities of class, race, and gender oppressions can continue unnamed and unchallenged. Resources may be located, I argue, in the African roots of the movement that provide an integrated worldview in which all aspects of life are considered spiri-tual and thus the oppressed are empowered to resist social, economic, and political as well as spiritual oppression.

TI  - Mercury Prediction in Urban Soils by Remote Sensing and Relief Data Using Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to explore the use of machine learning (ML) methods for mapping the distribution of mercury (Hg) content in topsoil, using the city of Ufa (Russia) and adjacent areas as an example. For this purpose, a soil dataset of 250 points sampled from a 0-20 cm depth on different land uses, including residential, industrial and undisturbed (forests and parks), was used. Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), Cubist and k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) ML techniques were employed to model and map the Hg concentrations. We used remote sensing data (RSD) and topographic attributes as explanatory variables. ML models were calibrated and validated using the leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The Hg content varied from 0.005 to 0.58 mg/kg and was characterized by very high variability. According to the MAE and RMSE metrics, the RF method resulted in the most accurate spatial prediction for the Hg content (0.029 and 0.065 mg/kg, respectively), while the XGBoost approach showed the lowest prediction efficiency (0.032 and 0.073 mg/kg, respectively). The results showed that the slope map, spectral index MSI and Sentinel-2A band B11 were the key variables in explaining the variability of Hg content. We found that higher uncertainty values of soil Hg were found in croplands, urban residential and industrial areas, which supports the view that spatial modelling of HM in urban landscapes is challenging. The present study provides insights into the potential of digital soil mapping techniques in combination with RSD and terrain variables for identifying areas at risk of Hg contamination in urban areas, which can inform land-use planning and management strategies to protect human health and the environment.

TI  - Meanings of adjectives <i>alag</i> and <i>ala</i> in the Buryat and Khakas languages (a case study of epic works)
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a comparative analysis of epic works aimed at examining the semantic structures of two adjectives, alag in Buryat and ala in Khakas. The analysis findings provide a comprehensive picture of the semantic space of the words under study. Special attention is paid to word-to-word connections in the epic language, allowing the nomination motive to be identified. This study has contributed to uncovering the new meanings of the adjective alag, namely "brilliant," "anxious," and "dulled," which are not specified in Mongolian-Russian dictionaries. The issue of the primary and secondary meanings is considered to be crucial in studying the semantic transitions within a polysemant. It is suggested that the meaning of "motley" was derived from the meaning "brilliant," referring to the predominance of light spots or stripes. The word alag is assumed to have combined with the synonyms eren "varie-gated" and sohor "motley" in the epos language after losing the supposed primary meaning "brilliant." Identifying the common meaning of "shining" in Turkic-Mongolian epic reflects the peculiarities of the national-cultural worldview of related peoples. The language representation of perceptual information is regarded as a result of the primary stage of self-knowledge, reflecting the mental-psychological and national-cultural specificity of Turkic-Mongolian people. Studying the semantic structure of the adjective alag / ala is expected to identify some general lines of the perceptual information implementation in Turkic and Mongolian languages.

TI  - Region-Based Sea Ice Mapping Using Compact Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery with Learned Features and Contextual Information
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational sea ice maps are usually generated manually using dual-polarization (DP) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery, but there is strong interest in automating this process. Recently launched satellites offer compact polarimetry (CP) imagery that provides more comprehensive polarimetric information compared to DP, which compels the use of CP for automated classification of SAR sea ice imagery. Existing sea ice scene classification algorithms using CP imagery rely on handcrafted features, while neural networks offer the potential of features that are more discriminating. We have developed a new and effective sea ice classification algorithm that leverages the nature of CP data. First, a residual-based convolutional neural network (ResCNN) is implemented to classify each pixel. In parallel, an unsupervised segmentation is performed to generate regions based on CP statistical properties. Regions are assigned a single class label by majority voting using the ResCNN output. For testing, quad-polarimetric (QP) SAR sea ice scenes from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) are used, and QP, DP, CP, and reconstructed QP modes are compared for classification accuracy, while also comparing them to other classification approaches. Using CP achieves an overall accuracy of 96.86%, which is comparable to QP (97.16%), and higher than reconstructed QP and DP data by about 2% and 10%, respectively. The implemented algorithm using CP imagery provides an improved option for automated sea ice mapping.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Safety and environmental aspects are crucial beyond production goals in the hydropower industry. By monitoring landslides associated with the construction of a hydropower dam in the Santa Cruz River in Argentine Patagonia, this paper contributes to the assessment of the project structural integrity of the construction and safety risks. Ground deformation is monitored using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data and the persistent scatterer interferometry technique, and it is contrasted with optical imagery, geological and technical reports, and fieldwork. The results include maps of accumulated deformation and deformation time series for the locations of the anchorages of the dam, providing a new and independent dataset to assess the integrity of the construction.

T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater supplies have been exploited because of global water shortage. Therefore, effective management of water resources is crucial. Identifying potential groundwater regions in arid and mountainous terrains is challenging for many developing nations because of a lack of financial and human resources. An integrated strategy using remote sensing, geographic information systems, and multi-criteria decision analysis of the hierarchical analytical process was used to identify potential zones for groundwater in the Gulufa Watershed, Blue Nile River Basin, Ethiopia, which covers 1700 km2. Nine groundwater-influencing thematic layers were produced from conventional and satellite data, including lineament density, lithology, slope, geomorphology, soil, land use/land cover, drainage density, rainfall, and elevation. Satty scale values for the thematic layers and their classes were determined based on experts' opinions and literature. Thematic maps were integrated based on their weights and rates to produce a potential zone map using ArcGIS weighted overlay spatial function tool. According to the results, the prospect zone map consists of 383 km2 of very high, 865 km2 of high, 350 km2 of moderate, 58 km2 of low, and 0.3 km2 of poor zones. Validation of the potential zone map using existing boreholes yielded a close agreement, demonstrating the method's accuracy. According to the map removal sensitivity analysis results, the potential zone was more sensitive to lithology than other thematic layers. The map created in the research region can be an essential reference for identifying potential locations for additional groundwater resource exploration, planning, and management.

TI  - Monitoring land subsidence by time series InSAR and wavelet analysis of seasonal deformation in Taiyuan Basin
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater overexploitation has been lasted for decades in Taiyuan Basin, causing the regional groundwater level to decline, which has been resulting in serious land subsidence. The temporal and spatial evolution of land subsidence has a strong correlation with the dynamic evolution of groundwater level. In this paper, we processed Sentinel-1 satellite data from 2015 to 2020 by SBAS-InSAR algorithm to investigate the surface deformation in Taiyuan Basin. A seasonal deformation model was used to separate the linear trend and the seasonal periodic signal in the deformation time series. Based on the wavelet analysis method, the periodic evolution characteristics of surface subsidence and groundwater level, and their time-lag relationships were quantitatively analyzed. We found that: (1) land subsidence mainly occurred in the central part of Taiyuan Basin (Xiaodian Qingxu Jiaocheng Qixian Taigu area, with a maximum rate up to -70. 0 mm . a (1)), in the western part (Qingxu Jiaocheng area, with a maximum rate up to -63. 4 mm . a (1)) and in the southern part (Xiaoyi Jiexiu area, with a maximum rate up to -72. 2 mm . a (1)); (2) due to the implementation of a series of water management practices such as closing wells and the Wanjiazhai Water Diversion project, groundwater level in Taiyuan City has been rising, the land has reversed from subsidence to uplift, with an overall uplift rate about 9 mm . a (1); (3) the surface deformation in the central part of Taiyuan Basin (Qingxu Qixian Taigu area) presented an obvious "subsidence-rebound" periodic variation following with the seasonal "drainage-recharge" behavior of the groundwater level variations; (4) the time-lag relationship between seasonal surface deformation and groundwater level change was not significant (only 22 days), indicating that low-permeability clay units in this region have little influence on delaying the compaction of aquifer systems. The results of our paper can provide a scientific support for the formulation of land subsidence prevention and control and sustainable water resource exploitation and utilization planning in the Taiyuan Basin.

TI  - SENTINEL LYMPH NODE- A POSSIBLE GUARANTEE OF RECURRENCE-FREE SURVIVAL.
T2  - Georgian medical news
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Dilemmas in the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous melanoma, concerning the prognosis of patients, are far from finding an adequate or optimal solution at the moment. The issues are multifaceted and encompass a number of key points such as : 1) the choice of resection field, 2) the choice between a one-stage and a two-stage model of surgical removal of the tumor lesion, 3) the removal (or not) of the so-called sentinel lymph node, 4) the time intervals between the two surgical sessions, 5) the need or not for reciprocity between the clinically measured and the histologically established postoperatively resection field, and a number of others. The likelihood that the key to successful treatment/no recurrence of cutaneous melanoma lies in one or more of the above points is high. We present and analyze two patients with histopathologically established intermediate-thickness cutaneous melanomas, treated : 1) one of them: with a two-stage approach according to the generally accepted AJCC/EJC recommendations, and the other with 2) a single-stage procedure/ one step melanoma surgery (OSMS) with a resection margin of surgical security of 2 cm and no detection/removal of the so-called draining lymph node (at his request). The first patient developed progression and lethality within 2 years, and the second patient remained progression-free 6 years later. Conclusions based on these observations, although speculative, could be as follows: Strict adherence to the guidelines does not insure patients against progression and lethality (patient 1), but an individualized/ personalised/modified approach, as well as deviations from the official recommendations of the generally accepted guidelines (AJCC/EJC) - could ensure (sometimes) the absence of such (progression) (patient 2). In practice, the reason for the successful treatment of cutaneous melanomas and the lack of progression, could also be due to (or associated with) the differences in the therapeutic approaches applied by clinicians. These could be seen as a good starting point for deeper analysis. The reason for the lack of progression could probably be sought in the fusion of the surgical sessions or in the application of the one step melanoma surgery (OSMS). In practice, the total resection field in one-stage and two-stage melanoma surgery is the same, but in the one-step melanoma surgery (OSMS) approach it is achieved within only one surgical session. This fusion of surgical sessions provides a number of advantages for patients that are currently not well studied from a scientific/prognostic point of view. Another key, even strange point, is the non-performance of a sentinel/draining lymph node. According to common beliefs, detection and removal of the draining lymph node is advisable, but it has more diagnostic, clarifying rather than a therapeutic value. The lack of its localization and removal in the described patient could also be related/associated with the lack of progression (although unlikely): and this fact is evident not only in the data presented in this publication, but also in other cases described in the scientific literature. And would probably benefit from further careful analysis. The lack of progression in intermediate-thickness melanomas in certain patients could be related to the following 2 interesting, concurrent, and currently unclear events: 1) the consolidation of the 2-in-1 surgical sessions (i.e., in the application of a one-step model of surgical behaviour / OSMS/ one step melanoma surgery), and 2) the failure (probably) to perform a sentinel lymph node ditection and removal. Whether this is a sporadic finding-or whether there is a definite correlation-would need to be verified by observing a larger number of patients at different clinical centers. The likelihood that other factors influence the presence or absence of this progression remains quite possible.

TI  - Discerning <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>-Infected Olive Orchards in the Time Series of MODIS Terra Satellite Evapotranspiration Data by Using the Fisher-Shannon Analysis and the Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis
T2  - FRACTAL AND FRACTIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Xylella fastidiosa is a phytobacterium able to provoke severe diseases in many species. When it infects olive trees, it induces the olive quick decline syndrome that leads the tree to a rapid desiccation and then to the death. This phytobacterium has been recently detected in olive groves in southern Italy, representing an important threat to the olive growing of the area. In this paper, in order to identify patterns revealing the presence of Xylella fastidiosa, several hundreds pixels of MODIS satellite evapostranspiration covering infected and healthy olive groves in southern Italy were analyzed by means of the Fisher-Shannon method and the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The analysis of the receiver operating characteric curve indicates that the two informational quantities (the Fisher information measure and the Shannon entropy) and the three multifractal parameters (the range of generalized Hurst exponents and the width and the maximum of the multifractal spectrum) are well suited to discriminate between infected and healthy sites, although the maximum of the multifractal spectrum performs better than the others. These results could suggest the use of both the methods as an operational tool for early detection of plant diseases.

TI  - Hyperspectral Remote Sensing for Early Detection of Wheat Leaf Rust Caused by <i>Puccinia triticina</i>
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Early crop disease detection is one of the most important tasks in plant protection. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the early wheat leaf rust detection possibility using hyperspectral remote sensing. The first task of the study was to choose tools for processing and analyze hyperspectral remote sensing data. The second task was to analyze the wheat leaf biochemical profile by chromatographic and spectrophotometric methods. The third task was to discuss a possible relationship between hyperspectral remote sensing data and the results from the wheat leaves, biochemical profile analysis. The work used an interdisciplinary approach, including hyperspectral remote sensing and data processing methods, as well as spectrophotometric and chromatographic methods. As a result, (1) the VIS-NIR spectrometry data analysis showed a high correlation with the hyperspectral remote sensing data; (2) the most important wavebands for disease identification were revealed (502, 466, 598, 718, 534, 766, 694, 650, 866, 602, 858 nm). An early disease detection accuracy of 97-100% was achieved from fourth dai (day/s after inoculation) using SVM.

TI  - Modeling occupancy and detection probabilities to update the status of threatened eastern massasauga rattlesnake populations
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of a species' distribution throughout a landscape is crucial for developing long-term conservation practices and effective management plans. Accurate distributional data are particularly important for threatened or rare species with a broad geographic range and low detectability in their preferred habitats, as surveying and successfully encountering this type of species is oftentimes difficult. One such species is the eastern massasauga (Sistrurus catenatus), a smallbodied, federally threatened rattlesnake with a distribution centered around the Great Lakes region. The current status of many massasauga populations remains uncertain, hindering effective recovery efforts. We used single-season occupancy models to reassess the status of historic massasauga sites (n = 33) distributed throughout Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We assessed siteand survey-specific covariates at both the local- and landscape-scale to inform occupancy and detection probabilities. Average canopy cover best predicted occupancy probabilities, while search effort best predicted detection probabilities. Our top model which included canopy cover (occupancy) and search effort (detection) estimated an average occupancy probability of 0.30 (CI = 0.15-0.50) and average detection probability of 0.55 (CI = 0.31-0.78). Landscape-scale covariates derived from remotely-sensed data did not improve model fit for occupancy models. Our findings suggest that persistence of eastern massasauga populations relies upon canopy cover of < 60%, so management practices aimed at reducing woody invasive species, or setting back natural succession, will benefit this species. Our results may also be used to guide future survey efforts for massasaugas and have implications for current population predictions that form the basis of recovery strategies.

TI  - Review of Remote Sensing-Based Methods for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation: Progress, Challenges, and Prospects
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential for elucidating the global carbon cycle and the response of forest ecosystems to climate change. Over the past five decades, remote-sensing techniques have played a vital role in forest AGB estimation at different scales. Here, we present an overview of the progress in remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. More in detail, we first describe the principles of remote sensing techniques in forest AGB estimation: that is, the construction and use of parameters associated with AGB (rather than the direct measurement of AGB values). Second, we review forest AGB remotely sensed data sources (including passive optical, microwave, and LiDAR) and methods (e.g., empirical, physical, mechanistic, and comprehensive models) alongside their limitations and advantages. Third, we discuss possible sources of uncertainty in resultant forest AGB estimates, including those associated with remote sensing imagery, sample plot survey data, stand structure, and statistical models. Finally, we offer forward-looking perspectives and insights on prospective research directions for remote sensing-based forest AGB estimation. Remote sensing is anticipated to play an increasingly important role in future forest AGB estimation and carbon cycle studies. Overall, this comprehensive review may (1) benefit the research communities focused on carbon cycle, remote sensing, and climate change elucidation, (2) provide a theoretical basis for the study of the carbon cycle and global climate change, (3) inform forest ecosystems and carbon management, and (4) aid in the elucidation of forest feedbacks to climate change.

TI  - New Technique for Satellite Observation Interpretation Based on Standard Ground-Based Measurements of the Total Ozone Column
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new technique for retrieving the total ozone column (TOC) by interpreting satellite measurements of outgoing thermal radiation of the Earth (IKFS-2 spectrometer, Russian satellite Meteor-M No. 2) is suggested and analyzed. The technique is based on an inverse operator which is constructed using ground-based standard observations (Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers) and satellite measurements of TOC along with multilinear regression. The technique is analyzed with the standard ground-based Dobson measurements of TOC at Voeikov station, Leningrad oblast (Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory). The analysis shows that multilinear regression between the ground-based and satellite data allows approximating TOC in Voeikovo for 2015-2020 with an error of 2.8% and a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.97. The TOC time series retrieved from the solution of the inverse problem by the regression method has an error of 3.1% and a CC of 0.97. The technique suggested can be used for different regions of with TOC retrieved from ozone measurements at World Meteorological Organization (WMO) stations.

TI  - Integrating Remote Sensing and Weather Variables for Mango Yield Prediction Using a Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate pre-harvest yield forecasting of mango is essential to the industry as it supports better decision making around harvesting logistics and forward selling, thus optimizing productivity and reducing food waste. Current methods for yield forecasting such as manually counting 2-3% of the orchard can be accurate but are very time inefficient and labour intensive. More recent evaluations of technological solutions such as remote (satellite) and proximal (on ground) sensing have provided very encouraging results, but they still require infield in-season sampling for calibration, the technology comes at a significant cost, and commercial availability is limited, especially for vehicle-mounted sensors. This study presents the first evaluation of a "time series"-based remote sensing method for yield forecasting of mango, a method that does not require infield fruit counts and utilizes freely available satellite imagery. Historic yield data from 2015 to 2022 were sourced from 51 individual orchard blocks from two farms (AH and MK) in the Northern Territory of Australia. Time series measures of the canopy reflectance properties of the blocks were obtained from Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data for the 2015-2022 growing seasons. From the imagery, the following vegetation indices (VIs) were derived: EVI, GNDVI, NDVI, and LSWI, whilst corresponding weather variables (rainfall (Prec), temperature (Tmin/Tmax), evapotranspiration (ETo), solar radiation (Rad), and vapor pressure deficit (vpd)) were also sourced from SILO data. To determine the relationships among weather and remotely sensed measures of canopy throughout the growing season and the yield achieved (at the block level and the farm level), six machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBOOST), RIDGE, LASSO and partial least square regression (PLSR), were trialed. The EVI/GNDVI and Prec/Tmin were found to be the best RS and weather predictors, respectively. The block-level combined RS/weather-based RF model for 2021 produced the best result (MAE = 2.9 t/ha), marginally better than the RS only RF model (MAE = 3.4 t/ha). The farm-level model error (FLEM) was generally lower than the block-level model error, for both the combined RS/weather-based RF model (farm = 3.7%, block (NMAE) = 33.6% for 2021) and the RS-based model (farm = 4.3%, block = 38.4% for 2021). Further testing of the RS/weather-based RF models over six additional orchards (other than AH and MK) produced errors ranging between 24% and 39% from 2016 to 2020. Although accuracies of prediction did vary at both the block level and the farm level, this preliminary study demonstrates the potential of a "time series" RS method for predicting mango yields. The benefits to the mango industry are that it utilizes freely available imagery, requires no infield calibration, and provides predictions several months before the commercial harvest. Therefore, this outcome not only presents a more adoptable option for the industry, but also better supports automation and scalability in terms of block-, farm-, regional, and national level forecasting.

TI  - Agricultural drought in the Vietnamese Central Highlands at 1-km resolution: Monthly and annual datasets.
T2  - Data in brief
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Drought is a complex natural hazard which can create significant impacts on society and environment. Given that this phenomenon varies across space and changes over time dependent on various factors (e.g., physical conditions and human activities), the available of spatiotemporal drought data enables a better monitoring and assessment of drought severity This study introduced the integrated multivariate drought index (iMDI) data, a new regional drought index, at 1 km spatial and monthly temporal resolutions for the Vietnamese Central Highlands over a 20-years period. The iMDI was developed recently which is a combination of vegetation condition index (VCI), the temperature condition index (TCI), and the evaporative stress index (ESI) based on the feature of scaling algorithms (i.e., normalisations and standardisation). The data were processed using the median values of MODIS time-series imagery obtained from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The iMDI datasets are available for monthly and annual drought monitoring between 2001 and 2020. Additionally, the datasets of VCI, TCI, and ESI were provided so that users can apply for their own purposes even though these data can directly obtain from GEE or other sources. Users, especially those without technical expertise, can reap the advantages of having open access to iDMI data. By doing so, they can reduce their expenses and the time required to process data. As such, this accessibility can promote the use of data for diverse applications, such as evaluating the impact of droughts on the environment and human activities and monitoring droughts regionally.

TI  - A Methodology for Classifying Attractive Sources Related to Airport Birdstrike by Using Geospatial Tools
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban and rural environment around airport grounds, being an attractive site for wildlife, is subjected to special attention in relation to the risk of wildlife collision with aircrafts according to specific aviation norms. Therefore, investigation into significant attractive sources in airport surroundings is needed to contribute to 'wildlife strike' monitoring in order to activate efficient countermeasures for limitation and control in view of aviation safety while at the same time increasing wildlife protection. On this basis, the study was focused on attractive sites related to the birdstrike hazard in airport surroundings. The methodology described in this paper investigated the spatial distribution characteristics of bird strike influencing factors with an open-access approach to data handling. Remote sensing imagery and open-source GIS tools were utilised to apply suitability analysis to the surfaces involved, such as airport obstacle limitation surfaces, protected areas, vegetation, and water bodies. The methodology was applied to a case study of the airport of Catania, Italy. The results showed that application of geospatial tools to suitability analysis allowed for the identification of areas that have the greatest influence on the birdstrike hazard for aviation. This approach has made it possible to analyse these areas from the point of view of airport safety and the monitoring of ecological areas and corridors of high naturalistic value in order to protect them, providing a contribution toward sustainable management of the birstrike issue.

TI  - Cropland Mapping in Tropical Smallholder Systems with Seasonally Stratified Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Spectral and Textural Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping arable field areas is crucial for assessing agricultural productivity but poses challenges in sub-Saharan agroecosystems because of diverse crop calendars, small and irregularly shaped fields, persistent cloud cover, and lack of high-quality model training data. This study proposes several methodological improvements to overcome these challenges. Specifically, it utilizes long-term MODIS data to stratify finer Sentinel-2 reflectance and Sentinel-1 backscatter image features on a per-pixel basis. It also incorporates texture features and employs a machine learning approach with over 300,000 samples. The eastern region of Ghana was stratified into seven seasonal strata exhibiting distinct vegetation seasonality, capturing diversity in crop calendars, using long-term MODIS (2001-2009) normalized difference vegetation index phenology. Three years (2017-2019) of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 original bands at 20 m were composited into dry and wet seasonal features according to the strata, from which spectral, polarimetric, and texture features were extracted. The field boundaries were digitized using PlanetScope images (2018-2019). Random Forest classifier with 10-fold cross-validation and recursive feature elimination was used for feature selection and model building. Including topographic variables, out of 137 image features, only 11 features were found important. Sentinel-2 SWIR-based spectral features were most important, followed by Sentinel-1 polarimetric (VV) and elevation features. Half of the 11 features were variance texture features, followed by spectral features. The Random Forest classifier produced a 0.78 AUC score with overall precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.96, 0.78, and 0.85, respectively. While the precision for both classes was >0.90, the recall rate for arable areas was half that of non-arable areas. Future studies could improve the technical workflow with reliable balanced sampling, narrowband hyperspectral images, and fully polarized SAR images.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF LAND COVER CHANGE (2001-2021) USING REMOTE SENSING WITHIN AND AROUND MINALUNGAO NATIONAL PARK IN NUEVA ECIJA, PHILIPPINES
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study determines the land cover change within and around Minalungao National Park in Nueva Ecija, Philippines. Landsat images (Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus - ETM+ and Landsat 8) with different time intervals (2001, 2014, 2021) were used in the analysis. The Semi Automatic Classification Plugin in Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) using the minimum distance classification algorithm was employed for the classification. The results establish four classifications of land cover: inland water, closed forest, open forest, and open/barren land. Accuracy assessments and kappa coefficients were accepted considerably. The result presented a dynamic land cover gain and loss related with different community activities. Both positive and negative activities affecting land cover were noted. Positive activities are related to forest restoration, ecotourism programs, and reports of tree-cutting activities. Moreover, negative activities are directly related with tree-cutting and livestock grazing. An alternative state of the protected area is also modelled based on land cover change around the protected area. This can be used to determine the most likely land cover status of Minalungao National Park if not established as a protected area.

AB  - The aim is to clarify the specifics of the synthesis of music and words in Valeriy Antonyuk's vocal cycle "Ten solosingings to poems by Japanese poets of the XVI-XVII centuries translated by Mykola Lukash" for soprano and piano. Addressing this issue involves accomplishing the following tasks: researching this vocal cycle in the light of ethnocultural dialogue; to carry out an analysis of the structure and figurative content of the poetic texts of Japanese classical poets translated into Ukrainian by M. Lukash; to reveal the features of the composer's handwriting, which determine the peculiarities of the creation of images through the synthesis of music and words. Methodology. To achieve the goal and solve the tasks, we apply a cultural approach and use structural-systemic, musicological, complex methods and generalization of results. Conclusions. We made an attempt to research the vocal cycle "Ten solosingings to poems by Japanese poets of the XVI-XVII centuries translated by Mykola Lukash" for soprano and piano in the light of ethnocultural dialogue. Joint efforts were aimed at identifying common emotional and figurative vibrations and creating a musical work that, using modern musical means, illuminates the aesthetic, philosophical and artistic worldview of haiku poems with their reinterpretation, touching on the Ukrainian mentality.

TI  - Is the Northern Goshawk an Efficient Bioindicator of Avian Abundance and Species Richness in Urban Environments?
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of biodiversity in expanding urban areas is an essential part of wildlife conservation. There is evidence that raptors, such as Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis), are effective bioindicator species in urban areas, however, their relationship with other bird populations is not clearly established. We asked whether activity patterns of Goshawks are a reliable indicator of wintering bird abundance and diversity in urban ecosystems. We tracked the movement of eight GPS-tagged Goshawks in the city of Tartu (Estonia) and analysed the numbers and diversity of birds in the same area using direct mapping and occasional data obtained from birdwatchers. The direct mapping approach revealed that the number of birds and avian species richness were higher in Goshawk activity hotspots than at random sites in 2022, however, no such differences were detected in 2023. Analysis of occasional citizen-collected data showed no effect of avian abundance nor species richness on the distribution of Goshawk activity. These results suggested that the movements of Goshawks may indicate the abundance and diversity of its prey, however, this relationship depends on the detection methodology. Hence, raptors are a promising bioindicator in urban environments, but results should be interpreted with caution, particularly when using citizen-collected data.

TI  - Development and Validation of a Model Based on Vegetation Indices for the Prediction of Sugarcane Yield
T2  - AGRIENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, Brazil is the leading producer of sugarcane in the world, with self-sufficiency in the use of ethanol as a biofuel, as well as being one of the largest suppliers of sugar to the world. This study aimed to develop a predictive model for sugarcane production based on data extracted from aerial imagery obtained from drones or satellites, allowing the precise tracking of plant development in the field. A model based on a semiparametric approach associated with the inverse Gaussian distribution applied to vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index (VARI), was developed with data from drone images obtained from two field experiments with randomized replications and four sugarcane varieties. These experiments were performed under conditions identical to those applied by sugarcane farmers. Further, the model validation was carried out by scaling up the analyses with data extracted from Sentinel-2 images of several commercial sugarcane fields. Very often, in countries such as Brazil, sugarcane crops occupy extensive areas. Consequently, the development of tools capable of being operated remotely automatically benefits the management of this crop in the field by avoiding laborious and time-consuming sampling and by promoting the reduction of operation costs. The results of the model application in both sources of data, i.e., data from field experiments as well as the data from commercial fields, showed a suitable level of overlap between the data of predicted yield using VIs generated from drone and satellite images with the data of verified yield obtained by measuring the production of experiments and commercial fields, indicating that the model is reliable for forecasting productivity months before the harvest time.

TI  - LULC Change Effects on Environmental Quality and Ecosystem Services Using EO Data in Two Rural River Basins in Thrace, Greece
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural abandonment and associated rapid urbanization, agricultural intensification, and climate change have been key factors transforming terrestrial landscapes, with significant impacts on the environmental quality and the ecosystem services (ES) provided to human welfare. In this study, two understudied rural river basins located in Thrace, North Greece, were selected to assess changes in landscape pattern, composition, and eco-environmental quality and ecosystem services values (ESV). Cloud-based remote sensing (RS) analyses of multitemporal Landsat imagery in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform were applied for multitemporal land use/land cover changes (LULCC) quantification between 1984-2021, along with landscape pattern, eco-environmental quality, and ES assessment. Although ecosystem changes observed were not extensive over this period, eco-environmental quality appeared to be affected due to fragmentation. Preserving the ecosystem's naturalness can enhance cultural ES to avoid further values loss originating from provisioning ES exploitation. This study highlights the strong connection between landscape configuration and eco-environmental quality, emphasizing the strong impact that anthropogenic activities have on the environment. The monitoring of the effects of LULCC on ecosystem health and the economic value of ES is crucial for the introduction of spatial planning and restoration policies.

TI  - Artisanal trawl fisheries as a sentinel of marine litter pollution
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic seafloor surveys are a highly desirable method of marine litter monitoring, but the high costs involved in seafloor sampling are not a trivial handicap. In the present work, we explore the opportunity provided by the artisanal trawling fisheries to obtain systematic data on marine litter in the Gulf of Cadiz between 2019 and 2021. We find that plastic was the most frequent material, with a prevalence of single-use and fishing-related items. Litter densities decreased with increasing distance to shore with a seasonal migration of the main litter hotspots. During pre-lockdown and post-lockdown stages derived from COVID-19, marine litter density decreased by 65%, likely related to the decline in tourism and outdoor recreational activities. A continuous collaboration of 33% of the local fleet would imply a removal of hundreds of thousands of items each year. The artisanal trawl fishing sector can play a unique role of monitoring marine litter on the seabed.

TI  - THE MEANS OF FORMING THE STROGANOVS' CULTURAL IDENTITY IN THE XVI-XVII CENTURIES
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - For the formation of a holistic, harmonious system of person's values, it is necessary to study the mechanisms of creating a cultural field in history. A vivid example is the Russian dynasty of industrialists and philanthropists - the Stroganovs, whose activities in the 16th-19th centuries directly influenced the economic, political and spiritual life of not only their regional possessions, but also the whole country.At the moment, a lot of aspects of the Stroganovs' life in the era of the Late Middle Ages (XVI-XVII centuries) have already studied. But not one of the researchers turned to understanding the factors that influenced the formation of the Stroganovs 'identity in the XVI- XVII centuries. Namely, this phenomenon became the basis for the development of the culture at the territory of the Stroganovs 'possessions for the indicated period. Therefore, to solve a scientific problem, it is necessary to determine the factors, the degree and nature of their influence on the Stroganovs 'cultural identity construction, taking into account regional and all-Russian processes in the culture of the late Middle Ages.One of the spesial characteristics of the study is an integrated approach. It consists in understanding the sustainable national historical core of cultural identity. The identity factor stands out as the most important link synthesizing various determinants of the development of national culture. The theory of "identity" developed to date is complex and comprehends the phenomenon in many aspects. To achieve this goal, the author presented and justified a hierarchical system that reveals a person's personality through the prism of their involvement, immersion and familiarization with the achievements of regional, national and world culture at a certain stage of society development. Each level of the system (regional, national, universal) is in dialectic relations with each other and have causal relationships in the hierarchy. The chosen approach allows the author to consider the problem in the context of cultural and social factors, to understand the direction of Stroganovs' identity evolution and to determine approaches to its study.In the framework of the study, the author identified a number of factors that directly impacted on the Stroganovs' spiritual and value orientations, such as geographical conditions, family structure, state policy, the Orthodox worldview, etc. The author highlighted religious identity as the organizing principle and semantic dominant of this process. So, the Stroganovs entered the world cultural space through Christianity, communion with the Holy Scriptures and biblical values, world Sacred history. The national level of identity is based on the unified religion of Orthodoxy and on such a core concept as a single language, appeared in the bookishness phenomenon. The study of the Stroganovs' value system in the context of the identity phenomenon has prospects in the further study of the cultural space of Russia in different historical periods.

T2  - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundExtragenital testing (rectal and oropharyngeal) of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) increases the detection of CT/NG infections, compared with genital testing alone. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual extragenital CT/NG screening for men who have sex with men, and additional screenings for women and transgender or gender-diverse individuals if certain sexual behaviors and exposures are reported.MethodsProspective computer-assisted telephonic interviews were conducted with 873 clinics between June 2022 and September 2022. The computer-assisted telephonic interview followed a semistructured questionnaire that included closed-ended questions on the availability and accessibility of CT/NG testing.ResultsOf the 873 clinics, CT/NG testing was offered in 751 clinics (86.0%), and extragenital testing was offered in only 432 clinics (57.5%). Most clinics (74.5%) with extragenital testing do not offer tests unless patients request them and/or report symptoms. Additional barriers to accessing information on available CT/NG testing include clinics not picking up the telephone, disconnecting the call, and unwillingness or inability to answer questions.ConclusionsDespite evidence-based recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the availability of extragenital CT/NG testing is moderate. Patients seeking extragenital testing may encounter barriers such as fulfilling specific criteria or being unable to access information on testing availability.

CL  - Orlando, FL
AB  - BackgroundBreast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a limiting sequelae of breast cancer treatment that may negatively impact 30% to 50% of high-risk breast cancer survivors. Risk factors for development of BCRL include axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and recently, axillary reverse lymphatic mapping and immediate lymphovenous reconstruction (ILR) at time of ALND have been implemented to prevent BCRL. Reliable anatomy of neighboring venules has been commented on in the literature; however, little information exists about anatomical location of local lymphatic channels amenable for bypass.MethodsAfter institutional review board approval, patients who underwent ALND with axillary reverse lymphatic mapping and ILR at a tertiary cancer center from November 2021 to August 2022 were applicable for this study. The location and number of lymphatic channels used for ILR were identified and measured intraoperatively with the arm abducted to 90 degrees and soft tissue under no tension. Four measurements were taken to localize each lymphatic and were based on relationship with reliable anatomic landmarks including 4th rib, anterior axillary line, and lower border of the pectoralis major muscle. Demographics, oncologic treatments, intraoperative factors, and outcomes were prospectively maintained.ResultsTwenty-seven patients met inclusion for this study by August 2022 with a total of 86 lymphatic channels identified. Patients were on average 50 & PLUSMN; 12 years old with a body mass index of 30 & PLUSMN; 6 and had an average of 1 vein and 3 identifiable lymphatic channels amenable to bypass. Seventy percent of lymphatic channels were found in a cluster of 2 or more channels. The average horizontal location was 4.5 & PLUSMN; 1.4 cm lateral to the 4th rib. The average vertical location was 1.3 & PLUSMN; 0.9 cm from the superior border of the 4th rib.ConclusionsThese data comment upon intraoperatively identified and consistent location of upper extremity lymphatic channels used for ILR. These lymphatic channels are often found in clusters with 2 or more lymphatic channels at the same location. Such insight may aid in easier intraoperative identification of amenable vessels for the unexperienced surgeon, decrease in intraoperative time, and higher success of ILR.

TI  - Wave Azimuth Cutoff Compensation Method and the Multisatellite Networking Mode of SAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radars (SARs) encounter the azimuth cutoff problem when observing sea waves. Consequently, SARs can only capture the waves with wavelengths larger than the cutoff wavelength and lose the information of waves with smaller wavelengths. To increase the accuracy of SAR wave observations, this paper investigates an azimuth cutoff compensation method based on the simulated multiview SAR wave synchronization data obtained by the collaborative observation via networked satellites. Based on the simulated data and the equivalent multiview measured data from Sentinel-1 virtual networking, the method is verified and the cutoff wavelengths decrease by 16.40% and 14.00%. The biases of the inversion significant wave height with true values decrease by 0.04m and 0.14m, and the biases of the mean wave period decrease by 0.17s and 0.22 s, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the azimuth cutoff compensation method. Based on the azimuth cutoff compensation method, the multisatellite SAR networking mode for wave observations are discussed. The highest compensation effect is obtained when the combination of azimuth angle is (95 degrees, 115 degrees, 135 degrees), the orbital intersection angle is (50 degrees, 50 degrees), and three or four satellites are used. The study of the multisatellite networking mode in this paper can provide valuable references for the compensation of azimuth cutoff and the observation of waves by a multisatellite network.

TI  - Individual and Combined Effects of 3D Buildings and Green Spaces on the Urban Thermal Environment: A Case Study in Jinan, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to accurately grasp the impact mechanism and change rule of buildings and green spaces on land surface temperature (LST), which is of great significance for alleviating urban heat islands (UHIs) and formulating adaptation measures. Taking Jinan, China, as the study area, combined multisource remote sensing data were used in this study to construct an index system of the influencing factors. We used a spatial regression model to explore the relative contribution of the influencing indicators on LST. We also drew a marginal utility curve to quantify the heating/cooling effect of the leading indicators. The results showed that, firstly, among the 3D building indicators, the leading indicators affecting LST were the degree of spatial convergence (SCD) and the building surface area (BSA). Among the green space indicators, the largest patch index (LPI), green coverage rate (GCR), and edge density (ED) were significantly negatively correlated with LST. Secondly, when we considered the 15 indicators comprehensively, SCD was the most influential indicator, with a contribution of 24.7%, and the contribution of the green space indicators to LST was significantly reduced. Thirdly, among the leading indicators, SCD was positively correlated with LST. When SCD was less than 60%, LST increased by about 0.38 & DEG;C for every 10% increase. When GCR > 44%, LST was significantly reduced, and when GCR > 62%, a cooling effect of 1.1 degrees C was observed. Beyond this threshold, the cooling effect will not improve significantly. This study shows that when 3D buildings are densely distributed and crowded, the cooling effect of green space will be limited to some extent by 3D buildings. The key to mitigating UHIs is to rationally configure and optimize the spatial structure of 3D buildings.

TI  - Sample Plots Forestry Parameters Verification and Updating Using Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of LiDAR technology has promoted great changes in forest resource surveys. The airborne LiDAR point cloud can provide the precise height and detailed structure of trees, and can estimate key forest resource indicators such as forest stock volume, diameter at breast height, and forest biomass at a large scale. By establishing relationship models between the forest parameters of sample plots and the calculated parameters of LiDAR, these developments may eventually expand the models to large-scale forest resource surveys of entire areas. In this study, eight sample plots in northeast China are used to verify and update the information using point cloud obtained by the LiDAR scanner riegl-vq-1560i. First, the tree crowns are segmented using the profile-rotating algorithm, and tree positions are registered based on dominant tree heights. Second, considering the correlation between crown shape and tree species, we use DBN classifier to identify species using features of crowns, which are extracted to 1D array. Third, when the tree species is known, parameters such as height, crown width, diameter at breast height, biomass, and stock volume can be extracted from trees, enabling accurate large-scale forest surveys based on LiDAR data. Finally, experiment results demonstrate that the F-score of the eight plots in the tree segmentation exceed 0.95, the accuracy of tree species correction exceeds 90%, and the R-2 of tree height, east-west crown width, north-south crown width, diameter at breast height, aboveground biomass, and stock volume are 0.893, 0.757, 0.694, 0.840, 0.896 and 0.891, respectively. The above results indicate that the LiDAR-based survey is practical and can be widely applied in forest resource monitoring.

TI  - Refocusing Swing Ships in SAR Imagery Based on Spatial-Variant Defocusing Property
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an essential tool for maritime surveillance in all weather conditions and at night. Ships are often affected by sea breezes and waves, generating a three-dimensional (3D) swinging motion. The 3D swing ship can thereby become severely defocused in SAR images, making it extremely difficult to recognize them. However, refocusing 3D swing ships in SAR imagery is challenging with traditional approaches due to different phase errors at each scattering point on the ship. In order to solve this problem, a novel method for refocusing swing ships in SAR imagery based on the spatial-variant defocusing property is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the spatial-variant defocusing property of a 3D swing ship is derived according to the SAR imaging mechanism. Secondly, considering the spatial-variant defocusing property, each azimuth line of the SAR 3D swing ship image is modeled as a multi-component linear frequency modulation (MC-LFM) signal. Thirdly, Fractional Autocorrelation (FrAc) is implemented in order to quickly calculate the optimal rotation order set for each azimuth line. Thereafter, Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) is performed on the azimuth lines to refocus their linear frequency modulation (LFM) components one by one. Finally, the original azimuth lines are replaced in the SAR image with their focused signals to generate the refocused SAR image. The experimental results from a large amount of simulated data and real Gaofen-3 data show that the proposed algorithm can overcome the spatial-variant defocusing of 3D swing ships. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, our approach reduces the image entropy by an order of magnitude, leading to a visible improvement in image quality, which makes it possible to recognize swing ships in SAR images.

TI  - Development of the Ames Global Hyperspectral Synthetic Data Set: Surface Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study introduces the Ames Global Hyperspectral Synthetic Data set (AGHSD), in particular the surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) product, to support the NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission development. The data set is generated based on the corresponding multispectral BRDF products from NASA's MODIS satellite sensor. Based on theories of radiative transfer in vegetation canopies, we derive a simple but robust relationship that indicates that the hyperspectral surface BRDF can be accurately approximated as a weighted sum of the soil surface reflectance, the leaf single albedo, and the canopy scattering coefficient, where the weights or coefficients are spectrally invariant and thus readily estimated from the multispectral MODIS products. We validate the algorithm with simulations by a Monte Carlo Ray Tracing model and find the results highly consistent with the theoretic derivation. Using reflectance spectra of soil and vegetation derived from existing spectral libraries, we apply the algorithm to generate the AGHSD BRDF product at 1 km and 8-day resolutions for the year of 2019. The data set is biogeochemically and biogeophysically coherent and consistent, and serves the goal to support the SBG community in developing sciences and applications for the future global imaging spectroscopy mission.Plain Language Summary This paper develops a emulated (or synthetic) global hyperspectral data set, based on existing multispectral satellite products, to support the NASA Surface Biology and Geology (SBG) mission development. The challenge of the task is to find a simple yet robust algorithm to interpolate multispectral observations to (unobserved) hyperspectral bands. Based on theoretic analyses and numerical model simulations, we develop an accurate and efficient algorithm that accomplishes this task by combining information from the optical properties of the surface elements and the structural properties of the landscape and vegetation canopies. The former are obtained from existing spectral libraries and the latter can be estimated from the multispectral satellite products. We apply the algorithm to generate a scientifically coherent and consistent global hyperspectral data set, which are publicly available to serve the needs of the science community of SBG and other global hyperspectral remote sensing satellite missions.

TI  - Automatic 10 m Forest Cover Mapping in 2020 at China's Han River Basin by Fusing ESA Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 Land Cover and Sentinel-2 near Real-Time Forest Cover Possibility
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasingly fragmented forest landscapes, it is necessary to map forest cover with fine spatial resolution in a large area. The European Space Agency (ESA) released the 10 m global land cover map in 2020 based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images, and Dynamic World provides near real-time possibilities of many land cover classes based on Sentinel-2 images, but they are not designed particularly for forest cover. In this research, we aimed to develop a method to automatically estimate an accurate 10 m forest cover map in 2020 by fusing the ESA forest cover map and Dynamic World near real-time forest cover possibilities. The proposed method includes three main steps: (1) generating stable forest samples, (2) determining the threshold T and (3) producing the fused forest cover map. China's Han River Basin, dominated by complex subtropical forests, was used as the study site to validate the performance of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method could produce a forest cover map with the best overall accuracy of 98.02% & PLUSMN; 1.20% and more accurate spatial details compared to using only one of the two data sources. The proposed method is thus superior in mapping forest cover in complex forest landscapes.

TI  - Estimation of Forest Fire Burned Area by Distinguishing Non-Photosynthetic and Photosynthetic Vegetation Using Triangular Space Method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest fire burned area is one of the most basic factors used to describe forest fires and plays a vital role in damage assessment. The development of the NSSI-NDVI vegetation index triangular space method enables simultaneous calculation of the flammable non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), combustible photosynthetic vegetation (PV), and incombustible bare soil (BS) fractional cover in forest areas. This can be used to compensate for the calculation method that was based on NDVI vegetation index only by comparing vegetation cover before and after forest fires, with the omission of the NPV burned area. To this end, the NSSI-NDVI triangular space shape consistency before and after forest fires was elucidated through combustion and ash wetting experiments. In addition, the feasibility of the NSSI-NDVI triangular space method for the accurate calculation of the post-fire vegetation damage area was verified. Finally, the applicability and accuracy of this research method were verified based on 10 m spatial resolution satellite hyperspectral images from before and after the forest fire in Lushan, Sichuan Province, China. The NSSI-NDVI triangular space method was used to calculate the PV, NPV, and BS coverage simultaneously, and component transformation was used to calculate the burned area and burned site separately.

TI  - Rice False Smut Monitoring Based on Band Selection of UAV Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice false smut (RFS) is a late-onset fungal disease that primarily affects rice panicle in recent years. Severe RFS can decrease the yield by 20-30% and severely affect rice quality. This research used hyperspectral remote sensing data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). On the basis of genetic algorithm combined with partial least squares to select the feature bands, this paper creates a new method to use the Pearson correlation coefficient method and Instability Index between Classes (ISIC) method to further select characteristic bands, which further eliminated 27.78% of the feature bands when the model monitoring accuracy was improved overall. The prediction accuracy of the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model and Random Forest model was the best, which were 85.62% and 84.10%, respectively, and the monitoring accuracy was improved by 2.22% and 2.4% compared with that before optimization. Then, based on the UAV hyperspectral data and the combination of characteristic bands selected by the three band optimization methods, the sensitive band ranges of rice false smut monitoring were determined, which were 698-800 nm and 974-997 nm. This paper provides an effective method of selecting characteristic bands of hyperspectral data and a method of monitoring crop diseases' using unmanned aerial vehicles.

TI  - A giant breast malignant solitary fibrous tumor: A rare case report and brief review
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - Solitary fibrous tumors (SFTs), which were first identified in the pleura and later at multiple anatomical locations, are rare mesenchymal neoplasms. The characteristics of SFTs include well-circumscribed margins, intense vascularity and a relatively indolent clinical course. SFTs originating from the breast are rare. To the best of our knowledge, only 33 cases of breast SFTs, including five malignant tumors, have been reported to date. In the present study, a rare case of complete resection of a giant malignant SFT is reported. A 48-year-old female patient who visited Weifang People's Hospital (Weifang, China) had a 2-year history of a right palpable breast lesion. The patient reported no other symptoms, such as skin changes or nipple discharge. An ultrasound examination revealed a giant, well-circumscribed, heterogeneous and hypoechoic lesion with central and peripheral blood flow. Owing to the large size of the lesion, mammography and magnetic resonance imaging were not feasible. Core needle biology showed that the lesion was a malignant spindle cell tumor. Following this, mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed. The sentinel lymph nodes exhibited metastasis. A definitive diagnosis of malignant SFT was made by microscopic examination with immunohistochemistry. The treatment strategy for benign breast SFTs should be complete surgical excision, whereas for malignant SFTs, it should include radical resection along with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Owing to the indolent nature and late recurrence and metastasis of malignant breast SFTs, regular patient follow-up for a longer duration is essential.

TI  - Observations of the Impacts of Hong Kong International Airport on Water Quality from 1986 to 2022 Using Landsat Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is an important sea airdrome in China. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impacts of this reclamation on the water quality of the Northwestern Bay of Hong Kong (NWBHK). In all, 117 Landsat 5 TM and 44 Landsat 8 OLI images were preprocessed and matched with the marine water data of 18 in situ monitoring points, acquiring 458 and 119 sets of data, respectively. This study adopted BPNN Machine Learning methods to establish the retrieval algorithm. Based on the images, the construction of HKIA was divided into three stages: (1) the construction of the first and second runways from 1992 to 1995; (2) the construction of the Hong Kong Port from 2013 to 2016; and (3) the construction of the third runway from 2017 to 2020. The concentrations of suspended particulate matter, orthophosphate phosphorus, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen from 1986 to 2022 were retrieved. In this paper, it was found that (1) the construction activities led to an increase in SPM, PO4P, and DIN concentrations in adjacent water bodies; (2) the impact of the Tuen Mun River on the NWBHK increased, while the impact of the Tung Chung River on the NWBHK decreased; and (3) the interception impact of HKIA on the transportation of the Pearl River water became stronger.

TI  - Integration of UAV and GF-2 Optical Data for Estimating Aboveground Biomass in Spruce Plantations in Qinghai, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - More refined and economical aboveground biomass (AGB) monitoring techniques are needed because of the growing significance of spruce plantations in climate change mitigation programs. Due to the challenges of conducting field surveys, such as the potential inaccessibility and high cost, this study proposes a convenient and efficient alternative to traditional field surveys that integrates Gaofen-2 (GF-2) satellite optical images and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-acquired optical and point cloud data to provide a reliable and refined estimation of the aboveground biomass (AGB) in spruce plantations. The feasibility of using data produced from the semiautomatic processing of UAV-based images and photogrammetric point clouds to replace conventional field surveys of sample plots in a young spruce plantation was evaluated. The AGB in 53 sample plots was estimated using data extracted from the UAV imagery. The UAV plot data and GF-2 optical data were used in four regression models to estimate the AGB in the study area. The coefficient of determination (R-2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean percent standard error (MPSE), and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) were calculated through five-fold cross-validation and stratified random sampling to evaluate the models' efficacies. In the end, the most accurate model was used to generate the spatial distribution map of the AGB. The results revealed the following: (1) the individual-tree height (R-2 = 0.90) and crown diameter (R-2 = 0.74) extracted from UAV data were accurate enough to replace field surveys used to obtain the AGB at the plot levels; (2) the random forest (RF) model (R-2 = 0.86; RMSE = 1.75 t/ha; MPSE = 15.75%; LCCC = 0.91) outperformed the ordinary least-squares (OLS) model (R-2 = 0.68; RMSE = 2.49 t/ha; MPSE = 22.94%; LCCC = 0.81), artificial neural network (ANN) model (R-2 = 0.67; RMSE = 2.54 t/ha; MPSE = 21.48%; LCCC = 0.80), and support vector machine (SVM) model (R-2 = 0.60; RMSE = 2.84 t/ha; MPSE = 31.73%; LCCC = 0.76) in terms of the estimation accuracy; (3) an AGB map generated by the random forest model was in good agreement with field surveys and the age of the spruce plantations. Therefore, the method proposed in this study can be used as a refined and cost-effective way to estimate the AGB in young spruce plantations.

TI  - Accuracy Assessment of Eleven Medium Resolution Global and Regional Land Cover Land Use Products: A Case Study over the Conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover land use (LCLU) products provide essential information for numerous environmental and human studies. Here, we assess the accuracy of eleven global and regional products over the conterminous U.S. using 25,000 high-confidence randomly distributed samples. Results show that in general, the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) and the Land Change Monitoring, Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) outperform other multi-class products, both in terms of higher individual class accuracy and with accuracy variability across classes. More specifically, F1 accuracy comparisons between the best performing USGS and non-USGS products indicate: (i) similar performance for the water class, (ii) USGS product outperformance in the developed (+1.3%), grass/shrub (+3.2%) and tree cover (+4.2%) classes, and (iii) non-USGS product (WorldCover) gains in the cropland (+5.1%) class. The NLCD and LCMAP also outperformed specialized single-class products, such as the Hansen Global Forest Change, the Cropland Data Layer and the Global Artificial Impervious Areas, while offering comparable results to the Global Surface Water Dynamics product. Spatial visualizations also allowed accuracy comparisons across different geographic areas. In general, the NLCD and LCMAP have disagreements mainly in the middle and southeastern part of conterminous U.S. while Esri, WorldCover and Dynamic World have most errors in the western U.S. Comparisons were also undertaken on a subset of the reference data, called spatial edge samples, that identifies samples surrounded by neighboring samples of different class labels, thus excluding easy-to-classify homogenous areas. There, the WorldCover product offers higher accuracies for the highly dynamic grass/shrub (+4.4%) and cropland (+8.1%) classes when compared to the NLCD and LCMAP products. An important conclusion while looking at these challenging samples is that except for the tree class (78%), the best performing products per class range in accuracy between 55% and 70%, which suggests that there is substantial room for improvement.

AB  - Ghana has retained a substantial area of tropical forests in an extensive network of protected reserves. These forests are impacted by land uses such as logging, mining, and agriculture as well as wildfires. We studied forest disturbance and recovery from 2013 to 2020 using annual maps of forest cover derived from Landsat imagery. Fire-associated disturbance was distinguished using VIIRS active fire data. We used boosted regression trees to model disturbances in closed and open forests as a function of climate variability, human accessibility, and landscape structure. A total of 3562 km(2) of forest reserves were disturbed, of which 17% (615 km(2)) were fire disturbances and 83% (2946 km(2)) were non-fire disturbances. Of the total disturbed area, 68% was degradation (change from closed to open forest), 28% was open forest loss, and only 4% was closed forest loss. Over the same period, 2702 km(2) of forest reserves recovered, with 1948 km(2) of these recovering to closed-canopy forests. Fire disturbances were strongly associated with precipitation anomalies and occurred mostly in drier years, whereas non-fire disturbances had weaker relationships with precipitation. Disturbances in closed forests occurred in landscapes where closed forest cover was already low. In contrast, disturbances in open forests were most common in locations with intermediate levels of population pressure from nearby cities and proximity to non-forest land cover. The results support the idea that forest disturbance in Ghana is a multi-stage process involving degradation of closed forests followed by loss of the resulting open forests. Although non-fire disturbance rates are consistent from year to year, sharp increases in fire disturbance occur in drought years. Locations with the highest disturbance risk are associated with measurable indicators of climate, human pressure, and fragmentation, which can be used to identify these areas for conservation and forest restoration activities.

TI  - Exploration for native parasitoids of Asian longhorned beetle in China as prospective biological control agents
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Native to China and the Korean Peninsula, the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB) Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) is a high-risk invasive pest of hardwood trees.2. To explore the potential of biological control of ALB in the United States, we conducted surveys of ALB parasitoids using sentinel logs in five geographical regions (Beijing, Gansu, Guizhou, Shanghai, and Yunnan) in China from 2019 to 2022.3. Seven hymenopteran larval parasitoid species, Bracon planitibiae Yang, Eurytoma chinensis Yang, Heydenia sp., Oxysychus glabripennis Yang, Sclerodermus guani Xiao et Wu, Spathius anoplophorae Yang, and Zolotarewskya anoplophorae Yang, were collected in Beijing. Four, three and two of these species were also found in Shanghai, Guizhou, and Yunnan, respectively. No parasitoid was found in Gansu.4. Mean parasitism rates by all parasitoid species were 3.6%-15.8% in Beijing, 1.4%-16.4% in Guizhou, 1.6%-7.1% in Shanghai, and 5.8% in Yunnan.5. Spathius anoplophorae and O. glabripennis were the two most dominant parasitoids collected consistently in the four different regions and may be considered as prospective agents for biological control introduction against ALB in the United States.6. We discuss some underlying ecological mechanisms that might contribute to the rarity of egg parasitoids and future opportunities and challenges for biological control of ALB.

TI  - Exploring the emergence and changing dynamics of a new integrated rice-crawfish farming system in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop-aquaculture systems are widely adopted around the world as they can provide high protein and energy outputs per unit of land and raise farm incomes, particularly for smallholder farmers. Recently, a new crop-aquaculture system, which combines rice production with crawfish breeding (integrated rice-crawfish farming), has emerged and rapidly expanded in China. However, the spatial extent and temporal dynamics of this integrated farming system largely remain unclear, which prohibits rigorous impact assessments to support its sustainable development. Here we use time series of Landsat satellite data, for the first time, to explore the emergence and the changing dynamics of this rice-crawfish farming system for the period of 2013-2021 in five provinces (805 600 km(2)) of China, where 90% of the global crawfish are produced. Our analysis reveals that the total area of rice-crawfish farming in these five provinces increased steadily from 0.11 Mha in 2013 to 0.70 Mha in 2019, then sharply contracted by a third in 2020 and rebounded in 2021. Spatially, rice-crawfish system is located primarily in low-elevation plain areas with abundant water resources, where paddy rice cultivation has traditionally dominated agriculture. More concentrated rice-crawfish distribution is observed in Jianghan Plain, and regions around Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake. The spatial distribution of rice-crawfish cultivation experienced considerable expansion towards the east and north from 2013 to 2021, with the largest expansion found in Jiangsu and Anhui after 2018. At the county level, over 6% of counties experienced notable area increases of more than 60 km(2) from 2017 and 2019, but 20% of counties have decreased from 2019 to 2021. Among the converted land use types, irrigated cropland is the largest contributor to rice-crawfish expansion with a contribution of 56%, followed by water bodies (25%) and rainfed cropland (13%). The spatial and temporal information provided in this study helps to understand the evolution of rice-crawfish cultivation in China and facilitates more efficient management of land resources under the rapid development of this farming system.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Variation in Habitat Suitability for <i>Oedaleus decorus asiaticus</i> Bei-Bienko on the Mongolian Plateau Using Maxent and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Oedaleus decorus asiaticus Bei-Bienko is one of the most dangerous agricultural pests on the Mongolian Plateau. Due to its small size, it is difficult to monitor and control. Therefore, it is important to detect the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of grasshopper occurrence, to extract the suitable areas for grasshoppers, and to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of the suitable areas for grasshoppers for monitoring and early warning of grasshoppers on the Mongolian plateau. Here the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat suitability for O. decorus asiaticus on the Mongolian Plateau was assessed using maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling along with multi-source remote sensing data and geospatial data. O. decorus asiaticus is a major grasshopper species that harms the development of agriculture on the Mongolian Plateau. Therefore, it is important to enhance the monitoring of O. decorus asiaticus. In this study, the spatiotemporal variation in the habitat suitability for O. decorus asiaticus on the Mongolian Plateau was assessed using maximum entropy (Maxent) modeling along with multi-source remote sensing data (meteorology, vegetation, soil, and topography). The predictions of the Maxent model were accurate (AUC = 0.910). The key environmental variables affecting the distribution of grasshoppers and their contribution were grass type (51.3%), accumulated precipitation (24.9%), altitude (13.0%), vegetation coverage (6.6%), and land surface temperature (4.2%). Based on the assessment results of suitability by Maxent model, the model threshold settings, and the formula for calculating the inhabitability index, the 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s inhabitable areas were calculated. The results show that the distribution of suitable habitat for O. decorus asiaticus in 2000 was similar to that in 2010. From 2010 to 2020, the suitability of the habitat for O. decorus asiaticus in the central region of the Mongolian Plateau changed from moderate to high. The main factor contributing to this change was accumulated precipitation. Few changes in the areas of the habitat with low suitability were observed across the study period. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the vulnerability of different regions on the Mongolian Plateau to plagues of O. decorus asiaticus and will aid the monitoring of grasshopper plagues in this region.

TI  - Taking Artificial Intelligence Into Space Through Objective Selection of Hyperspectral Earth Observation Applications: To bring the "brain" close to the "eyes" of satellite missions
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing hyperspectral imaging and artificial intelligence (AI) bring exciting opportunities to various fields of science and industry that can directly benefit from in-orbit data processing. Taking AI into space may accelerate the response to various events, as massively large raw hyperspectral images (HSIs) can be turned into useful information onboard a satellite; hence, the images' transfer to the ground becomes much faster and offers enormous scalability of AI solutions to areas across the globe. However, there are numerous challenges related to hardware and energy constraints, resource frugality of (deep) machine learning models, availability of ground truth data, and building trust in AI-based solutions. Unbiased, objective, and interpretable selection of an AI application is of paramount importance for emerging missions, as it influences all aspects of satellite design and operation. In this article, we tackle this issue and introduce a quantifiable procedure for objectively assessing potential AI applications considered for onboard deployment. To prove the flexibility of the suggested technique, we utilize the approach to evaluate AI applications for two fundamentally different missions: the Copernicus Hyperspectral Imaging Mission for the Environment (CHIME) [European Union/European Space Agency (ESA)] and the 6U nanosatellite Intuition-1 (KP Labs). We believe that our standardized process may become an important tool for maximizing the outcome of Earth observation (EO) missions through selecting the most relevant onboard AI applications in terms of scientific and industrial outcomes.

TI  - Canopy responses of Swedish primary and secondary forests to the 2018 drought
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Boreal forest ecosystems are predicted to experience more frequent summer droughts due to climate change, posing a threat to future forest health and carbon sequestration. Forestry is a regionally dominant land use where the managed secondary forests are typically even-aged forests with low structural and tree species diversity. It is not well known if managed secondary forests and unmanaged primary forests respond to drought differently in part because the location of primary, unmanaged, forests has remained largely unknown. Here we employed a unique map detailing over 300 primary forests in Sweden. We studied impacts of the 2018 nationwide drought by extracting and analyzing a high-resolution remote sensing vegetation index over the primary forests and over buffer zones around the primary forests representing secondary forests. We controlled for topographical variations linked to soil moisture, which was a strong determinant of drought responses, and analyzed Landsat-derived EVI2 anomalies during the drought year from a multiyear non-drought baseline. We found that primary forests were less affected by the drought compared to secondary forests. Our results indicate that forestry may exacerbate the impact of drought in a future climate with more frequent and extreme hydroclimatic events.

TI  - Spaceborne Relative Radiometer: Instrument Design and Pre-Flight Test
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to simultaneously determine the values of total solar irradiance (TSI) and the Earth's radiation at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) on board the Fengyun-3F satellite, a spaceborne relative radiometer (SRR) was developed. It adopts a dual-channel structure, including a solar radiometer channel (SR) with an unobstructed field of view (FOV) of 1.5 & DEG; and an Earth radiometer channel (ER) with a wide field of view (WFOV) of 95.3 & DEG; and a diameter of about 1900 km on the ground. Before the launch, both the SR and ER were calibrated. The SR, installed on the inner frame of the solar tracker of the SIM-II (solar irradiance monitor-II), is used to observe rapid changes in solar radiance with the SIAR (solar irradiance absolute radiometer), an electrical-substitution radiometer, on orbit. The ER is mounted on the U-shaped frame of the solar tracker, directly pointing in the nadir direction. Additionally, a dark space observation mode is used to determine the on-orbit background noise and lunar observation mode for on-orbit calibration. In this article, the instrument design and working principle of the SRR is first introduced, and an analysis of the measurement model of the ER, the WFOV channel of the SRR, is focused on. Finally, ground test results of the SRR are introduced.

TI  - Monitoring of Cropland Abandonment Based on Long Time Series Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Fujian Province, China
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland is the basis for human survival and development. The phenomenon of cropland abandonment has seriously affected national agricultural production and food security. In this study, remote sensing monitoring of abandoned cropland is carried out based on multisource time series remote sensing data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. Landsat and Sentinel-2 time series data from 2010-2021 were used to obtain monthly synthetic cloud-free image sets in combination with cropland plot data. The time series farmland probability dataset was generated using the random forest classification method. The LandTrendr algorithm was used to extract and analyse the time series cropland probability dataset. Finally, this study also explored the drivers of change in abandoned cropland in Fujian Province. The results show that (1) the LandTrendr algorithm can effectively extract abandoned farmland and avoid the impact of pseudovariation resulting from non-farmland categories. A total of 87.02% of the abandoned farmland was extracted in 2018; 87.50% of the abandoned farmland was extracted in 2020. (2) The abandoned area in Fujian Province fluctuated after a significant increase in 2012, with the abandoned area exceeding 30 thousand hectares. Since 2017, the abandoned area has decreased to slightly below 30 thousand hectares. (3) The regression results of the factors affecting abandoned cropland in Fujian Province show that the increase in the number of agricultural workers and the improvement in soil organic matter content will significantly reduce the area of abandoned cropland in Fujian Province, while the increase in the rate of urbanization, poor road accessibility, and insufficient irrigation conditions will increase the area of abandoned cropland. The results of this study are useful for conducting surveys of cropland abandonment and obtaining timely and accurate data on cropland abandonment. The results of this study are of great significance for the development of effective measures to stop the abandonment of cropland, and ensure the implementation of food security strategies.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Characteristics and Driving Forces of Aboveground Biomass in Desert Steppes of Inner Mongolia, China in the Past 20 Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The desert steppe serves as a transitional zone between grasslands and deserts, and long-term monitoring of aboveground biomass (AGB) in the desert steppe is essential for understanding grassland changes. While AGB observation techniques based on multisource remote-sensing data and machine-learning algorithms have been widely applied, research on monitoring methods specifically for the desert steppe remains limited. In this study, we focused on the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China, as the study area and used field sampling data, MODIS data, MODIS-based vegetation indices (VI), and environmental factors (topography, climate, and soil) to compare the performance of four commonly used machine-learning algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least-squares regression (PLS), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) in AGB estimation. Based on the optimal model, the spatial-temporal characteristics of AGB from 2000 to 2020 were calculated, and the driving forces of climate change and human activities on AGB changes were quantitatively analyzed using the random forest algorithm. The results are as follows: (1) RF demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of prediction accuracy and model robustness, making it suitable for AGB estimation in the desert steppe of Inner Mongolia; (2) VI contributed the most to the model, and no significant difference was found between soil-adjusted VIs and traditional VIs. Elevation, slope, precipitation, and temperature all had positive effects on the model; (3) from 2000 to 2020, the multiyear average AGB in the study area was 58.34 g/m(2), exhibiting a gradually increasing distribution pattern from the inner region to the outer region (from north to south); (4) from 2000 to 2020, the proportions of grassland with AGB slightly and significantly increasing trend in the study area were 87.08% and 5.13%, respectively, while the proportions of grassland with AGB slightly and significantly decreasing trend were 7.76% and 0.05%, respectively; and (5) over the past 20 years, climate change, particularly precipitation, has been the primary driving force behind AGB changes of the study area. This research holds reference value for improving desert steppe monitoring capabilities and the rational planning of grassland resources.

TI  - Sensitivity of Grassland Coverage to Climate across Environmental Gradients on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland cover is strongly influenced by climate change. The response of grassland cover to climate change becomes complex with background climate. There have been some advances in research on the sensitivity of grassland vegetation to climate change around the world, but the differences in climate sensitivity among grassland types are still unclear in alpine grassland. Therefore, we applied MODIS NDVI data and trend analysis methods to quantify the spatial and temporal variation of grassland vegetation cover on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Then, we used multiple regression models to analyze the sensitivity of fractional vegetation cover (FVC) to climatic factors (Temperature, Precipitation, Solar radiation, Palmer drought severity index) and summarized the potential mechanisms of vegetation sensitivity to different climatic gradients. Our results showed (1) a significant increasing trend in alpine desert FVC from 2000-2018 (1.12 x 10(-3)/a, R-2 = 0.56, p < 0.001) but no significant trend in other grassland types. (2) FVC sensitivity to climatic factors varied among grassland types, especially in the alpine desert, which had over 60% of the area with positive sensitivity to temperature, precipitation and PDSI. (3) The sensitivity of grassland FVC to heat factors decreases with rising ambient temperature while the sensitivity to moisture increases. Similarly, the sensitivity to moisture decreases while the sensitivity to thermal factors increases along the moisture gradient. Furthermore, the results suggest that future climate warming will promote grassland in cold and wet areas of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and may suppress vegetation in warmer areas. In contrast, the response of the alpine desert to future climate is more stable. Studying the impact of climate variation at a regional scale could enhance the adaptability of vegetation in future global climates.

TI  - Analysis of Dust Source and Dust Transport Path of a Typical Dust Event in Arid Area of Northwest China Based on HYSPLIT Model
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - As a kind of disastrous weather with great harmfulness, sandstorm event significantly impacts the ecological environment in Northwest China. This study, it is to explore the spatial-temporal evolution of a typical dust event in northwest China in 2016 based on ground-measured particulate matter data, MODIS data, OMI sensor data and CALIPSO LiDAR data. Firstly, the characteristics and pollution situation of typical urban air pollution sources in Northwest China were determined based on PM25/PM10 index. Then, the spatial distribution characteristics of dust levels in atmospheric aerosols were analyzed using MODIS image MCD19-A2 AOD data, OMAEROe data product OMAEROe data product AAI data and CALIPSO-Levell data. Finally, the backward trajectory of dust flow was simulated by the HYSPLIT model to determine the dust transport path in Northwest China. The results showed that the PM,0 index of Xining, Lanzhou and Yinchuan was more than 200 mu g center dot m(3) from April 30(th) to May 1(th), 2016, and their PM2.5/PM10 value was less than 0. 6, which was at a low level, indicating that the content of inhalable particulate matter in the air increases due to the influence of natural pollution sources. It could be inferred that this was the influence of the sandstorm event. Aerosol showed obvious horizontal variation during the sandstorm event. The sandstorm originated from the Southern Xinjiang Basin and continuously affected southern and central Xinjiang from May 1(th) to May 4(th). In addition, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia and some parts of Shaanxi were also affected. According to its spatial variation, the Taklimakan Desert was the center of the formation of aerosol pollution in this sandstorm event. The sandstorm event mainly affected the southern basin and central Xinjiang, and the northern part of Qinghai Province. It could be seen from the simulation results of the air flow track that the sandstorm event from April 30th to May 1(th), 2016, mainly affected Xinjiang and some areas of Qinghai through the westward path. What is more, the sandstorm material might have come from Southern Xinjiang basin and the Gurbangut Desert in the inner Junggar Basin of northern Xinjiang and Kazakhstan outside China. These results would provide an important scientific basis for suppressing the process of dust generation and protecting the sustainable development of an ecological environment in Northwest China.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution and Coupled Coordination of LUCC and ESV in Cities of the Transition Zone, Shenmu City, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the spatial-temporal evolution and the interconnectedness of land use/cover change (LUCC) and ecosystem service value (ESV). Such analysis can offer theoretical guidance and support decision-making for sustainable land resource development and ecological preservation in ecologically vulnerable cities within the Loess Plateau-Maowusu Desert transition zone. Utilizing Landsat data spanning 2000-2020, the paper examines the synergistic relationship between ESV and land use intensity in Shenmu City through bivariate spatial autocorrelation and the coupled coordination degree (CCD) model. Our findings indicate that the area of construction land in Shenmu City experienced the most significant change between 2000 and 2020, with a dynamism rate of 76.8%. This shift resulted in a decrease in the total ESV, from RMB 10.059 billion in 2000 to RMB 9.906 billion in 2020. The bivariate spatial autocorrelation analysis reveals a significant positive spatial correlation between ESV and land use intensity, while the CCD levels for both demonstrate a fluctuating yet overall upward trend over the 20-year period. The paper uncovers the spatial-temporal evolution of LUCC and ESV in Shenmu City along with their interconnected dynamics. The research outcomes can contribute valuable insights for reinforcing land resource utilization and promoting sustainable regional development within cities in the Loess Plateau-Maowusu Desert transition zone.

TI  - Monitoring the glaciers with remote sensing techniques to investigate the triggering mechanism of debris flow in Tianmo gully, Tibet
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - For glacierized mountain valleys with debris flow hazard, obtaining the glacier dynamic can facilitate the analyzing of the triggering mechanism of debris flow. Tianmo gully in Bomi County, Tibet is a prominent debris flow hazard. Large-scale debris flows occurred multiple times in this gully during the past two decades. In this study, Planet, TanDEM-X, and Sentinel 2 images were used to estimate the changes in glacier boundary during 2016 to 2021, the changes in glacier surface elevation during 2000 to 2016, and the changes in glacier flow velocity during 2016 to 2021. Results show that the glaciers did not surge or collapse before the large-scale debris flow occurred on 11 July 2018. By analyzing the optical images and meteorological data, we deemed that the rock debris surrounding the glaciers that was generated by rock collapse, the moraine and scattered ice in front of the glaciers, and the loose material generated by landslides in the middle-to-upstream part of the main gully, composed the triggering mass of the debris flow on 11 July 2018, and two consecutive days of heavy rainfall just before the debris flow saturated the moisture content of the mass and reduced the shear strength of the soil. Continuous light rain of the day directly induced the creeping of mass in high places, triggering the debris flow. Glaciers partly contributed mass and water source to the debris flow hazard in the Tianmo gully. The flow velocity of the glacier in Tianmo gully is notably higher than that of surrounding glaciers. The peak velocity of the glacier trunk is up to 0. 80 0. 02 m . d (1), which makes the glacial moraine accumulate fast. Meanwhile, the glacier meltwater lowers the threshold of rainfall to trigger the debris flow. No large-scale debris flow has occurred since July 2018. However, the side slopes in the mid-to-upstream and midstream parts of the main gully are steep and loose, which renders them prone to collapsing or sliding under the influence of rain and glacier meltwater. Unmanned aerial vehicle images show that a certain amount of loose material has already gathered at the bottom of the midstream part of the main gully. Moreover, the glacier flow will continuously increase the volume of the moraine. If the mass resource accumulates to a certain extent, heavy rainfall will trigger debris flow in the Tianmo gully again.

TI  - Vertical Distribution and Transport of Aerosols during a Dust Event in Xinjiang, Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust aerosols profoundly influence the radiative balance of the earth-atmosphere system and hence the global and regional climates. In this study, using multi-source satellite and ground-level observations combined with meteorological data, we investigated the three-dimensional evolution and transport characteristics of aerosols during a dust event that occurred in Xinjiang, China from 19 to 21 March 2019. Analysis of the meteorological data reveals that the dust air mass initially appeared in the northwest of Xinjiang and was subsequently transported to the Hami and Turpan areas due to the prevailing northwesterly winds, after which the direction of the airflow shifted due to topography, and the dust air masses were transported into southern Xinjiang. The air quality in the affected areas decreased rapidly, accompanied by a significant increase in aerosol optical depth (AOD), with the maximum value exceeding 3.5 in some areas. In addition, the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) data reveal that the aerosol particles in the dust-affected areas were mainly dust aerosols, with small amounts of pollutant dust aerosols. A reduction in the attenuated backscatter coefficient (& beta;532 & PAR;) was found with increasing altitude, with the dust aerosol pollution mainly distributed in the lower troposphere. The size of dust particles in the lower troposphere was relatively small and irregular. The depolarization ratio (PDR) values at altitudes of 8-10 km were relatively lower than those recorded in the lower troposphere, whereas the color ratio (CR) values were higher, which may have been influenced by the sparse vegetation coverage and poor subsurface conditions in Xinjiang, and attributable to the fact that regular large particles of dust are more likely to be dispersed to altitudes between 8 and 10 km within a short period of time. As a consequence of the meteorological conditions and topography, the dusting process in Xinjiang persisted for a relatively long period. These findings will contribute to enhanced understanding of the vertical distribution of aerosols in Northwest China.

TI  - Surface Properties of Global Land Surface Microwave Emissivity Derived from FY-3D/MWRI Measurements
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface microwave emissivity is crucial to the accurate retrieval of surface and atmospheric parameters and the assimilation of microwave data into numerical models over land. The microwave radiation imager (MWRI) sensors aboard on Chinese FengYun-3 (FY-3) series satellites provide valuable measurements for the derivation of global microwave physical parameters. In this study, an approximated microwave radiation transfer equation was used to estimate land surface emissivity from MWRI by using brightness temperature observations along with corresponding land and atmospheric properties obtained from ERA-Interim reanalysis data. Surface microwave emissivity at the 10.65, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89 GHz vertical and horizontal polarizations was derived. Then, the global spatial distribution and spectrum characteristics of emissivity over different land cover types were investigated. The seasonal variations of emissivity for different surface properties were presented. Furthermore, the error source was also discussed in our emissivity derivation. The results showed that the estimated emissivity was able to capture the major large-scale features and contains a wealth of information regarding soil moisture and vegetation density. The emissivity increased with the increase in frequency. The smaller surface roughness and increased scattering effect may result in low emissivity. Desert regions showed high emissivity microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) values, which suggested the high contrast between vertical and horizontal microwave signals in this region. The emissivity of the deciduous needleleaf forest in summer was almost the greatest among different land cover types. There was a sharp decrease in the emissivity at 89 GHz in the winter, possibly due to the influence of deciduous leaves and snowfall. The land surface temperature, the radio-frequency interference, and the high-frequency channel under cloudy conditions may be the main error sources in this retrieval. This work showed the potential capabilities of providing continuous and comprehensive global surface microwave emissivity from FY-3 series satellites for a better understanding of its spatiotemporal variability and underlying processes.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability Analysis of Vegetation Dynamics in China from 2000 to 2022 Based on Leaf Area Index: A Multi-Temporal Image Classification Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf Area Index (LAI) is one of the most important biophysical parameters of vegetation, and its dynamic changes can be used as a reflective indicator and differentiation basis of vegetation function. In this study, a VCA-MLC (Vertex Component Analysis-Maximum Likelihood Classification) algorithm is proposed from the perspective of multi-temporal satellite LAI image classification to monitor and quantify the spatial and temporal variability of vegetation dynamics in China since 2000. The algorithm extracts the vegetation endmembers from 46 multi-temporal images of MODIS LAI in 2011 without the aid of other a priori knowledge and uses the maximum likelihood classification method to select the categories that satisfy the requirements of the number of missing periods, absolute distance, and relative distance for the rest pixels to be classified, ultimately dividing the vegetation area of China into 10 vegetation zones called China Vegetation Functional Zones (CVFZ). CVFZ outperforms MCD12Q1 and CLCD land cover datasets in the overall differentiation of vegetation functions and can be used synergistically with other land cover datasets. In this study, CVFZ is used to cut the constant vegetation-type pixels of MCD12Q1 during 2001-2022. The results of the LAI mean time series decomposition of each subregion using the STL (Seasonal-Trend Decomposition based on Loess) method show that the rate of vegetation greening ranges from 9.02 x 10(-4) m(2)m(-2)yr(-1) in shrubland subregions to 2.34 x 10(-2) m(2)m(-2)yr(-1) in savanna subregions. In relative terms, the average greening speed of forests is moderate, and savannas tend to have the fastest average greening speed. The greening speed of grasslands and croplands in different zones varies widely. In contrast, the average greening speed of shrublands is the slowest. In addition, CVFZ detected grasslands with one or two phenological cycles, broadleaf croplands with one or two phenological cycles, and shrublands with no apparent or one phenological cycle.

TI  - Assessment and Projections of Marine Heatwaves in the Northwest Pacific Based on CMIP6 Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To assess the abilities of global climate models (GCMs) on simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of marine heatwaves (MHWs), GCMs from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Program in Phase 6 (CMIP6) were evaluated from a historical period between 1985 and 2014 in the Northwest Pacific Ocean using a dataset that synthesizes remote sensing data. MHW simulation capabilities were assessed using Rank Score (RS) and Comprehensive Rating (MR) metrics that include both spatial and temporal scoring metrics. It was found that most CMIP6 models overestimate cumulative intensity, while mean and maximum intensities, in addition to the duration, were underestimated in the historical period. Possible future changes in MHWs were also examined based on the rank-based weighting ensembles under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). MHWs were identified using both a fixed 30-year baseline and a 30-year sliding baseline. In all scenarios, all MHWs metrics except frequency will have an increasing trend for the fixed baseline method. The frequency of MHWs will decrease after the 2050s. Days will first increase and then stabilize under various scenarios. MHWs will take place for more than 300 days by the end of the 21st century for the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The cumulative intensity in the SSP5-8.5 scenario is roughly six times higher than that in the SSP1-2.6 scenario by the end of the 21st century. A fixed baseline will result in near-permanent MHWs at the end of the 21st century. There will be no permanent MHWs at the end of the 21st century. Using the 30-year shifting baseline to define the MHWs can improve future MHW projections by capturing the spatiotemporal variability features of the MHWs.

TI  - Integrative Digital Tools to Strengthen Data Management for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance in the "One Health" Domain in Nepal
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is increasing and represents one of the greatest public health challenges of our time, accounting for considerable morbidity and mortality globally. A "One Health" surveillance strategy, which integrates data concerning the resistant organisms circulating in humans, animals, and the environment, is required to monitor this issue and enable effective interventions. The timely collection, processing, analysis, and reporting of AMR surveillance data are necessary for the effective delivery of the information generated from such surveillance. Nepal has greatly improved its surveillance activities through a network of human and animal health laboratories; however, the data reported by sentinel laboratories are often inconsistent, incomplete, and delayed, causing challenges in terms of data cleaning, standardization, and visualization on a national level. To overcome these issues, innovative methods and procedures have been adopted in Nepal, with the development and customization of digital tools that reduce the human time and effort spent on data cleaning and standardization, with concomitant improvements in the accuracy of data. These standardized data can be uploaded to the district health information system 2 (DHIS2) One Health AMR surveillance portal, enabling the generation of reports that will help decision-makers and policy planners to combat the global problem of AMR.

TI  - Evaluation of the Ecological Quality of the Taishan Region Based on Landsat Series of Satellite Images
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The deterioration of ecological environment has seriously restricted regional sustainable development. Taishan region is one of the ecological protection and restoration of life community of mountains-rivers-forests-farmlands-lakes-grasslands in China. Its ecological quality changes are directly related to the overall layout of ecological restoration and protection projects. In this study, the Taishan region of China was taken as study area, and the grade change, spatial distribution, and spatial temporal fluctuation of the ecological environment quality were quantified. Based on the ENVI platform, the Landsat series of three images of the Taishan region in 2005, 2013, and 2017 serve as the data source, and the remote sensing ecological index model (RSEI) was used. According to the change characteristics of land use types, the driving factors of ecological environmental quality change were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) The area ratio of the ecological environment quality above the middle level was in order from large to small: 2005 (97.37%) > 2017 (91.46%) > 2013 (84.64%). (2) The overall quality of the ecological environment declined during the period of 2005-2013. (3) The overall change ranges from 2013 to 2017 are smaller than those from 2005 to 2013. The area of the deteriorating area decreased by 44.90%, and the area of the constant area and the area of the area that improved increased by 16.17% and 28.72%, respectively. During 2013-2017, the general trend is getting better and better. The improved areas were mainly concentrated in the main urban areas (Taishan District, Daiyue District), eastern Ningyang County, and western Xintai City. The research results can provide a scientific basis for the scientific evaluation of the ecological environment quality during the development and construction of the region, and have important value in the design and application of the ecological environment quality optimization path.

TI  - Assessment and driving factor of housing vacancies in Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - As the urbanization rate in the world has increased rapidly, the housing vacancy problem has become serious and attracting more attention. Calculating and analyzing vacant housing can help reduce the wasteful use of resources. This paper measures the housing vacancy rate and housing vacancy stock in the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration using night-time lighting and land use data. The results show that the average housing vacancy rate in the Shandong Peninsula urban agglomeration rose rapidly from 14.68% in 2000 to 29.71% in 2015 before declining slowly to 29.49% in 2020. Since urban population growth is lower than the housing construction rate, the average annual growth of housing vacancy stock between 2000 and 2020 exceeds 3 million square meters in megacities and is around 1-2 million square meters in large and medium-sized cities. The vacant housing has caused considerable waste of housing resources. The driving factors of the housing vacancy were further analyzed using the LMDI decomposition method. Results indicate that the economic development level is the most significant driving factor of the vacant housing stock. In addition, the value effect of unit floor areas is the major driving factor inhibiting the growth of vacant housing stock, while the decline of unit floor area value is conducive to the reduction of this stock.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of snow cover in montane meadows and forests using Planet imagery and machine learning
T2  - FRONTIERS IN WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain snowpack provides critical water resources for forest and meadow ecosystems that are experiencing rapid change due to global warming. An accurate characterization of snowpack heterogeneity in these ecosystems requires snow cover observations at high spatial resolutions, yet most existing snow cover datasets have a coarse resolution. To advance our observation capabilities of snow cover in meadows and forests, we developed a machine learning model to generate snow-covered area (SCA) maps from PlanetScope imagery at about 3-m spatial resolution. The model achieves a median F1 score of 0.75 for 103 cloud-free images across four different sites in the Western United States and Switzerland. It is more accurate (F1 score = 0.82) when forest areas are excluded from the evaluation. We further tested the model performance across 7,741 mountain meadows at the two study sites in the Sierra Nevada, California. It achieved a median F1 score of 0.83, with higher accuracy for larger and simpler geometry meadows than for smaller and more complexly shaped meadows. While mapping SCA in regions close to or under forest canopy is still challenging, the model can accurately identify SCA for relatively large forest gaps (i.e., 15m < DCE < 27m), with a median F1 score of 0.87 across the four study sites, and shows promising accuracy for areas very close (>10m) to forest edges. Our study highlights the potential of high-resolution satellite imagery for mapping mountain snow cover in forested areas and meadows, with implications for advancing ecohydrological research in a world expecting significant changes in snow.

TI  - Indocyanine Green and Methylene Blue Dye Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Early Breast Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Survival Study in 1574 Patients
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We collected 1574 breast cancer patients' clinicopathological and postoperative treatment follow-up data, who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy using a dual-tracer method of indocyanine green combined with methy-lene blue. By analyzing the statistical indicators including the identification rate, the number of sentinel lymph nodes, regional lymph node recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival, we conclude that indocya-nine green combined with methylene blue dualtracer method is safe and effective in sentinel lymph node biopsy in early breast cancer patients. Background: Currently, the standard tracing method is to use blue dyes and radioisotope as the tracer for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). However, there are variations in the choice of tracer in different countries and regions. Some new tracers are also gradually applied in clinical practice, but there is still a lack of long-term follow-up data to confirm their clinical application value. Patients and Methods: Clinicopathological and postoperative treatment follow-up data were collected from patients with early-stage cTis-2N0M0 breast cancer who underwent SLNB using a dual-tracer method of ICG combined with MB. Statistical indicators including the identification rate, the number of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), regional lymph node recurrence, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: Among the 1574 patients, SLNs were successfully detected during surgery in 1569 patients, with a detection rate of 99.7%; the median number of SLNs removed was 3. A total of 1531 patients were included in the survival analysis, with a median follow-up of 4.7 (0.5-7.9) years. In total, patients with positive SLNs had a 5-year DFS and OS of 90.6% and 94.7%, respectively. The 5-year DFS and OS of patients with negative SLNs were 95.6% and 97.3%, respectively. The postoperative regional lymph node recurrence rate was 0.7% in patients with negative SLNs. Conclusion: Indocyanine green combined with methylene blue dual-tracer method is safe and effective in sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early breast cancer.

TI  - Multiscale Analysis and Prediction of Sea Level in the Northern South China Sea Based on Tide Gauge and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the influence of global warming, the problem of sea-level rise is becoming increasingly prominent. The northern part of the South China Sea (SCS) is low lying, with intense economic development, and densely populated. These characteristics make the region extremely sensitive to the consequences of rising sea levels. This study aims to reveal the trends of sea-level changes in the northern SCS and provide scientific insights into the potential flooding risks in low-lying areas. To achieve this, the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method is used to analyze the water level time series data from three tide gauges along the coast of Hong Kong. This analysis reveals the multidimensional change characteristics and response mechanisms of the sea level in the SCS. The findings reveal distinct seasonal, interannual, decadal, and interdecadal variations in sea-level changes. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on sea-level changes in the study area, finding a 6-month lagged correlation between the sea level and ENSO. Spatially, the rate of sea-level change is faster in nearshore areas than in the open ocean and higher in the northern regions than in the southern regions. The Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA) method is employed to analyze the sea-level change time series, revealing long-range correlations and multifractal characteristics. In addition, we propose a sea-level prediction method that combines EEMD with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and conducts empirical research on sea-level changes in the northern South China Sea. The results indicate that the EEMD-LSTM model outperforms the standalone LSTM model in terms of predictive accuracy, effectively eliminating noise from signals and providing a valuable reference. In summary, this research delves into the multiscale characteristics and influencing factors of sea-level changes in the northern SCS, proposing an improved sea-level prediction method that integrates EEMD and LSTM. The findings lay the groundwork for evaluating the risks of sea-level rise in low-lying regions of the northern SCS and inform future response strategies.

TI  - Changes in the landscape patterns of Black-necked Crane habitat and its correlation with their individual population numbers during the past 40 years in China.
T2  - Ecology and Evolution
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape pattern of the Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis) habitat in China changed at different spatial scales and long-term periods due to natural factors and human activities, and habitat reduction and fragmentation threatened the survival of Black-necked Cranes. The factors driving the habitat landscape pattern and individual population changes of Black-necked Cranes remain to be studied. In this paper, based on remote sensing data of land use from 1980 to 2020, the changes in landscape pattern and fragmentation of the Black-necked Crane habitat in China over 40years were analyzed from two different spatial scales using the land cover transfer matrix and landscape index. The correlation between landscape and Black-necked Crane individual population was analyzed. The most obvious observations were as follows: (1) Although transformation between landscapes occurred to varying degrees, the area of wetlands and arable land in the breeding and the wintering areas (net) increased significantly from 1980 to 2020. (2) Habitat fragmentation existed in the breeding and the wintering area and was more obvious in the wintering area. (3) The number of individuals of Black-necked Cranes increased period by period, and habitat fragmentation did not inhibit their population growth. (4) The number of individuals of Black-necked Crane was closely related to the wetland and arable land. The increasing area of wetlands and arable and the increasing landscape shape complexity all contributed to the growth of the individual population. The results also suggested that the number of individuals of Black-necked Crane was not threatened by the expanding arable land in China, and they might benefit from arable landscapes. The conservation of Black-necked Cranes should focus on the relationship between individual Black-necked Cranes and arable landscapes, and the conservation of other waterbirds should also focus on the relationship between individual waterbirds and other landscapes.

TI  - Changes in the landscape patterns of Black-necked Crane habitat and its correlation with their individual population numbers during the past 40 years in China
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The landscape pattern of the Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis) habitat in China changed at different spatial scales and long-term periods due to natural factors and human activities, and habitat reduction and fragmentation threatened the survival of Black-necked Cranes. The factors driving the habitat landscape pattern and individual population changes of Black-necked Cranes remain to be studied. In this paper, based on remote sensing data of land use from 1980 to 2020, the changes in landscape pattern and fragmentation of the Black-necked Crane habitat in China over 40 years were analyzed from two different spatial scales using the land cover transfer matrix and landscape index. The correlation between landscape and Black-necked Crane individual population was analyzed. The most obvious observations were as follows: (1) Although transformation between landscapes occurred to varying degrees, the area of wetlands and arable land in the breeding and the wintering areas (net) increased significantly from 1980 to 2020. (2) Habitat fragmentation existed in the breeding and the wintering area and was more obvious in the wintering area. (3) The number of individuals of Black-necked Cranes increased period by period, and habitat fragmentation did not inhibit their population growth. (4) The number of individuals of Black-necked Crane was closely related to the wetland and arable land. The increasing area of wetlands and arable and the increasing landscape shape complexity all contributed to the growth of the individual population. The results also suggested that the number of individuals of Black-necked Crane was not threatened by the expanding arable land in China, and they might benefit from arable landscapes. The conservation of Black-necked Cranes should focus on the relationship between individual Black-necked Cranes and arable landscapes, and the conservation of other waterbirds should also focus on the relationship between individual waterbirds and other landscapes.

TI  - Using Sentinel Plots to Monitor for Changes in Thrips Susceptibility to MON 88702 Cotton Containing the Cry51Aa2.834_16 <i>Bt</i> Protein
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Transgenic Bt crops are important tools for growers to manage insect pests, but their use is threatened by the evolution of insect resistance, and monitoring programs are essential in detecting and responding to resistance. For Bt products in which insect control is not complete ("non-high-dose crops"), resistance monitoring is challenging, because insects and insect damage will be present even without resistance. Given these challenges, "sentinel plots" (designated monitoring plots) consisting of Bt and non-Bt control plots have been used to monitor for insect resistance to non-high-dose Bt crops by assessing changes in the efficacy of a Bt crop over time relative to a non-Bt control. We used this approach for ThryvOn & TRADE; cotton, a new non-high-dose Bt product targeting two sucking pest types-Lygus and thrips-and report here on the thrips monitoring program. Monitoring for insect resistance over time requires knowledge of the baseline susceptibility, which is the initial assessment of the insect population response to a given Bt crop prior to its widespread adoption. To characterize the baseline susceptibility of thrips to ThryvOn, we tested several approaches and found that the number of immature thrips on ThryvOn relative to the control cotton best characterized the efficacy of the trait. Transgenic Bt crops are important tools for growers to manage insect pests, but their durability is threatened by the evolution of insect resistance. Implementing a resistance monitoring program is essential to detect and mitigate resistance. For non-high-dose Bt crops, resistance monitoring is challenging, because insect control is not complete, so targeted insects and insect damage will be present even without resistance. Given these challenges, sentinel plots have been used to monitor for insect resistance to non-high-dose crops by assessing changes in the efficacy of a Bt crop over time relative to a non-Bt control. We optimized a sentinel plot resistance monitoring approach for MON 88702 ThryvOn & TRADE; cotton, a new non-high-dose Bt product targeting two sucking pest taxa-Lygus (L. lineolaris and L. hesperus) and thrips (Frankliniella fusca and F. occidentalis)-and report here on the thrips monitoring methods and results. Quantifying thrips immatures was the best metric to characterize the impact of the trait, with at least a 40-60% average reduction of thrips immatures on ThryvOn relative to the control cotton at all sites with higher thrips densities. These data can be used within a ThryvOn resistance monitoring program and represent a case study for establishing a resistance monitoring approach for a non-high-dose trait product.

TI  - Continuous evolution and emerging lineage of seasonal human coronaviruses: A multicenter surveillance study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have zoonotic origins, repeated infections, and global transmission. The objectives of this study are to elaborate the epidemiological and evolutionary characteristics of HCoVs from patients with acute respiratory illness. We conducted a multicenter surveillance at 36 sentinel hospitals of Beijing Metropolis, China, during 2016-2019. Patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) were included, and submitted respiratory samples for screening HCoVs by multiplex real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. All the positive samples were used for metatranscriptomic sequencing to get whole genomes of HCoVs for genetical and evolutionary analyses. Totally, 321 of 15 677 patients with ILI or SARI were found to be positive for HCoVs, with an infection rate of 2.0% (95% confidence interval, 1.8%-2.3%). HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1 infections accounted for 18.7%, 38.3%, 40.5%, and 2.5%, respectively. In comparison to ILI cases, SARI cases were significantly older, more likely caused by HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, and more often co-infected with other respiratory pathogens. A total of 179 full genome sequences of HCoVs were obtained from 321 positive patients. The phylogenetical analyses revealed that HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 continuously yielded novel lineages, respectively. The nonsynonymous to synonymous ratio of all key genes in each HCoV was less than one, indicating that all four HCoVs were under negative selection pressure. Multiple substitution modes were observed in spike glycoprotein among the four HCoVs. Our findings highlight the importance of enhancing surveillance on HCoVs, and imply that more variants might occur in the future.

TI  - Spatiotemporal statistical analysis of water area changes with climatic variables using Google Earth Engine for Lakes Region in Turkiye
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, trend analysis of the lake surface areas was performed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform in the period of 1985-2022 with Landsat 5/7/8/9 (TM) (ETM +), and (OLI) satellite images. The study analyzed 10 lakes, including Acigol, Aksehir, Beysehir, Burdur, Egirdir, Ilgin, Isikli, Karatas, Salda, and Yarisli in the Turkiye Lakes Region. In this analysis, the normalized differentiated water index was calculated for each of the 3147 satellite images, and water surfaces were extracted from other details using Otsu's threshold method. In the study's accuracy, the overall accuracy and F1-score values were calculated to be over 90% for all lakes. Moreover, the relationship between the changes in the surface areas of the lakes was evaluated using correlation analysis, with the sea surface temperature obtained from the NOAA satellite and the evaporation, temperature, and precipitation parameters obtained from the Era-5 satellite being used. In addition, the change of the area on the lake surface was analysed using Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope, and sequential MK test statistics. During the 37 years between 1985 and 2022, there was no significant change in the Acigol surface area, but a slight increasing trend was observed. Decreases of 76.07, 4.68, 41.77, 5.44, 37.56, 28.97, 78.65, 7.26, and 81.02% were determined in the lakes of Aksehir, Beysehir, Burdur, Egirdir, Ilgin, Isikli, Karatas, Salda, and Yarisli, respectively. The application of this method in the lakes region and monitoring these lakes, which are of great importance for Turkiye, provide valuable information in determining the lakes' organizational strategies.

TI  - Is mango farming sustainable? An integrated analysis of remote sensing techniques and smallholder farmers' perception in mango farming communities in Ghana
T2  - GHANA SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In sub-Sahara Africa, sustainable agricultural sector has been trumpeted as the surest way for livelihood transformation through poverty reduction and ensuring food and nutritional security. Using mango farming as a case study, the paper determines how sustainable agriculture can be achieved by examining the environmental, social and economic impacts of mango farms in a rural setting. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to collect primary data from 400 respondents from the Shai Osu-Doku and Yilo-Krobo Districts of the Greater Accra and Eastern Regions respectively of Ghana. Secondary data, especially Landsat images between 2000 and 2020 were acquired and analysed. The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and cross-tabulations, while the qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis and quotations from respondents. The findings show some positive outlook socioeconomically and environmentally. Socioeconomically, mango farming has led to an increase in incomes for farmers, reduced out-migration of the youth, ensured food security, and provided enough money to take of children's' education, health, and other social needs of the families. Environmentally, there is an improvement in the vegetal cover which has a positive impact on carbon sequestration, air filtering and soil conservation. The study confirms the sustainability of mango production as it is a viable business, provides good incomes and ensures access to food. To ensure sustainability and livelihood transformation, we recommend policies and measures to put in place to reduce the challenges that smallholder mango producers face to sustain and promote mango production.

TI  - A Study on Spatial Distribution Extraction of Tidal Inundated Mangroves Based on High and Low Tide Level Images
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A majority of mangroves are located in the coastal intertidal zone and are subject to tidal periodic inundation. However, the previous vegetation indices used for extracting the spatial distribution of mangroves were not able to effectively extract submerged mangroves, and the applicability of the vegetation indices used on different spatial resolution images obtained from different sensors was not verified. In this study, a new vegetation index, namely the intertidal mangrove identification indices (IMIIs), was proposed, based on GF-2 images of high and low tide levels. Meanwhile, other commonly used vegetation indices were also extracted. All the vegetation indices were used to extract the spatial distribution of mangroves under tidal inundation, and applicability tests of the vegetation indices were conducted on Sentinel-2 images in three different regions. It was found that the IMIIs proposed based on GF-2 images of high and low tide levels can extract submerged mangroves relatively well, and the spatial distribution extraction results of mangroves are better than those of other vegetation indices, with IMII2 outperforming IMII1. At the same time, IMIIs have good applicability in medium resolution Sentinel-2 images, and there are relatively large differences in the extraction results of mangrove spatial distribution among different vegetation indices in areas with significant impact of tidal inundation. Among all vegetation indices, the extraction results of IMIIs are relatively superior. In most cases, multi variables collaborative application can improve the accuracy of mangrove spatial distribution extraction results. Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that the IMIIs proposed in this study can accurately extract the spatial distribution of mangroves inundated by tides from both medium- and high-resolution images, providing accurate basic data for effective management and scientific protection of mangrove resources.

M3  - Article
AB  - Population pro jec tions pro vide pre dic tions of future pop u la tion sizes for an area. Historically, most population projections have been produced using deterministic or sce nario-based approaches and have not assessed uncer tainty about future pop u la tion change. Starting in 2015, how ever, the United Nations (UN) has pro duced prob a bi lis tic pop u la tion pro jec tions for all countries using a Bayes ian approach. There is also con sid-erable interest in subnational probabilistic population projections, but the UN's national approach can not be used directly for this pur pose, because within-coun try cor re la tions in fer til ity and mor tal ity are gen er ally larger than between-coun try ones, migra tion is not constrained in the same way, and there is a need to account for col lege and other spe cial pop u la tions, par tic u larly at the county level. We pro pose a Bayes ian method for producing subnational population projections, including migration and accounting for col lege pop u la tions, by build ing on but mod i fy ing the UN approach. We illus trate our approach by apply ing it to the counties of Washington State and com par ing the results with extant deterministic projections produced by Washington State demographers. Out-of-sam ple exper i ments show that our method gives accu rate and well-calibrated fore casts and fore cast inter vals. In most cases, our inter vals were narrower than the growth-based inter vals issued by the state, par tic u larly for shorter time hori zons.

TI  - Simulation and Analysis of the Dynamic Characteristics of Groundwater in Taliks in the Eruu Area, Central Yakutia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The perennially unfrozen zones (taliks) in the Eruu area of central Yakutia have a complex stratigraphic structure, and the dynamic characteristics of groundwater in this region have been insufficiently studied. This study analyzed the results of the explorations and geophysical studies conducted by the Melnikov Permafrost Institute of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science. In addition, we simulated and analyzed the dynamic characteristics of groundwater in the area based on hydro-meteorological data, snow data, and remote sensing data. During the process, the dynamic changes in the attributes of aquifers due to the seasonal freeze-thaw processes of soils, including the active layer, were also taken into account. The results showed the following: (1) According to the analysis of the measured data on water levels in hydrogeological observation well 14E/2014, the difference between the simulated and measured values of groundwater levels in monitoring wells for over 99% of the measurements was less than 0.1 m. The average difference between the measured (excluding missing values) and simulated values of groundwater level in the monitoring wells was 0.028 m/d. (2) The annual average water level in the study area declined. The simulated value dropped at a rate of 0.10 m/a, with only a gap of 0.01 m/a with the measured value. Meanwhile, the simulated water head was greatly influenced by the terrain, especially in the central area, where the head decreased rapidly from the perimeter toward the lakes (8.9 m/km on average). (3) From 1 September 2014 to 31 August 2015, the mean value of the simulated discharge in the study area was 3888.39 L/d, which was in line with the results of previous monitoring (the average flow was 4147.20 L/d and 3715.20 L/d in 2014 and 2015, respectively). This study can provide a reference for the reasonable exploitation and utilization of groundwater under the influence of the distribution of perennially unfrozen zones, or taliks, and provides an effective three-dimensional modeling method for quantifying the analysis of groundwater dynamics in permafrost regions.

TI  - Diverging climate response of corn yield and carbon use efficiency across the US
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we developed an open-source package to analyze the overall trend and responses of both carbon use efficiency (CUE) and corn yield to climate factors for the contiguous United States. Our algorithm enables automatic retrieval of remote sensing data through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agricultural production data at the county level through application programming interface (API). Firstly, we integrated satellite products of net primary productivity and gross primary productivity based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor, and climatic variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Secondly, we calculated CUE and commonly used climate metrics. Thirdly, we investigated the spatial heterogeneity of these variables. We applied a random forest algorithm to identify the key climate drivers of CUE and crop yield, and estimated the responses of CUE and yield to climate variability using the spatial moving window regression across the U.S. Our results show that growing degree days (GDD) has the highest predictive power for both CUE and yield, while extreme degree days (EDD) is the least important explanatory variable. Moreover, we observed that in most areas of the U.S., yield increases or stays the same with higher GDD and precipitation. However, CUE decreases with higher GDD in the north and shows more mixed and fragmented interactions in the south. Notably, there are some exceptions where yield is negatively correlated with precipitation in the Missouri and Mississippi River Valleys. As global warming continues, we anticipate a decrease in CUE throughout the vast northern part of the country, despite the possibility of yield remaining stable or increasing.

TI  - Radar Echo Reconstruction in Oceanic Area via Deep Learning of Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A conventional way to monitor severe convective weather is using the composite reflectivity of radar as an indicator. For oceanic areas without radar deployment, reconstruction from satellite data is useful. However, those reconstruction models built on a land dataset are not directly applicable to the ocean due to different underlying surfaces. In this study, we built reconstruction models based on U-Net (named STR-UNet) for different underlying surfaces (land, coast, offshore, and sea), and evaluated their applicability to the ocean. Our results suggest that the comprehensive use of land, coast, and offshore datasets should be more suitable for reconstruction in the ocean than using the sea dataset. The comprehensive performances (in terms of RMSE, MAE, POD, CSI, FAR, and BIAS) of the Land-Model, Coast-Model, and Offshore-Model in the ocean are superior to those of the Sea-Model, e.g., with RMSE being 5.61, 6.08, 5.06, and 7.73 in the oceanic area (Region B), respectively. We then analyzed the importance of different types of features on different underlying surfaces for reconstruction by using interpretability methods combined with physical meaning. Overall, satellite cloud-related features are most important, followed by satellite water-related features and satellite temperature-related features. For the transition of the model from land to coast, then offshore, the importance of satellite water-related features gradually increases, while the importance of satellite cloud-related features and satellite temperature-related features gradually decreases. It is worth mentioning that in the offshore region, the importance of satellite water-related features slightly exceeds the importance of satellite cloud-related features. Finally, based on the performance of the case, the results show that the STR-UNet reconstruction models we established can accurately reconstruct the shape, location, intensity, and range of the convective center, achieving the goal of detecting severe convective weather where a radar is not present.

TI  - Characterizing Sprawl Development in Urban China: A Perspective from Urban Amenity
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl in China presents unique characteristics that differ from those commonly studied in Western contexts, an aspect not fully explored in previous studies. Therefore, taking Wuhan, Hubei as an example and integrating population data, remote sensing data, and POI data, this research offers a perspective on sprawl development in urban China. By incorporating population, urban land use, and urban amenities, this study measures their dynamics to classify urban spaces and employs spatial regression models to identify the characteristics of sprawl development with spatial effects controlled. It further applies geographically weighted regression to examine the underlying spatial heterogeneity. The findings indicate that population growth and urban land expansion do not align perfectly, and further exploration identifies the various trends of sprawl development in urban core and periphery areas. On the other hand, some suburban areas show compact development trends, but the growth of local amenities may be limited due to the historical sprawl development legacies. Regression results reveal specific characteristics of this sprawl development. Key findings include the following: (1) shaped by the triple process of sprawl development of urban renewal, suburbanization, and rural revitalization, Wuhan shows a significant core-periphery structure with the trend of polycentricity; (2) overcrowding in central urban districts is the primary driver of sprawl development; (3) most traditional suburbs in Wuhan have emerged as a consequence of rapid urbanization with a legacy of sprawl development; (4) spatial heterogeneity across urban spaces highlights the necessity for locally tailored approaches to regulating sprawl development.

TI  - Three-dimensional histological electrophoresis enables fast automatic distinguishment of cancer margins and lymph node metastases
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tissue diagnosis is important during surgical excision of solid tumors for margin evaluation. Conventional histopathologic methods rely heavily on image-based visual diagnosis by specialized pathologists, which can be time-consuming and subjective. We report a three-dimensional (3D) histological electrophoresis system for rapid labeling and separation of the proteins within tissue sections, providing a more precise assessment of tumor-positive margin in surgically resected tissues. The 3D histological electrophoresis system uses a tumor- seeking dye labeling strategy to visualize the distribution of tumor-specific proteins within sections and a tumor finder that automatically predicts the tumor contour. We successfully demonstrated the system's capability to predict the tumor contours from five murine xenograft models and distinguish the tumor-invaded region of sentinel lymph nodes. Specifically, we used the system to accurately assess tumor-positive margins from 14 patients with cancer. Our 3D histological electrophoresis system serves as an intraoperative tissue assessment technology for more accurate and automatic pathologic diagnosis.

TI  - A High-Performance Automated Large-Area Land Cover Mapping Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mapping plays a pivotal role in global resource monitoring, sustainable development research, and effective management. However, the complexity of the mapping process, coupled with significant computational and data storage requirements, often leads to delays between data processing and product publication, thereby bringing challenges to creating multi-timesteps large-area products for monitoring dynamic land cover. Therefore, improving the efficiency of each stage in land cover mapping and automating the mapping process is currently an urgent issue to be addressed. This study proposes a high-performance automated large-area land cover mapping framework (HALF). By leveraging Docker and workflow technologies, the HALF effectively tackles model heterogeneity in complex land cover mapping processes, thereby simplifying model deployment and achieving a high degree of decoupling between production models. It optimizes key processes by incorporating high-performance computing techniques. To validate these methods, this study utilized Landsat imagery data and extracted samples using GLC_FCS and FROM_GLC, all of which were acquired at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Several 10 & DEG; x 10 & DEG; regions were chosen globally to illustrate the viability of generating large-area land cover using the HALF. In the sample collection phase, the HALF introduced an automated method for generating samples, which overlayed multiple prior products to generate a substantial number of samples, thus saving valuable manpower resources. Additionally, the HALF utilized high-performance computing technology to enhance the efficiency of the sample-image matching phase, thereby achieving a speed that was ten times faster than traditional matching methods. In the mapping stage, the HALF employed adaptive classification models to train the data in each region separately. Moreover, to address the challenge of handling a large number of classification results in a large area, the HALF utilized a parallel mosaicking method for classification results based on the concept of grid division, and the average processing time for a single image was approximately 6.5 s.

TI  - AM-GM Algorithm for Evaluating, Analyzing, and Correcting the Spatial Scaling Bias of the Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial variable in climate, ecological, and land surface modeling. However, the estimation of the LAI from coarse-resolution remote sensing data can be affected by the spatial scaling bias, which arises from the nonlinearity of retrieval models and the heterogeneity of the land surface. This study provides an algorithm named Arithmetic Mean and Geometric Mean (AM-GM) to correct the spatial scaling bias. It is established based on negative logarithmic functions and avoids second-order stationarity. In this algorithm, relationships are derived between the scaling bias of LAI and the arithmetic and geometric means of directional gap probability for two commonly used remote sensing models, the Beer-Lambert law and a semi-empirical transfer function, respectively. According to the AM-GM algorithm, the expression representing the model nonlinearity is derived and utilized for the analysis of LAI scaling bias. Furthermore, the AM-GM algorithm is simplified by a linear relationship, which is constructed between two quantities related to the directional gap probability between two specific resolutions. Two scenes simulated by the LargE-Scale remote sensing data and image Simulation framework (LESS) model and three sites are used to evaluate the proposed algorithm and analyze the scaling bias of LAI. The validation results show that the AM-GM algorithm provides accurate correction of LAI scaling bias. The analyses based on the AM-GM algorithm demonstrate that the scaling bias of LAI increases with the increase in the LAI value, with stronger surface heterogeneity and coarser spatial resolution. The validation results of the simplified AM-GM algorithm demonstrate that at the Sud-Ouest site, the absolute value of the bias for the estimated LAI decreases from 0.10, 0.22, 0.29, and 0.31 to 0.04, 0.01, 0.04, and 0.05 at 200 m, 500 m, 1000 m, and 1500 m resolutions, respectively. In conclusion, the proposed algorithm is effective in the analysis and correction of the scaling bias for coarse-resolution LAI.

TI  - Visible and Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Diurnal Variation Calibration for Corn Phenotyping Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing coupled with hyperspectral technology has become increasingly popular to investigate plant traits, showcasing its advantages in studying plant growth, health, and productivity. The quality of the collected hyperspectral images is crucial for subsequent data analysis and plant phenotyping studies. However, diurnal variations in spectral characteristics introduce more data variance in canopy reflectance spectra, raising the cost of subsequent analyses and compromising the performance of trait estimation models. In this study, a fixed gantry platform in a cornfield was used to capture visible and near-infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral images of corn canopies at consecutive time intervals. By applying reference board calibration and locally weighted scatterplot smoothing to minimize the effects of ambient light and daily growth, diurnal spectral changes across all involved VNIR wavelengths were investigated. Several distinct diurnal patterns were observed to have close connections with the plants' physiological effects. Diurnal calibration models were established at every wavelength by employing the least squares polynomial algorithm, with the highest coefficient of determination reaching 0.84. Moreover, by employing diurnal calibration in canopy spectra processing, the reduction in spectral variance brought about by varying imaging time was evidently exhibited. This study not only reveals the diurnal spectral variation pattern at VNIR bands but also offers a reliable, straightforward, and low-cost approach to improve the quality of remote sensing data and reduce the inherent variance brought about via the different imaging times ensuring that comparable spectral analysis can be performed under relatively fair conditions.

TI  - Assimilation of FY-3D and FY-3E Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Observation and Its Impact on Numerical Weather Prediction during Spring Season over the Continental United States
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - As a part of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Observing System, HIRAS-1 and HIRAS-2's observations' impact on improving the accuracy of numerical weather prediction (NWP) can be summarized into two questions: (1) Will HIRAS observation help the NWP system to improve its accuracy? (2) Which instrument has the greater impact on NWP? To answer the questions, four experiments are designed here: (I) the HIRAS-1 experiment, which assimilates the principal component (PC) scores derived from HIRAS-1 radiance observation from the FY-3D satellite; (II) the HIRAS-2 experiment, which assimilates HIRAS-2 (onboard the FY-3E satellite) radiance-observation-derived PC scores; (III) the J-01 experiment, which assimilates JPSS1 CrIS radiance-observation-derived PC scores; (IV) the control experiment. Each experiment generated a series of forecasts with 24 h lead-time from 16 March 2022 to 12 April 2022 using the Unified Forecast System Short-Range Weather application. Forecast evaluation using radiosonde and aircraft observation reveals: (a) for upper-level variables (i.e., temperature and specific humidity), assimilating HIRAS observation can improve the NWP's performance by decreasing the standard deviation (Stdev) and increasing the anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC); (b) according to the multi-category Heidke skill score, HIRAS assimilation experiments, especially the HIRAS-2 experiment, have a higher agreement with hourly precipitation observations; (c) based on two tornado-outbreak case studies, which occurred on 30 March 2022 and 5 April 2022, HIRAS observation can increase the predicted intensity of 0-1 km storm relative helicity and decrease the height of the lifted condensation level at tornado outbreak locations; and (d) compared to CrIS, HIRAS-2 still has room for improvement.

TI  - The spatiotemporal response of photosynthetic accumulation per leaf area to climate change on alpine grassland
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterizing the photosynthetic capacity of grassland is essential for exploring the carbon cycle under climate change. However, little research has been conducted to date on photosynthetic accumulation per leaf area (NPP/LAI) in spatial and temporal terms, especially on how they respond to climate change. Hence, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of NPP/LAI based on MODIS products, explored the partial correlation of NPP/LAI with climatic factors for the annual and growing season, and quantified the time lag effects of climatic factors on NPP/LAI for seasonal in alpine grassland ecosystems at the source of the Yellow River Basin. The results indicated that NPP, LAI, and NPP/LAI of growing season increased in the study area between 2000 and 2021 whiles annual NPP/LAI decreased. At the same time, the spatial distribution of the multiannual mean values of precipitation and temperature approximately reversed and gradually increased on the time scale. The annual NPP/LAI for each grassland type gradually decreased between 2000 and 2021, with the mean of the growing season in NPP/LAI ranging from montane meadows (12.595 g C center dot m(-2)) > swamps (11.859 g C center dot m(-2)) > alpine meadows (11.718 g C center dot m(-2)) > temperate steppes (10.994 g C center dot m(-2)). It is also interesting to note that the mean values for montane meadows and alpine meadows were slightly higher in summer than in autumn, while the opposite was true for temperate steppes and swamps. Regarding the effects of climate, the response of NPP/LAI to temperature and precipitation varied among grassland types on an annual and seasonal basis. In addition, the seasonal lag effect of climate factors showed that the overall degree of effect of winter temperature on NPP/LAI in subsequent seasons increased as the seasonal interval progressed, while the opposite was true for precipitation, meaning that temperature affected NPP/LAI over a longer period compared to precipitation. Moreover, the seasonal time lag effects of climatic factors in different grassland types had varying degrees of influence on NPP/LAI, with the NPP/LAI of montane meadows and alpine grasslands being more closely related to climatic factors than those of temperate steppes and swamps. This study provides a basis for effective monitoring of photosynthetic capacity dynamics and helps develop policies to cope with climate change in alpine grasslands.

TI  - Prediction of the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation cover in the Huainan mining area and quantitative analysis of driving factors
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of vegetation cover in the Huainan mining area and the quantitative evaluation of its driving factors are of great significance for protecting and restoring the environment in this area. This study uses the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI time-series data to estimate the vegetation cover and uses the transition matrix to analyze the spatiotemporal transfer of vegetation cover from 1989 to 2004, 2004 to 2021, and 2021 to 2030. In addition, a structural equation model (SEM) was established in this study to assess the driving factors of vegetation cover. The quantitative analysis and the cellular automata (CA)-Markov model were performed to predict the future vegetation cover in the Huainan mining area. The results are as follows: (1) In different periods, the vegetation cover types were mainly high cover types transferred to other vegetation cover types; (2) human activities are the key factors affecting the vegetation growth, while topographical factor is the most influential factor promoting the vegetation growth; (3) highly consistent CA-Markov and multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) predicted results of vegetation cover in 2030 compared to that in 2021. The proportion of bare soil and low cover types had increased significantly, mainly concentrated in the internal area of the mines. The prediction of the spatiotemporal evolution of vegetation cover in the Huainan mining area and the quantitative change in driving factors are of significant importance for the restoration of the environment in mining areas.

TI  - A Simple Real LST Reconstruction Method Combining Thermal Infrared and Microwave Remote Sensing Based on Temperature Conservation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST), defined as the radiative skin temperature of the ground, plays a critical role in land surface systems, from the regional to the global scale. The commonly utilized daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product at a resolution of one kilometer often contains missing values attributable to atmospheric influences. Reconstructing these missing values and obtaining a spatially complete LST is of great research significance. However, most existing methods are tailored for reconstructing clear-sky LST rather than the more realistic cloudy-sky LST, and their computational processes are relatively complex. Therefore, this paper proposes a simple and effective real LST reconstruction method combining Thermal Infrared and Microwave Remote Sensing Based on Temperature Conservation (TMTC). TMTC first fills the microwave data gaps and then downscales the microwave data by using MODIS LST and auxiliary data. This method maintains the temperature of the resulting LST and microwave LST on the microwave pixel scale. The average Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-2 of TMTC were 3.14 K, 4.10 K, and 0.88 for the daytime and 2.34 K, 3.20 K, and 0.90 for the nighttime, respectively. The ideal MAE of the TMTC method exhibits less than 1.5 K during daylight hours and less than 1 K at night, but the accuracy of the method is currently limited by the inversion accuracy of microwave LST and whether different LST products have undergone time normalization. Additionally, the TMTC method has spatial generality. This article establishes the groundwork for future investigations in diverse disciplines that necessitate real LSTs.

TI  - Characteristics of Internal Solitary Waves in the Timor Sea Observed by SAR Satellite
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Internal solitary waves (ISWs) with features such as large amplitude, short period, and fast speed have great influence on underwater thermohaline structure, nutrient transport, and acoustic signal propagation. The characteristics of ISWs in hotspot areas have been revealed by satellite images combined with mooring observation. However, the ISWs in the Timor Sea, which is located in the outflow of the ITF, have not been studied yet and the characteristics are unrevealed. In this study, by employing the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken by the Sentinel-1 satellite from 2017 to 2022, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of ISWs in the Timor Sea are analyzed. The results show that most of ISWs appear in Bonaparte basin and its vicinity. The average wavelength of the ISWs is 248 m, and most of the wave lengths are less than 400 m. The peak line of ISWs is longer in deeper water. The underwater structures of two typical ISWs are reconstructed based on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation combined with mooring observation. This shows that, compared with the two-layer model, the continuous layered model is more suitable for reconstructing the underwater structures of ISWs. Further analysis shows that both the rough topography and the spring-neap tides contribute to the generation of ISWs in the Timor Sea. This study fills a gap in knowledge of ISWs in regional seas, such as the Timor Sea.

TI  - Seasonal variations in glacier velocity in the High Mountain Asia region during 2015-2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Velocity is an important component of glacier dynamics and directly reflects the response of glaciers to climate change. As a result, an accurate determination of seasonal variation in glacier velocity is very important in understanding the annual variation in glacier dynamics. However, few studies of glacier velocity in the High Mountain Asia (HMA) region were done. Along these lines, in this work, based on Sentinel-1 glacier velocity data, the distribution of glacier velocity in the HMA region was plotted and their seasonal variations during 2015-2020 were systematically analysed. The average glacier velocity in the HMA region was 0.053 m/d, and was positively correlated with the glacier area and slope. Glaciers in the Karakoram Mountains had the fastest average flow velocity (0.060 m/d), where the glaciers exhibited the largest average area and average slope. Moreover, glaciers in the Gangdise Mountains had the slowest velocity (0.022 m/d) and the smallest average glacier area. The glacier flows were the fastest in spring (0.058 m/d), followed by summer (0.050 m/d), autumn (0.041 m/d), and winter (0.040 m/d). In addition, the glacier flows were the maximum in May, being 1.4 times of the annual average velocity. In some areas, such as the Qilian, Altun, Tibetan Interior, Eastern Kunlun, and Western Kunlun mountains, the peak glacier velocities appeared in June and July. The glacier velocity in the HMA region decreased in midsummer and reached the minimum in December when it was 75% of the annual average. These results highlight the role of meltwater in the seasonal variation in glacier flows in late spring and early summer. The seasonal velocity variation of lake-terminating glaciers was similar to that of land-terminating ones, but the former flowed faster. The velocity difference close to the mass balance line between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers was obviously greater in spring than in other seasons. In summer, the difference between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers at a normalized distance of 0.05-0.40 from the terminus was significantly greater than those of other seasons. The velocity difference between the lake- and land-terminating glaciers is closely related to the variable of ice thickness, and also to the frictional force of the terminal base reduced by proglacial lakes. Thus, it can be concluded that in addition to the variation of the glacier thickness and viscosity, the variation of glacier water input also plays a key role in the seasonal variation of glacier velocity.

TI  - On the automatic quality assessment of annotated sample data for object extraction from remote sensing imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the tasks of object extraction from remotely sensed imagery, such as built-up area, water-body, and other Earth surface information extraction, heavily rely on annotated sample data due to the wildly used machine learning algorithms, especially Deep Learning (DL) methods. Most algorithms, however, treat image-based annotations as ground truth and ignore the impact of unreliable annotations, leading to low-reliability solutions. Additionally, manual Annotation Quality aSsessment (AQS) of remote sensing data usually entails a significant workload in actual dataset production, particularly for large datasets. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel Annotation Quality aSsessment Network (AQSNet) for the automatic quality assessment of remote sensing annotated samples. It uses a multi-scale channel-spatial attention module to simulate how an inspector examines annotated samples at local and global scales, enhancing the ability to identify poor-quality annotations. Besides, we present a simple method for generating effective training samples by analyzing the types and characteristics of low-quality annotated sample data. Furthermore, we introduce and make publicly available HBD41, a massive land cover dataset, with 1,945,034 samples of size 512 x 512 pixels. To validate our methodology, two AQS datasets are constructed with HBD4 and public building datasets. On the building AQS dataset, the proposed method outperforms the baseline model (HRNet) by 7.115% in IoU and 5.712% on the water-body AQS dataset, respectively. Extensive ablation and comparison experiments also demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively assess the quality of remote sensing annotated samples. The high-quality sample data acquired by our AQSNet serves as a pre-trained dataset in the extended applications, from which robust pre-trained weights for downstream tasks are obtained, achieving accurate results with only 5% training samples in the LandCover.ai dataset for water-body extraction. To summarize, our method enables the automatic quality assessment of annotated sample data and the construction of high-quality sample data, both of which have the potential to improve the performance of machine learning models in the remote sensing community. The source code and the two constructed AQS datasets will be publicly available at https://github.com/zhilyzhang/AQSNet.

TI  - A Gridded Monthly Precipitation Merged Rain Gauge and Satellite Analysis Dataset for the Tian Shan Range between 1981 and 2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and reliable precipitation product on regular grids is essential for understanding trends and variability within climate studies, for weather forecasting, and in hydrology and agrometeorology applications. However, the construction of high-resolution spatiotemporal precipitation grid products is challenging for complex terrain with sparse rain gauge networks and when only coarse spatial resolutions of satellite data are available. The objective of this study was to consequently provide a practical method to create a grid precipitation product by merging accurate quantita-tive observations from weather stations with continuous spatial information and from a satellite-based estimate product. The new gridded precipitation product exhibits a monthly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.018 for the Tian Shan range, extending back to 1981. To overcome the limitation of low densities and sparse distributions of meteoro-logical stations in the complex terrain of the Tian Shan, a suitable interpolation of Australian National University Spline (ANUSPLIN) was used to interpolate grid precipitation based on in situ data. The interpolation grid precipitation was then merged with the satellite precipitation product developed by the U.S. Geological Survey and the Climate Hazards Group. After evaluation and validation using withheld stations and comparison to reference datasets, the result indicated that the merged product exhibits considerable promise for application in complex terrain. The method can be widely applied and is expected to construct precipitation products with high spatial and temporal resolution by merging multiple precipitation data sources.

TI  - A Novel Object-Level Building-Matching Method across 2D Images and 3D Point Clouds Based on the Signed Distance Descriptor (SDD)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a novel object-level building-matching method using cross-dimensional data, including 2D images and 3D point clouds, is proposed. The core of this method is a newly proposed plug-and-play Joint Descriptor Extraction Module (JDEM) that is used to extract descriptors containing buildings' three-dimensional shape information from object-level remote sensing data of different dimensions for matching. The descriptor is named Signed Distance Descriptor (SDD). Due to differences in the inherent properties of different dimensional data, it is challenging to match buildings' 2D images and 3D point clouds on the object level. In addition, features extracted from the same building in images taken at different angles are usually not exactly identical, which will also affect the accuracy of cross-dimensional matching. Therefore, the question of how to extract accurate, effective, and robust joint descriptors is key to cross-dimensional matching. Our JDEM maps different dimensions of data to the same 3D descriptor SDD space through the 3D geometric invariance of buildings. In addition, Multi-View Adaptive Loss (MAL), proposed in this paper, aims to improve the adaptability of the image encoder module to images with different angles and enhance the robustness of the joint descriptors. Moreover, a cross-dimensional object-level data set was created to verify the effectiveness of our method. The data set contains multi-angle optical images, point clouds, and the corresponding 3D models of more than 400 buildings. A large number of experimental results show that our object-level cross-dimensional matching method achieves state-of-the-art outcomes.

TI  - The Global Spatial and Temporal Distribution of Ice Cloud Optical Thickness Based on MODIS Satellite Data during 2000-2021
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cloud optical thickness (IOT) is an important parameter to characterize ice cloud properties and in the determination of cloud-radiation parameterization schemes, and the variation trend of ice clouds is more concerned with the study of weather and climate. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial and temporal distributions of IOT over the region between & PLUSMN;60 & DEG; latitude. Cloud product data from March 2000 to February 2021 acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite were used in this study. Theil-Sen median trend analysis and EOF analysis methods were used to study the variation trend of IOT. The research results indicate that the monthly average IOT shows a "W" distribution from January to December, with a maximum reached in July (12.15) and a double bottom reached in March (10.7) and October (10.99), respectively. The average global IOT reaches the maximum in June-August, it tends to decrease with time, and its slope is -0.01 year(-1). The statistical analysis results show that the area with an increase accounted for 49.4% of the total ice cloud coverage area; the area with a trend of significant increased and decreased is both 2.2%. The probability distribution of IOT reaches the maximum, around 3.25%, when the IOT is larger than 1.5 and less than or equal to 2.

TI  - Investigating the critical influencing factors of snowmelt runoff and development of a mid-long term snowmelt runoff forecasting
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Snowmelt runoff is a vital source of fresh water in cold regions. Accurate snowmelt runoff forecasting is crucial in supporting the integrated management of water resources in these regions. However, the performances of such forecasts are often very low as they involve many meteorological factors and complex physical processes. Aiming to improve the understanding of these influencing factors on snowmelt runoff forecast, this study investigated the time lag of various meteorological factors before identifying the key factor in snowmelt processes. The results show that solar radiation, followed by temperature, are the two critical influencing factors with time lags being 0 and 2 days, respectively. This study further quantifies the effect of the two factors in terms of their contribution rate using a set of empirical equations developed. Their contribution rates as to yearly snowmelt runoff are found to be 56% and 44%, respectively. A mid-long term snowmelt forecasting model is developed using machine learning techniques and the identified most critical influencing factor with the biggest contribution rate. It is shown that forecasting based on Supporting Vector Regression (SVR) method can meet the requirements of forecast standards.

TI  - Seasonal evolution of aerosol loading and its vertical distribution in northeastern China from long-term satellite observations and model reanalysis
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical structure of aerosols plays an important role in regional air pollution and climate change. Using long-term data on aerosol optical properties obtained through satellite observations (MODIS/Terra, MODIS/ Aqua, CALIOP) and reanalysis products (CAMS) during 2007-2021, we analysed the seasonal evolution and vertical distribution of aerosol loading in northeastern China (NEC). We also analysed the seasonal variation trends of aerosol optical depth (AOD) of aerosol species. The AODs during spring and summer were high and distributed in Liaoning (LN) with an average value of approximately 0.6, which was higher in central Jilin and southern Heilongjiang. Sulfate AOD (AOD_SO4) and organic matter AOD (AOD_OM) in NEC were higher during spring and summer (approximately 0.2), and the maximum value of dust AOD (AOD_DU) was approximately 0.1 obtained for western LN. During spring, the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) for NEC was high at heights below 2.0 km in LN, and its value was maximum (approximately 0.16 km-1) near the ground in LN during winter. The AEC was concentrated within 0-1 km during winter and higher within 1-3 km during spring and summer in NEC. During 2007-2021, AOD exhibited a decreasing trend, with higher average AOD during spring and summer and lower average AOD during autumn and winter. The seasonal trend of AOD in NEC exhibited a decreasing trend. BC_AOD showed the largest decline in spring, followed by DU_AOD and OM_AOD, and SO4_AOD showed a significant decline in summer.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution and trends monitoring of land desertification based on time-series remote sensing data in northern China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land desertification is a significant research area among current global ecological and environmental issues. Desertification not only affects the ecological environment, but is also closely related to human society. With the development of new technology, outstanding progress has been made in the development of desertification monitoring and evaluation indicators. The objective of this study was to assess the trends and distribution of land desertification in northern China using time-series GIMMS NDVI 3 g and MODIS-NDVI remote sensing data from 1991 to 2019. The Dimidiate Pixel Model was chosen to calculate the Vegetation Coverage Index (VCI). The Sen's slope estimator and the Mann-Kendall statistical test were used to analyze the spatial trends of the VCI. The residual trend method was applied to assess human and climate factor induced land degradation. Data from the study area showed that the total area of desertification in northern China decreased year by year from 1991 to 2019, but the area of very severe desertification demonstrated an increasing trend. At the same time, areas of severe, moderate, and mild desertification showed a decreasing trend. From the overall analysis, a trend of overall decrease and local aggravation of land desertification was revealed. The residual analysis showed that desertification control measures and favorable climatic conditions have played key roles in the process of desertification reversion; while climate fluctuations, reclamation and livestock have led to the development of further desertification.

TI  - Determination of static gravity field model by using satellite data of GOCE and GRACE
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-precision static satellite gravity field models have important applications in fields such as global ocean circulation research and global/regional digital elevation datum determination. In this paper, we discussed the determination of high-degree static satellite gravity field models with GOCE observation, GRACE observation and the joint of them. We first constructed a 300 degree Satellite Gravity Gradiometry (SGG) normal equation with the high-precision gravitational gradient components V-xx, V-xy, Vz(z) and V-xz throughout the entire mission of GOCE by the Direct least squares method, and a 130-degree Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking (SST) normal equation with the SST observation data by the point-wise acceleration approach. The 300-degree GOCEonly satellite gravity field model GOSGO2S is determined by combining SGG and SST normal equations with variance component estimation. The 180-degree model SWPU-GRACE2021S is then determined based on the dynamic approach with the GRACE data throughout the entire mission cycle of 15 years, and the normal equation is combined with GOCE normal equation to determine WHU-SWPU-GOGR2022S, a joint model of GOCE and GRACE. Finally, the XGM2019 model and GPS/leveling data are used for precision analysis of GOSGO2S, SWPU-GRACE2021S and WHU-SWPU-GOGR2022S in frequency domain and space domain respectively. The results show that the accuracy of GOSGO2S and WHU-SWPU-GOGR2022S is comparable to GO_CONS_GCF_2_ DIR_R6, GO_CONS_GCF_2_TIM_R6, GO_CONS_GCF_2_SPW_R5, G00006s and Tongji-GMMG2021S that use the entire mission data of GOCE satellite and the accuracy differences are in the order of millimeters. The SWPU-GRACE2021S model has the same accuracy below degree/order 160 as the international mainstream of GRACE satellite gravity field models, i. e., ITSG-Grace2018s and Tongji-Grace02s.

TI  - A Quantum Machine Learning Approach to Spatiotemporal Emission Modelling
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing impact of emissions on our health and the environment, there remains an unmet need for emission concentration prediction and forecasting. The accumulating monitoring station and satellite data make the problem well-suited for quantum machine learning. This work takes a quantum machine learning approach to the spatiotemporal prediction of emission concentration. A quantum quanvolutional neural network model was developed and compared to a classical spatiotemporal ConvLSTM model using an evaluation framework of baseline models and metrics of per-pixel loss and intersection over union accuracy. The quantum quanvolutional neural network developed successfully generates one-hour-ahead emission concentration forecasts with increasingly lower loss (6.5% and 30.5% less) and higher accuracy (18.4% and 18.6% higher) compared to the input-independent and random baselines at the end of training. The quantum model was also comparable to the classical ConvLSTM model, with slightly lower loss (4%) but also slightly lower accuracy (3.7%). The study's results suggest that the quantum machine learning approach has the potential to improve emission concentration modeling and could become a powerful tool for accurately predicting air pollution.

TI  - Investigating Surface Deformation and Its Intrinsic Mechanism in Shenzhen, China Using Sentinel-1A SAR Imagery
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - To avoid disasters caused by surface deformation in urban areas, monitoring and analyzing the mechanism of surface deformation in urban areas on a large scale and in long-term series is mandatory. Based on PS-InSAR technology and using 157 Sentinel-1A images, the surface deformation in Shenzhen was monitored from 2015 to 2022, and the obtained deformation rate ranged from -22.8 to +23.2 mm/year. In this paper, analysis is presented by integrating urbanization, climate, and geology data from Shenzhen. The analysis indicates that surface deformation caused by natural factors is typically observed in regions with unique geological characteristics, such as seasonal deformation in sedimentary areas and uplift along reverse fault zones. Human factors chiefly cause subsidence, and the areas with greater subsidence are generally urbanized areas (similar to 10 mm/year), industrial areas (similar to 20 mm/year), and reclamation areas (similar to 15 mm/year). The deformation of the reservoir dam is subject to multiple factors. The differential subsidence of 2-8 mm/year at both ends is due to the engineering geological conditions. In comparison, the weak rotation with a linear velocity of 18 mm/year is due to hydrostatic pressure and its structural characteristics. The research results of this paper systematically explore the phenomena and the intrinsic mechanism of surface deformation in Shenzhen, providing a safety basis for urban development and emergency disaster prevention in Shenzhen.

TI  - An Integrated Approach for Analyzing the Morphological Evolution of the Lower Reaches of the Minjiang River Based on Long-Term Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the evolution of river morphology is crucial for comprehending changes in water resources and implementing development projects along rivers. This study proposes an integrated approach utilizing remote sensing image data combined with deep learning and visual interpretation algorithms to analyze continuous-type changes in river morphology. This research focuses on the lower reaches of the Minjiang River in China and comprehensively analyzes the river's morphological evolution from 1986 to 2021. The results show that the proposed method of river water identification in this study demonstrates high accuracy and effectiveness, with an F1 score and Kappa coefficient greater than 0.96 and 0.91, respectively. The morphology of the river channel remains stable in the upstream and estuarine sections of the study region while undergoing substantial alterations in the middle section. Additionally, this study also identifies several factors that significantly impact the evolution of river morphology, including reservoir construction, river sediment mining, river training measures, geological conditions, and large flood events. The findings of this study can provide some insights into the management and conservation of water resources.

TI  - Modeling of BRDF Characteristics of Deep Convective Cloud Based on Himawari-8 Satellite Imager
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Deep convective cloud has high, stable, and reliable reflectivity in the visible-near infrared (VIS/NIR) band, which is suitable for radiometric calibration. In addition, the development of deep convective clouds is deeply located at the top of the troposphere and is less affected by water vapor absorption and aerosols. The deep convective cloud is mainly distributed in the equatorial region, which is suitable for the calibration of polar orbit and geostationary satellites. However, the deep convective cloud is not a real Lambertian target. When the satellite detects from different observation angles, the anisotropy characteristics of the deep convective cloud make the satellite observation biased, which leads to calibration errors. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the directional reflectance characteristics of deep convective clouds and establish an effective bidirectional reflectance distribution function ( BRDF) to correct the directional reflectance and improve the calibration accuracy. The operational Hu model is not only inapplicable to the shortwave infrared channel but also has a slight influence on the data stability in the VIS/ NIR channel when the eigenvalue is selected as the mean reflectivity. Since the previously constructed model has been relatively long compared with the current one and may be affected by human activities, the anisotropic reflection factors of deep convective clouds will change to some extent. The operational Hu model and CERES thick ice cloud model are broadband models. Therefore, we use the latest data to model the BRDF characteristics of deep convective clouds, which can better characterize the directional characteristics of deep convective cloud reflectivity. Modeling each channel separately can make up for the deficiency that the Hu model and CERES thick ice cloud model are broadband models. For the modeling of the shortwave infrared channel, it can fill the gap that the Hu model used by the current business is not applicable to the shortwave infrared channel, and it is of great significance to improve the calibration accuracy of the deep convective cloud target.Methods The BRDF modeling of each channel of deep convective clouds in this paper classifies the deep convective cloud reflectivity data into angle intervals and establishes a look-up table method. In view of the low attenuation of the instrument itself and in order to maintain sufficient data to make the interval of the look- up table established more smoothly, the data from 2016 to 2020 are used. With regard to the selection of normalized objects, it does not affect the relative value of the BRDF factor but only the absolute value of the BRDF factor. It affects the absolute rather than relative quantity of corrected reflectivity value and does not affect the relative calibration and attenuation analysis. The BRDF modeling normalization object in this paper selects a solar zenith angle of 35 degrees, observation zenith angle of 0 degrees, and relative azimuth direction reflectivity of 0 degrees as standard observation geometry. The reasons why they are used as the normalized objects are as follows: 1) for BRDF measurement of objects, since the albedo requires directional integration of data from all angles, which is too complex, the reflectivity in the vertical direction corresponding to the zenith angle is often used as a substitute; 2) the data volume of the interval deep convective cloud corresponding to this angle is the largest. As a normalized object, it can make the BRDF model more evenly distributed. Theoretically, as the interval division gets detailed, the anisotropy of the deep convective cloud target can be explained better. However, according to the principle of statistical model, in order to ensure that each angle interval has a certain amount of data distribution, for each channel, the zenith angle is classified as interval data of 5 degrees, and an interval look- up table of 5 degrees is constructed based on the existing data. In other words, the solar zenith angle is taken as 0 degrees- 5 degrees, 5 degrees- 10 degrees,., and 45 degrees-50 degrees, and the observation zenith angle is taken as 0 degrees- 5 degrees, 5 degrees- 10 degrees,., and 45 degrees- 50 degrees. The data of every interval of 10 degrees of the relative azimuth angle are classified into one category, that is, 5 degrees- 15 degrees,., 165 degrees-175 degrees, which is divided into intervals of 10x10x17= 1700 in total, and the mean value, standard deviation, and number of pixel points within each interval are calculated and counted.Results and Discussions The results show that the BRDF characteristics of the VIS/NIR channels are almost the same. The lowest reflectivity appears at the larger observation zenith angle, and the highest reflectivity appears in the perigee direction. On the contrary, the lowest reflectivity of the shortwave infrared channel appears near the perigee, and the highest reflectivity appears at the location where the zenith angle of the forward scattering observation is large (Fig. 1). Hu BRDF model chooses 17. 5 degrees between 15 degrees - 20 degrees of solar zenith angle to normalize the anisotropy factor corresponding to different observation zenith angle and relative azimuth, with solar zenith angle of 35 degrees, observation zenith angle of 30 degrees, and relative azimuth of 135 degrees. The results are plotted as a polar image (Fig. 2) and compared with the modeling results. Compared with that of the Hu model, in the VIS/ NIR band, the overall anisotropy of the proposed model shows a high consistency, which proves the reliability of the model. In the shortwave infrared channel, the Hu model shows a great difference, which is related to the inapplicability of the Hu model to the shortwave infrared channel. For the VIS/NIR band, the reflectivity of deep convective clouds is related to the cloud optical thickness, while the shortwave infrared channel is related to the absorption characteristics of particles, which is the fundamental reason for the large difference in anisotropy between the shortwave infrared channel and the VIS/NIR channel.Conclusions In this paper, BRDF feature modeling of deep convective clouds is realized. The extracted data of deep convective clouds during 2016-2020 are divided into intervals by angles, and the BRDF characteristics are characterized by calculating the mean reflectivity of each interval. The experimental results show that the BRDF characteristics of the VIS/ NIR band are basically the same. The lowest reflectivity appears at the location of the larger observation zenith angle, and the highest reflectivity appears in the perigee direction. For the shortwave infrared channel, the situation is the opposite. The lowest reflectivity appears near the perigee, and the highest reflectivity appears at the location of the larger forward scattering observation zenith angle. The BRDF characteristics of different bands in the shortwave infrared channel are quite different. When the model and Hu model are normalized to the same angle, the difference is compared. The results of the Hu model in the VIS/NIR band are similar to those of modeling, and the shortwave infrared channel is quite different. The effect of the BRDF model on reducing the standard error of deep convective cloud responses is further analyzed. Compared with the model without BRDF correction, the Hu model and the proposed model both reduce the standard error of the response in the VIS/ NIR band. For the shortwave infrared channel, the Hu model is not applicable, and the standard error of this model can be reduced by 31% at most. Compared with the Hu model, except for the poor correction effect of the model in the band of 460 nm, other bands show a better correction effect. Finally, the model in this paper is used to correct the direction of deep convective cloud reflectivity data based on Himawari-8 from 2016 to 2022, calculate its attenuation, and compare it with the attenuation results of the calibration coefficient method. It is found that it has a high consistency in the VIS/NIR band, and there are differences in the shortwave infrared band, which is related to the low attenuation rate of deep convective clouds in the shortwave infrared channel and its large fluctuations. This thus proves the reliability of the model in this paper.

TI  - Object-Oriented Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Based on Color Co-Occurrence Matrix
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem of misdetection caused by the traditional texture characteristic extraction model, which does not describe the correlation among multiple bands, an object-oriented remote sensing image change detection method based on a color co-occurrence matrix is proposed. First, the image is divided into multi-scale objects by graph-based superpixel segmentation, and the optimal scale is determined by the overall goodness F-measure (OGF). Then, except for the extraction of the spectral features, the multi-channel texture features based on the color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) are extracted to consider the correlation among multiple bands. To accurately find the representative features to overcome the impact of feature redundancy, a cumulative backward search strategy (CBSS) is further designed. Finally, the change detection is completed by inputting the difference image of dual time points to the trained random forest model. Taking Shenzhen and Dapeng as the study areas, with Sentinel-2 and Skysat images under different spatial resolutions, and the forest-bareland change type as an example, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by qualitative and quantitative analyses. They show that the proposed algorithm can obtain higher detection accuracy than the texture features without band correlation.

TI  - The Innovative Growth of Space Archaeology: A Brief Overview of Concepts and Approaches in Detection, Monitoring, and Promotion of the Archaeological Heritage
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Space Archaeology (SA), also known as Satellite Archaeology, Satellite Remote Sensing for Archaeology, or Archaeology from Space, is part of the wider interdisciplinary field of Remote Sensing for Archaeology. The application of satellite data in archaeological investigations has proven useful for landscape observation and analysis, the detection of archaeological traces, the reconstruction and monitoring of natural and anthropic processes, and the management and promotion of archaeological heritage. During the last few decades, the increasing number of SA studies has demonstrated innovative growth in archaeological disciplines due to the significant enhancement of spatial technologies, the advancement of visual inspection and image processing techniques, the development of data fusion methodologies, and the improvement of multi-temporal analysis methods. Therefore, a broad overview of the current situation in the concepts and approaches of SA is necessary to gain greater awareness of the current potentialities and limitations of this science to better address future studies. The present work provides a review of the scientific literature by exploring the different aspects of SA and the goals achieved to date in three main application fields: Detection, monitoring, and promotion of archaeological heritage. The contributions reviewed were divided within each of these three categories by analyzing the type of SA data and methods applied. The results indicate that (1) most studies aim to detect archaeological sites compared to monitoring and promotion; (2) optical images are used more than SAR data; and (3) techniques of image enhancement and visual interpretation are applied more than other data processing methods. This brief overview allows us to consider SA as an evolving discipline, an engine for cross-skills training, as well as a promising future science that can play a key role in the frontier of sustainable development and the new space economy.

TI  - Ecosystem Resistance and Resilience after Dry and Wet Events across Central Asia Based on Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change forecasts indicate that the frequency and intensity of extreme climate events will increase in the future; these changes will have important effects on ecosystem stability and function. An important arid region of the world, Central Asia has ecosystems that are extremely vulnerable to extreme weather events. However, few studies have investigated the resistance and resilience of this region's ecosystems to extreme weather events. In this study, first, the extreme drought/wet threshold was calculated based on the 113-year (1901-2013) standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index (SPEI); second, moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data were applied to calculate ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) and quantify ecosystem resistance and resilience after different extreme climate events; and finally, differences in the changes of various ecosystem types before and after climate events were assessed. The results showed the following: (1) The average SPEI was 0.073, and the thresholds of extreme wetness and drought were 0.91 and -0.67, respectively. Central Asia experienced extreme wet periods in 2002 and 2003 and a drought period in 2008. (2) Suitable wetness levels can increase the resistance of an ecosystem; however, continuous wetness reduces ecosystem resistance, as does drought. Wet areas had strong resilience after wet events, and arid areas had strong resilience after drought events. (3) During both wet and drought years, the transition between shrubland and grassland caused changes in ecosystem resistance and resilience. These findings are important for understanding the impact of future climate change on ecosystem stability.

TI  - Monitoring Urban Expansion (2000-2020) in Yangtze River Delta Using Time-Series Nighttime Light Data and MODIS NDVI
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration (YRDUA), which is located in the convergence zone of "The Belt and Road Initiative", is one of the regions with the best urbanization foundations in China. Referring to the four five-year plans (China's national economic plan), this study aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of urban expansion in the YRDUA from 2000 to 2020. To conduct a long-term analysis of urbanization, an extended time series (2000-2020) of a nighttime light (NTL) dataset was built from the multi-temporal Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) data (2000-2013), and Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) data (2014-2020); data from these sources are crucial to understanding the urbanization processes in the region in order for more effective decision making to take place. The support vector machine (SVM) method was used to extract urban clusters from the extended time-series NTL data and MODIS NDVI products. The evolution of the urban expansion intensity was detected at city scales, and the inequality of urban growth was demonstrated using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. Finally, a quantitative relationship between urban NTL intensity and socio-economic data was built to explore the main factors that control urban intensity. The results indicated that the urban extents extracted from time-series NTL data were consistent with those extracted from Landsat data, with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 89%. A relatively fast urbanization pace was observed during the 10th five-year plan (from 2000 to 2005), which then declined slightly in the 11th five-year plan (from 2006 to 2010). By the 12th and 13th five-year plan (from 2011 to 2020), urban clusters in all cities tended to grow steadily. Urban expansion has presented a radial pattern around the main cities, with sprawl inequality across cities. The results further revealed that the primary factors controlling NTL brightness were gross domestic product (GDP), total fixed asset investment, tertiary industry, gross industrial output, urban area, and urban permanent residents in city clusters, but the same driving factors had a different contribution order on the NTL intensity across cities. This study provides significant insight for further urbanization study to be conducted in the YRDUA region, which is crucial for sustainable urban development in the region.

TI  - Research on nonlinear correction algorithm of Fourier transform spectrometer based on responsivity correction
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Fourier transform spectrometer shows great advantages in the field of quantitative remote sensing. Nonlinear correction is an important part to ensure the accuracy of on-orbit radiometric calibration. The FY-4/GIIRS located in the stationary orbit has the characteristics of uneven sunlight exposure and severe daily changes in the background tempera- ture of the instrument. A nonlinear correction algorithm based on instrument spectral responsivity correction is derived. By measuring a set of standard reference radiation source spectral quantification values and spectral responsivity, fitting the correction coefficient of the primary term of spectral responsivity. After the ambient temperature of the instrument changes, the correction coefficient of the response rate constant term can be recalculated using the correction coefficient of the first-order term, the spectral value and the spectral responsivity of the black body observation, and the nonlinear correction coefficient of the instrument under any instrument background temperature can be obtained. Verified by the ground thermal vacuum (TVAC) calibration tests data before the launch of the instrument, the algorithm is simple and effective. In each ambient temperature test, the radiometric calibration accuracy in the observation range of 180-320 K has been improved significantly.

TI  - Mapping Irrigated Areas Based on Remotely Sensed Crop Phenology and Soil Moisture
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Artificial irrigation is critical for improving soil moisture conditions and ensuring crop growth. Its irrational deployment can lead to ecological and environmental issues. Mapping and understanding the changes in irrigated areas are vital to effectively managing limited water. However, most researchers map irrigated areas with a single data resource, which makes it hard to detect irrigated signals in complex situations. The case study area for this paper was China's winter wheat region, and an irrigated area map was generated by analyzing the effects of artificial irrigation on crop phenological characteristics and soil moisture time series. The mapping process involved three steps: (1) generating a basic irrigated map by employing the ISODATA classification method on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test irrigation signals from the microwave remote sensing data and reanalysis data; (2) creating the other map with the maximum likelihood ratio classification and zoning scheme on the phenological parameters extracted from the NDVI time series; and (3) fusing these two maps at the decision level to obtain the final map with a higher spatial resolution of 1 km. The map was evaluated against existing irrigated area data and was highly compatible with GMIA 5.0. The overall accuracy (OA) was 73.49%.

TI  - Satellite-derived forest canopy greenness shows differential drought vulnerability of secondary forests compared to primary forests in Peru
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding tropical secondary forest canopy greenness and responses to climatic conditions is important for climate change mitigation, particularly in the tropics where secondary forest growth is a substantial carbon sink and a promoted natural climate solution. We here test three hypotheses: (a) forest canopy greenness is higher in younger, secondary forests than in older, primary or mature forests, (b) secondary forests are more vulnerable to climatic pressures and (c) there are significant differences between forest types regarding primary-secondary canopy greenness and their differential responses to drought anomalies. To explore these relationships, we monitored wet and dry seasonal greenness from 2001 to 2020, estimated through the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), of Peruvian tropical dry, montane and lowland secondary forests and compared it to nearby primary forests. We developed predictive models of seasonal EVI using remotely sensed variables, including land surface temperature (LST), evapotranspiration (ET), potential evapotranspiration (PET), ratio of ET and PET (ETn), and the standard precipitation index (SPI). Overall, there was a higher change in annual and seasonal EVI for secondary forests compared to primary forests. However, primary forests maintained relatively stable EVI levels during the wet season despite drought anomalies. When decoupling forest type canopy greenness and drought response, primary forest greenness in dry and lowland ecosystems were temporally more stable. Secondary montane had a lower increase in greenness when drought anomalies held during different seasons. Stepwise multiple linear regression models indicated that LST and ETn, a plant water use index, were the most significant factors to predict greening fluctuations in dry and montane forest types. ET and SPI mostly drove wet season mean EVI across all forest types. Predictors of dry season mean EVI varied, but mostly including water availability. Our results suggest that tropical secondary forests are more productive overall yet more vulnerable to prolonged drought.

TI  - In-Depth Monitoring of Anthropic Activities in the <i>Puglia</i> Region: What Is the Acceptable Compromise between Economic Activities and Environmental Protection?
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In many countries in the world, the conservation of habitats is at risk mainly due to anthropic pressures on the environment. A study was conducted to assess the extent to which sensitive and high nature-value habitats are damaged by high-impact human activities. Some evaluation methods that are applied may not be entirely appropriate to the characteristics of the investigated areas or may be very accurate but provide results that are delayed with respect to the occurrence of the events that created the loss of their characteristics. The main purpose of this study is to optimise some methodologies for monitoring the impacts of human activities making it possible to obtain better results in less time and with much lower costs. This methodology has been applied in two different areas present in the Puglia Region in south-eastern Italy, in the central Mediterranean area. The biotope fragmentation method was applied on coastal dunes, in the province of Brindisi, affected by an important tourist influx. The results of the inclusion, in the evaluation methodology, of the remote sensing of the paths indicate a more real situation on the state of fragmentation of the coastal dunes. The second methodology concerns the monitoring, through topographical profiles obtained from Sentinel-1 DEM images, of active and inactive mining sites, allowing to obtain of very detailed information on the progress of mining activities in a very short time. By implementing these methodologies, it is possible to improve the control of the territory allowing a more detailed analysis in order to safeguard the environment from impacting human activities and avoiding, as much as possible, the occurrence of illegal activities. Finally, compensation factors to ensure that human activities are conducted in a sustainable way are also evaluated.

TI  - Assessing Forest Quality through Forest Growth Potential, an Index Based on Improved CatBoost Machine Learning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have always depended on nature, and forests are an important part of this; the determination and improvement of forest quality is therefore highly significant. Currently, domestic and foreign research on forest quality focuses on the current states of forests. We propose a new research direction based on the future states. By referencing and analyzing the forest quality standards of domestic and foreign experts and institutions, the concept and model for calculating forest growth potential were constructed. Forest growth potential is a new forest quality indicator. Based on the data of 110,000 subcompartments of forest resources from the Lin'an and Landsat8 satellites' remote sensing data, the unit volume was predicted using three machine-learning algorithms: random gradient descent SGD, the integrated machine learning algorithm CatBoost, and deep learning CNN. The CatBoost algorithm model was improved based on Optuna; then the improved CatBoost algorithm was selected through evaluation indicators for the prediction of forest volume and finally incorporated into the calculation model for forest growth-potential value. The forest growth-potential value was calculated, and an accurate forest quality improvement scheme based on the subcompartments is preliminarily discussed. The successful calculation of forest growth potential values has a certain reference significance, providing guidance for accurately improving forest quality and forest management. The improved CatBoost calculation model is effective in the prediction of forest growth potential, and the determination coefficient R-2 reaches 0.89, a value that compares favorably with those in other studies.

TI  - Assessment of heavy metal contamination and ecological risk in Morocco's marine and estuarine ecosystems through a combined analysis of surface sediment and bioindicator species:<i> Donax</i><i> trunculus</i> and<i> Scrobicularia</i><i> plana</i>
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Morocco is one of the most affected regions by heavy metal pollution worldwide. In this study, two ecosystems in Agadir Bay, southern Morocco, were studied seasonally, using surface sediment and bivalve species. The con-centrations of Cu, Pb and Cd were determined using the Shimadzu AAS 7000 flame atomic absorption spec-trophotometer method. Our results marked average levels corresponding to an unpolluted sediment with a low contamination degree, low ecological risk associated with metal contamination, and levels that did not exceed the thresholds set by EC, USEPA, INERIS and INRH, except for Pb in tourist beach. The principal component analysis findings revealed a positive correlation in the bioaccumulation between the two compartments, with an influence of abiotic parameters. Thus, to better manage environmental pollution in these ecosystems, authorities must implement waste treatment strategies in the surrounding harbor and tourist complexes and prohibit the use of these toxic metals in the coastal areas.

TI  - Mongolia Contributed More than 42% of the Dust Concentrations in Northern China in March and April 2023
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Dust storms are one of the most frequent meteorological disasters in China, endangering agricultural production, transportation, air quality, and the safety of people's lives and property. Against the backdrop of climate change, Mongolia's contribution to China's dust cannot be ignored in recent years. In this study, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), along with dynamic dust sources and the HYSPLIT model, to analyze the contributions of different dust sources to dust concentrations in northern China in March and April 2023. The results show that the frequency of dust storms in 2023 was the highest observed in the past decade. Mongolia and the Taklimakan Desert were identified as two main dust sources contributing to northern China. Specifically, Mongolia contributed more than 42% of dust, while the Taklimakan Desert accounted for 26%. A cold high-pressure center, a cold front, and a Mongolian cyclone resulted in the transport of dust aerosols from Mongolia and the Taklimakan Desert to northern China, where they affected most parts of the region. Moreover, two machine learning methods [the XGBoost algorithm and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)] were used to forecast the dust storms in March 2023, based on ground observations and WRF-Chem simulations over East Asia. XGBoost-SMOTE performed well in predicting hourly PM10 concentrations in China in March 2023, with a mean absolute error of 33.8 mu g m(-3) and RMSE of 54.2 mu g m(-3).

TI  - Study Variability of the Land Surface Temperature of Land Cover during El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a Tropical City
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The World Health Organization has reported numerous fatalities, primarily among urban residents, during El Nino events. This study employed remote sensing technology to investigate the influence of the El Nino Southern Oscillation on temperature. The objective was to analyze the effect of ENSO on temperature across different land cover types using Landsat satellite data. Pre-processing was applied to the satellite data before converting numerical values into surface temperatures. The findings revealed that RS technology effectively captured the impact of varying ENSO intensity levels on surface temperatures. ENSO strength influenced temperature variations in the study areas. During El Nino events, urban areas exhibited higher land surface temperatures compared to vegetation, wetlands, and water bodies, a pattern consistent during La Nina. Specifically, there was a 2.5 ? temperature increase in the urban land cover area during El Nino events between 2016 and 1997. Water bodies, vegetation, and wetlands experienced respective temperature increases of 0.17 ?, 0.17 ?, and +0.7 ? during ONI value 1 events between 2016 and 1997. These findings are crucial for local authorities, providing spatial information on hot spots to enhance vigilance against potential El Nino temperatures.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Comparative Analysis of Dry/Wet Phenomenon of the Rainy Period Using Artificial Neural Networks and Markov Chains
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The work presented in this paper is a spatiotemporal analysis of the dry/wet phenomenon of the rainy period in northern Algeria to predict the drought. To that end, we implemented artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyze the behavior of processes. For a comparative study, we also analyzed the behavior of the dry/wet phenomenon of the rainy period using Markov chains (MC). The dry/wet phenomenon is divided into 9 categories obtained according to the values of SPI (Standard Precipitation Index). The database is built from satellite estimates of precipitation rates over a period from 1985 to 2021. To assess the performance of the two methods, short-term predictions were determined and compared to actual satellite data. The evaluation parameters used show that the predictions obtained correspond to real data for both the Markov chain method and the neural network method. We then predicted the long-term dry/wet phenomenon, from 2022 to 2050. The long-term prediction results of the dry/wet phenomenon performed by ANN and MC are compared to the simulations given by the coupled multi-model inter-comparison project version 6 (CMIP6) under scenarios, shared socioeconomic pathways SSP126. The overall orientation is identical for the three models (ANN, MC and CMIP6). Indeed, the prediction results performed by the three models indicate that areas representing dry surfaces are gaining ground at the expense of wetlands with a slight difference.

TI  - Identification of Populations at Risk for "Choosing Un-Wisely": A SEER Population-Based Study.
T2  - The American surgeon
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 2016, the Choosing Wisely campaign has recommended against routine axillary surgery in elderly patients with early stage, hormone receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. The objective was to evaluate factors associated with axillary surgery in breast cancer patients meeting criteria for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) omission and identify potential disparities.METHODS: Female patients age ≥70years with cT1-2N0M0, ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer diagnosed after publication of the Choosing Wisely recommendations, between 2016 and 2019, were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Patient demographics and tumor characteristics associated with axillary surgery were analyzed.RESULTS: Of the 31756 patients meeting omission criteria, 25771 (81.2%) underwent axillary surgery. Hispanic ethnicity, median household income between $35,000 and $70,000, treatment in rural areas, poor differentiation, lobular and mixed lobular with ductal histology, T2 tumors, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy were factors associated with receiving axillary surgery on multivariable analysis. In the axillary surgery cohort, a median of 2 (IQR = 2) nodes were examined and 529 (2.1%) patients were found to have 1 or more positive lymph nodes.DISCUSSION: Among elderly patients meeting Choosing Wisely criteria for SLNB omission, particular racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographic populations may be at increased risk for potential over treatment. Identification of these factors provides specific opportunities for education and implementation of de-escalation of unnecessary procedures.

TI  - The COVID-19 lockdown: a unique perspective into heterogeneous impacts of transboundary pollution on snow and ice darkening across the Himalayas
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau holds the largest mass of snow and ice outside of the polar regions. The deposition of light-absorbing particles (LAPs) including mineral dust, black carbon and organic carbon and the resulting positive radiative forcing on snow (RFSLAPs) substantially contributes to glacier retreat. Yet how anthropogenic pollutant emissions affect Himalayan RFSLAPs through transboundary transport is currently not well known. The COVID-19 lockdown, resulting in a dramatic decline in human activities, offers a unique test to understand the transboundary mechanisms of RFSLAPs. This study employs multiple satellite data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer and ozone monitoring instrument, as well as a coupled atmosphere-chemistry-snow model, to reveal the high spatial heterogeneities in anthropogenic emissions-induced RFSLAPs across the Himalaya during the Indian lockdown in 2020. Our results show that the reduced anthropogenic pollutant emissions during the Indian lockdown were responsible for 71.6% of the reduction in RFSLAPs on the Himalaya in April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The contributions of the Indian lockdown-induced human emission reduction to the RFSLAPs decrease in the western, central, and eastern Himalayas were 46.8%, 81.1%, and 110.5%, respectively. The reduced RFSLAPs might have led to 27 Mt reduction in ice and snow melt over the Himalaya in April 2020. Our findings allude to the potential for mitigating rapid glacial threats by reducing anthropogenic pollutant emissions from economic activities.

TI  - Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer treated with systemic neoadjuvant therapy
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - AimsTouch preparation (TP) and frozen section (FS) are the two methods routinely used in the intraoperative evaluation (IOE) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) to detect metastases in patients with breast cancer. Both methods are extremely sensitive and specific in the primary surgery (non-neoadjuvant systemic therapy (non-NST)) setting. Since NST introduces unique challenges in the IOE of SLNs, the aim was to determine the accuracy of TP and FS in the IOE of SLNs in the NST setting and compare the results with the non-NST setting and to examine factors that contribute to any differences. MethodsWe analysed 871 SLNs from 232 patients (615 SLNs from NST and 256 SLNs from non-NST settings) between 2016 through 2019. ResultsIn the NST group, TP alone (n=366) had a sensitivity of 45.7% and specificity of 99.7%; FS alone (n=90) had a sensitivity of 83.3% and specificity of 100%. When both TP and FS (n=135) were used, the sensitivity was 80.3% and the specificity was 98.6%.In the non-NST group, TP alone (n=193) had a sensitivity of 66.7% and specificity of 100%; FS alone (n=22) had a sensitivity and specificity of 100%; and combined TP and FS (n=34) had a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 96%, respectively. ConclusionsEvaluating SLNs intraoperatively in the NST setting can be challenging secondary to therapy-related changes. In the NST setting, FS has higher sensitivity and specificity compared with TP for the IOE of SLNs and should be the preferred method.

TI  - Dependency of LSA and LST to topographic factors in Iran, based on remote sensing data
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo (LSA) and land surface temperature (LST) are used in many environmental studies. Linking topographical factors (altitude, aspect, and slope) with LST and LSA plays an essential role in climate modeling, environmental changes, hydrology, energy balance, architecture, etc. Knowing the relationship between them is of particular importance. In this research, the data of two remote sensing products that are Modis Terra and Aqua (for the period of 2000-2019) were used to investigate the link between topographical factors, LSA, and LST. Investigating the relationship between the altitude, aspect, and slope with LST showed that this parameter is strongly influenced by topographical factors; an increase in altitude, aspect, and slope leads to a decrease in LST. The correlation coefficients of altitude, aspect, and slope with the LST are estimated to be - 0.968, - 0.927, and - 0.684, respectively. The results of linking topographical factors with albedo showed that this parameter has a strong link with altitude, so as the altitude increases, there would be an increase in albedo. But there is no significant relationship between aspect and slope considering the low correlation coefficients. The correlation coefficients of latitude, aspect, and slope with LSA are 0.95, 0.087, and 0.18 respectively. Therefore, the altitude, aspect, and slope are important factors affecting the LST in Iran. Altitude also plays a vital role in the Iran's LSA.

TI  - Simultaneous multicolor imaging of lymph node chains using hydroporphyrin-doped near-infrared-emitting polymer dots
T2  - NANOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Evaluation of lymphatic drainage can be challenging to differentiate between separate drainage basins because only one 'color' is typically employed in sentinel node studies. This study aimed to test the feasibility of multicolor in vivo lymphangiography using newly developed organic polymer dots. Materials & methods: Biocompatible, purely organic, hydroporphyrin-doped near-infrared-emitting polymer dots were developed and evaluated for in vivo multicolor imaging in mouse lymph nodes. Results & conclusion: The authors demonstrated successful multicolor in vivo fluorescence lymphangiography using polymer dots, each tuned to a different emission spectrum. This allows minimally invasive visualization of at least four separate lymphatic drainage basins using fluorescent nanoparticles, which have the potential for clinical translation.

TI  - Estimating urban spatial structure based on remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial structure of a city is essential for formulating a spatial strategy for that city. In this study, we propose a method for analyzing the functional spatial structure of cities based on satellite remote sensing data. In this method, we first assume that urban functions consist of residential and central functions, and that these functions are measured by trip attraction by purpose. Next, we develop a model to explain trip attraction using remote sensing data, and estimate trip attraction on a grid basis. Using the estimated trip attraction, we created a contour tree to identify the spatial extent of the city and the hierarchical structure of the central functions of the city. As a result of applying this method to the Tokyo metropolitan area, we found that (1) our method reproduced 84% of urban areas and 94% of non-urban areas defined by the government, (2) our method extracted 848 urban centers, and their size distribution followed a Pareto distribution, and (3) the top-ranking urban centers were consistent with the districts defined in the master plans for the metropolitan area. Based on the results, we discussed the applicability of our method to urban structure analysis.

TI  - Contribution of Landsat imagery to map vulnerable areas to seawater intrusion along the Mt.-Cameroon coastal area using lineaments pattern
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Large overpopulated coastal areas are, nowadays, affected by seawater intrusion, and the contamination of the groundwater is a real threat. This paper aims to identify the zones along which seawater spreads in the Mt. Cameroon coastal region of Cameroon, and to map the most vulnerable areas to this threat. The results are based on the location of the contaminated boreholes, statistical analysis of automatic and manual lineaments, topographic and slope maps. The elaborated thematic maps allow identification of the fractured zones along which seawater can spread and the areas where the impact of this phenomenon could be more severe. The presence of a large number of contaminated coastal boreholes suggests that elevation (<100 masl), slope (<3 degrees) and fractures are the factors promoting the seawater intrusion along the narrow and flat coastal strip of study areas. The network of closely spaced and intersecting fractures along the gentle slope (<8 degrees) of the Mt. Cameroon, favour the boreholes contamination up to 4 km from the shoreline. Between the Mt. Cameroon and Limbe-Mabeta Massif, a wide NE-SW-oriented system of long and intersecting fractures, promote the inland seawater intrusion up to 10 km inland. The closely spaced and intersecting fractures along which seawater can easily spread has been reconstructed based on orientation, density and length of manual lineaments and the lineaments intersection map. Landsat 7 ETM + image is the one which provides the most reliable vulnerable zone with respect to lineament pattern in this region than both Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel 1-A images.

TI  - Remote sensing reveals unprecedented sublethal impacts of a 40-year-old oil spill on mangroves*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills cause long-lasting mangrove loss, threatening their conservation and ecosystem services worldwide. Oil spills impact mangrove forests at various spatial and temporal scales. Yet, their long-term sublethal effects on trees remain poorly documented. Here, we explore these effects based on one of the largest oil spills ever recorded, the Baixada Santista pipeline leak, which hit the mangroves of the Brazilian southeastern coast in 1983. Historical, Landsat-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) maps over the spilled mangrove reveal a large dieback of trees within a year following the oil spill, followed by a eight-year recolonization period and a stabilization of the canopy cover, however 20-30% lower than initially observed. We explain this permanent loss by an unexpected persistence of oil pollution in the sediments based on visual and geochemical evidence. Using field spectroscopy and cutting-edge drone hyperspectral imaging, we demonstrate how the continuous exposure of mangrove trees to high levels of pollution affects their health and productivity in the long term, by imposing permanent stressful conditions. Our study also reveals that tree species differ in their sensitivity to oil, giving the most tolerant ones a competitive advantage to recolonize spilled mangroves. By leveraging drone laser scanning, we estimate the loss of forest biomass caused by the oil spill to be 9.8-91.2 t ha- 1, corresponding to 4.3-40.1 t C ha- 1. Based on our findings, we encourage environmental agencies and lawmakers to consider the sublethal effects of oil spills on mangroves in the environmental cost of these accidents. We also encourage petroleum companies to use drone remote sensing in monitoring routines and oil spill response planning to improve mangrove preservation and impact assessment.

TI  - A global historical twice-daily (daytime and nighttime) land surfacetemperature dataset produced by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer observations from 1981 to 2021
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key variable for monitoring and evaluating global long-term climate change. However, existing satellite-based twice-daily LST products only date back to 2000, which makes it difficult to obtain robust long-term temperature variations. In this study, we developed the first global historical twice-daily LST dataset (GT-LST), with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Level-1b Global Area Coverage (GAC) data from 1981 to 2021. The GT-LST product was generated using four main processes: (1) GAC data reading, calibration, and preprocessing using opensource Python libraries; (2) cloud detection using the AVHRR-Phase I algorithm; (3) land surface emissivity estimation using an improved method considering annual land cover changes; (4) LST retrieval based on a nonlinear generalized split-window algorithm. Validation with in situ measurements from Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) sites and Baseline Surface Radiation Network sites showed that the overall root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of GT-LST varied from 1.6 to 4.0 K, and nighttime LSTs were typically better than daytime LSTs. Intercomparison with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer LST products (MYD11A1 and MYD21A1) revealed that the overall root-mean-square difference (RMSD) was approximately 3.0 K. Compared with MYD11A1 LST, GT-LST was overestimated, and relatively large RMSDs were obtained during the daytime, spring, and summer, whereas the significantly smaller positive bias was obtained between GT-LST and MYD21A1 LST. Furthermore, we compared our newly generated dataset with a global AVHRR daytime LST product at the selected measurements of SURFRAD sites (i.e., measurements of these two satellite datasets were valid), which revealed similar accuracies for the two datasets. However, GT-LST can additionally provide night-time LST, which can be combined with daytime observations estimating relatively accurate monthly mean LST, with an RMSE of 2.7 K. Finally, we compared GT-LST with a regional twice-daily AVHRR LST product over continental Africa in different seasons, with RMSDs ranging from 2.1 to 4.3 K. Considering these advantages, the proposed dataset provides a better data source for a range of research applications. GT-LST is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7113080 (1981-2000) (Li et al., 2022a), https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7134158 (2001-2005) (Li et al., 2022b), and https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7813607 (2006-2021) (J.

TI  - The uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP) in measuring people's exposure to green space using the integrated 3S approach
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - The "mobility turn" in environmental health studies promoted the integrated 3S (GIS, GPS, and remote sensing) approach in the study of urban residents' exposure to green space and corresponding health outcomes. However, few studies have examined the uncertainty induced by contextual settings when measuring people's exposure to green space using the conventional and integrated 3S approaches. In this paper, we compared the differences in green space exposure obtained from different geographic contexts using residence-based and mobility-based methods, multiple spatial resolutions, and buffer zones. We collected 7-day GPS trajectories from 208 participants at the 1-minute temporal resolution in Hong Kong. Entire Hong Kong's green space was delineated using multiple remote sensing data sources at 3 m, 10 m, and 30 m spatial resolutions. Lastly, the residence-based and mobility-based measurements of exposure to green space were calculated for each participant using 100 m, 300 m, and 500 m buffer zones at three spatial resolutions. Descriptive analyses, t-tests, and logistic regression were employed to examine the influence of different contextual settings on different measurements of green space exposure and their health effects. The results indicate multiple significant disparities. The most striking difference is that mobility-based measurements of exposure to green space are significantly higher than those of residence-based measurements, manifesting the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). For future studies, we suggest using mobility-based measurements of exposure to green space, smaller buffer zones, and finer spatial resolutions, which enable more accurate measurements of green space exposure for the study of green space's health effects.

TI  - Environmental conditions are the dominant factor influencing stability of terrestrial ecosystems on the Tibetan plateau
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem stability is essential for the sustainable provision of diverse ecosystem services. However, the factors that maintain ecosystem stability and their relative importance on the Tibetan Plateau, a region sensitive to climate change, remain unclear. Here, we combined data from ground-based biodiversity surveys at 143 sites from 2019 to 2021 with the temporal stability of ecosystems derived from remote sensing data from 2000 to 2020 to disentangle mechanisms of diversity-stability relationships. We further quantified the impact of biodiversity (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity) and environmental context (spatial location, climate, and soil conditions) on temporal stability. Our results show that the stability of a typical ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau is mainly regulated by environmental factors, and the environmental context can directly affect the stability of the ecosystem rather than indirectly through biodiversity. These findings are critical for adaptation measures and prioritizing conservation areas for future climate change scenarios.Environmental conditions contribute to maintaining the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems in the Tibetan plateau more than plant diversity, according to a data-model analysis based on ground field survey and remote sensing at 143 sites over 2019-2021.

TI  - Improvement of deep learning Method for water body segmentation of remote sensing images based on attention modules
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Traditional remote sensing water identification methods lack texture and shape information extraction, and the previous algorithms lack the versatility of satellite images of different resolutions. Therefore, for the remote sensing image water segmentation task, this paper first collects GF-2 images to establish a remote sensing image water segmentation dataset. PSPNet, Deeplab v3+, and U-Net have achieved good training results on this dataset. Secondly, to further improve the accuracy of water body segmentation, an attention module is introduced in the feature fusion part of the U-Net model to improve the feature fusion efficiency. Among them, a channel-spatial attention module, CBAM, performs the best. The experimental results show that the U-Net model introduced with CBAM has various degrees of improvement in the six evaluation indicators of remote sensing water body segmentation. The IoU and MIoU of CBAM-vgg16-UNet reach 92.66% and 95.91%, respectively. Finally, the experimental results show that the method also performs well on GF-1, GF-6, Landsat8 and EO-1 datasets, verifying the generality of the network.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a landslide susceptibility prediction model by applying the Frequency Ratio (FR) model and remote sensing data sets for the Northern part of Uttarakhand, India. First, a landslide inventory was carried out from the interpretation of satellite images. Thereafter, the landslide inventory points were randomly separated into training and validation datasets. Subsequently, the significant landslide causative factors such as slope, lithology, lineament density, land use/land cover, drainage density, aspect, elevation, road buffer, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), stream power index, and topographic wetness index were identified to run the model set up. Next, applying the FR statistical model in a GIS environment for development of landslide susceptibility index map and divided into five distinct landslide susceptibility zones (very low, low, moderate, high, and very high). To validate the results, the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve were developed to check the accurrancy of the model, and it was observed that the prediction value of the FR model was reasonably accurate (86.1% at 95% confidence level). The output LSI map would be helpful for the government and planners to map and monitor potential landslide areas and mitigate the hazards.

TI  - Forest Age Mapping Using Landsat Time-Series Stacks Data Based on Forest Disturbance and Empirical Relationships between Age and Height
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest age is a critical parameter for the status and potential of carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems and reflects major forest disturbance information. However, reliable forest age data with high spatial resolution are lacking to date. In this study, we proposed a forest age mapping method with a 30 m resolution that considers forest disturbance. Here, we used the Landsat time-series stacks (LTSS) data from 1986 to 2021 and implemented the LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to detect the age of disturbed forests. The age of non-disturbed forests was extracted based on forest canopy height data and the empirical relationship between age and height. High-resolution Google images combined with the forest management archive data of forestry departments and national forest inventory (NFI) data were used for the validation of disturbed and non-disturbed forest age, respectively. The results showed that the LandTrendr algorithm detected disturbance years with producer and user accuracies of approximately 94% and 95%, respectively; and the age of non-disturbed forests obtained using the empirical age-height relationship showed an R-2 of 0.8875 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 5.776 with NFI-based results. This confirms the reliability of the proposed 30 m resolution forest age mapping method considering forest disturbance. Overall, the method can be used to produce spatially explicit forest age data with high resolution, which can contribute to the sustainable use of forest resources and enhance the understanding of carbon budget studies in forest ecosystems.

T2  - Journal of gynecologic oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to validate the surgical and oncologic outcomes of robotic surgery with sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) in endometrial cancer.METHODS: This study included 130 patients with endometrial cancer, who underwent robotic surgery, including hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic SNNS at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of Kagoshima University Hospital. Pelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were identified using the uterine cervix 99m Technetium-labeled phytate and indocyanine green injections. Surgery-related and survival outcomes were also evaluated.RESULTS: The median operative and console times and volume of blood loss were 204 (range: 101-555) minutes, 152 (range: 70-453) minutes, and 20 (range: 2-620) mL, respectively. The bilateral and unilateral pelvic SLN detection rates were 90.0% (117/130) and 5.4% (7/130), respectively, and the identification rate (the rate at which at least one SLN could be identified on either side) was 95% (124/130). Lower extremity lymphedema occurred in only 1 patient (0.8%), and no pelvic lymphocele occurred. Recurrence occurred in 3 patients (2.3%), and the recurrence site was the abdominal cavity, with dissemination in 2 patients and vaginal stump in one. The 3-year recurrence-free survival and 3-year overall survival rates were 97.1% and 98.9%, respectively.CONCLUSION: Robotic surgery with SNNS for endometrial cancer showed a high SLN identification rate, low occurrence rates of lower extremity lymphedema and pelvic lymphocele, and excellent oncologic outcomes.

TI  - Vegetation EVI changes and response to natural factors and human activities based on geographically and temporally weighted regression
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The research on vegetation changes plays a crucial role in the assessment of ecosystem health, monitoring environmental changes, providing early warnings for natural disasters, and supporting decision-making for sustainable development. However, understanding the nonstationary characteristics of drivers affecting vegetation change remains challenging. This study used Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data obtained through Google Earth Engine (GEE), Theil-Sen, and Mann-Kendall methods to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns and trends of vegetation changes in Sichuan, western China from 2000 to 2020. The Geographical and Temporal Weighted Regression (GTWR) method was applied to deal with spatial and temporal nonstationarity simultaneously. Results showed that vegetation cover in Sichuan was good overall, with medium and high vegetation covering more than 78% of the area. About 72.75% of the area showed an increasing trend in vegetation cover, and areas with extremely significant and significant EVI growth (p < 0.01 and 0.01 & LE; p < 0.05) accounted for 23.94% of the total area. The areas with significant increases in vegetation EVI were mainly distributed in northeast, east, southeast, central, and southwest in Sichuan, while the areas with significant decreases were mainly distributed in the central Sichuan plain urban agglomeration and western Sichuan plateau. GTWR addressed the nonstationary effect of the temporal dimension on the drivers of natural and human activities, with a fitted R2 of 0.846. The study identified climate, terrain, and human activities as the primary driving factors behind vegetation EVI fluctuations. Annual average temperature and precipitation, human activities, and slope had a positive impact on vegetation EVI changes, while solar radiation and aspect had a negative inhibitory effect. The effects of climate, terrain, and human activities on EVI changes exhibited significant spatial heterogeneity and clustering, resulting in either positive promotion or negative inhibition. This study provides an additional methodology to solve the nonstationary problem of vegetation change trends and their response mechanisms. The revealed changes in vegetation EVI and the spatiotemporal heterogeneity characteristics of their driving factors are important for fragile ecosystems to adapt to and mitigate the effects of natural changes and human activities. Revealing the variations in vegetation EVI and their underlying drivers can showcase diverse characteristics across regions and time periods, the presence of spatiotemporal heterogeneity holds great significance in

TI  - Multiobjective optimization of regional irrigation and nitrogen schedules by using the CERES-Maize model with crop parameters determined from the remotely sensed leaf area index
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using crop models to develop reasonable irrigation and nitrogen schedules (INSs) is critical for achieving high yields and maximizing water use efficiency (WUE) and nitrogen use efficiency. However, the INSs developed based on crop parameters determined through field experiments have low robustness at the regional scale. Remote sensing data indicate the growth conditions of regional crops, and representative regional crop parameters can be determined using remote sensing data. The objective of the present study was to develop a regional INS by adopting a crop model with crop parameters calibrated using the remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI). First, the crop parameters of a field-scale crop model were calibrated on the basis of field-scale trial data for four summer maize growing seasons. Sensitive crop parameters at the regional scale were then identified using an assimilation algorithm based on the remotely sensed LAI. The rationality of using the remotely sensed LAI for determining regional crop parameters was demonstrated by simulating regional maize growth. Finally, a regional-scale crop model was developed and coupled with a multiobjective genetic algorithm to optimize the regional INS for different typical-rainfall years. The results indicated that the regional-scale crop model was more accurate than was the field-scale crop model in simulating the regional LAI, plant height, soil water content, and yield and the corresponding RMSE decreased by 0.50 m2/m2, 0.15 m, 0.02 cm3/cm3, 344.11 kg/ha. Compared with the INSs currently used by farmers, the optimized INS was associated with a marginally higher irrigation quantity (average increase of 2.66%) but a significantly lower nitrogen application rate (average decrease of 31.6%). The crop yield, WUE, and partial factor productivity for nitrogen were 6.35-12.51%, 2.64-10.41%, and 61.8-66.2% higher, respectively, in different typical-rainfall years when using the optimized INS than when using an unoptimized INS. The results of this study indicate that a regional INS established on the basis of regional crop model parameters estimated using remote sensing data can aid irrigation and nitrogen application scheduling.

TI  - The Changes in Dominant Driving Factors in the Evolution Process of Wetland in the Yellow River Delta during 2015-2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the previous studies exploring the changing patterns of wetland in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) were conducted based on sparse time-series images, which ignored its severe environmental gradient and rapid evolution process of the wetland. The changes in the dominant factors in the evolution of the wetland in the YRD are not clear. This study used the dense time-series Sentinel-2 images to establish a wetland database of the YRD, and then analyzed the spatial distribution characteristics of, and temporal changes in, the wetland during 2015-2022. Finally, the dominant factors of the spatio-temporal evolutions of the wetland were explored and revealed. The results showed the following. (1) During 2015-2022, the wetland in the YRD was dominated by artificial wetland, accounting for 54.02% of the total wetland area in the study area. In 2015-2022, the total wetland area increased by 309.90 km(2), including an increase of 222.63 km(2) in natural wetlands and 87.27 km(2) in artificial wetlands. In the conversion between wetland types, 218.73 km(2) of artificial wetlands were converted into natural wetlands, and 75.18 km(2) of natural wetlands were converted into artificial wetlands. The patch density of rivers, swamps, and salt pans increased, showing a trend of fragmentation. However, the overall degree of landscape fragmentation in wetlands weakened. The trend of changes in the number of patches and landscape shape index was the same, while the trend of changes in Shannon's diversity index and Contagion index was completely opposite. (2) Natural factors, such as precipitation (0.51, 2015; 0.65, 2016), DEM (0.57, 2017; 0.47, 2018; 0.49, 2020; 0.46, 2021), vegetation coverage (0.59, 2019), and temperature (0.48, 2022), were the dominant influencing factors of wetland changes in the YRD. The dominant single factor causing the changes in artificial wetlands was vegetation coverage, while socio-economic factors had lower explanatory power, with the average q value of 0.18. (3) During 2015-2022, the interactions between the natural and artificial factors of the wetland changes were mostly nonlinear and showed double-factor enhancement. The interactions between temperature and sunshine hours had the largest explanatory power for natural wetland change, while interactions between precipitation and vegetation coverage, and between temperature and vegetation coverage, had large contribution rates for artificial wetland change. The interactions among natural factors had the greatest impacts on wetland change, followed by interactions between natural factors and socio-economic factors, while interactions among socio-economic factors had more slight impacts on wetland change. The results can provide a scientific basis for regional wetland protection and management.

TI  - Mapping Insect-Proof Screened Citrus Orchards Using Sentinel-2 MSl Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Citrus is a crucial agricultural commodity of the hilly subtropical regions of southern China. Attempts in recent years to combat the destructive disease Huanglongbing (HLB) have led to citrus orchards being covered with insect-proof screens (IPS). Understanding which citrus orchards are covered by IPS is crucial for regional water and soil conservation, as well as control of plastic pollution. However, monitoring of orchards is complicated by IPS spectral interference in remotely sensed image classification. Here, an optimal feature combination scheme is developed and tested for mapping citrus orchards that use IPS. Seasonal Sentinel-2 images from 2021 were used to define indices for vegetation, plastic mulch, red edge, and texture. These were combined with topographic and land surface temperature using random forest classification to determine optimal feature discrimination combinations for orchards in Xunwu County, Jiangxi Province. Results show: (1) significantly higher visible light reflectance from IPS orchards ensures spectral discrimination between IPS covered and uncovered orchards. (2) After feature optimization, the seasonal spectral band has the highest accuracy (86%) in single feature classification. The addition of conventional indices and topographic-temperature features improves classification to 92%. (3) Xunwu County had 460 km(2) of citrus orchard cover in 2021, with 88 km(2) (19%) of that total being covered with IPS. Our method effectively and accurately maps citrus orchards with or without IPS coverage at 10 m resolution. The effective monitoring of large-scale IPS in other regions can now support the development of local and regional sustainable agricultural policies.

TI  - Mapping Maize Cropland and Land Cover in Semi-Arid Region in Northern Nigeria Using Machine Learning and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of crop quantity and quality is vital for global food security. National food security has recently been at the forefront of local and regional research, and has become a vital priority for most developing countries. Therefore, ensuring reliable classification of cropland and other land cover is crucial for sustainable agricultural development and ensuring national food security. A good understanding of the Nigerian agricultural sector is essential to making better decisions and managing operations more efficiently. Scientists, practitioners, and policymakers must exchange reliable information to develop and support agricultural programs and policies. It is essential to develop and implement novel methods for mapping maize cropland and other land cover types. Thus, Seasonal Crop Inventory (SCI) is a valuable tool for farmers, researchers, and policymakers, as it provides critical information on crop production. It informs decisions related to land management, food security, and agricultural policy. In this study, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images have been combined to map maize cropland and other land covers in northern Nigeria during the 2016-2019 growing season. We employed a technologically advanced space-based remote sensing technique. As a pioneer study that obtained detailed information on northern Nigeria's cropland, the research utilized platforms such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-computing engine using various classification techniques that include Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification Regression Trees (CART) algorithms to produce a pixel-based Seasonal Crop Inventory of the study area. The outcome demonstrated a reliable GEE-based mapping of the region's cropland with satisfactory classification accuracy. It revealed the overall accuracy values and the Kappa coefficients to be above 97% during the different time nodes under study. It also indicated a 98% and 93% producer and user accuracy for the cropland. The research further revealed that the Random Forest performed the best among the three machine-learning models tested in this study for mapping the maize cropland and other land cover classes. Therefore, the study's findings and the derived crop mapping would greatly help provide valuable information that helps farmers, policymakers, and other stakeholders make more informed decisions about agricultural production, land use planning, and resource management.

TI  - Retrieval uncertainty and consistency of Suomi-NPP VIIRS Deep Blue and Dark Target aerosol products under diverse aerosol loading scenarios over South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval accuracy and stability of two operational aerosol retrieval algorithms, Deep Blue (DB) and Dark Target (DT), applied on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on-board Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite were evaluated over South Asia. The region is reported to be highly challenging to accurate estimation of satellite-based aerosol optical properties due to variations in surface reflectance, complex aerosol system and regional meteorology. Performance of both algorithms were initially evaluated by comparing their ability to retrieve aerosol signal over the complex geographical region under specific air pollution emission scenario. Thereafter, retrieval accuracy was investigated against 10 AERONET sites across South Asia, selected based on their geography and predominance aerosol types, from year 2012-2021. Geospatial analysis indicates DB to efficiently retrieve fine aerosol features over bright arid surfaces, and for smoke/dust dominating events whereas DT was better to identify small fire events under dark vegetated surface. Both algorithms however, indicate unsatisfactory retrieval accuracy against AERONET having 56-59% of valid retrievals with high RMSE (0.30-0.33) and bias. Overall, DB slightly underpredicted AOD with -0.02 mean bias (MB) whereas DT overpredicted AOD (MB: 0.13), with seasonality in their retrieval efficiency against AERONET. Time-series analysis indicates stability in retrieving AOD and match-up number for both algorithms. Retrieval bias of DB and DT AOD against AERONET AOD under diverse aerosol loading, aerosol size, scattering/absorbing aerosol, and surface vegetation coverage scenarios revealed DT to be more influenced by these conditions. Error analysis indicates at low AOD (& LE;0.2), accuracy of both DB and DT were subject to underlying vegetation coverage. At AOD>0.2, DB performed well in retrieving coarse aerosols whereas DT was superior when fine aerosols dominated. Overall, accuracy of both VIIRS algorithms require further refinement to continue MODIS AOD legacy over South Asia.

TI  - A small survey for massive stars in the LMC/SMC: binaries and pulsations
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Binarity and pulsations are two notable properties that frequently appear together in massive stars. To place constraints on how binarity affects stellar evolution, the exact parameters of massive stars in binary systems must be known. Their exact and accurate masses and radii, which were calculated from binary dynamics, present model-independent restrictions and challenge existing theories of stellar evolution. In this investigation, our goal is to determine the atmospheric characteristics of nine double-lined spectroscopic binaries that are located in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud. Nine newly discovered double-lined eclipsing binaries with B-type massive components have been studied; these binaries were found using the OGLE variable star catalogues. The absolute physical parameters of each component have been measured with an accuracy of less than or equal to 3 per cent. By analysing through Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data of the systems, we were able to identify five candidates for slowly pulsating B stars in massive binary systems with masses ranging from 2 to 25 M-circle dot. According to the results of the preliminary research, the orbital periods of these binary systems span anywhere from 1.8 to 6.3 d, whereas the pulsating periods range anywhere from 0.3 to 1.5 d. The achievement in identifying a significant number of pulsating eclipsing systems opens the door to the initial sensible approach of constraining the internal physics of a group of massive stars via asteroseismology of eclipsing binaries including such stars.

TI  - Can Axillary Lymph Node Dissection be Omitted in Breast Cancer Patients with Metastatic Sentinel Lymph Nodes Undergoing Mastectomy? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Real-World Evidence
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundThe omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients with breast cancer who have metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) undergoing mastectomy remains controversial. This meta-analysis explored the clinicopathological factors affecting the selection of ALND and the influences of ALND on survival outcomes in patients receiving mastectomy with positive SLNs.MethodsEligible studies published prior to 31 December 2022 were selected by searching the Embase, Web of Science and PubMed databases. Pooled analyses were performed using the number of events for clinicopathological parameters and HRs with 95% CIs for survival outcomes including disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS).ResultsA total of 10 retrospective studies enrolling only breast cancer patients with limited SLN metastases (no more than 3 positive SLNs or micrometastatic SLNs) undergoing mastectomy were included. Performing ALND in mastectomy patients who had limited SLN metastases was significantly correlated with invasive ductal carcinomas, larger tumors, lymphovascular invasion, higher tumor grade, macrometastatic SLNs, more positive SLNs, extranodal extension, positive surgical margins, negative ER, administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and nonwhite race (P < 0.05). However, performing ALND did not result in significantly longer OS, DFS, LRFS or DRFS (P > 0.05) in these patients.ConclusionThe present meta-analysis indicated that ALND may be safely avoided in patients with breast cancer who had limited SLN metastases undergoing mastectomy. Further well-designed randomized clinical trials are warranted to validate our results.

TI  - Snowpack Dynamics Influence Tree Growth and Signals in Tree Rings of Tianshan Mountain, Central Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is an important source of freshwater in the Tianshan Mountains of Central Asia. This study established 18 tree ring width chronologies and compound chronologies and analyzed the effects of snow depth, measured both by remote sensing and at meteorological stations, on the radial growth of spruce trees. The results showed that the established standard chronology of tree ring width is suitable for the analysis of tree ring climatology. The correlation coefficient of the ring width index (RWI) and the remote sensing snow depth was greater than that of the meteorological station snow depth. For the remote sensing snow depth, the correlation coefficients were greater in the winter and spring months compare to other periods, while the correlation coefficients of the meteorological stations were greater only in the winter. The nonlinear method (BRNN) showed good fitting in the reconstruction of the historical snow depth. The reconstructed snow depth exhibited a decreasing trend in the Bharakonu Mountains (BM), Narathi Mountains (NM), and Halke mountains (KM) sub-regions in the overall reconstructed period; however, the trends were inconsistent in both the historical and the observed periods, indicating the importance of reconstructing snow depth in the Tianshan Mountains.

TI  - Inequalities in residential nature and nature-based recreation are not universal: A country-level analysis in Austria
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence suggests that residential nature, e.g., greenness around the home, and nature-based recreation, e.g., visits to specific natural locations, are beneficial for health and well-being. However, several studies report that residential access is lower among socio-economically disadvantaged communities, potentially exacerbating health inequalities. We explored this issue in Austria, a relatively rural and mountainous country that also contains several cities, including the capital Vienna with around 2 million citizens. Data were drawn from a representative survey of the adult population across all nine Austrian regions (N symbolscript 2258) and explored socio-demographic predictors of residential green and blue space (using satellite data on surrounding greenness and distance to rivers and lakes), and visit frequencies to 12 different urban and rural green/blue environments. In contrast to most findings elsewhere, which usually focus on relatively specific locations (e.g., cities), we found little evidence of socio-economic inequalities in residential green/blue space at the whole country level. Further, although frequent visits to specific environments were less likely among, e.g., people with lower vs. higher education, other typically disadvantaged groups, e.g., those self-identifying as belonging vs. not belonging to an ethnic minority, reported more visits to e.g., urban parks and rivers. Findings suggest that inequalities in nature exposure may not be universal when considered at a country level.

TI  - Towards a Digital Twin Prototype of Alpine Glaciers: Proposal for a Possible Theoretical Framework
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Destination Earth (DestinE) European initiative has recently brought into the scientific community the concept of the Digital Twin (DT) applied to Earth Sciences. Within 2030, a very high precision digital model of the Earth, continuously fed and powered by Earth Observation (EO) data, will provide as many digital replicas (DTs) as the different domains of the earth sciences are. Considering that a DT is driven by use cases, depending on the selected application, the provided information has to change. It follows that, to achieve a reliable representation of the selected use case, a reasonable and complete a priori definition of the needed elements that DT must contain is mandatory. In this work, we define a possible theoretical framework for a future DT of the Italian Alpine glaciers, trying to define and describe all those information (both EO and in situ data) and relationships that necessarily have to enter the process as building blocks of the DT itself. Two main aspects of glaciers were considered and investigated: (i) the "metric quantification" of their spatial dynamics (achieved through measures) and (ii) the "qualitative (semantic) description" of their health status as definable through observations from domain experts. After the first identification of the building blocks, the work proceeds focusing on existing EO data sources providing their essential elements, with specific focus on open access high-resolution (HR) and very-high-resolution (VHR) images. This last issue considered two scales of analysis: local (single glacier) and regional (Italian Alps). Some considerations were furtherly reported about the expected glaciers-related applications enabled by the availability of a DT at regional level. Applications involving both metric and semantic information were considered and grouped in three main clusters: Glaciers Evolution Modelling (GEM), 4D Multi Reality, and Virtual Reality. Limitations were additionally explored, mainly related to the technical characteristics of available EO VHR open data and some conclusions provided.

TI  - Large-Scale Land Subsidence Monitoring and Prediction Based on SBAS-InSAR Technology with Time-Series Sentinel-1A Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban development in China has aggravated land subsidence, which poses a potential threat to sustainable urban development. It is imperative to monitor and predict land subsidence over large areas. To address these issues, we chose Henan Province as the study area and applied small baseline subset-interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SBAS-InSAR) technology to obtain land deformation information for monitoring land subsidence from November 2019 to February 2022 with 364 multitrack Sentinel-1A satellite images. The current traditional time-series deep learning models suffer from the problems of (1) poor results in extracting a sequence of information that is too long and (2) the inability to extract the feature information between the influence factor and the land subsidence well. Therefore, a long short-term memory-temporal convolutional network (LSTM-TCN) deep learning model was proposed in order to predict land subsidence and explore the influence of environmental factors, such as the volumetric soil water layer and monthly precipitation, on land subsidence in this study. We used leveling data to verify the effectiveness of SBAS-InSAR in land subsidence monitoring. The results of SBAS-InSAR showed that the land subsidence in Henan Province was obvious and uneven in spatial distribution. The maximum subsidence velocity was -94.54 mm/a, and the uplift velocity was 41.23 mm/a during the monitoring period. Simultaneously, the land subsidence in the study area presented seasonal changes. The rate of land subsidence in spring and summer was greater than that in autumn and winter. The prediction accuracy of the LSTM-TCN model was significantly better than that of the individual LSTM and TCN models because it fully combined their advantages. In addition, the prediction accuracies, with the addition of environmental factors, were improved compared with those using only time-series subsidence information.

TI  - Canopy reflectance spectra's variability, physical traits' uniqueness and the prediction of rubber clones<i> (Hevea</i><i> brasiliensis)</i>
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Before implementing any further precision agriculture applications, the crucial task is to determine the rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) clones. This paper addresses the potential of using canopy spectral indices (CSIs) to delineate mature rubber clones. Each rubber clone responds differently to its local environment. Unfortunately, checking a sizeable mature rubber plantation and determining each rubber tree's clone is tedious and time-consuming. It is, therefore, of interest and objective to classify and predict rubber clones via CSIs. This study highlighted statistically significant differences in the physical and spectral functional traits' variability among nine mature rubber clones in a micro-agroclimatic environment with uniform management practices. We analysed the trunk girth, leaf physical properties and multispectral remote sensing data collected by a low-cost unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to explore the mature rubber canopy's spectral indices, which are a crucial unique trait of rubber clones. We found that rubber leaf area increases with leaf mass. There is a positive relationship between trunk girth and leaf mass per area (LMA). Furthermore, leaf density and NDVI have a strong relationship that potentially links both traits. The additional assessment indicates that none of the 89 CSIs independently could discriminate between all nine rubber clones. However, several CSIs could distinguish several individual rubber clones or two or more groups of rubber clones. The classification results selected B1, NDVI, NDRE, RB3B2B4, GARI and BWDRVI as the most important CSIs. The generated models estimated that individual rubber clone prediction by CSIs provided low to moderate overall accuracy between 41.8 & PLUSMN; 5.3% and 82.3 & PLUSMN; 3.9%. Despite the variability, our findings highlighted a promising approach using CSI traits as a practical way to achieve accurate rubber clone predictions because of their uniqueness for specific clones or groups of clones.

TI  - Using a deep neural network to detect methane point sources and quantify emissions from PRISMA hyperspectral satellite images
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic emissions of methane (CH4) have made a considerable contribution towards the Earth's changing radiative budget since pre-industrial times. This is because large amounts of methane are emitted from human activities, and the global warming potential of methane is high. The majority of anthropogenic fossil methane emissions to the atmosphere originate from a large number of small (point) sources. Thus, detection and accurate, rapid quantification of such emissions are vital to enable the reduction of emissions to help mitigate future climate change. There exist a number of instruments on satellites that measure radiation at methane-absorbing wavelengths, which have sufficiently high spatial resolution that can be used for detecting plumes of highly spatially localised methane "point sources" (areas on the order of m(2) to km(2)). Searching for methane plumes in methane-sensitive satellite images using classical methods, such as thresholding and clustering, can be useful but is time-consuming and often involves empirical decisions. Here, we develop a deep neural network to identify and quantify methane point source emissions from hyperspectral imagery from the PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) satellite with 30m spatial resolution. The moderately high spectral and spatial resolution, as well as considerable global coverage and free access to data, makes PRISMA a good candidate for methane plume detection. The neural network was trained with simulated synthetic methane plumes generated with the large eddy simulation extension of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-LES), which we embedded into PRISMA images. The deep neural network was successful at locating plumes with a F1 score, precision, and recall of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.92, respectively, and was able to quantify emission rates with a mean error of 24 %. The neural network was furthermore able to locate several plumes in real-world images. We have thus demonstrated that our method can be effective in locating and quantifying methane point source emissions in near-real time from 30m resolution satellite data, which can aid us in mitigating future climate change.

TI  - Poleward migration of tropical cyclones induced severe disturbance of boreal forest above 50°
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With global warming, tropical cyclones (TCs) are moving to northern latitudes with devastating effects on boreal for-ests and significant ecological and socioeconomic consequences in the northern hemisphere. Recently, TCs distur-bances have been documented in the northern temperate and even the southern boreal forest zone. Here we report and quantify the impact of TC Lingling (2019), which damaged the boreal forests >50 & DEG; latitude in a remote area of Sakhalin Island, Northeast Asia. A multi-step algorithm was used to identify disturbed forested areas together with Sentinel-2 imagery to recognize windthrow patches caused by TCs and evaluate tree species composition. We found extensive damage to boreal forests caused by TC Lingling, with forested area losses of >80 km2. The affected areas mainly belonged to zonal dark coniferous forests, which account for 54 km2 of windthrows. In contrast, a lower impact was recorded in deciduous broadleaf and larch forests. TC Lingling caused a high proportion (>50 %) of large gaps (>10 ha), however, gaps of such extent have not been previously recorded in these dark coniferous forests. Hence, our study highlights the potential of TCs as the new disturbance agent responsible for extensive disturbances of boreal forests at more northern latitudes than previously thought. This implies the significant role of TCs in disturbance re-gimes and boreal forest dynamics. We suggest that continued poleward migration of TCs may lead to an unprecedent-edly large area of disturbed boreal forests resulting in complex changes in diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our findings are crucial for identifying potential shifts in boreal forest structure and dynamics under ongoing global climate change and altered forest disturbance regimes.

TI  - Ocean Clutter Characterization Based on PolSAR Data and Second-Order Statistics of Elementary Scatterers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New features are proposed for sea clutter characterization when PolSAR data are employed. Cameron coherent target decomposition is applied to characterize each SAR pixel by means of the 8 basic elementary scatterers obtained by this decomposition. Since the examined SAR pixel does not match exactly to a specific ideal elementary scatterer, the closest scatterer is assigned to this pixel along with its distance (closeness) from the ideal one. The features proposed are (a) the percentage of each elementary scatterer in the investigated region; (b) the distribution of the closeness of each declared elementary scattering mechanism to its ideal counterpart; (c) the co-occurrence of the same scattering mechanism, taking into consideration its distance from the ideal one; and (d) The co-occurrence of the different scattering mechanisms in pairs, taking again into consideration their distance from the ideal ones. Simultaneously, the skewness and the kurtosis and their 2D versions of the previously mentioned probabilities are employed to further improve ocean clutter characterization. The above features correspond to the sea state condition in each separate region, i.e., the wave height and the wind speed. A clear correspondence between the proposed features and the sea state conditions is established. Data were available from RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-1 PALSAR systems for four different ocean regions on Earth.

TI  - Beyond "greening" and "browning": Trends in grassland ground cover fractions across Eurasia that account for spatial and temporal autocorrelation
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland ecosystems cover up to 40% of the global land area and provide many ecosystem services directly supporting the livelihoods of over 1 billion people. Monitoring long-term changes in grasslands is crucial for food security, biodiversity conservation, achieving Land Degradation Neutrality goals, and modeling the global carbon budget. Although long-term grassland monitoring using remote sensing is extensive, it is typically based on a single vegetation index and does not account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which means that some trends are falsely identified while others are missed. Our goal was to analyze trends in grasslands in Eurasia, the largest continuous grassland ecosystems on Earth. To do so, we calculated Cumulative Endmember Fractions (annual sums of monthly ground cover fractions) derived from MODIS 2002-2020 time series, and applied a new statistical approach PARTS that explicitly accounts for temporal and spatial autocorrelation in trends. We examined trends in green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and soil ground cover fractions considering their independent change trajectories and relations among fractions over time. We derived temporally uncorrelated pixel-based trend maps and statistically tested whether observed trends could be explained by elevation, land cover, SPEI3, climate, country, and their combinations, all while accounting for spatial autocorrelation. We found no statistical evidence for a decrease in vegetation cover in grasslands in Eurasia. Instead, there was a significant map-level increase in non-photosynthetic vegetation across the region and local increases in green vegetation with a concomitant decrease in soil fraction. Independent environmental variables affected trends significantly, but effects varied by region. Overall, our analyses show in a statistically robust manner that Eurasian grasslands have changed considerably over the past two decades. Our approach enhances remote sensing-based monitoring of trends in grasslands so that underlying processes can be discerned.

TI  - Farmland abandonment in the mountainous areas from an ecological restoration perspective: A case study of Chongqing, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland abandonment reflects the decline of rural areas, resulting in a series of vicious chain reactions, hindering the promotion of the comprehensive rural revitalization strategy. From the perspective of ecological restoration, this paper integrated multi-source data such as Landsat, GF-1, and Google Earth images and household survey data, aiming to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern, attribution, and mechanism of farmland abandonment in typical mountainous areas over the past 20 years by employing spatial analysis and mathematical models and to promote comprehensive management of abandoned farmland. The results are as follows. (1) The scope of abandoned farmland in Chongqing has been expanding, with the abandoned area growing from 142,385.8 hm2 to 345,778.4 hm2 from 2000 to 2020, with the initially abandoned farmland mostly concentrated in the northeastern areas, such as Chengkou, with an abandonment rate of 21.8%, and thereafter, spreading in all directions; In the end, abandoned farmland was concentrated in northeastern and southeastern Chongqing, such as Wuxi and Youyang, with abandonment rates of approximately 25.1% and 20%, respectively. (2) The attribution of farmland abandonment mainly includes wild boar damage, labour shortage, and natural conditions, among which wild boar proliferation has become an important factor under the background of ecological restoration. (3) Ecological restoration has produced a counter-servicing effect of the ecosystem on human beings, forming a vicious circle in the mountainous countryside where ecological restoration continues to aggravate farmland abandonment. The contribution of this study is to investigate the pattern of farmland abandonment from both macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. At the same time, this paper explores the intrinsic mechanism between ecological restoration and farmland abandonment and proposes scientific countermeasures to break the vicious cycle of ecological restoration that continues to exacerbate farmland abandonment in mountainous areas.

TI  - Knowledge Gaps and Impact of Future Satellite Missions to Facilitate Monitoring of Changes in the Arctic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Polar-orbiting satellite observations are of fundamental importance to explore the main scientific challenges in the Arctic Ocean, as they provide information on bio-geo-physical variables with a denser spatial and temporal coverage than in-situ instruments in such a harsh and inaccessible environment. However, they are limited by the lack of coverage near the North Pole (Polar gap), the polar night, and frequent cloud cover or haze over the ocean and sea ice, which prevent the use of optical satellite instruments, as well as by the limited availability of external validation data. The satellite sensors' coverage and repeat cycles may also have limitations in properly identifying and resolving the dominant spatial and temporal scales of atmospheric, ocean, cryosphere and land variability and their interactive processes and feedback mechanisms. In this paper, we provide a state of the art of contribution of satellite observations to the understanding of the polar environment and climate scientific challenges tackled within the Arktalas Hoavva project funded by the European Space Agency. We identify the current limitations to the wider use of polar orbiting remote sensing data, as well as the observational gaps of the existing satellite missions. A comprehensive overview of all satellite missions and applications is given provided with a primary focus on the European satellites. Finally, we assess the expected capability of the approved future satellite missions to answer today's scientific challenges in the Arctic Ocean.

TI  - Tectonic controls on the ecosystem of the Mara River basin, East Africa,from geomorphological and spectral index analysis
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tectonic activity impacts the environment; therefore, identifying the influence of active faulting on environmental factors, such as soil development and vegetation growth patterns, is valuable in better understanding ecosystem functions. Here, we illustrate how tectonic activity and the lithology of bedrock influence temporal and spatial patterns of vegetation and soil parameters in a fault-controlled river basin.The Mara River basin lies in a region of previously unrecognised active normal faulting, dominated by the Utimbara and Isuria faults, resulting in areas of relative uplift, subsidence and tilting. Faulting leads to spatially variable erosion and soil formation rates as well as disruption and modification of drainage systems. On a small scale, steep escarpments cast shade and provide shelter. All of these factors might be expected to exert controls on ecosystem dynamics on a range of lengths and timescales. Here, we investigate tectonic controls on ecological processes in the Mara River basin using TanDEM-X and Sentinel-2 data. We use high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) to map the Utimbara and Isuria faults and to measure the height of the escarpments (up to 400 m) along the length of the faults. Total fault offset can be estimated by correlating Neogene phonolite lavas (thought to be 3.5-4.5 Myr old) on either side of the faults. If the age is correct, slip rates can be estimated to be on the order of 0.1 mm yr(-1). Analysis of DEMs also reveals the presence of recent earthquake scarps in the hanging-wall sediments of the main faults and extensive alluvial fan formation on the hanging wall. Low mountain front sinuosity values and the presence of steep escarpments also suggest recent activity. Drainage is displaced across the fault traces, and, in one area, it is possible to map the lateral channel migration of the Mara River due to hanging-wall tilting.We used a 5-year normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series, the clay mineral ratio (CMR) and a moisture stress index (MSI) to investigate spatiotemporal vegetation patterns and soil formation. Whilst lithology does exert some control, as expected, we observed that the downthrown hanging wall of the faults, especially directly adjacent to the escarpment, is consistently associated with a higher degree of vegetation, wetland formation and clay distribution. Analysis of spectral indices shows that the overall spatial pattern of vegetation cover is seasonally low in the flat plains and perennially high in the vicinity of more complex, tectonically influenced structures. The NDVI highlights several locations with permanently healthy vegetation along the escarpment which extend downslope for several kilometres. Our study shows that in the Mara River basin, active normal faulting is an important stabiliser of vegetation growth patterns, likely caused by favourable hydrological and pedological conditions along the escarpments; tectonic activity has a direct beneficial influence on ecological processes in this climatically sensitive region.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study targets modeling the mangrove's gross primary productivity (GPP) through path analysis using Sentinel-2 satellite-derived optical indices and climatic factors. The formulated objectives were executed in the Pichavaram mangrove regions of India. The bio-physical related Near Infrared vegetation (NIRv), chlorophyll-related red edge symmetry (RES), pigment-related Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI), and water-content related Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) along with precipitation and temperature z-score values were found to be the appropriate causal variables for modeling the GPP of mangroves. The path model applied in the present study helped to understand the direct and indirect influences of optical indices and climatic factors on estimating GPP. Using the path analysis technique, the concurrent inputs of Sentinel-2 optical indices and climatic factors accurately estimated the GPP of mangroves (R-2-0.76), RMSE = 0.58 g Cm(-2)day(-1),p<0.001). Another remarkable outcome of the study was the synchronization of the period of the peak growing season of mangroves with the duration between the downward zero-crossing and upward zero-crossing of the z-score quantifier depicting the temperature and precipitation effect. This statistical correspondence with phenological aspects creates a scope for modeling the phenology of mangroves. The path model decomposition outcomes of the present investigation facilitate the refinement of parameterization of the light-use efficiency models.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we determined whether changes in vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) can be used to characterize the quality of terrestrial ecosystems, which is critical for global change and carbon balance. We first explored the spatial correlation of NPP and its impact on vegetation restoration. MOD17A3 remote sensing products were used to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in NPP on the Loess Plateau (LP) over the last two decades (2000-2020). The resulting spatial autocorrelation indices identified cold and hot spots in the spatial clustering patterns. The effects of climate change and human activities on the anomalous clustering of NPP were assessed using Pearson correlation analysis and multi-temporal land use land cover data. The results indicate that i) Temporally, from 2000 to 2020, the NPP of the LP increased significantly by 6.88 g Cm-2 yr(-1) and so did the proportion of revegetated land area >400 g Cm-2 yr(-1) from 4% to 37%. Spatially, NPP showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast. ii) The vegetation NPP on the LP showed a strong positive global spatial autocorrelation (p< 0.01). The hot and cold regions were polarized; the cold spots were clustered in the northwest, while the hot spots in the south and east. The spatial clustering patterns were dominated by high-high (HH) and low-low (LL) clusters. Abnormal patterns existed mainly in the transition areas between HH and LL clusters and insignificant regions, which were jointly affected by human activities and climate change. iii) Precipitation was the dominant climatic factor (86%) affecting the NPP variation in the LP, with the annual minimum precipitation showing a significantly positive relationship with the interannual variability in NPP, while the maximum precipitations greatly influenced the variation in local spatial anomaly patterns. This suggests that climatic extremes affect vegetation. Our study helps to facilitate green ecological management and high-quality development in the LP.

AB  - Emergency care system (ECS) performance is a proxy indicator of emergency care (EC) response and health systems resilience. The Emergency Care and System Assessment tool (ECSA) provides a structure for measuring emergency department (ED) systemic performance, using high quality ECS metrics. These metrics aligned with WHO targeted priority action areas facilitate synergies in supporting ECS evaluation at the micro level.Retrospective file reviews and anecdotal evidence from a low resource tertiary health facility between 1st January 2020 - 31st May 2021 showed that: - the governance structure had administrative and financial autonomy from the public healthcare system, healthcare financing was mostly out of pocket (OPP) and the human resource ecosystem was structured in operations, enforcement and training to drive EC quality improvement. More than two thirds of the patients were high acuity but only 2% of the patients died. Most sentinel ED functions were available at the facility however the facility does not have a developed prehospital care, neurosurgical nor a burns unit. Micro ECS framework derived from ECSA objectively interrogates performance of the healthcare system that supports EC in a tertiary facility.

TI  - Evaluating the relationship between groundwater quality and land use in an urbanized watershed
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality is critical. Effective water management requires understanding the relationship between land use and water quality. The study's goals were to compare the effects of land use, identify the types of land that impact hydrochemistry, and define how different land use affects water quality. For this purpose, the comparative relationship between groundwater quality, land use classes and landscape metrics were established for the years 2016 and 2021. Water samples were collected from 42 wells, and different hydro-chemical variables were considered to calculate the water quality index (WQI). The WQI value in 2016 ranged from 26.49 to 151.03 and 29.65 to 155.62 in 2021. The results indicate that the water quality in most parts of the study area is moderate for drinking and domestic purpose use. The google earth engine platform was used and radiometrically corrected and orthorectified Sentinel-2 satellite images were processed to classify land use classes for selected years. Five buffer zones were established within a 2-km watershed along each well site, and the effects of land use types and landscape metrics on water quality in the buffer zones were analyzed. Results revealed that the effects of land use types on water quality were mainly reflected in buffer 1 (B1), buffer 4 (B4), buffer 5 (B5) in 2016 and B1, buffer 3 (B3), and B5 in 2021. The impacts of landscape-level metrics on water quality are mainly reflected in buffer 2 (B2) and B3 in 2021, while at the class-level, they are mainly reflected in B1 and B4 in 2021. The redundancy analysis revealed that different hydro-chemical variables behaved differently with the land use classes and landscape metrics in the various buffer zones.

T2  - NATURE REVIEWS IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Here, Schenkel and Pauken consider how specific patterns of T cell trafficking and localization in tissue microenvironments shape their immune functions in acute infection and cancer settings. They further consider the relevance of this for the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade therapy in the clinic.Tissue localization is a critical determinant of T cell immunity. CD8(+) T cells are contact-dependent killers, which requires them to physically be within the tissue of interest to kill peptide-MHC class I-bearing target cells. Following their migration and extravasation into tissues, T cells receive many extrinsic cues from the local microenvironment, and these signals shape T cell differentiation, fate and function. Because major organ systems are variable in their functions and compositions, they apply disparate pressures on T cells to adapt to the local microenvironment. Additional complexity arises in the context of malignant lesions (either primary or metastatic), and this has made understanding the factors that dictate T cell function and longevity in tumours challenging. Moreover, T cell differentiation state influences how cues from the microenvironment are interpreted by tissue-infiltrating T cells, highlighting the importance of T cell state in the context of tissue biology. Here, we review the intertwined nature of T cell differentiation state, location, survival and function, and explain how dysfunctional T cell populations can adopt features of tissue-resident memory T cells to persist in tumours. Finally, we discuss how these factors have shaped responses to cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Meta-analysis of a large bedload transport rate dataset
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of bedload transport, a type of coarse fluvial sediment motion, is challenging because of higherorder, complex, and time-variable environmental processes. Still, models for calculating bedload transport mostly rely on semi-empirical formulae derived from time-averaged laboratory flume or field measurements and involve cross-section averaging of hydro-environmental parameters. Additionally, many models assume infinite, constant availability of sediment, which is unrealistic in natural environments. While most published models yield excellent results on the dataset they were trained on, they may be significantly inaccurate when applied to other cases. Also, more recent formulae relying on considerable amounts of data still lead to high calculation uncertainty. While the importance of short-term dynamics, for example, driven by turbulence, for bedload transport is well known, this study investigates the relevance of time-variable processes at monthly to seasonal scales. Our analysis of a large dataset and remote sensing data shows evidence for seasonal variability in measurements of bedload transport rates and challenges the validity of Gaussian statistics for interpolating bedload transport models. Measured bedload transport rates were smaller when snowmelt was taking place and when no glacier was present in the catchment, and were best represented by extreme value distributions. By controlling for biases from measurement devices, geomorphic patterns, and the presence of an upstream dam, we show that steady, constant at-a-station hydraulics only explain a limited share of the variance in the measurements. Ultimately, a model for estimating bedload transport rates should consider the temporal variability of processes across all scales, from turbulence to climate.

TI  - Analysis of Spatiotemporal Evolution Patterns and Driving Forces of Reservoirs on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Revealing the temporal and spatial evolution pattern of reservoirs and their driving mechanisms is of great significance for promoting the coordinated development of the national economy and natural ecology. In this study, the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains (NSTM) in Xinjiang was selected as the study area. Based on remote sensing data from 1990 to 2020, the temporal and spatial evolution characteristics of reservoirs on the NSTM in the past 30 years were analyzed using the grid cells method and the nuclear density analysis method, and the mechanisms by which natural geographical conditions and socio-economic development influence the temporal and spatial evolution of reservoirs in the NSTM were analyzed using GeoDetector. The results indicate the following: (1) In terms of temporal change, the area of reservoirs in the NSTM showed an overall expansion trend from 1990 to 2020, with a growth rate of 42.77%, and the number of reservoirs increased from 123 to 238 during the same period, with a growth rate of 93.50%. (2) In terms of spatial change, the distribution of reservoir accumulation areas on the NSTM gradually developed horizontally from the middle section with rapid economic development to the western and eastern sections. (3) The GeoDetector results showed that the main driving factors affecting the spatial differentiation of reservoir area in the NSTM from 1990 to 2020 were the average elevation (0.201), cultivated land area (0.112), and GDP (0.070), while the main driving factors combinations were the average elevation and cultivated land area (0.374), the average elevation and GDP (0.325), and the average elevation and average population (0.319). The research results can provide a theoretical basis and a decision-making reference for water conservancy project planning and water resources management in the NSTM.

TI  - Quantifying the independent contributions of climate and land use change to ecosystem services
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem services (ESs) are critical to human welfare and play an important role in supporting sustainable social and economic development. Climate change (CLC) and land use change (LUCC) are two of the most important factors influencing ESs. However, few studies have tried to distinguish the independent contributions of CLC and LUCC to ESs. Using meteorological, soil, land use, and remote sensing data for Liaoning Province (China) from 2000 to 2020, the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model and Carnegie-Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model were used to construct scenario simulation frameworks based on three hy-pothetical scenarios: 1) CLC effect only; 2) LUCC effect only; 3) a combined effect of CLC and LULC. The three scenario simulation frameworks were then used to determine the independent contributions of CLC and LUCC to net primary productivity (NPP), water yield (WY), soil retention (SR), and their temporal dynamics. Results showed that under the combined effect of CLC and LULC, NPP, WY and SR in Liaoning Province exhibited a trend of gradual increase from 2000 to 2020, increasing by 124.62 gC/m2, 30.64 mm/a and 0.63 t/km2, respectively. Under the CLC only scenario, WY and SR changed by 6.24% and 2%, respectively, exhibiting a more significant effect than under the LUCC only scenario. In contrast, NPP changed by 25.71% under the LUCC only scenario, which was more significant than under the CLC only scenario. Overall, CLC was found to be the dominant factor affecting changes in WY and SR in Liaoning Province, with independent contribution rates of 81.79%-84.02% and 73.57%-85.44%, respectively, whereas LUCC was the dominant factor affecting changes in NPP with an independent contribution rate of 86.12%-92.50%. Decreased precipitation levels and an increase in temperature were the two primary factors driving fluctuations in the independent contributions of CLC to WY and SR, while large-scale forest land area damage and rapid urbanization were the two primary factors driving fluctuations in the independent contribution of LUCC to NPP. The results of this study identify the specific effects of different climatic conditions on ESs and highlight the conflict between urbanization and ecosystem service provision, providing a theoretical foundation for improving and increasing ESs and regional sustainable development in Liaoning Province.

TI  - Automatically identifying the vegetation destruction and restoration of various open-pit mines utilizing remotely sensed images: Auto-VDR
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatio-temporal pattern of vegetation disturbance by open-pit mining activities such as the disturbance area and magnitude are important for coordinated development of surface mining and environmental protection. This paper proposes an automatic method (Auto-VDR) for identifying vegetation destruction and restoration of various open-pit mines. The proposed method consists of three steps: construction of the sample dataset, identification of disturbance types, and extraction of disturbance time and magnitude. First, a sample dataset with three types was constructed according to the interannual trends of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in mining areas: "Restoration after destruction (RAD)", "Destruction without restoration (DWR)" and "No destruction (ND)". Second, in order to accommodate to various open-pit mines with different background conditions (original vegetation cover prior to mining, loss rate and magnitude of vegetation due to mining, etc.), the "Shape-based distance" was used to match the NDVI curves of each pixel to the three disturbance types. Third, the disturbance time and magnitude in the destroyed regions were extracted based on the vegetated/bare ground threshold (& alpha;). The Shendong coal base in China was selected as the study area consisting of 133 open-pit coal mines. Annual NDVI was generated using Landsat time-series data. The maps of vegetation destruction and restoration caused by surface mining during 1990-2021 were drawn with accuracies of 0.82 and 0.87, respectively. The identification accuracy of the Auto-VDR is higher than Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) and Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC). The results show that from 1990 to 2021, a total of 400.08 km2 of vegetation has been destroyed, accounting for 35.93% of the study area. Furthermore, restoration activities mainly began in 2010, lagging mining activities by approximately three years. The accumulated area of restoration was 177.91 km2 and accounts for 15.98% of the study area. The vegetation destruction at the Shendong coal base has gone through four stages, with 2008, 2015 and 2018 as splits, corresponding to the developing stage of the China coal industry. In particular, the area of vegetation destruction per year reached the maximum of 61.16 km2 in 2008, which was 1.38 times the total area mined over the past 17 years. There were 14% of the 133 open-pit mines in Shendong coal base with a restoration rate of 0.8 and 59% of the mines with a restoration rate of 0.5. This method has been demonstrated to be able to extract vegetation destruction and restoration processes accurately and rapidly for various open-pit mines at a scale of coal base, which provides an important reference for supervising the impact of mining on the environment and assessing the effectiveness of ecological restoration.

TI  - Validation of Himawari-8 Sea Surface Temperature Retrievals Using Infrared SST Autonomous Radiometer Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study has evaluated five years (2016-2020) of Himawari-8 (H8) Sea Surface Temperature (SST) Level 2 Pre-processed (L2P) data produced by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (Bureau) against shipborne radiometer SST measurements obtained from the Infrared SST Autonomous Radiometer (ISAR) onboard research vessel RV Investigator. Before being used, all data sets employed in this study have gone through careful quality control, and only the most trustworthy measurements are retained. With a large matchup database (31,871 collocations in total, including 16,418 during daytime and 15,453 during night-time), it is found that the Bureau H8 SST product is of good quality, with a mean bias +/- standard deviation (SD) of 0.12 degrees C +/- 0.47 degrees C for the daytime and 0.04 degrees C +/- 0.37 degrees C for the night-time. The performance of the H8 data under different environmental conditions, determined by the observations obtained concurrently from RV Investigator, is examined. Daytime and night-time satellite data behave slightly differently. During the daytime, a cold bias can be seen under almost all environmental conditions, including for most values of wind speed, SST, and relative humidity. On the other hand, the performance of the night-time H8 SST product is consistently more stable under most meteorological conditions with the mean bias usually close to zero.

TI  - Comparison of Three Active Microwave Models of Forest Growing Stock Volume Based on the Idea of the Water Cloud Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stock volume (GSV) is an essential aspect of ecological carbon stock monitoring. The successive launches of spaceborne microwave satellites have provided a broader way to use microwave remote sensing to monitor forest accumulation. Currently, the inversion parameterization models of active microwave remote sensing stock volume mainly include the interferometric water cloud (IWCM), BIOMASAR, and Siberia. Among them, the IWCM introduces backscattering and coherence, the BIOMASAR model only introduces backscattering, and the Siberia model only introduces coherence. Although these three models combine the backscatter coefficient and coherence of SAR to estimate volume accumulation, the performance of the models has not been evaluated at the same time in the same area. Therefore, this article starts from the perspective of the three combinations of coherence and backscattering, relies on three models that do not require measured data, and evaluates the accuracy of the models' overall inversion of GSV. In addition, we combine precipitation meteorological information, vegetation types, and seasonal variation to separately explore model performance. The comparison results show that the IWCM model is relatively stable in the process of stock volume inversion and is more sensitive to the vegetation types of coniferous and deciduous forests. The influence of seasons and precipitation on the model is weak, and the accuracy of the multi-time-series model is slightly improved. The Siberia model has a good storage volume inversion effect in this study area, but the multiple time series did not improve the model accuracy. The BIOMASAR model is simple, and its performance was slightly inferior in this study area. Precipitation can negatively affect BIOMASAR. The model results for multiple time series outperform those for single time. In summary, the stability of IWCM is more suitable for research with unknown information. The BIOMASAR model is simple, does not require coherence calculations, and is ideal for the estimation of large-scale national or world-level storage distributions. The Siberian model performs better in small regions and smaller spatiotemporal baselines.

TI  - Measuring polycentric urban development with multi-temporal Sentinel-1 SAR imagery: A case study in Shanghai, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies on polycentric urban development (PUD) have been done by using LandScan and point of interest data. So far, the quality of PUD products has been limited by the spatio-temporal resolution of these datasets. Using Sentinel-1 SAR missions with a 10 m pixel spacing and a weekly repeat cycle, this study, for the first time, explores the potential of using a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR images for measuring urban polycentricity. In particular, we develop a variance-based filtering method to mitigate speckle noise. We propose the Kittler and Illingworth with a Modified Model (KI-MM) method to accurately identify PUD-related changes. We focus on the mean distance of new-born patches and the mean patch area for a PUD-related change analysis. These allow us to associate SAR tailor-made output with PUDs. The proposed methods were implemented on Google Earth Engine platform using 304 Sentinel-1 SAR images on the city of Shanghai, China, acquired between 2015 and 2018. We have tested 80 distribution models and found that the Laplace distribution is the best model for the KI-MM method. Our results show 2526, 2409, 4232 new-born patches for 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018, with areas equal to 18, 20, 36 km2, respectively. Using cross-validation with Sentinel-2 (optical) reference, we found that the matching rates and F1-score between detected changes and reference for the years 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018 were equal to 89.79% and 91.67%, 100% and 100%, 88.64% and 94.06%, respectively. We conclude that Sentinel-1 SAR images are suited to PUD applications at an intra-city scale with a high spatio-temporal resolution.

TI  - Association of sociodemographic characteristics with utilization of sentinel lymph node biopsy for American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition T1b cutaneous melanoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an important staging and prognostic tool for cutaneous melanoma (CM). However, there exists a knowledge gap regarding whether sociodemographic characteristics are associated with receipt of SLNB for T1b CMs, for which there are no definitive recommendations for SLNB per current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. We performed a retrospective analysis of the 2012-2018 National Cancer Database, identifying patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer staging manual 8th edition stage T1b CM, and used multivariable logistic regression to analyze associations between sociodemographic characteristics and receipt of SLNB. Among 40,458 patients with T1b CM, 23,813 (58.9%) received SLNB. Median age was 62 years, and most patients were male (57%) and non-Hispanic White (95%). In multivariable analyses, patients of Hispanic (aOR 0.67, 95%CI 0.48-0.94) and other (aOR 0.78, 95%CI 0.63-0.97) race/ethnicity, and patients aged > 75 (aOR 0.33, 95%CI 0.29-0.38), were less likely to receive SLNB. Conversely, patients in the highest of seven socioeconomic status levels (aOR 1.37, 95%CI 1.13-1.65) and those treated at higher-volume facilities (aOR 1.29, 95%CI 1.14-1.46) were more likely to receive SLNB. Understanding the underlying drivers of these associations may yield important insights for the management of patients with melanoma.

TI  - Intestinal tuft cells: Sentinels, what else?
T2  - SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The intestinal epithelium plays crucial roles in maintaining gut homeostasis. A key function consists in constituting a physical and chemical barrier between self and non-self-compartments, and, based on its crosstalk with the luminal environment, in controlling activation of the host immune system. Tuft cells are a unique epithelial cell lineage, the function of which remained a mystery even 50 years after their initial discovery. The first function of intestinal tuft cells was recently described, with a central role in initiating type 2 immune responses following infection with helminth parasites. Since then, tuft cells have emerged as sentinel cells recognizing a variety of luminal cues, mediating the host-microorganisms crosstalk with additional pathogens, including viruses and bacteria. Although it can be anticipated that more functions will be discovered for tuft cells in the future, recent discoveries already propelled them at the forefront of gut mucosal homeostasis regulation, with important potential impact in gut physiopathology. This review focuses on intestinal tuft cells, from their initial description to the current understanding of their functions, and their potential impact in diseases.

TI  - Spatial Validation of Spectral Unmixing Results: A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The pixels of remote images often contain more than one distinct material (mixed pixels), and so their spectra are characterized by a mixture of spectral signals. Since 1971, a shared effort has enabled the development of techniques for retrieving information from mixed pixels. The most analyzed, implemented, and employed procedure is spectral unmixing. Among the extensive literature on the spectral unmixing, nineteen reviews were identified, and each highlighted the many shortcomings of spatial validation. Although an overview of the approaches used to spatially validate could be very helpful in overcoming its shortcomings, a review of them was never provided. Therefore, this systematic review provides an updated overview of the approaches used, analyzing the papers that were published in 2022, 2021, and 2020, and a dated overview, analyzing the papers that were published not only in 2011 and 2010, but also in 1996 and 1995. The key criterion is that the results of the spectral unmixing were spatially validated. The Web of Science and Scopus databases were searched, using all the names that were assigned to spectral unmixing as keywords. A total of 454 eligible papers were included in this systematic review. Their analysis revealed that six key issues in spatial validation were considered and differently addressed: the number of validated endmembers; sample sizes and sampling designs of the reference data; sources of the reference data; the creation of reference fractional abundance maps; the validation of the reference data with other reference data; the minimization and evaluation of the errors in co-localization and spatial resampling. Since addressing these key issues enabled the authors to overcome some of the shortcomings of spatial validation, it is recommended that all these key issues be addressed together. However, few authors addressed all the key issues together, and many authors did not specify the spatial validation approach used or did not adequately explain the methods employed.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations in soil loss across the biodiversity hotspots of Western Ghats Region, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the soil loss in the Western Ghats Region (WGR) is challenging due to limited long-term observation data and accessibility issues, as well as the WGR spanning multiple administrative units. This study aimed to estimate long-term spatiotemporal variations in soil loss rates across the WGR. Using remote sensing inputs, such as LANDSAT-8, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and rainfall records to estimate soil loss rates using the USLE method from 1990 to 2020. Results indicated that the average soil loss for the WGR was 32.3, 46.2, 50.2, and 62.7 Tons ha(-1) yr(-1) for 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020, respectively, showing a concerning 94% increase, and an consistently increasing trend. The state-wise increase is highest in Tamil Nadu (121%), followed by Gujarat (119%), Maharashtra (96%), Kerala (90%), Goa (80%), and Karnataka (56%). These high rates of increase in soil loss are unsustainable to support the biodiversity of WGR and can lead to permanent destruction. The study highlights the importance of considering the long-term effects of land use change on soil erosion and the need for sustainable land management practices, and benefits of using open source satellite products for monitoring. The results can be used to sensitise government agencies on the need to protect the natural land cover, which will reduce soil erosion. The need for conservation and preservation of the WGR is of paramount importance, and steps must be taken to ensure that the natural land cover is protected and soil erosion is reduced.

TI  - Spectral separability of bark beetle infestation stages: A single-tree time-series analysis using Planet imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bark beetles cause severe damage to European forests leading to impacts on many sectors, from the environmental to the economical. Timely mapping of the different stages of an attack is very important. Remote sensing has been widely used to map bark beetle damage using both airborne and satellite data. Newly available satellite multispectral data with a daily revisit time and high spatial resolution has the potential to monitor an attack in all its phases. This study explores the spectral separability of bark beetle infestation stages using the Planet imagery at individual tree level. Multi-temporal spectral analysis of 78 trees in different stages of a spruce bark beetle attack was carried out. Bands and vegetation indexes derived from 42 multispectral images were compared to eleven field surveys over a time span of approximately four months. The spectral separability analysis was done considering three criteria exploring: 1) the significance of the differences, 2) the magnitude of the differences and 3) the separability in a supervised classification context. The field surveys reported different effects depending on the season of the bark beetle attack - spring vs. summer. Spectral bands and indexes extracted from trees in the healthy and red-stage were significantly different. Trees in the green-attack stage at the end of the summer showed a statistically significant difference from healthy trees. The separability measured with a supervised classifier showed that it is possible to separate healthy, green-attack and red-stage trees with high accuracy values (kappa accuracy above 0.9).

TI  - What incentives encourage local communities to collect and upload mosquito sound data by using smartphones? A mixed methods study in Tanzania
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundTo detect and identify mosquitoes using their characteristic high-pitched sound, we have developed a smartphone application, known as the 'HumBug sensor', that records the acoustic signature of this sound, along with the time and location. This data is then sent remotely to a server where algorithms identify the species according to their distinctive acoustic signature. Whilst this system works well, a key question that remains is what mechanisms will lead to effective uptake and use of this mosquito survey tool? We addressed this question by working with local communities in rural Tanzania and providing three alternative incentives: money only, short message service (SMS) reminders and money, and SMS reminders only. We also had a control group with no incentive.MethodsA multi-site, quantitative empirical study was conducted in four villages in Tanzania from April to August 2021. Consenting participants (n = 148) were recruited and placed into one of the three intervention arms: monetary incentives only; SMS reminders with monetary incentives; and SMS reminders only. There was also a control group (no intervention). To test effectiveness of the mechanisms, the number of audio uploads to the server of the four trial groups on their specific dates were compared. Qualitative focus group discussions and feedback surveys were also conducted to explore participants' perspectives on their participation in the study and to capture their experiences of using the HumBug sensor.ResultsQualitative data analysis revealed that for many participants (37 out of 81), the main motivation expressed was to learn more about the types of mosquitoes present in their houses. Results from the quantitative empirical study indicate that the participants in the 'control' group switched on their HumBug sensors more over the 14-week period (8 out of 14 weeks) when compared to those belonging to the 'SMS reminders and monetary incentives' trial group. These findings are statistically significant (p < 0.05 or p > 0.95 under a two-sided z-test), revealing that the provision of monetary incentives and sending SMS reminders did not appear to encourage greater number of audio uploads when compared to the control.ConclusionsKnowledge on the presence of harmful mosquitoes was the strongest motive for local communities to collect and upload mosquito sound data via the HumBug sensor in rural Tanzania. This finding suggests that most efforts should be made to improve flow of real-time information back to the communities on types and risks associated with mosquitoes present in their houses.

TI  - A Novel Remote Sensing Image Enhancement Method, the Pseudo-Tasseled Cap Transformation: Taking Buildings and Roads in GF-2 as an Example
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - With the improvements in sensor accuracy, the spectral features of high-resolution remote sensing images become more complex. As a result, the classification accuracy for land cover classification decreases. Remote sensing image enhancements can improve the visual effect and the intra-class consistency and enhance the characteristics of ground objects. These enhancements are important for both image interpretation and improving image segmentation accuracy. In this study, we propose a pseudo-tasseled cap transformation (pseudo-TCT) through an orthogonal linear transformation of Gaofen-2 (GF-2) images using the untransposed tasseled cap transformation (TCT) coefficients, and further, enhance the visual effect and the separability among ground objects by linear stretching and percentage truncation stretching. To examine the separability among ground objects in the pseudo-TCT image, we used K-Means clustering, ISODATA clustering and 3D visualization of the spectral features of typical ground objects. The results show that the separability of buildings and roads from background objects is better than in the original image and the TCT image, and typical ground objects are effectively distinguished. Additionally, we visualized intra-class consistency by calculating the mean Euclidean distance between the pixel values of each point and the pixel values of its eight neighboring points and calculated the standard deviation of the intra-class consistency images. The results indicate that the secondary textures of the objects were weakened, and edges were made clearer, enhancing intra-class consistency. The pseudo-TCT is effective, at least in our work, and could be a candidate for image enhancement under certain applications.

TI  - The Precursory 3D Displacement Patterns and Their Implicit Collapse Mechanism of the Ice-Rock Avalanche Events Occurred in Sedongpu Basin Revealed by Optical and SAR Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the kinematic evolution patterns of mountain glaciers near Yarlung Tsanpo River performs a major role in evaluating the glacial instability and the secondary disasters. For the Sedongpu Basin near the Yarlung Tsanpo River Valley, the dramatic geomorphic landscape variations triggered by the ice-rock avalanche events were visually identified as the dominant texture deficiencies in time-series optical images. To improve the image correlation quality broken by these image texture deficiencies, the Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 optical images were divided into different groups, then a stepwise combination strategy was innovatively proposed to derive the glacier time-series displacement velocities in different temporal stages. The standard deviations (STD) of the optical measurements in the stable area maintained around 0.04 m/yr for the normalized displacement velocity and maintained from 0.6 to 1.7 m for the cumulative displacement time series. The obvious variations in glacier displacement velocity were identified before each collapse event. Subsequently, the offset-tracking procedures were performed on 7 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to acquire the range and azimuth displacement velocities. To better reveal the dynamic mechanism of the glacier activity, the three-dimensional (3D) glacial displacement velocity was also derived by using optical and SAR results. The precipitation, temperature, and seismic activities were assumed as the main triggering factors of controlling the glacial dynamic mechanism and final collapse events. Additionally, the dynamic mechanism of the active glaciers in Sedongpu Basin conformed to a power law, which was limited by the changes of the internal stress friction force on the sliding base surface. The aim of this study is to shed a light on interpreting the precursory displacement patterns and their implicit failure mechanism of these ice-rock avalanche events with the conventional freely optical and SAR observations.

TI  - Texture Features Derived from Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices for Estimating and Mapping Forest Growing Stock Volume
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest growing stock volume (GSV, m(3)/ha) is an indispensable variable for forest resources supervision. Precise measurement of GSV is conducive to monitoring forest dynamics. Nevertheless, little research has explored the pattern pixel values and the function of texture features derived from a vegetation index (VI) for GSV prediction. In this study, we investigated combining linear regression or Random Forest with Sentinel-2 spectral predictors and image textures derived from spectral bands and vegetation indices, which were based on standard deviation values or mean values at the plot level, for predicting GSV of Masson pine, theropencedrymion and all the survey plots in Anji County, China. Specifically, ten groups of experiments encompassing combinations of spectral parameters and texture measures were established for detecting the potential of image textures based on two different image pixel statistics. The results showed that texture measures derived from VI were superior to spectral parameters or texture measures derived from spectral bands for estimating the GSV of single tree species. Moreover, texture features based on shortwave infrared bands or their related VI and the standard deviation at pixel level for spectral bands/indices were emphasized. Finally, the mean value at the plot level exhibited slightly stronger potential than the standard deviation in general.

TI  - Possible Zones of Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD) and Seawater Intrusion (SWI) along the West Coast of Kanyakumari, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The possible zones of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) and seawater intrusion (SWI) along the west coast of Kanyakumari in the southernmost Indian Peninsula were identified by integrating the surface temperature anomaly, water table fluctuation, and water quality analysis. Temperature map of the sea surface from Landsat 8 satellite data, which helped to demarcate SGD in areas with significant thermal contrast, exists between the seawater and discharging groundwater. Monitoring data of 2019-2021 illustrated patchy, diffuse, and temporally variable groundwater seepage. The spatial distribution map created from groundwater level, and water quality parameters depicted high SGD in areas of high groundwater level and high chances of SWI in regions with low groundwater level. This study identified that the areas with low groundwater level, high EC, and high chloride contents are prone to SWI. Similarly, the regions with high thermal contrast, high groundwater level, and low EC have more SGD. These methods have the potential to be used as preliminary screening tools before implementing detailed studies about the mixing process.

TI  - Physiological and biochemical responses to caffeine and microplastics in Mytilus galloprovincialis
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Caffeine (Caff) is one of the most widely used substances in the human diet and a well-recognized drug. Its input into surface waters is remarkable, but biological effects on aquatic organisms are unclear, particularly in combination with pollutants of suspected modulatory activity, like microplastics (MP). The aim of this study was to reveal the impact on the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lamark, 1819) of Caff (20.0 & mu;g L-1) in the environmentally relevant com-bination (Mix) with MP 1 mg L-1 (size 35-50 & mu;m) after the exposure for 14 days. Untreated and exposed to Caff and MP separately groups were also examined. Cell viability and cell volume regulation in hemocytes and digestive cells, as well as the indexes of oxidative stress, glutathione (GSH/GSSG) and metallothioneins levels, and caspase-3 activity in digestive gland were assessed. MP and Mix reduced Mn-superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase activities and level of lipid peroxidation, but increased the digestive gland cell viability, GSH/GSSG ratio (by 1.4-1.5 -fold), metallothioneins level and their Zn content, while Caff did not affect oxidative stress indexes and metallothionein-related Zn chelation. Protein carbonyls were not targeted in all exposures. The distinguishing feature of the Caff group was the decline (2-fold) in caspase-3 activity and low cell viability. The multi-stress effect of Mix was shown by the worsening of the volume regulation of digestive cells and confirmed by discriminant analysis of biochem-ical indexes. The special capabilities of M. galloprovincialis as a sentinel organism make it an excellent bio-indicator reflecting the multi-stress effects in sub-chronic exposures to potentially harmful substances. The identification of the modulation of individual effects in combined exposure increases the need to base monitoring programs on studies of multi-stress effects in sub-chronic exposures.

TI  - Deep learning detection of melanoma metastases in lymph nodes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In melanoma patients, surgical excision of the first draining lymph node, the sentinel lymph node (SLN), is a routine procedure to evaluate lymphogenic metastases. Metastasis detection by histopathological analysis assesses multiple tissue levels with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically stained glass slides. Considering the amount of tissue to analyze, the detection of metastasis can be highly time-consuming for pathologists. The application of artificial intelligence in the clinical routine has constantly increased over the past few years. Methods: In this multi-center study, a deep learning method was established on histological tissue sections of sentinel lymph nodes collected from the clinical routine. The algorithm was trained to highlight potential melanoma metastases for further review by pathologists, without relying on supplementary immunohistochemical stainings (e.g. anti-S100, antiResults: The established method was able to detect the existence of metastasis on individual tissue cuts with an area under the curve of 0.9630 and 0.9856 respectively on two test cohorts from different laboratories. The method was able to accurately identify tumour deposits >0.1 mm and, by automatic tumour diameter measurement, classify these into 0.1 mm to -1.0 mm and > 1.0 mm groups, thus identifying and classifying metastasis currently relevant for assessing prognosis and stratifying treatment. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that AI-based SLN melanoma metastasis detection has great potential and could become a routinely applied aid for pathologists. Our current study focused on assessing established parameters; however, larger future AI-based studies could identify novel biomarkers potentially further improving SLN-based prognostic and therapeutic predictions for affected patients.

TI  - Analysing far-red SIF directional anisotropy of three structurally contrasting forest canopies towards improved GPP estimation
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is used to estimate terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) due to its physiological link to photosynthesis. However, strong angular variations in satellite-observed SIF (SIFobs), especially for forest canopies with a high structural heterogeneity, hampers robust estimation of GPP. Here, we use directional SIFobs datasets from OCO-2 and TROPOMI satellite sensors and the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer model to investigate the directional properties of far-red SIFobs and their relationships with two GPP products obtained from MODIS and FluxCom datasets for three European forest types with contrasting canopy structures, i.e., boreal, temperate and Mediterranean forests. We found bowl-like angular distribution patterns of SIFobs in both observed and simulated boreal and temperate forests, but no generic distribution pattern of SIFobs was found for the Mediterranean forest. In our GPP estimation of boreal forest, oblique SIFobs performed better than the widely used nadir SIFobs. However, we did not find an optimal view angle suitable for all three forest types. Further, the angular dependencies and forest structure impacts present in SIFobs were found to still propagate into the estimation of total emitted SIF (SIFtotal), which generally regarded as free of these confounding effects. Finally, our results demonstrate that two commonly used variables, i.e., SIFobs with a constant viewing angle and the approximated SIFtotal, both fail to produce a robust relationship with GPP for the Mediterranean forest. These findings highlight the importance of forest canopy structural heterogeneity, including forest floor, on interpretation of directional satellite SIF observations, even when corrected and expressed as a total canopy SIF emission.

TI  - A High Spatiotemporal Enhancement Method of Forest Vegetation Leaf Area Index Based on Landsat8 OLI and GF-1 WFV Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial parameter for analyzing terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycles and global climate change. Obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution forest stand vegetation LAI products over large areas is essential for an accurate understanding of forest ecosystems. This study takes the northwestern part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (the northern section of the Greater Khingan Mountains) in northern China as the research area. It also generates the LAI time series product of the 8-day and 30 m forest stand vegetation growth period from 2013 to 2017 (from the 121st to the 305th day of each year). The Simulated Annealing-Back Propagation Neural Network (SA-BPNN) model was used to estimate LAI from Landsat8 OLI, and the multi-period GaoFen-1 WideField-View satellite images (GF-1 WFV) and the spatiotemporal adaptive reflectance fusion mode (STARFM) was used to predict high spatiotemporal resolution LAI by combining inversion LAI and Global LAnd Surface Satellite-derived vegetation LAI (GLASS LAI) products. The results showed the following: (1) The SA-BPNN estimation model has relatively high accuracy, with R-2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 0.38 for the 2013 LAI estimation model, and R-2 = 0.74 and RMSE = 0.17 for the 2016 LAI estimation model. (2) The fused 30 m LAI product has a good correlation with the LAI verification of the measured sample site (R-2 = 0.8775) and a high similarity with the GLASS LAI product. (3) The fused 30 m LAI product has a high similarity with the GLASS LAI product, and compared with the GLASS LAI interannual trend line, it accords with the growth trend of plants in the seasons. This study provides a theoretical and technical reference for forest stand vegetation growth period LAI spatiotemporal fusion research based on high-score data, and has an important role in exploring vegetation primary productivity and carbon cycle changes in the future.

TI  - Transboundary Nile basin dynamics: Land use change, drivers, and hydrological impacts under socioeconomic pathways
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape transitions in the Nile River basin will likely accelerate over the next decades due to socioeconomic developments and climate change. However, the assessments of land use/land cover (LULC) changes and their impact on the water resources over the Nile basin lacked a transboundary perspective. Here we used coupled basin-scale geospatial-hydrological models to project future LULC changes in the Nile basin and its three trib-utaries (i.e., White Nile, Blue Nile, and Atbara River), explored their drivers and projected hydrological impacts under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) during 2020-2060. Compared to 1992-2019, significant increases in the forested area (>50 x 103 km2) are expected to occur in the upstream areas of the White Nile and the Blue Nile in South Sudan and Ethiopia, with larger increases projected under higher emission scenarios. Consequently, it will likely reduce the downstream seasonal river discharge for the White and Blue Nile by up to 8.4% (SSP5) and 8.9% (SSP2), respectively. An increase of 7.4% in the Blue Nile discharge is expected during the flood season if the current urbanization/deforestation rates would prevail in the future. Large decreases (>15 x 103 km2) of unused land are expected in the Atbara River sub-catchment with increases in natural vegetation socioeconomic-related LULC types, leading to a river flow decrease of 15% during the rainy season under the SSPs. The basin-scale LULC changes are projected to decrease the Main Nile flow to Egypt by 3.6% under SSPs and increase by 2.1% if the historical trends prevail. The results highlight a close association between landscape dynamics, socioeconomic growth, and climate change over the Nile basin and suggest adaptive LULC planning and conservation measures.

T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This review was carried out to understand the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD) datasets for estimating particle concentration and its influence on ambient air and surroundings by various models. Several studies have evaluated particle (PM10 and PM2.5) concentration profiles present in the lowest layers of the atmosphere by using AOD datasets. This study aimed at identifying consistent and precise particle estimation by various datasets retrieved by satellite-based models for the ground-level PM concentration. Extremities of satellite sensor data, like specific capabilities, as well as a few drawbacks are presented. Multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR), visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) datasets, mixed-effect model (MEM), and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models outperformed to estimate AOD and PM in comparison with the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and other datasets. The improvised algorithms with higher resolution in the upcoming research would provide an even better estimation for AOD and PM.

TI  - Does the Rational Function Model's Accuracy for GF1 and GF6 WFV Images Satisfy Practical Requirements?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-6 (GF-6) satellites have acquired many GF-1 and GF-6 wide-field-view (WFV) images. These images have been made available for free use globally. The GF-1 WFV (GF-1) and GF-6 WFV (GF-6) images have rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). In practical applications, RPC corrections of GF-1 and GF-6 images need to be completed using the rational function model (RFM). However, can the accuracy of the rational function model satisfy practical application requirements? To address this issue, a geometric accuracy method was proposed in this paper to evaluate the accuracy of the RFM of GF-1 and GF-6 images. First, RPC corrections were completed using the RFM and refined RFM, respectively. The RFM was constructed using the RPCs and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 90 m DEM. The RFM was refined via affine transformation based on control points (CPs), which resulted in a refined RFM. Then, an automatic matching method was proposed to complete the automatic matching of GF-1/GF-6 images and reference images, which enabled us to obtain many uniformly distributed CPs. Finally, these CPs were used to evaluate the geometric accuracy of the RFM and refined RFM. The 14th-layer Google images of the corresponding area were used as reference images. In the experiments, the advantages and disadvantages of BRIEF, SIFT, and the proposed method were first compared. Then, the values of the root mean square error (RSME) of 10,561 Chinese, French, and Brazilian GF-1 and GF-6 images were calculated and statistically analyzed, and the local geometric distortions of the GF-1 and GF-6 images were evaluated; these were used to evaluate the accuracy of the RFM. Last, the accuracy of the refined RFM was evaluated using the eight GF-1 and GF-6 images. The experimental results indicate that the accuracy of the RFM for most GF-1 and GF-6 images cannot meet the actual use requirement of being better than 1.0 pixel, the accuracy of the refined RFM for GF-1 images cannot meet practical requirement of being better than 1.0 pixel, and the accuracy of the refined RFM for most GF-6 images meets the practical requirement of being better than 1.0 pixel. However, the RMSE values that meet the requirements are between 0.9 and 1.0, and the geometric accuracy can be further improved.

TI  - Study on the influence of coal fire on the temporal and spatial distribution of CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> gas emissions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study the impact of gas released from coal fire combustion on the spatial-temporal distribution of CO2 and CH4 and other greenhouse gas emissions, the impact of regional coal fire on CO2 and CH4 emission flux was comprehensively evaluated using Landsat 8 and GOSAT satellite data in Xinjiang. In addition, typical fire areas are selected, a single-channel algorithm is used to invert the surface temperature of the coal field, the spatial distribution of the coal fire area is extracted by setting the threshold, and the influence law of CO2 and CH4 emissions in the typical fire area is accurately analyzed. The results show that during 2017-2018, CO2 and CH4 emissions in Xinjiang were generally dispersed and locally concentrated, while CO2-O and CH4-O were at low levels in most regions, fluctuating in the ranges of 0.01 similar to 0.14 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1) and 0.001 similar to 0.003 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1), respectively. However, the emission intensity of CO2-O and CH4-O in coal fire concentrated areas is higher, which are 1.6 similar to 3.8 g center dot m(-2) day(-1) and 0.013 similar to 0.026 g center dot m(-2)center dot day(-1), respectively. CO2-F and CH4-ag have similar laws. The fire area of Daquan Lake is scattered, and there are four areas with the surface temperature over 35 degrees C: A, B, C, and D, respectively. The Sandaoba fire area is more concentrated, and only two areas are E and F when the surface temperature exceeds 35 degrees C. CO2 and CH4 released by burning in Daquan Lake and Sandaoba fire areas increased CO2-F and CH4-ag by 2.08 and 0.89 times, respectively. The results provide a reference for coal fire control and carbon emission reduction.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Geocomputation and geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) have essential roles in advancing geographic information science (GIS) and Earth observation to a new stage. GeoAI has enhanced traditional geospatial analysis and mapping, altering the methods for understanding and managing complex human-natural systems. However, there are still challenges in various aspects of geospatial applications related to natural, built, and social environments, and in integrating unique geospatial features into GeoAI models. Meanwhile, geospatial and Earth data are critical components in geocomputation and GeoAI studies, as they can effectively reveal geospatial patterns, factors, relationships, and decision-making processes. This editorial provides a comprehensive overview of geocomputation and GeoAI applications in mapping, classifying them into four categories: (i) buildings and infrastructure, (ii) land use analysis, (iii) natural environment and hazards, and (iv) social issues and human activities. In addition, the editorial summarizes geospatial and Earth data in case studies into seven categories, including in-situ data, geospatial datasets, crowdsourced geospatial data (i.e., geospatial big data), remote sensing data, photogrammetry data, LiDAR, and statistical data. Finally, the editorial presents challenges and opportunities for future research.

TI  - Normalized Temperature Drought Index (NTDI) for Soil Moisture Monitoring Using MODIS and Landsat-8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the fundamental regulator of energy exchange in the vegetation-soil-atmosphere circulation system, soil moisture is a key parameter for drought monitoring and is indispensable to the land surface hydrological processes. In order to overcome the constraints of the Perpendicular Drought Index, PDI (performs poorly over the fields with dense vegetation and hard to construct the soil line), and the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index, TVDI (requires similar atmospheric forcing and large enough dimension of mapping area), in soil moisture monitoring, a new drought index (Normalized Temperature Drought Index, NTDI) is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal changes of soil moisture by substituting red and near-infrared reflectances with vegetation index and normalized land surface temperature on the basis of the PDI framework. Victoria, Australia, was selected as the study area as it experiences many severe droughts and has been affected for more than ten years. Time series of satellite-based data were applied to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the NTDI at the regional scale. Results indicated that the expression of the soil line representing the water condition of the bare soil is easier to obtain in the new trapezoid framework and has good fits with the coefficients of determination (R-2) of more than 0.8. Compared with PDI, TVDI and Modified PDI (MPDI) at the cropping sites, NTDI exhibits a relatively better performance in soil moisture monitoring for most days where the R-2 achieved can reach to more than 0.7 on DOY 242, 254 and 272. Meanwhile, spatial-temporal mappings of the four drought indices from satellite data were conducted, and the NTDI presented the slightly seasonal variation and effectively described the real spatial characteristics of regional drought. Overall, the NTDI seems to a viable approach and can provide insight into spatial and temporal soil moisture monitoring at different scales.

TI  - R-MFNet: Analysis of Urban Carbon Stock Change against the Background of Land-Use Change Based on a Residual Multi-Module Fusion Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional land-use change is the leading cause of ecosystem carbon stock change; it is essential to investigate the response of LUCC to carbon stock to achieve the strategic goal of "double carbon" in a region. This paper proposes a residual network algorithm, the Residual Multi-module Fusion Network (R-MFNet), to address the problems of blurred feature boundary information, low classification accuracy, and high noise, which are often encountered in traditional classification methods. The network algorithm uses an R-ASPP module to expand the receptive field of the feature map to extract sufficient and multi-scale target features; it uses the attention mechanism to assign weights to the multi-scale information of each channel and space. It can fully preserve the remote sensing image features extracted by the convolutional layer through the residual connection. Using this classification network method, the classification of three Landsat-TM/OLI images of Zhengzhou City (the capital of Henan Province) from 2001 to 2020 was realized (the years that the three images were taken are 2001, 2009, and 2020). Compared with SVM, 2D-CNN, and deep residual networks (ResNet), the overall accuracy of the test dataset is increased by 10.07%, 3.96%, and 1.33%, respectively. The classification achieved using this method is closer to the real land surface, and its accuracy is higher than that of the finished product data obtained using the traditional classification method, providing high-precision land-use classification data for the subsequent carbon storage estimation research. Based on the land-use classification data and the carbon density data corrected by meteorological data (temperature and precipitation data), the InVEST model is used to analyze the land-use change and its impact on carbon storage in the region. The results showed that, from 2001 to 2020, the carbon stock in the study area showed a downward trend, with a total decrease of 1.48 x 107 t. Over the course of this 19-year period, the farmland area in Zhengzhou decreased by 1101.72 km2, and the built land area increased sharply by 936.16 km2. The area of land transfer accounted for 29.26% of the total area of Zhengzhou City from 2001 to 2009, and 31.20% from 2009 to 2020. The conversion of farmland to built land is the primary type of land transfer and the most important reason for decreasing carbon stock. The research results can provide support, in the form of scientific data, for land-use management decisions and carbon storage function protections in Zhengzhou and other cities around the world undergoing rapid urbanization.

TI  - Denoising and Accuracy Evaluation of ICESat-2/ATLAS Photon Data for Nearshore Waters Based on Improved Local Distance Statistics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The second-generation spaceborne LiDAR-Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) carries the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS), which can penetrate a certain depth of water, and is one of the important means to obtain the water depth information of nearshore water. However, due to the influence of the atmospheric environment, water quality and color, the system itself and other factors, the photon point cloud introduces survey noise, which restricts the survey accuracy and reliability of nearshore water depth. Therefore, in this study, we presented a photon denoising algorithm for layered processing of submarine surface. Firstly, rough denoising of the original photon data was completed by smoothing filtering. Then, elevation histogram statistics were carried out on the photon data, two peaks of the histogram were fitted by a double Gaussian function, and the intersection of two curves was then taken to separate the water surface and underwater photons. The surface photons were denoised by the DBSCAN clustering algorithm. Then according to the distribution characteristics of underwater signal photons, a single-photon point cloud filtering bathymetric method was proposed based on improved local distance statistics (LDSBM), which was used for fine denoising of underwater point cloud data. Finally, the Gaussian function was used to fit the frequency histogram, and the signal photons were screened to extract the water depth information. In this study, 13 groups of the ATL03 dataset from the Xisha Islands, the St. Thomas and the Acklins Island were used for denoising. The denoising results were compared with the signal photons manually marked and the signal photons extracted by the official built-in method (OM). The experimental results showed that, compared with the official method results of ATL03, the LDSBM had a higher F value (comprehensive evaluation index), with an average of more than 96.70%. In conclusion, the proposed underwater single-photon point cloud filtering bathymetric method was superior to the traditional algorithm and could recover terrain information accurately.

TI  - Discovery of new tetrahydroisoquinolines as potent and selective LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of MLL-rearranged leukemia
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a promising target for cancer therapy. Here, we performed the design, synthesis, and extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies based on our previously discovered natural LSD1 inhibitor, higenamine. We found that the tetracyclic tetrahydroisoquinoline FY-21 is a potent and selective inhibitor of LSD1 (IC50 = 340 nM). FY-21 inhibited leukemia cell proliferation and colony formation and increased the level of p53 expression. Meanwhile, FY-21 reduced the mRNA levels of the transcription factors HOXA9 and MEIS1. Furthermore, FY-21 significantly induced leukemia cell differentiation. In vivo studies showed that FY-21 prolonged the survival rate of leukemia mice. Collectively, FY-21 is a potent, selective LSD1 inhibitor and can serve as a lead compound for the development of novel and highly effective LSD1 inhibitors for AML treatment.

TI  - Forest Vertical Structure Mapping Using Multi-Seasonal UAV Images and Lidar Data via Modified U-Net Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the acceleration of global warming, research on forests has become important. Vertical forest structure is an indicator of forest vitality and diversity. Therefore, further studies are essential. The investigation of forest structures has traditionally been conducted through in situ surveys, which require substantial time and money. To overcome these drawbacks, in our previous study, vertical forest structure was mapped through machine learning techniques and multi-seasonal remote sensing data, and the classification performance was improved to a 0.92 F1-score. However, the use of multi-seasonal images includes tree location errors owing to changes in the timing and location of acquisition between images. This error can be reduced by using a modified U-Net model that generates a low-resolution output map from high-resolution input data. Therefore, we mapped vertical forest structures from a multi-seasonal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) optic and LiDAR data using three modified U-Net models to improve mapping performance. Spectral index maps related to forests were calculated as optic images, and canopy height maps were produced using the LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DTM). Spectral index maps and filtered canopy height maps were then used as input data and applied to the following three models: (1) a model that modified only the structure of the decoder, (2) a model that modified both the structure of the encoder and decoder, and (3) a model that modified the encoder, decoder, and the part that concatenated the encoder and decoder. Model 1 had the best performance with an F1-score of 0.97. The F1-score value was higher than 0.9 for both Model 2 and Model 3. Model 1 improved the performance by 5%, compared to our previous research. This implies that the model performance is enhanced by reducing the influence of position error.

TI  - Revealing the Driving Mechanisms of Land Surface Temperature Spatial Heterogeneity and Its Sensitive Regions in China Based on GeoDetector
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) has a critical impact on the energy balance of land surface processes and ecosystem stability. Meanwhile, LST is controlled by multiple factors at the surface, resulting in heterogeneity of its spatial distribution. To understand the drivers of LST spatial heterogeneity and their contributions, the effects of air temperature, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil moisture, net surface radiation, precipitation, aerosol optical depth (AOD), evapotranspiration, water vapor, digital elevation model (DEM), climate type, and land cover type on LST spatial heterogeneity was analyzed in this study with GeoDetector. The results showed that the explanatory ability of air temperature to impact the spatial heterogeneity of LST was the largest in each year with a mean value of 0.74, followed by water vapor with a mean value of 0.7, and the driving effect of the factors on LST showed an increasing trend year by year. However, the land cover type did not have an effect on the spatial heterogeneity of LST for the univariate analysis in this study. In addition, the interaction analysis indicated that the spatial distribution of LST was jointly driven by all the driving factors. Among them, air temperature had the strongest interaction with other factors, with the strength of the effect in the range of 0.73-0.8. In terms of the highly sensitive area of LST for each driver, AOD has the largest driving area, accounting for 15.8% of the total area, followed by WV, TA, and ET at about 11%, and the remaining variables are less than 10%. During the study period, the area of the highly sensitive region of LST for each factor showed an overall decreasing trend, indicating that the influence of the driving factors on LST will be stronger and more concentrated. Generally, this study provides meaningful understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of LST since 2003 and provides a scientific reference for coping with climate change, analyzing surface environmental patterns, and protecting ecological environment.

TI  - Detection of the Spatial Variability of Soil Salinity East of the Bitter Lake of the Suez Canal, Egypt, as a Basis for Management Zones Using Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imagery
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the more serious problems that cause soil degradation, particularly in semi-arid and arid regions. In agricultural lands, it threatens plant growth and productivity, which requires specific management decisions for various inputs, such as fertilizers. Accurate prediction and mapping of soil salinity have become possible through remote sensing techniques. The focus of this research is to derive soil salinity from spectral indices measured from different bands of sentinel-2 satellite in order to delineate management zones (MZs). Four spectral salinity indices were used for the purpose of this study, using blue, green, red, and NIR bands in different combinations. Exponential regression best describes the relationship between salinity indices and soil electrical conductivity (EC) through ground truthing. The results indicate that salinity indices 2 (BluexRed/reen) and 4 (Green+Red/2) (SI2 and SI4) outperformed the other indices and could describe 70% and 71% of the variability in soil EC with prediction models of: SoilEC = 0:319e(0:0007xSI2) and SoilEC = 0:3418e(0:0006xSI4), respectively. The generated models were validated by normalized root mean square error and the d coefficient of agreement. The results of the best-fit models were 16.5% and 0.86 for SI2 and 16.7% and 0.84 for SI4, respectively. The box-and-whiskers diagram proposed that the field can be divided into four soil EC-dependent groups, which are considered MZs to support a variety of management decisions. This study shows that through sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, the spatial variability of soil salinity can be mapped and used as a basis for MZs within the studied region.

TI  - Insight into seasonal aerosol concentrations and meteorological influence over a flood affected area using satellite data and statistical model simulation
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Aerosol particles in the atmosphere are one of the many factors that might affect floods. One of India's most flood-prone regions, Muzaffarpur district in Bihar, has been chosen as the study area. The time period considered for the satellite data on meteorological influence is from the year 2000 to 2021. The correlation coefficient between past forecasts and its confirming data is often used to assess the effectiveness of weather and climate forecasting systems. Therefore, changes in correlation can be utilized to gauge advancements in forecasting ability. In this study, the relationship between aerosol optical depth (AOD) 550 nm, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, PM2.5 and precipitation are carried out with correlation co-efficient. The average rainfall throughout the monsoon was found to be 162.5 mm, during the period 2000-2021. The descriptive statistical data for seasonal data were determined for AOD (550 nm), PM2.5, wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature values. It is inferred that there is a positive correlation between precipitation and AOD for the monsoon season. Hence the fitting of meteorological parameter AOD for the monsoon season are done with six different probability distributions Gamma (3P), Logistics, Lognormal (3P), Normal, Rayleigh (2P) and Weibull (3P). The parameters of these distributions are evaluated using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation and the goodness of fit is tested using the test statistics Kolmogorov Smirnov and Anderson Darling test. Among the six discussed distributions, Weibull (3P) distribution provides the best fit to model the meteorological data from the satellite, the flood prediction would be obtained from the model proposed.

TI  - Climate change impacts on snow cover area and snowmelt runoff in the Ajichai Basin-Iran
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - During snowmelt in mountainous areas, runoff can play an important role in providing water to the region. This study examined the effect of climate change on runoff in Ajichai, Iran, since it affects air warming and faster melting of snow and ice. Using the sixth report provided by IPCC, the future temperature and precipitation in the years 2015-2100 were predicted using two scenarios, SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5. According to the results, the average annual minimum and maximum temperatures would increase by 1 degrees during this period, but precipitation would decrease by about 3%. Based on the Snow Runoff Model (SRM) model and the snow cover area (SCA) obtained from Google Earth Engine and MODIS daily images from 2013 to 2018, runoff caused by snow melting was simulated. Based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between snow cover and temperature and precipitation, the SCA was estimated in three decades: 2031-2040, 2061-2070, and 2091-2100. With reasonable accuracy, the SRM was able to simulate runoff. In the SSP1 scenario, the SCA in spring and winter will remain the same throughout all three decades, but in the SSP5 scenario, it will decrease by about 17%. In the future, the runoff will decrease by up to 6% in the winter and increase in the spring.

TI  - Insight into historical and future spring snow cover from satellite observation and model simulations over the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of spring snow cover fraction (SCF) can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain Earth system models (ESMs) in simulating the energy exchange between land and atmosphere system, global hydrological cycle and future climate impacts. Here, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of simulated spring SCF from 23 and 20 ESMs participating CMIP5 and CMIP6, against satellite data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Climatic Data Center (NOAA/NCDC) and a long-term Northern Hemisphere daily 5-km snow cover extent product (JASMES) over the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and its 13 subregions during the period of 1982-2005 and 2072-2095. Our results show that (a) no model performs consistently better in simulating spring SCF from all aspects (mean annual, long-term trend and climatological monthly of spring SCF); (b) the mean annual of spring SCF that was simulated by CMIP5 and CMIP6 model simulations was underestimated in most of the NH and overestimated over the Tibetan Plateau and eastern Asia; (c) most of the model simulations showed a stronger reduction trend for mean annual of spring SCF; (d) the climatological monthly variation of spring SCF is reasonably captured by all model simulations, except for overestimation over the TIB and EAS regions, and there is underestimation in other regions; (e) compared to CMIP5, most of the model simulations in CMIP6 exhibit an improved ability to simulate spring SCF across all aspects; (f) we confirm that the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) is a better way to represent the three aspects of spring SCF than most individual model simulations. Finally, the spring SCF values predicted by models with better simulation abilities over the NH and its 13 subregions under different scenarios show decreasing trends. Specifically, the highest decreasing trend of spring SCF was found under high emission scenarios (RCP8.5 and SSP5-8.5).

TI  - Survival rates for invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea in accordance with the Eighth edition AJCC Cancer Staging Manual: A retrospective single center study.
T2  - Indian journal of dermatology, venereology and leprology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background Cutaneous malignant melanoma is known to have a poorer prognosis in Asian patients as compared to Caucasians. Few studies have analysed the overall survival rate (OS) and melanoma-specific survival rate (MSS) of patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea. Aim This study aims to analyse the OS, MSS and prognostic factors of patients with invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea. Methods The medical records of patients diagnosed with invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma from July 2006 to June 2016 at Kyungpook National University Hospital were reviewed retrospectively. The OS/MSS of these patients were calculated in accordance with the Eighth American Joint Committee on Center staging system and the prognostic factors affecting MSS were analysed. Results A total of 202 patients with a mean age of 61.5 years were included. The 5-year OS/MSS was 64.4%/70.7% in the patients. The 5-year OS/MSS was 94.7%/97.1% for stage I, 67.2%/76.3% for stage II, 54.4%/59.1% for stage III, and 0%/0% for stage IV. On univariate analysis, the age, sex, Breslow thickness, ulceration, microsatellites, satellites, locally recurrent or in-transit metastasis, tumour metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes and clinicopathological stage were all significantly associated with the MSS, but not with acral distribution or BRAF mutation status. However, on multivariate analysis only the Breslow thickness, ulceration and stage IV were significantly associated with the MSS. Limitations This study was conducted retrospectively in a relatively small number of patients at a single tertiary center in South Korea. Conclusions The OS/MSS of patients with invasive cutaneous malignant melanoma in South Korea was lower than those in Caucasians. In addition to the Breslow thickness and ulceration, the impact of tumour location and sentinel nodal metastasis on cutaneous malignant melanoma should be reevaluated to better understand the disease prognosis in these patients.

TI  - Hodological Space in the Acts Narrative
T2  - EXPOSITORY TIMES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study is an attempt to highlight the geographical perspective that was current in the New Testament world: a hodological understanding of space, which represents the ancient people's worldview, and can be a clue to interpreting Acts also. This article argues that Acts reveals the linearity of hodological space through the geographical movement of the apostles to the end of earth. Luke constructs a linear narrative, that is, a straight line on which he arranges a number of cities and places. Acts is composed of a series of paths from the preface to the final scene, but those paths are condensed within a single path from Jerusalem to Rome. From this hodological reading, the essay claims that Luke guides his audience to the final destination of Rome, which is hidden away as a surprise. That might be a reason why Luke places Rome at the end of Paul's entire itinerary.

TI  - InSAR-Derived Horizontal Velocities in a Global Reference Frame
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Letter
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar is used to measure deformation rates over continents to constrain tectonic processes. The resulting velocity measurements are only relative, however, due to unknown integer ambiguities introduced during propagation of the signal through the atmosphere. These ambiguities mostly cancel when using spectral diversity to estimate along-track motion, allowing measurements to be made with respect to a global reference frame. Here, we calculate along-track velocities for a partial global data set of Sentinel-1 acquisitions and find good agreement with ITRF2014 plate motion model and measurements from GPS stations. We include corrections for solid-earth tides and gradients of ionospheric total electron content. Combining data from ascending and descending orbits we are able to estimate north and east velocities over 250 x 250 km areas and their accuracy of 4 and 23 mm/year, respectively. These "absolute" measurements can be particularly useful for global velocity and strain rate estimation where GNSS measurements are sparse.Plain Language Summary It is possible to use repeated radar measurements from satellites to measure movement of the ground toward or away from the satellite very accurately. These measurements do not tell us the absolute movement, however, but rather the difference in movement between any two parts of the ground captured in the same radar image. Using a related technique, we measure horizontal movement of the ground in the flight direction of the satellite, and these are absolute measurements, in a global reference frame. By combining measurements from different flight directions, we can estimate the horizontal movement of the ground in any direction. Our estimates largely match what we expect from plate tectonics and measurements made using GPS instruments. These new measurements can be useful for large-scale mapping of ground movement, which can be used to better understand how the Earth deforms and how earthquake hazard varies across the globe.

TI  - MT-InSAR and Dam Modeling for the Comprehensive Monitoring of an Earth-Fill Dam: The Case of the Beninar Dam (Almeria, Spain)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Beninar Dam, located in Southeastern Spain, is an earth-fill dam that has experienced filtration issues since its construction in 1985. Despite the installation of various monitoring systems, the data collected are sparse and inadequate for the dam's lifetime. The present research integrates Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) and dam modeling to validate the monitoring of this dam, opening the way to enhanced integrated monitoring systems. MT-InSAR was proved to be a reliable and continuous monitoring system for dam deformation, surpassing previously installed systems in terms of precision. MT-InSAR allowed the almost-continuous monitoring of this dam since 1992, combining ERS, Envisat, and Sentinel-1A/B data. Line-of-sight (LOS) velocities of settlement in the crest of the dam evolved from maximums of -6 mm/year (1992-2000), -4 mm/year (2002-2010), and -2 mm/year (2015-2021) with median values of -2.6 and -3.0 mm/year in the first periods (ERS and Envisat) and -1.3 mm/year in the Sentinel 1-A/B period. These results are consistent with the maximum admissible modeled deformation from construction, confirming that settlement was more intense in the dam's early stages and decreased over time. MT-InSAR was also used to integrate the monitoring of the dam basin, including critical slopes, quarries, and infrastructures, such as roads, tracks, and spillways. This study allows us to conclude that MT-InSAR and dam modeling are important elements for the integrated monitoring systems of embankment dams. This conclusion supports the complete integration of MT-InSAR and 3D modeling into the monitoring systems of embankment dams, as they are a key complement to traditional geotechnical monitoring and can overcome the main limitations of topographical monitoring.

TI  - Relaxation-Based Radiometric Normalization for Multitemporal Cross-Sensor Satellite Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal cross-sensor imagery is fundamental for the monitoring of the Earth's surface over time. However, these data often lack visual consistency because of variations in the atmospheric and surface conditions, making it challenging to compare and analyze images. Various image-normalization methods have been proposed to address this issue, such as histogram matching and linear regression using iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection (IR-MAD). However, these methods have limitations in their ability to maintain important features and their requirement of reference images, which may not be available or may not adequately represent the target images. To overcome these limitations, a relaxation-based algorithm for satellite-image normalization is proposed. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the radiometric values of images by updating the normalization parameters (slope ( ff) and intercept ( fi)) until a desired level of consistency is reached. This method was tested on multitemporal cross-sensor-image datasets and showed significant improvements in radiometric consistency compared to other methods. The proposed relaxation algorithm outperformed IR-MAD and the original images in reducing radiometric inconsistencies, maintaining important features, and improving the accuracy (MAE = 2.3; RMSE = 2.8) and consistency of the surface-reflectance values (R-2 = 87.56%; Euclidean distance = 2.11; spectral angle mapper = 12.60).

TI  - Monsoon paddy crop discrimination using machine learning algorithms to multi-temporal Sentinel-1A (C-band) data in Alathur block of Palakkad district of Kerala state, India
T2  - PADDY AND WATER ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop identification and acreage estimation are always challenges for passive remote sensing in cloudy environments, especially during the rainy season. Microwave remote sensing data, with its availability and advantages of cloud penetration, can offer a solution to this problem. In the present study, a dual-pole polarization Sentinel-1 (C-band) SAR dataset was used for the assessment of the paddy temporal growth stage in the Alathur block of Kerala, India. The acreage estimation of coconut, fallow, mixed trees, paddy, rubber, plantation, paddy-coconut, and plantation fallow classes were also carried out using ArcGIS software. The multi-temporal data from June 2021 to October 2021 is openly accessible from the European Space Agency (ESA) via the Sentinel-1. The image was preprocessed for radiometric corrections, speckle filtering, terrain correction, and co-registration, and was finally converted from a linear to a decibel (dB) domain using ESA (SNAP software). The crop discrimination of paddy and other classes was also classified by using the decision tree rule (DTR), K-nearest neighbors, minimum distance (MD), and random forest (RF) classifiers. The results revealed that during the early stage of the paddy crop, specular reflection occurred, which enabled a low backscatter signature of - 18.45 to - 10.9 dB in VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and in VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) polarization, and with each growth stage of the crop, the backscatter varied. However, there was no significant variation observed for coconut (- 15.02 dB) in VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and (- 8.67 dB) in VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) and for Rubber (- 14.57 dB) in VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) and (- 7.78 dB) in VV (vertical transmit and vertical receive) as compared to paddy field. The results obtained for paddy and other classes from different classifiers revealed that random forest (RF) and K-nearest neighbor classifications gave 95.0 percent and 94.0 percent accuracy for the classification of paddy, respectively, as compared to decision tree rule (DTR) and minimum distance classification.

TI  - Validation and Evaluation of GRACE-FO Estimates with In Situ Bottom Pressure Array Measurements in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), and its follow-on mission (GRACE-FO), provides a novel measurement of the variations in ocean bottom pressure (OBP) at global and basin scales, including those in marginal seas. However, these measurements have not yet been validated rigorously for the South China Sea (SCS). In this study, the accuracy in the monthly GRACE-FO mascon solutions in the SCS from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Center for Space Research (CSR), and Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) was validated with the results of the comparison with the in situ OBP records from an array of 25 pressure-recording inverted echo sounders (PIESs) that are located west of the Luzon Strait (LS). The correlation coefficient (Cor) and root mean square difference (RMSD) between the 10-month period of GSFC and PIES, spanning from July 2018 to June 2019 (with missing satellite data for August and September 2018), were 0.77 (p-value = 0.005) and 0.41 mbar (1 mbar = 100 Pa), respectively. These values suggest that the accuracy of GSFC in the SCS in this period was substantially better than that of JPL (Cor = 0.35, p-value = 0.16; RMSD = 0.74 mbar) and CSR (Cor = 0.25, p-value = 0.24; RMSD = 0.89 mbar). Moreover, the volume transport anomaly of the SCS abyssal circulation was estimated and compared based on the OBP records from GSFC and PIES observations, indicating that the GRACE-FO OBP (GSFC) can be used to monitor seasonal or longer-period variations in the SCS abyssal volume transport. Additionally, the variations in OBP from GRACE-FO were significantly overestimated on the continental shelf of the SCS, which may be attributed to signal leakage. Our findings provide reliable evidence for the application of long-term, fully covered OBP records from GRACE-FO in the SCS, and also offer a valuable reference for the application of GRACE-FO in other regions.

TI  - Bayesian Monte Carlo Inversion of InSAR Time Series Deformation Induced by Wastewater Injection: A Case Study in West Texas
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wastewater disposal can induce detectable surface uplift, which may cause ground instability and threaten infrastructure. The distributions of local hydro-geomechanical parameters, especially Young's modulus and hydraulic conductivity, play an essential role in these geohazards. To constrain these parameters, we have inverted spatio-temporal deformation measured by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and injection information using a Bayesian Monte Carlo approach with a poroelastic finite element model. Sentinel-1A/B imagery from 2014 to 2020 is processed to track the spatio-temporal deformation in Winkler county, West Texas, USA. The posterior distribution of subsurface effective volumes reveals under-reported volumes in the well near the deformation center. In addition, the inversion results provide better constraints for the parameters than those solely obtained based on the cumulative spatial deformation or temporal development of the deformation center.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper reports from a symposium exploring the application of Virtual Reality (VR) in RE. The contributors presented empirical case-studies of interventions and instructional designs that had been tested in classroom settings ranging from primary to teacher education. The presentations illustrate the ways in which VR can be understood as a rapidly developing family of technologies that, as teaching and learning material, offers a new form of mobility and the shifting of grounds in the RE classroom: It can bring learners to places of worship across the globe or provide immersive experiences of being at the receiving end of bullying as a starting point for ethical reflection. VR and 360-images enable us to encounter religion and worldview, oneself and different ways of exploring our subject in ways that strengthen the relevance of RE. The larger picture that emerges from the symposium is not one of revolutionary change but definite enrichment of the RE toolkit with rich avenues for future research.

TI  - Detection and mapping of artillery craters with very high spatial resolution satellite imagery and deep learning
T2  - SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unexploded munitions are some of the most enduring remnants of conflicts around the world. Their effects on the economy, health, environment, and post-conflict rehabilitation are long reaching and devastating for the areas they plague. With the advancements in very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite multispectral imaging at submeter resolution, it becomes possible to detect object attributes at the scale of individual impacts (craters) of heavy weapon shelling. Manual identification and delineation of artillery craters in satellite imagery is time and resource consuming, especially when large territories and volumes of VHR data are considered. Therefore, automatic image processing methods should be explored. Here, we evaluate the application of a deep learning approach for identifying and mapping artillery craters in agricultural fields in Eastern Ukraine during the onset of armed conflict in 2014. The model was applied to pansharpened multispectral VHR imagery acquired by the WorldView-2 satellite at 0.5-m spatial resolution. The model can detect artillery craters with producer's accuracy (PA) (or recall) of 0.671 and user's accuracy (UA) (or precision) of 0.392 in terms of crater area and shape, and PA of 0.559 and UA of 0.427 in terms of binary crater identification. The model's performance is dependent on crater size. Reliability of crater detection and mapping improves as the size of craters increases. For example, for craters larger than 60 m2 PA is 0.803 and UA is 0.449 (per-pixel), and PA is 0.891 and UA is 0.721 (per-object). Overall, the model prioritizes PA over UA, i.e., omission error over commission error, and is better at detecting craters than their shapes. We applied the trained model to a separate, 858 km2 subregion of Donetsk oblast to automatically estimate and map the locations, number and area of artillery craters. Our estimates revealed over 22,000 craters in the subregion, which occupy an area of 1.2 km2, or 0.14% of the region, primarily in agricultural fields. The availability of such crater maps is extremely valuable within demining and chemical decontamination efforts and can assist in assessing the impact of warfare on agriculture and the environment. We outline the current limitations of the proposed approach and avenues for further research for improving artillery crater detection and mapping.

TI  - Are aligners capable of inducing palatal bodily translation or palatal root torque of upper central incisors? A biomechanical in vitro study
T2  - CLINICAL ORAL INVESTIGATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesPrevious studies have shown that aligners have limited ability to control root movements. The purpose of this study was to investigate which modification geometry and foil thickness are optimal for generating the force-moment (F/M) systems required for palatal root torque of maxillary central incisors.Materials and methodsTooth 11 was separated from a maxillary acrylic model and connected to a movement unit via a 3D F/M sensor. Different modification geometries (crescent, capsular, double-spherical) with different depths were digitally implemented in the labio-cervical region of tooth 11 to induce an increased contact force. We evaluated the F/M systems exerted by aligners with thicknesses of 0.4-1.0 mm. F/M measurements were taken with tooth 11 in the neutral position and during palatal displacement of tooth 11 (simulating its initial clinical movement).ResultsThe mechanical requirements of palatal root torque are a palatally directed force (- Fy) and a palatal root torquing moment (- Mx). These requirements were reliably achieved with modification depths > 0.5 mm. The modification depth and foil thickness had a significant influence on - Fy magnitudes (linear mixed-effect models, p < 0.01). With the 0.75-mm aligners combined with 1.5-mm deep modifications, the palatal root torque range (palTR) started after an initial palatal crown displacement of 0.09, 0.12, and 0.12 mm for the capsular, crescent, and double-spherical modification geometries, respectively.ConclusionsA relatively early start of the palatal torque range (after a 0.1-mm palatal crown displacement) and appropriate - Fy magnitudes were achieved with 0.75-mm-thick aligners containing 1.5-mm deep capsular or crescent pressure regions. Subsequent clinical trials are required to confirm the clinical effects of these modifications.

TI  - Adaptability Evaluation of the Spatiotemporal Fusion Model of Sentinel-2 and MODIS Data in a Typical Area of the Three-River Headwater Region
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of surface vegetation monitoring in the "Three-River Headwaters" Region (TRHR) relies on satellite data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. The spatial and temporal fusion method for multiple data sources can effectively overcome the limitations of weather, the satellite return period, and funding on research data to obtain data higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This paper explores the spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (STARFM), the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM), and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF) method applied to Sentinel-2 and MODIS data in a typical area of the TRHR. In this study, the control variable method was used to analyze the parameter sensitivity of the models and explore the adaptation parameters of the Sentinel-2 and MODIS data in the study area. Since the spatiotemporal fusion model was directly used in the product data of the vegetation index, this study used NDVI fusion as an example and set up a comparison experiment (experiment I first performed the band spatiotemporal fusion and then calculated the vegetation index; experiment II calculated the vegetation index first and then performed the spatiotemporal fusion) to explore the feasibility and applicability of the two methods for the vegetation index fusion. The results showed the following. (1) The three spatiotemporal fusion models generated high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution data based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and MODIS data, the STARFM and FSDAF model had a higher fusion accuracy, and the R2 values after fusion were higher than 0.8, showing greater applicability. (2) The fusion accuracy of each model was affected by the model parameters. The errors between the STARFM, ESTARFM, and FSDAF fusion results and the validation data all showed a decreasing trend with an increase in the size of the sliding window or the number of similar pixels, which stabilized after the sliding window became larger than 50 and the similar pixels became larger than 80. (3) The comparative experimental results showed that the spatiotemporal fusion model can be directly fused based on the vegetation index products, and higher quality vegetation index data can be obtained by calculating the vegetation index first and then performing the spatiotemporal fusion. The high spatial and temporal resolution data obtained using a suitable spatial and temporal fusion model are important for the identification and monitoring of surface cover types in the TRHR.

TI  - Enhancing Soil Mapping with Hyperspectral Subsurface Images generated from soil lab Vis-SWIR spectra tested in southern Brazil
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Remote Sensing (RS) products involving the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR, simply Vis-SWIR) wavelengths are applicable for spatial prediction of soil properties, usually in the process called Digital Soil Mapping (DSM). The multispectral optical orbital sensors lack spectral resolution, while the Proximal Soil Sensing (PSS) offers many application possibilities. The limited spectral resolution and soil cover are the main challenging aspects for DSM. The objective of the study was to combine the soil lab Vis-SWIR spectra within DSM technique to create new hyperspectral images to use as covariates in a novel method of soil mapping. The advantages of the method were demonstrated throughout the spatial prediction of the Total Carbon (TC) content on soils of the upper part of Itatiaia National Park (INP), (Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais States, southeastern Brazil). The covariates applied were multispectral orbital bands from Sentinel 2, relief with its terrain derivations, geology and geomorphology. Using uppermost soil horizon lab Vis-SWIR spectra information from 72 points in the upper part of INP, 130 hyperspectral images were generated, in other words, Hyperspectral Subsurface Image. The validation methods were 8-fold cross-validation (CV) and External Validation (EV) running alongside within Random Forest algorithm, where randomness was locked. The DSM reaches an average CV coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.6, while creating a new model with a set of hyperspectral images gave a CV R2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 4.06. The EV also presented an advantage for the second approach. The results support the method as the first strong integration between PSS and DSM, named by the authors as Hyperspectral Soil Mapping (HSM), which proved to be more efficient for mapping TC due to the pure soil lab Vis-SWIR spectra signal (free of atmospheric influence and vegetation cover). The method can be applied in dense or sparsely vegetated areas, for agricultural or conservation purposes, for various soil properties, with each and every wavelength.

TI  - Interest of seroprevalence surveys for the epidemiological surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in African populations: Insights from the ARIACOV project in Benin
T2  - TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Many SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys since the end of 2020 have disqualified the first misconception that Africa had been spared by the pandemic. Through the analysis of three SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys carried out in Benin as part of the ARIACOV project, we argue that the integration of epidemiological serosurveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in the national surveillance packages would be of great use to refine the understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic in Africa.Methods We carried out three repeated cross-sectional surveys in Benin: two in Cotonou, the economic capital in March and May 2021, and one in Natitingou, a semi-rural city in the north of the country in August 2021. Total and weighted-by-age-group seroprevalences were estimated and the risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed by multivariate logistic regression.Results In Cotonou, a slight increase in overall age-standardised SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from 29.77% (95% CI: 23.12%-37.41%) at the first survey to 34.86% (95% CI: 31.57%-38.30%) at the second survey was observed. In Natitingou, the globally adjusted seroprevalence was 33.34% (95% CI: 27.75%-39.44%). A trend of high risk for SARS-CoV 2 seropositivity was observed in adults over 40 versus the young (less than 18 years old) during the first survey in Cotonou but no longer in the second survey.Conclusions Our results show that, however, rapid organisation of preventive measures aimed at breaking the chains of transmission, they were ultimately unable to prevent a wide spread of the virus in the population. Routine serological surveillance on strategic sentinel sites and/or populations could constitute a cost-effective compromise to better anticipate the onset of new waves and define public health strategies.

TI  - Mapping Paddy Rice Planting Area in Dongting Lake Area Combining Time Series Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely acquisition of cropping intensity and spatial distribution of paddy rice is not only an important basis for monitoring growth and predicting yields, but also for ensuring food security and optimizing the agricultural production management system of cropland. However, due to the monsoon climate in southern China, it is cloudy and rainy throughout the year, which makes it difficult to obtain accurate information on rice cultivation based on optical time series images. Conventional image synthesis is prone to omission or redundancy of spectral and temporal features that are potentially important for rice-growth identification, making it difficult to determine the optimal features for high-precision mapping of paddy rice. To address these issues, we develop a method to granulate the effective use interval of classification features by extracting phenological signatures of rice to obtain cost-effective and highly accurate mapping results. Two steps are involved in this method: (1) analyzing the information on various features (spectra, polarization, and seasonal regularity) to identify three key phenological periods throughout the lifespan of paddy rice; (2) identifying the features with the highest class separation between paddy rice, non-paddy crops, and wetlands under different phenological stages; and (3) removing redundant features to retain the optimal feature combinations. Subsequently, the obtained feature sets are used as input data for the random forest classifier. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the identified rice results was 95.44% with F1 scores above 93% for both single- and double-cropping rice. Meanwhile, the correlation coefficient of our mapped rice area compared with the official statistics of rice area at county and district levels was 0.86. In addition, we found that combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for rice recognition was better than using Sentinel-1 or Sentinel-2 alone, and the classification accuracy was improved by 5.82% and 2.39%, which confirms that the synergistic Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data can effectively overcome the problem of missing optical images caused by clouds and rain. Our study demonstrates the potential of distinguishing mixed rice-cropping systems in subtropical regions with fragmented rice-field distribution in a cloudy and rainy environment, and also provides a basis for the rational layout of rice production and improvement of cultivation systems.

TI  - Investigating the relationship between COVID-19 shutdown and land surface temperature on the Anatolian side of Istanbul using large architectural impermeable surfaces
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Artificial impermeable surfaces are becoming more prevalent, especially in urban areas, as a result of shifting land use and cover, roads, roofs, etc. The modification of land surface temperature (LST) can also be accomplished through artificially impermeable surfaces. Large artificial impermeable surfaces, such as rooftops, parking lots, and other areas of use, can be found in industrial zones, shopping malls, industrial airports, and other locations. For the Anatolian side of Istanbul, 14 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery images over the years 2016-2022 were investigated. To evaluate how well the study's images could be utilized, correlation and cosine similarity approaches were employed. A total of 12 images may be employed for research LST studies, it was discovered. We looked at closure dates during the COVID-19 epidemic to find out how human migration affected the LST. In addition, the LST value was estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method employing LST and other biophysical indices. A decrease in LST values was seen as a result of the investigation. High levels of similarity and correlation were found between the images used. Results from the Google Mobility Index also provide support to the study. All of these facts provide support to Istanbul's Anatolian side experiencing lower surface temperature values, which consequently affects the city's massive structures.

TI  - A Calibration Method for Large-Footprint Full-Waveform Airborne Laser Altimeter without a Calibration Field
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometrical measurement precision of laser spots is affected by the deviation between the parameters of the laser altimeter and the laboratory measurement results, and the inversion accuracy of surface object height is also limited. The measurement parameters and the load state can be obtained by calibration of the laser altimeter system. Usually, ground detectors are deployed to calibrate the measurement parameters of the laser altimeter, including the divergence angle and the energy distribution of the laser beam. A calibration method for a laser footprint spot without a calibration field was proposed in this paper, focused on the airborne large-footprint laser altimeter system. The geometric parameters of the laser spot were calibrated through the laser echo waveforms of a specific terrain. The experimental results show that geometric calibration of the large-footprint laser altimeter can be achieved in the area of the step surface. The divergence angle of the laser beams obtained from the six experimental areas is 4.604 +/- 0.359 mRad, and the consistency of the energy distribution from each laser spot reaches 92.67%. A new method of on-orbit calibration and verification is provided for the satellite laser altimeter system.

TI  - <i>Dreissena</i><i> polymorpha</i> responses under thermal and hypoxic stress: New insights in the tolerance of this freshwater sentinel species
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dreissena polymorpha is a sentinel freshwater mussel providing key functional ecosystemic services like nutrient recycling and suspended matter filtration. Global warming and especially extreme events imply rapid fluctua-tions of environmental parameters that sessile organisms could not escape. The increase occurrence of heat waves and the subsequent expansion of hypoxic areas could challenge the survival of mussels. This study pro-vided a deeper knowledge of energy management and cellular function during thermal (+15 degrees C) or hypoxic (30% of dissolved oxygen saturation) stress for 7 days. A potential metabolic rate depression was highlighted in D. polymorpha under hypoxia through a decline in the mitochondrial activity and a constant AMP content over time. A contrasted pattern of response was observed in thermal-stressed mussels between 24 h and 7 days of exposure. A global increase of metabolic activity was noticed in mussels after 24 h while a return to control level was noticed at the end of the experiment. Although D. polymorpha is considered as a temperature tolerant species, a significant increase of ADP:ATP ratio, related to a decrease of mitochondrial activity and density, suggested an overwhelming of organisms. This study pointed to the importance of considering time of exposure to natural factor variations in tolerance window of organisms in a long-term changing environment. The apparent short-term tolerance of D. polymorpha could hide much more deleterious consequences, i.e. mortality, if abiotic stresses persist, as suggested by climate change models.

TI  - Landuse, landcover change dynamics and flooding in the lower Niger basin Onitsha, South Eastern Nigeria
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study looked at the factors contributing to Onitsha's incessant flooding, specifically landuse and land cover depletion. The landuse/landcover changes during a period of ten years (2008 - 2018) and the relevant variables were studied in the lower Niger Basin, focusing on Onitsha, Anambra State. Three sets of Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) Landsat imagery maps from 2008, 2013, and 2018 were used to construct three Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based landuse/landcover maps of the research location and cross-tabulation method was adopted for the Change Detection analysis. The results demonstrated that between 2008 and 2013, built-up areas expanded by 9.4%, and between 2013 and 2018, they increased by 9.4%. Then it grew by 5.5%, resulting in a total area of 470 ha and 275 ha. Then, between 2008 and 2018, built-up added 745 ha in the study region, whereas vegetation lost 638 ha between 2008 and 2013, and another 97 ha between 2013 and 2018, for a total loss of 735 ha. Between 2008 and 2013, the area of bare ground increased by 1.3%, to 65 ha, while between 2013 and 2018, the area of bare ground decreased by 0.3%, to 15 ha. This study also discovered a 40-hectare rise in waterbody between 2008 and 2013 and a 100-hectare loss between 2013 and 2018. Based on the findings, the changes in landuse/landcover change detection provided insight into non-compliance with existing landuse acts and the implementation strategies of government agencies enforcing them.

TI  - A wetland permanence classification tool to support prairie wetland conservation and policy implementation
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland permanence, the duration and frequency that surface water is present, affects biological communities and whether wetlands are protected under legislation in some jurisdictions. Wetland drainage in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) has changed the distribution of wetlands because smaller and more temporary wetlands are more likely to be drained. This change in distribution affects biodiversity and other wetland ecosystem services. In Manitoba, Canada, wetlands are treated differently under the Water Rights Act based on permanence classification and can either be drained with a simplified registration (temporary and ephemeral wetlands), drained with a permit requiring mitigation (seasonal wetlands), or are protected from drainage (semipermanent and permanent wetlands). To facilitate implementing a conservation program targeting the most vulnerable wetlands, we built a classification model using LiDAR and Sentinel-2 data (1312 training observations). Our random forest model had 73% accuracy on 563 test observations and is applicable across the agricultural region of southwestern Manitoba. We predicted the wetland permanence class of 365,499 wetlands and built an online tool to help practitioners implement a conservation program that pays producers to conserve temporary and ephemeral wetlands. Our approach is applicable elsewhere in the PPR and other regions with variation in wetland permanence.

TI  - The Grande Ronde Model Watershed: Integrating Science into Restoration Implementation and Adaptive Management
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed conservation groups throughout the Pacific Northwest coordinate and implement watershed and habitat restoration to recover Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. Many watershed organizations struggle with implementing an adaptive management process that integrates monitoring data and the latest science into their restoration programs. We describe the evolution and lessons learned from the Grande Ronde Model Watershed (GRMW), one of the longest running watershed organizations coordinating fish habitat restoration projects. Since 1992, the GRMW has initiated nearly 300 habitat restoration projects and their partners more than 600 projects. These projects have evolved from an opportunistic approach, focusing on small-scale riparian fencing and instream structures to a data driven, collaborative processes for identifying, ranking, and implementing large process-based floodplain projects using the latest science. The GRMW recently developed an adaptive management process to assess restoration goals and priorities, and a multi-scale monitoring program that leverages the extensive data collected by partners, and periodic collection of LiDAR to evaluate past, current, and future restoration projects. These recently developed components, which are based on the collective history of the GRMW, provide important lessons for other watershed restoration organizations. These include partnering with local organizations to collect monitoring data; use of a transparent multi-scale process for prioritizing restoration; development of a stepwise process for design and implementation of priority projects; a formal adaptive management process with a designated lead to use the latest science to modify goals, priorities, project selection, and design; and use of remotely sensed data to assist with multi-scale monitoring of project success.

TI  - Retrieving cloud base height from passive radiometer observations via a systematic effective cloud water content table
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud base heights (CBHs) play an important role in weather and climate studies, but remain one of the most challenging properties to be inferred using passive satellite spectral instruments. This is because spectral signals detected from space are mainly from cloud tops and contain minimal information on cloud vertical structures owing to limited penetration. This paper presents a new algorithm for retrieving CBH from radiometer mea-surements, utilizing an improved characterization for mutable cloud water contents (CWCs). This was achieved by introducing a variable named effective CWC (ECWC) to represent the vertically varying CWC; and subse-quently investigating the sensitivity of ECWC to both cloud and environmental properties. Considering these characteristics, a systematic ECWC lookup table (LUT) was created based on collocated active and passive sat-ellite observations. We then converted the existing cloud water path (CWP; kg/m2) to cloud geometric thickness (CGT; km) via the developed LUT, and calculated CBH by subtracting the CGT estimates from conventional cloud top height (CTH) retrievals. The algorithm was tested using observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) as examples, and was evaluated using active measurements from the CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CAL -IPSO) satellites and a ground-based Ka-band radar. Overall, our CBH results agreed closely with the active ob-servations, with mean biases of 0.11 & PLUSMN; 1.93 km for MODIS and -0.12 & PLUSMN; 2.34 km for AHI in single-layer cloud cases. Despite the natural limitations on retrieving CBHs using passive radiometers, the proposed algorithm achieves retrieval accuracies comparable to those of operational CTH products. Moreover, this algorithm works for both single-layer and overlapping clouds, and can be extended to other passive radiometers by reconstructing the LUT. Such accurate CBH information derived from high-resolution passive radiometers would greatly improve our understanding of cloud vertical distributions; and could play an important role in studies of cloud radiative effects and the aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Modeling of Air Temperature in the Complex Environment of Yerevan City, Armenia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning (ML) was used to assess and predict urban air temperature (T-air) considering the complexity of the terrain features in Yerevan (Armenia). The estimation was performed based on the Partial Least-Squares Regression (PLSR) model with a high number (30) of input variables. The relevant parameters include a newly purposed modification of spectral index IBI-SAVI, which turned out to strongly impact T-air prediction together with land surface temperature (LST). Cross-validation analysis on temperature predictions across a station-centered 1000 m circular area revealed quite a high correlation (R-Val(2) = 0.77, RMSEVal = 1.58) between the predicted and measured T-air from the test set. It was concluded the remote sensing is an effective tool to estimate T-air distribution where a dense network of weather stations is not available. However, further developments will include incorporation of additional weather parameters from the weather stations, such as precipitation and wind speed, as well as the use of non-parametric ML techniques.

TI  - Impact of land use change on the urban-rural temperature disparity in Eastern China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Unprecedented land use and land cover change (LULCC) has occurred across China over the past two decades. While urban heat island effects have been well documented, few studies identified the LULCC-induced tem-perature disparity within cities and nearby rurual areas. Through an integrated analysis of satellite observations and regional model simulations, this study quantifies LULCC effect on summer temperature in old urban areas (existed in 2003), new urban areas (developed after 2003) and rural areas (non-urban areas) over Eastern China in 2003-2019. The results show that LULCC causes urban areas to become warmer, with the effect being more pronounced in new urban areas than in old urban areas. Air temperature (2 m, T2) and surface temperature (TSK) in new urban areas increase respectively by 1.69 degrees C and 3.40 degrees C, while in old urban areas, T2 (TSK) increases by 0.10 degrees C (0.13 degrees C). Significant vegetation degradation is observed in new urban areas, whereas vegetation restoration occurs in old urban areas in recent years as a result of urban renewal. In contrast, LULCC cools and greens rural areas, with a 0.02 degrees C (0.03 degrees C) decrease in T2 (TSK). Urbanization warming can spread to the suburbs, along with vegetation degradation. The analysis of surface energy budget reveals that the reduction in latent heat plays a dominant role in urban warming. Our study underscores that a much larger greenspace fraction and albedo management in urban areas are suggested as an inherent part of future LULCC policy to alleviate urban-rural temperature disparity.

TI  - Can upscaling ground nadir SIF to eddy covariance footprint improve the relationship between SIF and GPP in croplands?
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is important for the mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of vegetation gross primary production (GPP) at fine spatiotemporal scales. However, eddy covariance (EC) observations generally cover larger footprint areas than ground SIF observations (a bare fiber with nadir), and this footprint mismatch between nadir SIF and GPP could complicate the canopy SIF-GPP relationships. Here, we upscaled nadir SIF observations to EC footprint and investigated the change in SIF-GPP relationships after the upscaling in cropland. We included 13 site-years data in our study, with seven site-years corn, four siteyears soybeans, and two site-years miscanthus, all located in the US Corn Belt. All sites' crop nadir SIF observations collected from the automated FluoSpec2 system (a hemispheric-nadir system) were upscaled to the GPP footprint-based SIF using vegetation indices (VIs) calculated from high spatiotemporal satellite reflectance data. We found that SIF-GPP relationships were not substantially changed after upscaling nadir SIF to GPP footprint at our crop sites planted with corn, soybean, and miscanthus, with R2 change after the upscaling ranging from -0.007 to 0.051 and root mean square error (RMSE) difference from -0.658 to 0.095 umol m - 2 s - 1 relative to original nadir SIF-GPP relationships across all the site-years. The variation of the SIF-GPP relationship within each species across different site-years was similar between the original nadir SIF and upscaled SIF. Different VIs, EC footprint models, and satellite data led to marginal differences in the SIF-GPP relationships when upscaling nadir SIF to EC footprint. Our study provided a methodological framework to correct this spatial mismatch between ground nadir SIF and GPP observations for croplands and potentially for other ecosystems. Our results also demonstrated that the spatial mismatch between ground nadir SIF and GPP might not significantly affect the SIF-GPP relationship in cropland that are largely homogeneous.

TI  - Geodetic constraints of the 2015 M<sub>w</sub>6.5 Alor, East Indonesia earthquake: a strike-slip faulting in the convergent boundary
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - On 2015 November 4, an M-w 6.5 earthquake struck the east region of Alor Island, eastern Indonesia. Here, we use Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data to explore the coseismic surface displacement of this earthquake. Based on the ALOS-2 coseismic interferograms, the first fault model and coseismic slip distribution of the 2015 Alor earthquake are presented in this study. The preferred slip model links to a blind south-southeast striking, south-southwest dipping strike-slip fault with amount of normal slip component and a peak slip of 2.09 m at 2.34 km of depth. Considering the fact that the ascending and descending InSAR prediction of the distributed slip model does not fit the InSAR observations at the northwest and southeast tips with the simple planar fault model. We tried to construct a strike-variable fault model to further improve data fit. The results of the calculated Coulomb stress change imply that the regions with positive CFS changes mainly located at the northwest and southeast extremities of the rupture of the Alor earthquake, and in the lobes north and south of the rupture. The most striking discovery from the InSAR observations of the Alor earthquake is that most of the displacements occurred on a fault whose existence was unknown before the earthquake.

TI  - An analysis of aerosol properties during a dust storm due to the TAUKTAE cyclone using remote sensing
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Millions of people suffer from health problems due to poor air quality in regions of high particulate pollution. Therefore, this paper proposes for better understanding of the impact of dust storms on both short- and long-term environmental factors that can help in a preferable formulation of warning and prediction scenarios in arid regions. We evaluate the effect of dust storms on the optical properties of aerosols and meteorological parameters by employing both ground-based and satellite remote sensing approaches. For this, we use AERosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP), and Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) to retrieve aerosol optical properties from 15 May 2021 to 20 May 2021 over Karachi. At 550nm, the instantaneous maximum values of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are measured to be similar to 0.8, and 0.59 on 16 May 2021, and the lowest values of Angstrom Exponent (AE) are discovered to be similar to 0.2, and similar to 0.26 by Aqua-MODIS and AERONET respectively. Such observations are attributed to dust aerosols over Karachi; these values are more than those that might be expected on an ordinary day. We also found S5P and OMI retrieved ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) of about 1 and similar to 1.9 on 17 May 2021 respectively which indicate the presence of absorbing (dust) aerosols. Subtypes of aerosols derived by CALIPSO with vertical profile taken on 17 May 2021 segregate the widespread aerosol burden as contaminated dust particles over surrounding regions of Karachi (24.48-30.59 degrees N, 69.01-70.56 degrees E).

TI  - Can norms bridge boundaries? Systems theory's challenge to eco-theology and Earth system law
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The following article was written to honour Johan Buitendag's contribution to the discipline of eco-theology. Assuming an interdisciplinary stance, eco-theology in general and his work, in particular, is observed from the position of legal theory and sociology. As such, eco-theology is not assessed on theological grounds but is treated interdisciplinary through comparison with environmental law. More specifically, the project of eco-theology is shown to share certain characteristics with the nascent subdiscipline of Earth systems law within environmental law. It is argued that one of the most important of these is the use of norms as an ecological strategy. This is understandable as both the religious and legal systems rely on the norm form to a lesser or greater extent. However, in the legal sociology of systems theory, the shortcomings of norms have been eloquently argued. This article thus posits the limits of norms to eco-theology and Earth systems law as a challenge deserving attention. However, social systems theory has its shortcomings, and a preliminary line of flight away from this challenge is suggested in the shape of Agamben's description of the monastic form-of-life, where life and norm overlap so intensely that suggestions of a new worldview gain plausibility.Contribution: This article argues for the similarity in theology and law's respective strategies for combatting climate change, most importantly, that both employ a normative form. It points out that norms have crucial shortcomings but suggests that they might be overcome through reinterpretations of normativity.

TI  - Changes in Carbon Dioxide Balance Associated with Land Use and Land Cover in Brazilian Legal Amazon Based on Remotely Sensed Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon region comprises the largest tropical forest on the planet and is responsible for absorbing huge amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere. However, changes in land use and cover have contributed to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, especially CO2, and in endangered indigenous lands and protected areas in the region. The objective of this study was to detect changes in CO2 emissions and removals associated with land use and land cover changes in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA) through the analysis of multispectral satellite images from 2009 to 2019. The Gross Primary Production (GPP) and CO(2)Flux variables were estimated by the MODIS sensor onboard Terra and Aqua satellite, representing carbon absorption by vegetation during the photosynthesis process. Atmospheric CO2 concentration was estimated from the GOSAT satellite. The variables GPP and CO(2)Flux showed the effective flux of carbon in the BLA to atmosphere, which were weakly correlated with precipitation (r = 0.191 and 0.133). The forest absorbed 211.05 TgC annually but, due to its partial conversion to other land uses, the loss of 135,922.34 km(2) of forest area resulted in 5.82 TgC less carbon being absorbed. Pasture and agriculture, which comprise the main land conversions, increased by 100,340.39 km(2) and absorbed 1.32 and 3.19 TgC less, and emitted close to twice more, than forest in these areas. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations increased from 2.2 to 2.8 ppm annually in BLA, with hotspots observed in the southeast Amazonia, and CO2 capture by GPP showed an increase over the years, mainly after 2013, in the north and west of the BLA. This study brings to light the carbon dynamics, by GPP and CO(2)Flux models, as related to the land use and land cover in one of the biggest world carbon reservoirs, the Amazon, which is also important to fulfillment of international agreements signed by Brazil to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services in the region.

TI  - Industry, occupation, and exposure history of mesothelioma patients in the US National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank, 2006-2022
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malignant mesothelioma is associated with environmental and occupational exposure to certain mineral fibers, especially asbestos. This study aims to examine work histories of mesothelioma patients and their survival time. Method: Using the NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System, we mapped occupations and industries recorded for 748 of 1444 patients in the U.S. National Mesothelioma Virtual Bank (NMVB) during the period 2006-2022. Descriptive and survival analyses were conducted. Results: Among the 1023 industries recorded for those having mesothelioma, the most frequent cases were found for those in manufacturing (n = 225, 22.0%), construction (138, 13.5%), and education services (66, 6.5%); among the 924 occupation records, the most frequent cases were found for those in construction and extraction (174, 18.8%), production (145, 15.7%), and management (84, 9.1%). Males (583) or persons aged >40 years (658) at the time of diagnosis tended to have worked in industries traditionally associated with mesothelioma (e. g., construction), while females (163) or persons aged 20-40 years (27) tended to have worked in industries not traditionally associated with mesothelioma (e.g., health care). Asbestos, unknown substances, and chemical solvents were the most frequently reported exposure, with females most often reporting an unknown substance. A multi-variable Cox Hazard Regression analysis showed that significant prognostic factors associated with decreased survival in mesothelioma cases are sex (male) and work experience in utility-related industry, while factor associated with increased survival are epithelial or epithelioid histological type, prior history of surgery and immunotherapy, and industry experience in accommodation and food services. Conclusion: The NMVB has the potential of serving as a sentinel surveillance mechanism for identifying industries and occupations not traditionally associated with mesothelioma. Results indicate the importance of considering all potential sources of asbestos exposures including occupational, environmental, and extra-occupational ex-posures when evaluating mesothelioma patients and advising family members.

TI  - Assessment of severe aerosol events from NASA MODIS and VIIRS aerosolproducts for data assimilation and climate continuity
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - While the use and data assimilation (DA) of operational Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol data is commonplace, MODIS is scheduled to sunset in the next year. For data continuity, focus has turned to the development of next-generation aerosol products and sensors such as those associated with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on Suomi NPOESS Preparation Project (S-NPP) and NOAA-20. Like MODIS algorithms, products from these sensors require their own set of extensive error characterization and correction exercises. This is particularly true in the context of monitoring significant aerosol events that tax an algorithm's ability to separate cloud from aerosol and account for multiple scattering related errors exacerbated by uncertainties in aerosol optical properties. To investigate the performance of polar-orbiting satellite algorithms to monitor and characterize significant events, a level 3 (L3) product has been developed using a consistent aggregation methodology for 4 years of observations (2016-2019) that is referred to as the SSEC/NRL L3 product. Included in this product are the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET), MODIS Dark Target, Deep Blue, and Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithms. These MODIS "baseline algorithms" are compared to NASA's recently released NASA Deep Blue algorithm for use with VIIRS. Using this new dataset, the relative performance of the algorithms for both land and ocean were investigated with a focus on the relative skill of detecting severe events and accuracy of the retrievals using AERONET. Maps of higher-percentile aerosol optical depth (AOD) regions of the world by product identified those with the highest measured AODs and determined what is high by local standards. While patterns in AOD match across products and median to moderate AOD values match well, there are regionally correlated biases between products based on sampling, algorithm differences, and AOD range - in particular for higher AOD events. Most notable are differences in boreal biomass burning and Saharan dust. Significant percentile biases must be accounted for when data are used in trend studies, data assimilation, or inverse modeling. These biases vary by aerosol regime and are likely due to retrieval assumptions in lower boundary conditions and aerosol optical models.

TI  - Does the fundamental host range of <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> match its realized host range in Europe?
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Unintentional introduction of natural enemies has increased in recent years due to a massive rise in global trade and tourism. One such natural enemy is the Asian egg parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus, a promising agent for classical biological control of Halyomorpha halys. In Europe, adventive T. japonicus populations have been detected in Switzerland, Italy and Germany. Host specificity testing demonstrated that its fundamental host range is fairly broad; however, it is unclear whether spatial or temporal refuges reduce parasitism of non-target species in the field. To address this, the realized host range of T. japonicus was assessed over three years by exposing sentinel egg masses of H. halys and 18 non-target species and collecting naturally laid egg masses in Switzerland and Italy. In total, 15 of 18 non-target species were successfully parasitized by T. japonicus in the field, confirming its broad fundamental host range. However, most non-target species were less parasitized by T. japonicus than H. halys, profiting from either partial temporal or spatial refuges from parasitism. Species with an unusual life cycle and the same ecological niche as H. halys, such as Pentatoma rufipes, which was the most parasitized non-target species in both countries, potentially face an increased risk of parasitism. In contrast, beneficial non-target effects may occur for the invasive pest, Nezara viridula, which suffered high non-reproductive mortality induced by T. japonicus. In both cases, life table studies will be needed to determine the impact of non-target parasitism and the potential consequences at the population level.

M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of global 3D urban expansion over time is becoming increasingly crucial for achieving long-term development goals. In this study, we generated a global dataset of annual urban 3D expansion (1990-2010) using World Settlement Footprint 2015 data, GAIA data, and ALOS AW3D30 data with a three-step technical framework: (1) extracting the global constructed land to generate the research area, (2) neighborhood analysis to calculate the original normalized DSM and slope height of each pixel in the study area, and (3) slope correction for areas with a slope greater than 10 degrees to improve the accuracy of estimated building heights. The cross-validation results indicate that our dataset is reliable in the United States(R-2 = 0.821), Europe(R-2 = 0.863), China(R-2 = 0.796), and across the world(R-2 = 0.811). As we know, this is the first 30-meter 3D urban expansion dataset across the globe, which can give unique information to understand and address the implications of urbanization on food security, biodiversity, climate change, and public well-being and health.

TI  - Modelling Green Volume Using Sentinel-1,-2, PALSAR-2 Satellite Data and Machine Learning for Urban and Semi-Urban Areas in Germany
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Green Infrastructure (UGI) provides ecosystem services such as cooling of temperatures and is majorly important for climate change adaptation. Green Volume (GV) describes the 3-D space occupied by vegetation and is highly useful for the assessment of UGI. This research uses Sentinel-2 (S-2) optical data, vegetation indices (VIs), Sentinel-1 (S-1) and PALSAR-2 (P-2) radar data to build machine learning models for yearly GV estimation on large scales. Our study compares random and stratified sampling of reference data, assesses the performance of different machine learning algorithms and tests model transferability by independent validation. The results indicate that stratified sampling of training data leads to improved accuracies when compared to random sampling. While the Gradient Tree Boost (GTB) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms show generally similar performance, Support Vector Machine (SVM) exhibits considerably greater model error. The results suggest RF to be the most robust classifier overall, achieving highest accuracies for independent and inter-annual validation. Furthermore, modelling GV based on S-2 features considerably outperforms using only S-1 or P-2 based features. Moreover, the study finds that underestimation of large GV magnitudes in urban forests constitutes the biggest source of model error. Overall, modelled GV explains around 79% of the variability in reference GV at 10 m resolution and over 90% when aggregated to 100 m resolution. The research shows that accurately modelling GV is possible using openly available satellite data. Resulting GV predictions can be useful for environmental management by providing valuable information for climate change adaptation, environmental monitoring and change detection.

TI  - Analysis of the 20-Year Variability of Ocean Wave Hazards in the Northwest Pacific
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Northwest Pacific (NWP), where a unique monsoon climate exists and where both typhoons and extratropical storms occur frequently, hazardous waves pose a significant risk to maritime safety. To analyze the 20-year variability of hazardous waves in this region, this study utilized hourly reanalysis data from the ECMWF ERA5 dataset covering the period from 2001-2020, alongside the wave risk assessment method. The ERA5 data exhibits better consistency, in both the temporal and spatial dimensions, than satellite data. Although hazardous wind seas occur more frequently than hazardous swells, swells make hazardous waves travel further. Notably, the extreme wave height (EWH) shows an increasing trend in high- and low-latitude areas of the NWP. The change in meridional wind speeds is the primary reason for the change in the total wind speed in the NWP. Notably, the maximum annual increase rate of 0.013 m/year for EWH exists in the region of the Japanese Archipelago. This study elucidated the distributions of wave height intensity and wave risk levels, noting that the EWHs of the 50-year and 100-year return periods can reach 20.92 m and 23.07 m, respectively.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need to apply geospatial artificial intelligence analysis to disparate environmental datasets to find solutions that benefit frontline communities. One such critically needed solution is the prediction of healthrelevant ambient ground-level air pollution concentrations. However, many challenges exist surrounding the size and representativeness of limited ground reference stations for model development, reconciling multi-source data, and interpretability of deep learning models. This research addresses these challenges by leveraging a strategically deployed, extensive low-cost sensor (LCS) network that was rigorously calibrated through an optimized neural network. A set of raster predictors with varying data quality and spatial scales was retrieved and processed, including gap-filled satellite aerosol optical depth products and airborne LiDAR-derived 3D urban form. We developed a multi-scale, attention-enhanced convolutional neural network model to reconcile the LCS measurements and multi-source predictors for estimating daily PM2.5 concentration at 30-m resolution. This model employs an advanced approach by using the geostatistical kriging method to generate a baseline pollution pattern and a multi-scale residual method to identify both regional patterns and localized events for highfrequency feature retention. We further used permutation tests to quantify the feature importance, which has rarely been done in DL applications in environmental science. Finally, we demonstrated one application of the model by investigating the air pollution inequality issue across and within various urbanization levels at the block group scale. Overall, this research demonstrates the potential of geospatial AI analysis to provide actionable solutions for addressing critical environmental issues.

TI  - Generation of High Temporal Resolution Full-Coverage Aerosol Optical Depth Based on Remote Sensing and Reanalysis Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a crucial physical parameter used to measure the radiative and scattering properties of the atmosphere. Obtaining full-coverage AOD measurements is essential for a thorough understanding of its impact on climate and air quality. However, satellite-based AOD products can be affected by abnormal weather conditions and high reflectance surfaces, leading to gaps in spatial coverage. To address this issue, we propose a satellite-based AOD filling method based on hourly level-3 Himawari-8 AOD products. In this study, the optimal model with a mean bias error (MBE) less than 0.01 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) less than 0.1 in most land cover types was selected to generate the full-coverage AOD. The generated full-coverage AOD was validated against in situ measurements from the AERONET sites and compared with the performance of Himawari-8 AOD and MERRA-2 AOD over the AERONET sites. The validation results indicate that the accuracy of full-coverage AOD is comparable to that of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) AOD, and for other land cover types (excluding barren land), the accuracy of full-coverage AOD is superior to that of MERRA-2 AOD. To investigate the practical application of full-coverage AOD, we utilized it as an input parameter to perform radiative transfer simulations in northwestern and southern China. The validation results showed that the simulated at-sensor radiance based on full-coverage AOD was in good agreement with the at-sensor radiance observations from MODIS. These results indicate that complete and accurate measurements of AOD have considerable potential for application in the simulation of at-sensor radiance and other related topics.

TI  - Spiritual warfare in Africa: Towards understanding the classical model in light of witchcraft practices and the Christian response
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The socio-religious panorama of the African religion deserves a close observation of its foundation and function. The perception of the spirit world is dominant in Africa. Similarly, spiritual warfare in the African context is prevalent in the mind and worldview of an African. Spiritual warfare derives its framework from African Traditional Religion (ATR). Hence, understanding ATR's complexity helps us with the understanding of spiritual warfare. Some essential questions to understand would be what is spiritual warfare from an ATR perspective? How do Africans perceive spiritual warfare? And how do Africans engage in spiritual warfare? What is the place of ATR in spiritual warfare? African Traditional Religion acknowledges the reality and functionality of witchcraft. The perception of the reality of evil forces in Africa attracts all forms of spiritual rites, seeking more extraordinary spiritual powers for defensive and offensive spiritual warfare. This article argues that the effectual Christian response to spiritual warfare with witchcraft practices in Africa is 'the classical model' of spiritual warfare. The article provides a synopsis of the models of spiritual warfare, that is, the classical model (CW), world systems model (WSM), ground-level deliverance model (GLDM), and strategic-level deliverance model (SLSW). Subsequently, the article provides the framework for African spiritual warfare and witchcraft practices from traditional and contemporary perspectives. Lastly, the article argues that the Evangelical Christian Response to witchcraft practices is rooted in 'the classical model' of spiritual warfare. Contribution: The article contributes to African religiosity within the African context. It reveals the ongoing argument about the continuity and discontinuity of the ATR beliefs and practices in Christianity. The article adds to the evangelical or classical arguments in support of the discontinuity of ATR beliefs and practices in Christianity.

TI  - Reconstruction and Visualization of Landslide Events Based on Pre- and Post-Disaster Remote Sensing Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a method to reconstruct and visualize landslide events based on pre- and post-disaster remote sensing data. The proposed method establishes the dynamic equations of the landslide evolution process and calibrates the model parameters based on pre- and post-disaster remote sensing data. Based on the calibrated dynamic equations, we reconstruct and simulate the historical landslide process and visualize the landslide evolution. The experimental results show that our method could dynamically and realistically reconstruct and visualize the landslide evolution process. Moreover, the landslide process simulation can also detect the maximum depth, maximum sliding speed, maximum momentum, and other indicators during the evolution process, and the visualization results can be used for subsequent hazard assessment, engineering implementation, and other applications.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Changes of Abarkuh Playa Landform from Sentinel-1 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Playas, as the flattest landforms in semiarid and arid regions, are extremely sensitive to climate changes, such as changes in the hydrologic regime of the landscape. The changes in these landforms due to irrigation, anthropogenic activities, and climate change could be a source of disasters. In this study, we explored the spatial-temporal changes of the Abarkuh Playa in Central Iran using the time series of the Sentinel-1 backscatter dataset in the three scales. Our results showed that the western area of the Abarkuh Playa has been changed to other landforms with different characteristics, which is clear from all backscatter maps. The spatial-temporal analysis of the time series of backscatter data using the independent component analysis and time series of precipitation revealed that the backscatter variations were associated with direct rainfall across the playa and the surface was reacting to changes in the soil moisture content. The results of the power scale showed that the boundary of the playa could successfully be recognized as the oscillating pattern from other landforms in the study area. Moreover, the spatial-temporal analysis of backscatter in the power scale showed that different polarizations could reveal different patterns of surface changes for the playa.

TI  - Estimation of agricultural burned affected area using NDVI and dNBR satellite-based empirical models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major crucial issues that need worldwide attention is open stubble burning, which imposes a variety of adverse impacts on nature and human society, destroying the world's biodiversity. Many earth observation satellites render information to monitor and assess agricultural burning activities. In this study, different remotely sensed data (Sentinel-2A, VIIRS) has been employed to estimate the quantitative measurements of agricultural burned areas of the Purba Bardhaman district from October-December 2018. The multi-temporal image differencing techniques and indices (NDVI, NBR, and dNBR) and VIIRS active fires data (VNP14IMGT) have been utilized to spot agricultural burned areas. In the case of the NDVI technique, a prominent area, 184.82 km2 of agricultural burned area (7.85% of the total agriculture), was observed. The highest (23.04 km2) burned area was observed in the Bhatar block, located in the middle part of the district, and the lowest (0.11 km2) burned area was observed in the Purbasthali-II block, which is located in the eastern part of the district. On the other hand, the dNBR technique revealed that the agricultural burned areas enwrap 8.18% of the total agricultural area, which is 192.45 km2. As per the earlier NDVI technique, the highest agricultural burned areas (24.82 km2) were observed in the Bhatar block, and the lowest (0.13 km2) burn area occurred in the Purbashthali-II block. In both cases, it is observed that agricultural residue burning is high in the western part of the Satgachia block and the adjacent areas of the Bhatar block, which is in the middle part of Purba Bardhaman. The agricultural burned area was extracted using different spectral separability analyses, and the performance of dNBR was the most effective in spectral discrimination of burned and unburned surfaces. This study manifested that agricultural residue burning started in the central part of Purba Bardhaman. Later it spread all over the district due to the trend of early harvesting rice crops in this region. The performance of different indices for mapping the burned areas was evaluated and compared, revealing a strong correlation (R2) = 0.98. To estimate the campaign's effectiveness against the dangerous practice and plan the control of the menace, regular monitoring of crop stubble burning using satellite data is required.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - The present study aimed to develop a methodology to estimate jute (Corchorus sp.) cultivated areas in the Indian subcontinent using sentinel-1A Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) C band dual polarization data. We developed a hierarchical decision tree (DT) model to estimate jute area and compared it with other supervised and unsupervised methods. The proposed DT model showed improved overall accuracy of 82-83% (Kappa coefficient, k = 0.78-0.79) over supervised or unsupervised methods and validated against Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) data, Government of India during 2016-2019. The VV backscatter record improved accuracy over VH backscatter.

TI  - Satellite-Based Light Use Efficiency Model for Sugarcane Yield Estimation at Field Scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sugarcane is a major cash crop grown in India. Several empirical, semi-empirical and mechanistic models have been used to compute and predict sugarcane yield using satellite data. Reliable data predictions are necessary for important decision-making situations. This study attempted a semi-empirical Light Use Efficiency (LUE) model to compute the field-level sugarcane yield for a mill catchment in Uttar Pradesh, India. The phenology parameters, Start of Season and End of Season, for each field were derived by fitting the Sentinel-1 VH backscatter data using the Savitzky-Golay filter. Later these fields were grouped into four classes based on their key phenology parameters. Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) was computed from INSAT- 3D data and calibrated based on the ground information. The fraction of absorbed PAR was computed using Sentinel-2 images and ground truth Leaf Area Index observations. The model was limited to using temperature and water stress factors. Water stress was computed using the Land Surface Water Index from Sentinel-2. ERA5's 2 m temperature data were used to compute the stress caused by temperature. LUE and Harvest index were used as constants. The study yielded very satisfying results. The observed and predicted data had an agreement index of 0.91 and a Root Mean Square Error of 46.6 q/ha. The results improved substantially after the calibration of the INSAT-3D insolation. This study overcomes the limitation of varying planting and harvesting dates which are usually not accounted for in LUE-based yield estimation.

TI  - An uncanny dialogue: Lev Shestov's philosophy as the 'great art' of not seeing and Sigmund Freud's psychoanalytic investigations of the unconscious mind
T2  - JOURNAL OF EUROPEAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Having become known as one of the most influential thinkers of the twentieth century, Lev Shestov (1866-1938) advanced his pioneering ideas in parallel to Freud's development of psychoanalysis. Originating in his earlier works, his views of philosophy as art and the corresponding idea of the possibility of a fundamental, inner and creative transformation of one's worldview found its further expression in his mature writings, in which his insight into the nature of other thinkers' creativity took on a definitively active role in his philosophy. With the focus on the notion of the transformative capability of thought in Shestov's writing and based on my archival research and translations, in this article, I explore the Kyiv-born philosopher's ideas in dialogue with Freud's psychoanalytical theory and in the context of the postmodern view of reality as a symbolical and multifaceted representation.

T2  - CURRENT SURGERY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of ReviewThis review critically examines the best evidence-based management for the clinically N0 (cN0) neck in oral squamous cell carcinoma.Recent FindingsThere is much controversy regarding the management of the cN0 neck with three main treatment paths being advocated. These are the excision of the primary oral cancer with close observation of the neck, excision of the primary combined with elective neck dissection, and the use of sentinel node biopsy. Recent studies suggest that patients with primary cancers who have undiagnosed occult nodal metastases benefit from elective supraomohyoid neck dissection. Depth of invasion of the primary and T stage defines high-risk patients for nodal disease. The use of adjuvant therapy is dictated by surgical histopathology.Elective supra-omohyoid neck dissection is currently indicated if the risk of occult neck nodes is > 20%. The role of sentinel node biopsy is still being defined.

TI  - No significant effect of mortality salience on unconscious ethnic bias among the Japanese
T2  - BMC RESEARCH NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveTerror management theory posits that when mortality is salient, individuals attempt to defend their cultural worldviews. Although numerous studies have confirmed this hypothesis, some recent studies have suggested that East Asians do not engage in worldview defense. We conducted a pre-registered experiment with 895 Japanese adults to investigate whether they exhibited worldview defense at an unconscious level. Participants performed the Implicit Association Test using Japanese and Korean surnames as stimuli after being primed with thoughts about mortality.ResultsThe results revealed that mortality salience had no influence on implicit ethnic bias. These findings support the notion that East Asians do not engage in worldview defense, in accord with recent criticism of the validity of terror management theory. We discuss the limitations and implications of our findings.

TI  - Range-wide population assessments for subalpine fir indicate widespread disturbance-driven decline
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Subalpine forests in western North America are threatened by rapid climate change, increased activity by endemic and exotic insects and diseases, and changing wildfire regimes. The interactive effects of these stressors have resulted in pronounced population declines in many subalpine tree species; however, a systematic assessment of the status and trends of subalpine forests is lacking. Subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) is a widespread species across the western United States, with documented population declines in many parts of its distribution. Here we use subalpine fir as an initial leverage point to build a more complete understanding of subalpine forest baseline conditions and responses to environmental change. Specifically, we leverage the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database to (1) ask how subalpine fir populations are changing across the species' distribution in the western US, (2) assess the drivers of recent subalpine fir population trends, and (3) explore whether those changes imply generalized species-wide and/or system-wide decline. We found that subalpine fir abundance and basal area are declining concurrently across - 62% of the species' distribution, and increasing across - 19%. Range-wide, we estimated 25.02 & PLUSMN; 2.74 % subalpine fir mortality between 2000 and 2009 and 2010-2019 FIA inventory periods, with higher mortality concentrated in the eastern Oregon Cascades, central Idaho, and parts of southern Colorado. High regeneration density did not predict positive population trajectories, which were instead associated with higher rates of adult recruitment. While the importance of different mortality agents varied substantially between ecoregions, 83.4% of total range-wide mortality was related to fire or biological disturbance. Declining subalpine fir basal area coincided with declines in the basal area of other co-occurring tree species in 39% of subalpine forest area, and with increases in conspecific basal area in 22% of forest area. Fire disturbance was the single largest cause of subalpine fir mortality; however, even where subalpine fir fire mortality was high, mortality among other species was primarily caused by insects. Our results suggest that subalpine fir declines across large portions of the western United States are driven by forest disturbance, and that declines in subalpine fir populations may be indicative of negative change in subalpine forest systems broadly.

TI  - An updated review of diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura-A sentinel health event of potential elongate mineral particle pathogenicity
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - There are approximately 400 inorganic minerals in the Earth's crust, some of which can be encountered as elongate mineral particles [EMPs] with dimensional characteristics similar to the six minerals known as asbestos and other asbestiform amphiboles with established human pathogenicity. In addition, the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology is producing an ever-increasing array of high aspect ratio engineered nanomaterials [HARNs] with physical dimensions and biodurability similar to the asbestos fiber types with recognized path-ogenic potential. Many of these non-asbestos/non-asbestiform EMPs and HARNs with the potential for aero-solization into the breathing zones of workers and in individuals in non-occupational environments have not yet been thoroughly studied with respect to their potential human pathogenicity, a fact which obviously poses concerns for both occupational health and public health professionals. On the basis of dose-response consider-ations it seems reasonable to infer that if any of these non-regulated EMPs or HARNs actually are pathogenic, then those mineral fiber exposure-induced disorders associated with the lowest cumulative exposure doses of the commercial amphibole types of asbestos, that is, diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura, and its non-malignant correlate of benign parietal pleural plaques, are those which are most likely to occur following inhalational exposures to any of the non-regulated EMPs and HARNs. Because of that observation, this paper reviews certain aspects of diffuse mesothelioma, including a summary of recent changes in the nomenclature of diffuse meso-thelioma of the pleura; of both the descriptive and the analytical epidemiology of the disease; of the etiologies of mesothelioma, both "exposure" related and endogenous in nature; and of the asbestos population attributable fraction for diffuse mesotheliomas in the USA, both historically and in the future.

TI  - An Automatic Method for Rice Mapping Based on Phenological Features with Sentinel-1 Time-Series Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world, feeding more than 50% of the global population. However, rice is also a significant emitter of greenhouse gases and plays a role in global climate change. As a result, quickly and accurately obtaining the rice mapping is crucial for ensuring global food security and mitigating global warming. In this study, we proposed an automated rice mapping method called automated rice mapping using V-shaped phenological features of rice (Auto-RMVPF) based on the time-series Sentinel-1A images, which are composed of four main steps. First, the dynamic threshold method automatically extracts abundant rice samples by flooding signals. Second, the second-order difference method automatically extracts the phenological period of rice based on the scattering feature of rice samples. Then, the key "V" feature of the VH backscatter time series, which rises before and after rice transplanting due to flooding, is used for rice mapping. Finally, the farmland mask is extracted to avoid interference from non-farmland features on the rice map, and the median filter is applied to remove noise from the rice map and obtain the final spatial distribution of rice. The results show that the Auto-RMVPF method not only can automatically obtain abundant rice samples but also can extract the accurate phenological period of rice. At the same time, the accuracy of rice mapping is also satisfactory, with an overall accuracy is more than 95% and an F(1 )score of over 0.91. The overall accuracy of the Auto-RMVPF method is improved by 2.8-12.2% compared with support vector machine (SVM) with an overall accuracy of 89.9% (25 training samples) and 92.2% (124 training samples), random forest (RF) with an overall accuracy of 82.8% (25 training samples) and 88.3% (124 training samples), and automated rice mapping using synthetic aperture radar flooding signals (ARM-SARFS) with an overall accuracy of 89.9%. Altogether, these experimental results suggest that the Auto-RMVPF method has broad prospects for automatic rice mapping, especially for mountainous regions where ground samples are often not easily accessible.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - IntroductionPrimary vaginal melanoma is extremely rare, has a poor prognosis, and occurs mostly in elderly women. The diagnosis is based on histology and immunohistochemistry of a biopsy. Given the rarity of vaginal melanoma, no standardized treatment guidelines are established; however, surgery is the primary treatment modality in the absence of metastatic disease. Most reports in the literature are retrospective single cases, case series, and population-based studies. The open surgical approach is the main modality reported. Here, we report for the first time a 10-step combined robotic-vaginal technique, with en bloc resection of the uterus and total vagina, for treating clinically early-stage primary vaginal melanoma. In addition, the patient in our case underwent a robotic pelvic bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection. The literature on the surgical approach for vaginal melanoma is reviewed. Case presentationA 73-year-old woman was referred to our tertiary cancer center and was clinically staged according to the 2009 International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging for vaginal cancer as FIGO-stage I (cT1bN0M0) and according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for (cutaneous) Melanoma Staging as clinical stage IB. Preoperative imaging with magnetic resonance imaging, FDG-positron emission tomography-computed tomography, and ultrasound of the groins did not reveal any adenopathy nor metastases. The patient was planned for a combined vaginal and robotic en bloc total vaginectomy and hysterectomy, as well as a pelvic bilateral sentinel lymph node dissection. ResultsThe surgical procedure was performed in 10 steps described in this case report. The pathology revealed free surgical margins and negative test results for all sentinel lymph nodes. The postoperative recovery process was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on day 5. ConclusionThe main surgical approach reported for primary early-stage vaginal melanoma is open surgery. A minimally invasive surgical approach, described here as a combined vaginal-robotic en bloc total vaginectomy and hysterectomy, for the surgical treatment of early-stage vaginal melanoma enables precise dissection, low surgical morbidity, and fast recovery for the patient.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variation in Water Coverage in the Sub-Lakes of Poyang Lake Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest freshwater lake in China, Poyang Lake is an internationally important wetland and the largest migratory bird habitat in Asia. Many sub-lakes distributed in the lake basin are seasonal lakes, which have a significant impact on hydro-ecological processes and are susceptible to various changes. In this study, using multi-source remote sensing data, a continuous time-series construction method of water coverage suitable in Poyang Lake was developed. That method combined the downscaling of the MNDWI (modified normalized difference water index) with the ISODATA (iterative self-organizing data analysis technique algorithm), and its accuracy can be up to 97% in the months when Landsat 8 is available or 87% when it is unavailable. Based on that method, the increasing variation in water coverage was observed in the sub-lakes of Poyang Lake during 2013-2020 to be within a range of 200-690 km(2) normally. The center of the sub-lakes always remained inundated (>80% inundation frequency), while the surrounding areas were probably kept dry for seven months (except for June to September). The dominant influencing factors of water coverage variations were different in different hydrological periods (wet season and dry-wet season: discharge; dry season: temperature and wind speed; wet-dry season: temperature and precipitation). In addition, "returning farmland to lakes" affected the increase in the water area in the sub-lakes. This study is helpful for the management of water resources and the protection of migratory birds in the Poyang Lake region.

AB  - Street views, satellite imageries and remote sensing data have been integrated into a wide spectrum of topics in the social sciences. Computer vision methods not only help analysts and policymakers make better decisions and produce more effective solutions but they also enable models to achieve more precise predictions and greater interpretability. In this paper, we review the growing literature applying such methods to economic issues and the social sciences, in which social scientists employ deep learning approaches to utilise image data to retrieve additional information. Typically, image data produce better results than traditional approaches and can provide detailed results and helpful insights to improve society and people's well-being.

TI  - Comprehensive meteorological factors analysis and lag correlation study for cyanobacterial blooms in shallow plateau lake
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) are a growing concern for shallow plateau lakes, and numerous studies have investigated the relationship between CBs and meteorological factors. However, these studies have typically lacked comprehensive analyses and neglected the impact of lag effects. This study employed Landsat satellite imagery to extract CBs information from Xingyun Lake from 1990 to 2019 and conducted a lag correlation analysis between meteorological factors ranging from 1 to 30 days with a 1-day step and CBs. The result show that the Sunshine Duration displayed a negative correlation with CBs at an 8-day lag, but when Sunshine Duration was <6 h, it exhibited a positive relationship with CBs at a 1-day lag. And daytime precipitation had more substantial positive link with CBs than nighttime precipitation at a lag of 13 days. The aforementioned conclusions deepen our comprehension of the meteorological forces that drive cyanobacterial blooms in plateau lakes. Moreover, the maximum and minimum wind velocities were negatively and positively associated with CBs with lags of 20 and 29 days, respectively. In addition, relative humidity and atmospheric pressure were positively associated with cyanobacterial blooms 13-19 days and 3 days after their onset, respectively. The relationship between air temperature and cyanobacterial blooms in Xingyun Lake was weak. Our research emphasizes the significance of incorporating delayed effects and refined meteorological factors for accurate cyanobacterial bloom forecasting.

TI  - Current populations of Colobus vellerosus (Geoffory, 1834) & Cercopithecus lowei (Thomas, 1923) and land-use, land cover changes in Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary, Ghana
T2  - Journal of Threatened Taxa
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Research aim: This study evaluated the density of two primate species Colobus vellerosus and Cercopithecus lowei and the change in land-use types in Boabeng-Fiema Monkey Sanctuary in Ghana, from 2007 to 2019. Method: Total counts of individual monkeys were done in all six patches of forest in the Sanctuary in 2019. Using Landsat imagery, land-cover maps of the study area were examined to evaluate the change that has occurred over a nine-year period between 2010 and 2019. Results: A total of 602 individuals of C. vellerosus were counted in 34 groups (0.58 group/ha). Group locations were: 15 at Boabeng (0.12 groups/ha), five at Fiema (0.08 group/ha), three at Bomini (0.09 group/ha), four at Busuyna (0.13 group/ha), three at Bonte (0.06 group/ha), and four at Akrudwa (0.11 group/ha). C. lowei was only encountered at Boabeng and Fiema, with a total of 351 individuals distributed in 26 groups. In 2010, forest covered a land area of 1,540.08 ha, and it was estimated to have increased to 2,643.12 ha in 2019. Farmlands covered 5,069.07 ha in 2010, and in 2019 were estimated to cover 4,155.03 ha. Built-up areas in 2010 covered an area of 433.89 ha, and in 2019 had declined to 244.89 ha. Conclusion: The monkey populations have increased and spread to occupy all patches in the Monkey Sanctuary. On LULCC, 72% increase, 18% reduction, and 44% reduction in forest cover, farmland and built-up areas were observed respectively. Implications for conservation: There is a blend of traditional and conventional conservation efforts contributing to the increase in primate population, the occupancy of previously 'empty' forest patches and change in areas of land-use types.

TI  - Cerebral embolic protection during transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Insights from a consecutive series with the Sentinel cerebral protection device
T2  - CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundGrowing interest in neuroprotection in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has catalyzed the development of cerebral protection systems (CPS). ObjectivesReport insights from consecutive real-world patients undergoing TAVR with the Sentinel-CPS. MethodsPatients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR from April 2019 to May 2022 were enrolled in a prospective registry. The reason for unsuccessful Sentinel-CPS deployment and the amount of debris captured by the filters were prospectively recorded. ResultsThe Sentinal CPS was successfully deployed in 330 patients (85%, Group 1). Deployment was not attempted, unsuccessful or only partially successful in 59 patients (15%, Group 2), caused by anatomical factors such as tortuosity, heavy calcification or small dimensions of radial or brachial artery in 46, technical aspects such as puncture failure or dissection in 5 or use of right radial access for the pigtail in 6. Debris was captured in 98% of patients in Group 1. In 40%, the amount of debris was graded moderate or extensive. Predictors for moderate/extensive debris were moderate/severe aortic calcification (OR 1.50, CI 1.05-2.15, p = 0.03), pre- and postdilatation (OR 1.97, CI 1.02-3.79, p = 0.04 and OR 1.71, CI 1.01-2.89, p = 0.048). The risk of stroke was numerically lower in patients who underwent TAVR with the Sentinel CPS (2.1 vs. 5.1%, respectively, p = 0.15). There was no stroke during CPS deployment, but one patient had a stroke immediately after device retrieval. ConclusionsThe Sentinel-CPS was successfully deployed in 85% of patients. Predictors for moderate/extensive debris captured were moderate/severe aortic calcification, pre- and postdilatation.

TI  - Monitoring the Impact of Heat Damage on Summer Maize on the Huanghuaihai Plain, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important food crop, summer maize is widely planted all over the world. Monitoring its growth and output is of great significance for world food security. With the trend of global warming and deterioration, the frequency of high temperature and heat damage affecting summer corn has been increasing in the past ten years. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for monitoring the high temperature and heat damage of summer maize. At present, there are nearly a hundred indices or methods for research on high temperature and heat damage. However, research based on the vegetation index cannot fully describe the damage caused by high-temperature thermal damage, and there is an obvious asynchrony effect. Research based on hyperspectral remote sensing has many inconveniences in data acquisition and complex physical model construction. Therefore, this study uses remote sensing data, including MODIS surface reflection data, MODIS land surface temperature products, as well as ground observation data and statistical data, combined with multiple remote sensing indices and land surface temperature, to construct a remote sensing index, LSHDI (land surface heat damage index). The LSHDI first searches for a location with the worst vegetation growth conditions in the three-dimensional feature space based on the LST (land surface temperature), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the land surface water index (LSWI). Then, it calculates the distance between each point and this location to measure the degree of vegetation affected by high temperature and heat damage. Finally, because there is no reliable disaster verification dataset that has been published at present, this study uses soil moisture as a reference to explain the performance and stability of the LSHDI. The results showed that their coefficient of determination was above 0.5 and reached a significance level of 0.01. The LSHDI can well-reflect the high temperature and heat damage of land surface vegetation and can provide important data support and references for agricultural management departments.

TI  - Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval of China Using Multi-Source Data and Ensemble Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale surface soil moisture (SSM) distribution is very necessary for agricultural drought monitoring, water resource management, and climate change research. However, the current large-scale SSM products have relatively coarse spatial resolution, which limits their application. In this study, we estimate the 1 km daily SSM in China based on ensemble learning using a multi-source data set including in situ soil moisture measurements from 2980 meteorological stations, MODIS Surface Reflectance products, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) soil moisture products, ERA5-Land dataset, SRTM DEM and soil texture. Among them, in situ measurements are used as independent variables, and other data are used as dependent variables. In order to improve the spatio-temporal completeness of SSM, the missing value in SMAP soil moisture products were reconstructed using the Discrete Cosine Transformation-penalized Partial Least Square (DCT-PLS) method to provide spatially complete background field information for soil moisture retrieval. The results show that the reconstructed soil moisture value has high quality, and the DCT-PLS method can fully utilize the three-dimensional spatiotemporal information to fill the data gaps. Subsequently, the performance of four ensemble learning models of random forest (RF), extremely randomized trees (ERT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) for soil moisture retrieval was evaluated. The LightGBM outperformed the other three machine learning models, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.88, a bias of 0.0004 m(3)/m(3), and an unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.0366 m(3)/m(3). The high correlation between the in situ soil moisture and the predicted values at each meteorological station further indicate that LightGBM can well capture the temporal variation of soil moisture. Finally, the model was used to map the 1 km daily SSM in China on the first day of each month from May to October 2018. This study can provide some reference and help for future long-term daily 1 km surface soil moisture mapping in China.

TI  - Sensitivity studies of nighttime top-of-atmosphere radiances from artificial light sources using a 3-D radiative transfer model for nighttime aerosol retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - By accounting for surface-based light source emissions andtop-of-atmosphere (TOA) downward lunar fluxes, we adapted the sphericalharmonics discrete ordinate method (SHDOM) 3-dimensional (3-D) radiativetransfer model (RTM) to simulate nighttime 3-D TOA radiances as observedfrom the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band(DNB) on board the Suomi-NPP satellite platform. Used previously for daytime3-D applications, these new SHDOM enhancements allow for the study of theimpacts of various observing conditions and aerosol properties on simulatedVIIRS-DNB TOA radiances. Observations over Dakar, Senegal, selected for itsbright city lights and a large range of aerosol optical depth (AOD), wereinvestigated for potential applications and opportunities for using observed radiances containing VIIRS-DNB "bright pixels" from artificial light sources to conduct aerosol retrievals. We found that using the standard deviation (SD) of such bright pixels provided a more stable quantity for nighttime AOD retrievals than direct retrievals from TOA radiances. Further, both themean TOA radiance and SD of TOA radiances over artificial sources aresignificantly impacted by satellite viewing angles. Light domes, theenhanced radiances adjacent to artificial light sources, are strongfunctions of aerosol properties and especially aerosol vertical distribution, which may be further utilized for retrieving aerosol layerheight in future studies. Through inter-comparison with both day- andnighttime Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, the feasibility ofretrieving nighttime AODs using 3-D RTM SHDOM over artificial light sourceswas demonstrated. Our study shows strong potential for using artificiallight sources for nighttime AOD retrievals, while also highlighting largeruncertainties in quantifying surface light source emissions. This studyunderscores the need for surface light emission source characterizations asa key boundary condition, which is a complex task that requires enhancedinput data and further research. We demonstrate how quality-controllednighttime light data from the NASA's Black Marble product suite could serveas a primary input into estimations of surface light source emissions fornighttime aerosol retrievals.

TI  - Temporal upscaling of MODIS instantaneous FAPAR improves forest gross primary productivity (GPP) simulation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a measure of carbon uptake by terrestrial ecosystems for carbon neutrality and serves as a key indicator for the Sustainable Development Goals. The instantaneous Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) is applied in GPP estimation by light use efficiency (LUE) models. However, an obvious time scale mismatch exists between instantaneous FAPAR and daily accumulated GPP. In the study, we explored the potential of temporal upscaling instantaneous FAPAR in improving GPP simulation. The absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) derived from instantaneous and upscaled FAPARs were first compared. GPPs were estimated from instantaneous and upscaled FAPAR by MOD17 LUE model using default and optimized parameters. The optimized GPP was finally compared with three GPP products: GLASS, MOD17A2H and MYD17A2H GPP. The APARs and GPPs were evaluated with the Eddy Covariance (EC) GPP at 78 forest sites from the Fluxnet community. Results showed that when compared with EC GPP, the upscaled FAPAR-derived APAR held a higher R2 (0.26-0.73) than that from instantaneous FAPARs. The upscaled FAPARbased GPPs by MOD17 LUE model with default or optimized parameters had a larger R2 and smaller RMSE reducing uncertainties by 6.82-7.8% (maximum value: 27.9-49%). The optimized upscaled FAPAR-derived GPP was far superior to the GPP products with larger R2 (0.69-0.85) and smaller RMSE (12.8-14.6 g C/m2/8d). It is concluded that temporal upscaling of MODIS instantaneous FAPAR can well improve the estimation of forest GPP and the parameters of MOD17 LUE model should be further optimized. Our study is an effort toward reducing the uncertainties from FAPAR in the GPP estimation for better assessing the achievement of carbon neutrality and Sustainable Development Goals.

T2  - Journal of genetics and genomics = Yi chuan xue bao
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - With the rapid development of sequencing technologies, especially the maturity of third-generation sequencing technologies, there has been a significant increase in the number and quality of published genome assemblies. The emergence of these high-quality genomes has raised higher requirements for genome evaluation. Although numerous computational methods have been developed to evaluate assembly quality from various perspectives, the selective use of these evaluation methods can be arbitrary and inconvenient for fairly comparing the assembly quality. To address this issue, we have developed the Genome Assembly Evaluating Pipeline (GAEP), which provides a comprehensive assessment pipeline for evaluating genome quality from multiple perspectives, including continuity, completeness, and correctness. Additionally, GAEP includes new functions for detecting misassemblies and evaluating the assembly redundancy, which performs well in our testing. GAEP is publicly available at https://github.com/zy-optimistic/GAEP under the GPL3.0 License. With GAEP, users can quickly obtain accurate and reliable evaluation results, facilitating the comparison and selection of high-quality genome assemblies.

T2  - LOCAL GOVERNMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This study investigates the effects of receipt and anticipation of intergovernmental revenues on local governments draw on accumulated fiscal reserves to cushion the impacts of COVID-19-related fiscal stress. Several studies have been conducted on determinants of fiscal reserves accumulation. However, little is known about the determinants of government draw on fiscal reserves, beyond revenue shortfall, in times of fiscal stress. Dwelling on the premise that government's draw on fiscal reserves is influenced by factors beyond revenue shortfall and controlling for the effects of revenue shortfalls and other factors, we analysed local government survey data to determine the effects of intergovernmental revenue on government draw on fiscal reserves. Results show that draw on fiscal reserves is significantly constrained by percent of FY 2020 revenue received from federal and state governments, but significantly and positively inluenced by revenue losses and percent of FY 2021 revenue anticipated from federal government.

TI  - Characteristics and predictors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in young adults hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome: A retrospective cohort study of 30,000 patients in the Gulf region
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe characteristics of young adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has not been well described. The mean age of gulf citizens in ACS registries is 10-15 years younger than their western counterparts, which provided us with a unique opportunity to investigate the characteristics and predictors of OHCA in young adults presenting with ACS. MethodologyThis was a retrospective cohort study using data from 7 prospective ACS registries in the Gulf region. In brief, all registries included consecutive adults who were admitted with ACS. OHCA was defined as cardiac arrest upon presentation (i.e., before admission to the hospital). We described the characteristics of young adults (< 50 years) who had OHCA and performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess independent predictors of OHCA. ResultsA total of 31,620 ACS patients were included in the study. There were 611 (1.93%) OHCA cases in the whole cohort [188/10,848 (1.73%) in young adults vs 423/20,772 (2.04%) in older adults, p = 0.06]. Young adults were predominantly males presenting with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) [182/188 (96.8%) and 172/188 (91.49%), respectively]. OHCA was the sentinel event of coronary artery disease (CAD) in 70% of young adults. STEMI, male sex, and non-smoking status were found to be independent predictors of OHCA [OR = 5.862 (95% CI 2.623-13.096), OR: 4.515 (95% CI 1.085-18.786), and OR = 2.27 (95% CI 1.335-3.86), respectively]. ConclusionWe observed a lower prevalence of OHCA in ACS patients in our region as compared to previous literature from other regions. Moreover, OHCA was the sentinel event of CAD in the majority of young adults, who were predominantly males with STEMIs. These findings should help risk-stratify patients with ACS and inform further research into the characteristics of OHCA in young adults.

TI  - Widening the lens of population-based health research to climate change impacts and adaptation: the climate change and health evaluation and response system (CHEERS)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Climate change significantly impacts health in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), exacerbating vulnerabilities. Comprehensive data for evidence-based research and decision-making is crucial but scarce. Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSSs) in Africa and Asia provide a robust infrastructure with longitudinal population cohort data, yet they lack climate-health specific data. Acquiring this information is essential for understanding the burden of climate-sensitive diseases on populations and guiding targeted policies and interventions in LMICs to enhance mitigation and adaptation capacities.Objective: The objective of this research is to develop and implement the Change and Health Evaluation and Response System (CHEERS) as a methodological framework, designed to facilitate the generation and ongoing monitoring of climate change and health-related data within existing Health and Demographic Surveillance Sites (HDSSs) and comparable research infrastructures.Methods: CHEERS uses a multi-tiered approach to assess health and environmental exposures at the individual, household, and community levels, utilizing digital tools such as wearable devices, indoor temperature and humidity measurements, remotely sensed satellite data, and 3D-printed weather stations. The CHEERS framework utilizes a graph database to efficiently manage and analyze diverse data types, leveraging graph algorithms to understand the complex interplay between health and environmental exposures.Results: The Nouna CHEERS site, established in 2022, has yielded significant preliminary findings. By using remotely-sensed data, the site has been able to predict crop yield at a household level in Nouna and explore the relationships between yield, socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes. The feasibility and acceptability of wearable technology have been confirmed in rural Burkina Faso for obtaining individual-level data, despite the presence of technical challenges. The use of wearables to study the impact of extreme weather on health has shown significant effects of heat exposure on sleep and daily activity, highlighting the urgent need for interventions to mitigate adverse health consequences.Conclusion: Implementing the CHEERS in research infrastructures can advance climate change and health research, as large and longitudinal datasets have been scarce for LMICs. This data can inform health priorities, guide resource allocation to address climate change and health exposures, and protect vulnerable communities in LMICs from these exposures.

TI  - Ecopsychological Development and Maternal Ecodistress during Matrescence
T2  - ECOPSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The experience of matrescence, the developmental transition to motherhood, has not explicitly included the ecological domain, whereby mothers awaken to ecological concerns and question their ethical relationship to nature. Therefore, in this paper, we argue the need for a new framework known as maternal ecopsychology and its related ecotherapies to accelerate a mother's movement toward an enlarged ecoconsciousness as part and parcel of an already unfolding matrescence. We will also explore the ecopsychological underpinnings of maternal mental health disorders, such as Perinatal Mood and Anxiety Disorders, which have not previously been viewed from a nature-based perspective. First, we define ecoconsciousness and the ecological self to demonstrate how their development is necessary for humanity's ecological sustainability, especially for maternal health. We then outline how mothers have a unique opportunity to move from an anthropocentric to an ecocentric worldview through their matrescence and, in doing so, later reinterpret maternal psychopathology. We propose nature-based interventions such as those available to adolescents as alternative treatments for established maternal mental health symptoms, including but not limited to climate and environment-related concerns. Finally, we share general guidelines for ecotherapeutic practices with mothers to address the three primary conflicts that often arise in matrescence and to help mothers transition away from the limitations of anthropocentrism and toward a profound new interrelationship with nature instead.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping and tracking invasive alien plant species (IAPS) and their invasiveness can be achieved using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS). Continuous monitoring using RS, GIS and modelling are fundamental tools for informing invasion and management strategies. Using systematic comparisons, we look at three remote sensing imagery platforms and how accurately they can be classified within the Vhembe biosphere reserve, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Supervised classification of National Geospatial Information Colour Digital Aerial Imagery, DigitalGlobe Worldview 2 and CNES SPOT 6 was performed. The Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm was used to identify the best satellite for species-level classification. The accuracy of the classifications produced an overall accuracy (OA) of 71% with a Kappa coefficient (KC) of 0.76 for CDA photographs, an OA of 81% and a KC of 0.80 for Worldview 2, and an OA of 89% with a KC of 0.86 for SPOT 6 imagery. Therefore, SPOT 6 imagery came out as the most suitable for species-level classification. The classification results from the SPOT 6 imagery were used as input data for further species distribution modelling of Mauritius Thorn and River Red Gum in the VBR.

TI  - Time-series analysis of satellite imagery for detecting vegetation cover changes in Indonesia
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia has one of the world's largest tropical forests; thus, its deforestation and environmental degradation are a global concern. This study is the first to perform comprehensive big data analyses with coherent vegetation criteria to measure the vegetation change at a high temporal resolution (every 16-day period) for 20 years and the high administrative resolution (regency or city) all over Indonesia. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer is analyzed through state space modeling. The findings reveal that the NDVI increases in almost all regencies, except in urban areas. A high correlation between the NDVI change and the time is observed in Sumatra, Papua, and Kalimantan. The gain of the NDVI values is obvious in the Central and Eastern Java Island. Human activities, such as the expansion of agriculture and forestry and forest conservation policies, are the key factors for the observed pattern.

TI  - Training sample selection for robust multi-year within-season crop classification using machine learning
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Within-season crop classification using multispectral imagery is an effective way to generate timely crop maps that can support water and crop management; however, developing such models is challenging due to limited satellite imagery and ground truth data available during the season. This study investigated ways to optimize the use of multi-year samples in a within-season crop classification model, aiming to enable accurate within-season crop mapping across years. Our study focused on classifying field-scale corn/maize, cotton, and rice in south-eastern Australia from 2013 to 2019. The crop classification model was based on the random forest and sup-port vector machine algorithms applied to Landsat 8 multispectral bands. We designed four experiments to understand the influences of training sample selection on model accuracy. Specifically, we analyzed how the within-season classification accuracies are affected by 1) training sample size; 2) proportions of classification classes; 3) the inclusion of a non-crop class (e.g., fallow land) in the training sample, and 4) training samples collected from different years. We found that 1) the training sample size should be sufficiently large to ensure within-season classification accuracy; 2) using training samples for each crop type in proportion to their occurrence within the landscape results in more accurate multi-year classification; 3) the inclusion of the non -crop class can reduce the accuracy with which crop types are distinguished, so the proportion of the non-crop class should be maintained at a relatively low level, and 4) predicting the current year with training samples from previous years can lead to a minor decline in accuracy compared to using samples only from the current year. These training sample settings were adopted to develop a final model. We found that the model accuracy continues to improve as more input imagery is added as the cropping season progresses, with a rapid rate of initial improvement which then slows. December, the third month of the summer growing season, is the earliest time that reliable maps were generated, with an overall accuracy of 86 % and user's accuracies for all crops exceeding 80 %. Our proposed experiments are robust and transferable to other regions and seasons to assist the development of within-season crop maps, and can thus be valuable tools to support agricultural management.

TI  - Improvement of Monitoring Production Status of Iron and Steel Factories Based on Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote satellite (TIRS) images combined with high-resolution optical images in a time series can be used to analyze the production status of iron and steel factories (ISF) in China, which is more objective compared with statistical data. In previous studies, based on the land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved from Landsat-8 TIRS data, the heat island intensity index of an ISF (hereinafter referred to as ISHII) evaluates the LST difference between the main production area and other areas, and it can show the production status partly in one ISF. However, deviations in the LST due to seasonal changes can cause inaccuracies in the monitoring production status. In this study, we propose a modified method that introduces a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on regression (hereinafter referred to as STR) into the ISHII data to build a seasonal decomposition model. First, on the basis of a previously proposed time series of ISHII data from January 2013 to October 2017 for three ISF samples, the seasonal decomposition of the ISHII model was used to decompose the ISHII data into three components: trend, seasonality, and random. Then, we analyzed the relationships between these three components and the production status in the three ISFs. Additionally, to verify the precision of this method, we used high-resolution optical images to visually detect surface changes in the facilities at specific times. Finally, results showed that the trend curve can represent the entire factory development status, the seasonality curve shows the regular seasonal fluctuation, and the random component sensitively reflects the production status changes of one ISF. After decomposition, the capacity of a random component to reflect production changes has doubled or tripled compared to previous methods. In conclusion, this study provides a modified method with a seasonal decomposition model to improve prediction accuracy on the long-term production status of ISFs. Then, based on the change obtained from high-resolution optical images and Internet data on the ISF production status, we verified the accuracy of this modified method. This research will provide powerful supports for sustainable industrial development and policy decision-making in China.

TI  - Improving Radar Data Assimilation Forecast Using Advanced Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilating the proper amount of water vapor into a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model is essential in accurately forecasting a heavy rainfall. Radar data assimilation can effectively initialize the three-dimensional structure, intensity, and movement of precipitation fields to an NWP at a high resolution (+/- 250 m). However, the in-cloud water vapor amount estimated from radar reflectivity is empirical and assumes that the air is saturated when the reflectivity exceeds a certain threshold. Previous studies show that this assumption tends to overpredict the rainfall intensity in the early hours of the prediction. The purpose of this study is to reduce the initial value error associated with the amount of water vapor in radar reflectivity by introducing advanced remote sensing data. The ongoing research shows that errors can be largely solved by assimilating satellite all-sky radiances and global positioning system radio occultation (GPSRO) refractivity to enhance the moisture analysis during the cycling period. The impacts of assimilating moisture variables from satellite all-sky radiances and GPSRO refractivity in addition to hydrometeor variables from radar reflectivity generate proper amounts of moisture and hydrometeors at all levels of the initial state. Additionally, the assimilation of satellite atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) improves wind information and the atmospheric dynamics driving the moisture field which, in turn, increase the accuracy of the moisture convergence and fluxes at the core of the convection. As a result, the accuracy of the timing and intensity of a heavy rainfall prediction is improved, and the hourly and accumulated forecast errors are reduced.

TI  - Long-term spatio-temporal changes of wetlands in Tibetan Plateau and their response to climate change
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the changes of wetlands on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is important for action to ensure ecosystem resilience in Asia. However, mapping long-term changes of wetlands at high resolutions remains challenging. Here, we quantify the spatio-temporal changes of TP wetlands from 1990 to 2019, by combining Landsat imagery with deep learning to map TP wetlands. The deep learning model combined with transfer learning strategies achieves high classification performance using a few class samples. The validation results show that the user's accuracy is 95.5% and the producer's accuracy is 90.1% for wetland extraction, satisfying with subsequent analysis of wetland spatio-temporal changes. Based on the wetland extraction model, we have created annual wetland map in the TP for the first time. We find that the areal extent of TP wetlands has increased by 31.2 +/- 6.6 % over the past 30 years. The growth is particularly noticeable (by 22.5 +/- 6.2 %) during 2015-2019. Spatially, the wetland areal extent on the Qiangtang Plateau (in the inner part of TP and as habitats of various birds and rare wild animals) and the source region of Yangtze River show the largest expansions by 55.3 +/- 9.3 % and 44.0 +/- 8.9 %, respectively. Such rapid wetland expansions are associated with increasing rainfall and temperature which have heterogeneous influences on wetland changes across the TP. Our findings provide evidence for the impact of climate change on wetland area. The marked wetland changes highlight that climate mitigation is a priority for high-latitude ecosystems.

TI  - The Formation of an Ice-Contact Proglacial Lake and Its Impact on Glacier Change: A Case Study of the Tanymas Lake and Fedchenko Glacier
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake-terminating glaciers have some peculiar behaviors compared to land-terminating glaciers, but in-depth observation is still limited regarding their formation, which is crucial for understanding the glacier-lake interaction. Here, the long-term evolutions of Tanymas Lake and the Fedchenko Glacier were investigated based on Landsat images, Google Earth imagery, KH-9 images, glacier surface elevation and velocity change datasets, and meteorological records. The results indicate that Tanymas Lake is both an ice-contact proglacial lake and an ice-dammed lake. It covered an area of 1.10 km(2) in September 2022, and it is one of the largest glacial lakes in Pamir and even in HMA. The initial basin of Tanymas Lake is a moraine depression in Tanymas Pass, and the blocked dam is the Tanymas-5 Glacier and its terminal moraine. Tanymas Lake was in an embryonic stage before August 2005, in a formation and expansion stage from August 2005 to September 2018, and in a new expansion stage after September 2018. In this process, the Tanymas terminus of the Fedchenko Glacier also transformed from a land terminus to a partial lake terminus, and then to a complete lake terminus. The formation of Tanymas Lake is associated with the accumulation of glacial meltwater and the blockage of drainage, while the slow expansion of Tanymas Lake is related to the cold climate and slight glacier mass loss of Central Pamir. In the coming decades, with the accelerated mass loss of the Tanymas terminus of the Fedchenko Glacier, the area, depth, and water storage of Tanymas Lake will continue to increase, accompanied by the growing GLOF risk.

TI  - Prediction of Mine Subsidence Based on InSAR Technology and the LSTM Algorithm: A Case Study of the Shigouyi Coalfield, Ningxia (China)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate prediction of surface subsidence induced by coal mining is critical to safeguarding the environment and resources. However, the precision of current prediction models is often restricted by the lack of pertinent data or imprecise model parameters. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes an approach to predicting mine subsidence that leverages Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The proposed approach utilizes small baseline multiple-master high-coherent target (SBMHCT) interferometric synthetic aperture radar technology to monitor the mine surface and applies the long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm to construct the prediction model. The Shigouyi coalfield in Ningxia Province, China was chosen as a study area, and time series ground subsidence data were obtained based on Sentinel-1A data from 9 March 2015 to 7 June 2016. To evaluate the proposed approach, the prediction accuracies of LSTM and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were compared. The results show that the proposed approach could accurately predict mine subsidence, with maximum absolute errors of less than 2 cm and maximum relative errors of less than 6%. The findings demonstrate that combining InSAR technology with the LSTM algorithm is an effective and robust approach for predicting mine subsidence.

TI  - Surface Temperature Trends on the Central Siberian Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change does not occur in the same way worldwide; its effects display regional differences. Some regions with unique characteristics may experience dramatic changes, leading to significant indications for the global climate. The Siberian high, a system of high atmospheric pressure, is formed on the Central Siberian Plateau, affecting a significant part of the northern hemisphere from November to February. Climate changes in this region have significant influences on the global climate cycle. Hence, determining the temperature trends of this region will yield key indicators for climate change studies. Remote sensing provides useful databases for climate change studies, surface temperatures, temporal and spatial resolutions, and numerous advantages. In the present study, we aimed to determine the temporal and spatial surface temperature trends of the Central Siberian Plateau. As our data source, we used MODIS (Aqua and Terra) satellite images for 8 days between 2002- and 2021. The measurements from the region were arranged as monthly and annual values, presented as mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. Then, using these data, we obtained the mean values for the region and performed Mann-Kendall trend analyses. Accordingly, there was an overall increase of more than 2 degrees C in the study area. We performed a pixel-based Mann-Kendall trend test to reveal the mean annual temperatures and detect local changes. Our findings showed significant rises in temperature in the northern part of the study area.

TI  - Seismic Risk Regularization for Urban Changes Due to Earthquakes: A Case of Study of the 2023 Turkey Earthquake Sequence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Damage identification soon after a large-magnitude earthquake is a major problem for early disaster response activities. The faster the damaged areas are identified, the higher the survival chances of inhabitants. Current methods for damage identification are based on the application of artificial intelligence techniques using remote sensing data. Such methods require a large amount of high-quality labeled data for calibration and/or fine-tuning processes, which are expensive in the aftermath of large-scale disasters. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised classification approach for identifying urban changes induced by an earthquake between images recorded at different times. We integrate information from a small set of labeled data with information from ground motion and fragility functions computed on large unlabeled data. A relevant consideration is that ground motion and fragility functions can be computed in real time. The urban changes induced by the 2023 Turkey earthquake sequence are reported as an evaluation of the proposed method. The method was applied to the interferometric coherence computed from C-band synthetic aperture radar images from Sentinel-1. We use only 39 samples labeled as changed and 9000 unlabeled samples. The results show that our method is able to identify changes between images associated with the effects of an earthquake with an accuracy of about 81%. We conclude that the proposed method can rapidly identify affected areas in the aftermath of a large-magnitude earthquake.

TI  - Coseismic deformation and source characterisation of the 21 June 2022 Afghanistan earthquake using dual-pass DInSAR
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - On 21 June 2022 (at 20:54:34UTC), a magnitude 6.0 (Richter scale) earthquake (depth 4 km) struck eastern Afghanistan, devastating parts of the Khost and Paktika provinces. With its epicentre located southwest of Khost city, more than 1000 people were killed and several thousands injured by the earthquake. Deformation modelling and finite-fault source characterisation provide essential information for seismic hazard management and advanced analysis of the seismicity in earthquake prone areas. The coseismic deformation, which occurred west of the NNE-SSW-trending North Waziristan-Bannu thrust fault zone, was assessed using dual-pass (ascending and descending) interferometric Sentinel-1 data. The line of sight (LOS) displacement estimated from ascending pass imagery ranged from + 0.38 m to - 0.16 m. The descending pass LOS displacement ranged from + 0.10 m to - 0.13 m. The displacement components are resolved in vertical and east-west directions using ascending and descending passes. The displacement is predominantly westward with a strong upliftment component, thus indicating an SW-trending oblique slip movement of the fault. Inversion modelling was done to derive the seismic source characteristics from DInSAR displacement values using an elastic dislocation model. The linear inversion model converges at a single fault source solution with a dip and strike of similar to 62 degrees and 216 degrees N, respectively, having a rake of 25 degrees N. The distributed slip values vary between 0 and 2.25 m. The inversion model results in a moment magnitude of 6.18 and a geodetic moment of 2.06 x 10(18) Nm, comparable to those derived using teleseismic body wave data by USGS. Damage assessment using optical data from the Worldview-1 satellite substantiates that the building damages are located primarily within the zone of surface deformation.

TI  - Remote sensing inversion of land surface temperature for cloud coverage areas based on NDVI in the North China Plain
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - As the cloud covers the surface thermal radiation during the transmission process and the remote sensor in the air is difficult to detect, Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing inversion of Land Surface Temperature (LST) must be performed under clear-sky and cloudless conditions. This study has established the functional relationship between LST and the vegetation index of cloudless vegetation pixels around the cloud coverage areas in the North China Plain based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to address the issues of TIR remote sensing inversion for LST affected by cloud coverage. By acquiring NDVI and using short-term, relatively stable characteristics of vegetation, the LST of the cloud cover area is estimated. The findings show a linear negative correlation between LST and NDVI in vegetation pixels, with the vegetation type remaining essentially unchanged over time. When there are 20 pixels in each of the two thermal infrared channels of FY-3 D, the MAE value and RMSE value of the 24th thermal infrared channel are 0.77 and 0.88, respectively, and the MAE value and RMSE value of the 25th thermal infrared channel are 0.64 and 0.80, respectively. When the number of pixels is 200, the 24th thermal infrared channel's MAE value and RMSE values are 0.96 and 0.99, respectively, while the 25th thermal infrared channel's MAE value and RMSE values are 0.90 and 0.95, respectively. In other words, the estimation is more accurate and closer to the true value, and the land surface temperature retrieved by the 25th channel deviates from the true value to a lesser extent. The average absolute error and root mean square error are both less than 1, which may satisfy the accuracy demands of practical applications such as agricultural drought monitoring, ecological evaluation, and crop yield estimation.

TI  - Revealing a Shift in Solar Photovoltaic Planning Sites in Vietnam from 2019 to 2022
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology has been widely used as a major source of renewable energy. Vietnam is especially active in installing solar energy systems. The total installed solar PV capacity in Vietnam has significantly increased since 2019, but the spatial evolution of solar panels is yet to be discussed. Therefore, this study aims to reveal the shift that occurred in solar photovoltaic planning sites in Vietnam from 2019 to 2022. Solar PV maps were produced from Sentinel-2 imagery via a deep learning segmentation model. Land cover maps, terrain slope, solar power potential, population density, and power grid datasets were compared to the locations of the detected PV sites each year to reveal a shift in the solar farm planning sites. The result show that the deep learning model achieved satisfactory performance. The observed shift in the PV installation sites suggests that for the first two years, large solar farms were built on suitable land near the electricity grid, while smaller PVs were constructed at locations less suitable for solar energy production in 2021 and 2022. These findings suggest that the shift in solar PV planning in Vietnam was caused by the availability of suitable land with an appropriate energy transfer capacity and the participation of smaller-scale PV operators.

TI  - Assessing space-based smoldering peatland in the tropics with atmospheric products from multi-sensor satellites
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The research on space-based tropical smouldering peatlands poses challenges due to their low temperature and background object environments. This study focuses on analyzing smoldering pixels detected by the Tropical Peatland Combustion Algorithm (ToPeCAl) applied to Landsat-8 imagery in Indonesian peatlands. A modification to the contextual test for selecting fire pixels is proposed. Instead of using the high confidence level typically employed for selecting flaming pixels, a low confidence level is suggested to identify smoldering pixels from their background pixels. The validation of smoldering pixels is conducted using atmospheric products from multi-sensor satellites. The findings reveal that applying the low confidence level on the contextual test results in an accuracy of 75% for smoldering detection, similar to previous research with ground check validation. A dynamic statistical threshold value is utilized from background pixels within a moving window to validate smoldering pixels using atmospheric data, taking into consideration factors such as wind velocity, spatial resolution, and time of acquisition between sensors. Approximately 50-70% of the selected smoldering pixels show higher values of Aerosol Optical Depth from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-AOD), Carbon Monoxide from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI-CO), and Absorbing Aerosol Index from Second-generation Global Imager (SGLI-AAI) compared to their mean background pixel values. The study reveals a significant correlation (up to 0.8) between TROPOMI-CO and ground measurement of AOD over smouldering peatlands. These insights have the potential to aid disaster management agencies in effectively controlling smoldering fires and minigating the risk associated with smoldering peatlands.

TI  - A New and Automated Method for Improving Georeferencing in Nighttime Thermal ECOSTRESS Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Georeferencing accuracy plays a crucial role in providing high-quality ready-to-use remote sensing data. The georeferencing of nighttime thermal satellite imagery conducted by matching to a basemap is challenging due to the complexity of thermal radiation patterns in the diurnal cycle and the coarse resolution of thermal sensors in comparison to sensors used for imaging in the visual spectral range (which is typically used for creating basemaps). The presented paper introduces a novel approach for the improvement of the georeferencing of nighttime thermal ECOSTRESS imagery: an up-to-date reference is created for each to-be-georeferenced image, derived from land cover classification products. In the proposed method, edges of water bodies are used as matching objects, since water bodies exhibit a relatively high contrast with adjacent areas in nighttime thermal infrared imagery. The method was tested on imagery of the East African Rift and validated using manually set ground control check points. The results show that the proposed method improves the existing georeferencing of the tested ECOSTRESS images by 12.0 pixels on average. The strongest source of uncertainty for the proposed method is the accuracy of cloud masks because cloud edges can be mistaken for water body edges and included in fitting transformation parameters. The georeferencing improvement method is based on the physical properties of radiation for land masses and water bodies, which makes it potentially globally applicable, and is feasible to use with nighttime thermal infrared data from different sensors.

TI  - Orofacial manifestations of child maltreatment: A review
T2  - DENTAL TRAUMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The recognition and reporting of child abuse and neglect continues to be a challenge in the healthcare setting. All healthcare providers, including dentists, should be aware of the high prevalence of orofacial injuries and conditions that are concerning for abuse and neglect. Sentinel injuries may appear trivial and do not require medical attention, but are unlikely caused by accidental mechanisms and, if not properly identified, often precede more severe abusive injuries. Concerning orofacial findings can manifest as bruising, eye injuries, intraoral injuries, pharyngeal perforations, facial bone fractures, and sexually transmitted infections. Abusive caregivers are likely to give inadequate explanations or no history at all to explain concerning findings. Medical providers' failure to make mandated reports about their concerns to the appropriate agencies can have significant long-term impacts on the physical and psychological well-being of children.

TI  - Fragmentation effects on an endangered species across a gradient from the interior to edge of its range
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how habitat fragmentation affects individual species is complicated by challenges associated with quantifying species-specific habitat and spatial variability in fragmentation effects within a species' range. We aggregated a 29-year breeding survey data set for the endangered marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) from >42,000 forest sites throughout the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, Washington, and northern California) of the United States. We built a species distribution model (SDM) in which occupied sites were linked with Landsat imagery to quantify murrelet-specific habitat and then used occupancy models to test the hypotheses that fragmentation negatively affects murrelet breeding distribution and that these effects are amplified with distance from the marine foraging habitat toward the edge of the species' nesting range. Murrelet habitat declined in the Pacific Northwest by 20% since 1988, whereas the proportion of habitat comprising edges increased by 17%, indicating increased fragmentation. Furthermore, fragmentation of murrelet habitat at landscape scales (within 2 km of survey stations) negatively affected occupancy of potential breeding sites, and these effects were amplified near the range edge. On the coast, the odds of occupancy decreased by 37% (95% confidence interval [CI] -54 to 12) for each 10% increase in edge habitat (i.e., fragmentation), but at the range edge (88 km inland) these odds decreased by 99% (95% CI 98 to 99). Conversely, odds of murrelet occupancy increased by 31% (95% CI 14 to 52) for each 10% increase in local edge habitat (within 100 m of survey stations). Avoidance of fragmentation at broad scales but use of locally fragmented habitat with reduced quality may help explain the lack of murrelet population recovery. Further, our results emphasize that fragmentation effects can be nuanced, scale dependent, and geographically variable. Awareness of these nuances is critical for developing landscape-level conservation strategies for species experiencing broad-scale habitat loss and fragmentation.

TI  - Comprehensive surveillance of acute respiratory infections during the COVID-19 pandemic: a methodological approach using sentinel networks, Castilla y Leon, Spain, January 2020 to May 2022
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Since 1996, epidemiological surveillance of acute respiratory infections (ARI) in Spain has been limited to seasonal influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and potential pandemic viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic provides opportunities to adapt existing systems for extended surveillance to capture a broader range of ARI.Aim: To describe how the Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System of Castilla y Leon, Spain was rapidly adapted in 2020 to comprehensive sentinel surveillance for ARI, including influenza and COVID-19. Methods: Using principles and methods of the health sentinel network, we integrated electronic medical record data from 68 basic surveillance units, cover-ing 2.6% of the regional population between January 2020 to May 2022. We tested sentinel and non -senti-nel samples sent weekly to the laboratory network for SARS-CoV-2, influenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens. The moving epidemic method (MEM) was used to calculate epidemic thresholds. Results: ARI incidence was estimated at 18,942 cases per 100,000 in 2020/21 and 45,223 in 2021/22, with similar seasonal fold increases by type of respiratory disease. Incidence of influenza-like illness was negli-gible in 2020/21 but a 5-week epidemic was detected by MEM in 2021/22. Epidemic thresholds for ARI and COVID-19 were estimated at 459.4 and 191.3 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. More than 5,000 samples were tested against a panel of respiratory viruses in 2021/22.Conclusion: Extracting data from electronic medical records reported by trained professionals, combined with a standardised microbiological information sys-tem, is a feasible and useful method to adapt influenza sentinel reports to comprehensive ARI surveillance in the post-COVID-19 era.

TI  - Satellite Evidence for Divergent Forest Responses within Close Vicinity to Climate Fluctuations in a Complex Terrain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a significant impact on forest ecosystems worldwide, but it is unclear whether forest responses to climate fluctuations are homogeneous across regions. In this study, we investigated the impact of climatic fluctuations on forest growth in a complex terrain, in Anhui Province of China, using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), while considering the impact of terrain characteristics and forest types. Our regional-scale analysis found that the forest response to climatic drivers in Anhui Province is not homogeneous, with only 69% of the forest area driven by temperature (TEM), while 11% is precipitation (PRE) driven and 20% is solar radiation (SWD) driven. We also found with random forest models that terrain traits (elevation and slope) contributed significantly (29.47% and 27.96%) to the spatial heterogeneity of forest response to climatic drivers, with higher elevation associated with a stronger positive correlation between the EVI and temperature (p < 0.001), a weaker positive correlation between the EVI with precipitation (p < 0.001), and a stronger negative correlation between the EVI with solar radiation (p < 0.01), while forest type contributed the least (4.21%). Our results also imply that in a warmer and dryer climate, some forest patches may switch from TEM driven to PRE driven, which could lead to a decrease in forest productivity, instead of an increase as predicted by existing climate models. These results highlight the heterogeneous response of forests within close vicinity to climate fluctuations in a complex terrain, which has important implications for climate-related risk assessments and local forest management.

TI  - Scavengers as Prospective Sentinels of Viral Diversity: the Snowy Sheathbill Virome as a Potential Tool for Monitoring Virus Circulation, Lessons from Two Antarctic Expeditions
T2  - MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctica is a unique environment due to its extreme meteorological and geological conditions. In addition to this, its relative isolation from human influences has kept it undisturbed. This renders our limited understanding of its fauna and its associated microbial and viral communities a relevant knowledge gap to fill. This includes members of the order Charadriiformes such as snowy sheathbills. They are opportunistic predator/scavenger birds distributed on Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands that are in frequent contact with other bird and mammal species. This makes them an interesting species for surveillance studies due to their high potential for the acquisition and transport of viruses. In this study, we performed whole-virome and targeted viral surveillance for coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza viruses in snowy sheathbills from two locations, the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland. Our results suggest the potential role of this species as a sentinel for this region. We highlight the discovery of two human viruses, a member of the genus Sapovirus GII and a gammaherpesvirus, and a virus previously described in marine mammals. Here, we provide insight into a complex ecological picture. These data highlight the surveillance opportunities provided by Antarctic scavenger birds.IMPORTANCE This article describes whole-virome and targeted viral surveillance for coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza viruses in snowy sheathbills from the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland. Our results suggest an important role of this species as a sentinel for this region. This species' RNA virome showcased a diversity of viruses likely tied to its interactions with assorted Antarctic fauna. We highlight the discovery of two viruses of likely human origin, one with an intestinal impact and another with oncogenic potential. Analysis of this data set detected a variety of viruses tied to various sources (from crustaceans to nonhuman mammals), depicting a complex viral landscape for this scavenger species.This article describes whole-virome and targeted viral surveillance for coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and influenza viruses in snowy sheathbills from the Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland.

TI  - Impact of wetland change on ecosystem services in different urbanization stages: A case study in the Hang-Jia-Hu region, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization has had a profound impact on wetlands, and wetland conservation and restoration have attracted much attention. However, the detailed impacts of different urbanization and wetland changing processes on ecosystem services (ESs) are not well understood. Based on long-time series of remote sensing data (1990-2020), flood mitigation (FM), water purification (WP), carbon sequestration (CS), and biodiversity conservation (BC) were quantified in the Hang-Jia-Hu (HJH) region, China. According to the changing trend of urban land, the study period was divided into three urbanization stages: slow urbanization (1990-1998), rapid urbanization (1998-2013), and moderate urbanization (2013-2020). Regression analysis was used to explore the quantitative relationship between urbanization/wetland changes and ESs. The results showed that the urban land expansion rates in the slow urbanization, rapid urbanization, and moderate urbanization stages were 46.51 km2/yr, 100.62 km2/yr, and 70.87 km2/yr, respectively, and the corresponding wetland changing rates were 5.14 km2/yr, 19.54 km2/yr and -20.88 km2/yr, respectively. FM decreased in the slow and moderate urbanization stages and increased in the rapid urbanization stage, and WP increased in the slow and rapid urbanization stages and decreased in the moderate urbanization stage. Urbanization led to a decrease in FM, CS, and BC. Wetland restoration improved these ESs, while wetland loss caused a decline in multiple ESs in the slow and rapid urbanization stages. Wetland restoration partially offsets the negative effects of urbanization and wetland loss on ESs in the rapid urbanization stage. Urbanization and wetland changes have linear and nonlinear effects on ESs in different urbanization stages. Wetland restoration is an effective way to improve ESs in urbanization regions. This study can make an important contribution to sustainable wetland ecosystem development in urbanization regions.

TI  - Evidence for Urbanization Effects on Eco-Environmental Quality: A Case Study of Guyuan City, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Achieving sustainable development and a good quality of life depends largely on the state of the ecological environment. This research is centered on Guyuan City and examines the changes in the ecological environment quality across space and time, based on Landsat imagery and the remote sensing ecological environment index (RSEI) between 2000 and 2019. Correlation analysis and partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to investigate the environmental and human factors that affect the quality of the ecological environment. The results indicate a significant reduction in areas with a very-poor-quality ecological environment and a significant increase in excellent ecological environment management from 2000 to 2019, especially in eastern Guyuan City. The low-value area of the RSEI index gradually shifted from eastern counties to western areas relative to Guyuan City, exhibiting a significant change from a high-cluster distribution to a significantly discrete distribution. Elevation, precipitation, and total organic carbon showed significantly positive correlations with the RSEI, while temperature, land use, and pH showed significantly negative correlations. This study also reveals that topography and climate change have a positive impact on ecological changes, and urbanization is becoming less limiting for ecological improvement. In future ecological construction processes, emphasis should be placed on the terrain and climatic conditions to maximize the restoration of the ecological environment affected by urban construction. This work provides regional guidance for future sustainable development and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns and driving mechanisms of rice biomass during the growth period in China since 2000
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - China is a major rice-producing nation and understanding changes in rice planting areas and growth periods and the mechanisms driving rice biomass is important to ensure effective agricultural strategies and food security. In this study, rice planting areas from 2000 to 2021 in China were extracted using Savitzky-Golay filtering and the absolute distance index. Using MODIS remote sensing image data, we determined the rice growth period based on the inflection points of the enhanced vegetation index. In addition, the cumulative biomass of rice during the growth period since 2000 was determined based on the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model. Finally, the key driving mechanisms and coupling relationships among the driving factors of rice biomass during the growth period were determined using geographically weighted regression and structural equation models. The results showed that the accumulation of net primary productivity (NPP) during the rice growth period in Northeast China, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and Northwest China increased significantly (P < 0.01). The accumulation of NPP during the rice growth period in Huang-Huai-Hai, South China, and Southwest China decreased significantly (P < 0.01). In addition, Central Inner Mongolia, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and Loess Plateau have less rice planting area and no significant variation pattern in the accumulation of NPP during the rice growth period. In the nine major agricultural regions of China, precipitation, temperature, and evapo-transpiration were among the most influential meteorological factors affecting rice biomass. For the inland areas with less precipitation, drainage density was an increasingly important influencing factor. Areas with high topographic relief were more likely to be affected by the slope. In areas with relatively poor soil, the fertilizer application rate influenced rice biomass growth. Our results provide insights into the spatio-temporal patterns of rice biomass and its driving mechanisms, and demonstrate the efficacy of using remote sensing data at a macro scale.

TI  - Fuzzy wavelet neural network driven vehicle detection on remote sensing imagery*
T2  - COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based target detection process is applied to spot the targeted objects in remote sensing images (RSIs). However, it is challenging to detect small-sized vehicles in RSIs. The current study designs a Chicken Swarm Optimization with Transfer Learning-Driven Vehicle Detection and Classification on Remote Sensing Imagery (CSOTL-VDCRS) technique to resolve these issues. The presented CSOTL-VDCRS technique employs the mask-region based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) technique for the detection of the vehicles. Once the vehicles in the RSIs are detected, the next step is to classify them using the Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network (FWNN) model. To enhance the performance of the proposed model in terms of vehicle detection, the CSO technique is used as a hyperparameter optimizer for the Mask RCNN technique. The proposed CSOTL-VDCRS technique was experimentally validated using the benchmark dataset, and the outcomes demonstrate its superior performance over other existing models.

TI  - Multi-temporal assessment of land surface temperatures as an indicator of land use/cover changes and climate variability in the Develi Basin, Turkey
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that reflects land surface processes of water and energy balance and has been used in assessment of land use/cover changes. However, the use of LST in monitoring changes in non-urban areas such as agricultural areas and wetlands is still limited. In this study, we aim to determine the spatial and temporal changes in LST in a semi-arid agricultural basin in Turkey (Develi Basin), where land use/cover and climatic conditions showed considerable variability since 1980s. Irrigated agriculture have expanded in the basin since 1987, after the construction of a large irrigation project. The basin hosts an internationally important wetland, called the Sultan Marshes, affected negatively by irrigation expansion. The study covers a 39-year period from 1984 to 2022. Four Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in 1984, 1987, 2003, and 2007 and two Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images acquired in 2014 and 2022 were used in the analyses. The land use/cover changes were evaluated based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). LST was estimated through top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature from thermal bands of Landsat images. Climate variability from 2014 to 2022 was analyzed with statistical methods. The results indicated that Develi Basin faced both spatial and temporal land use/cover changes. The area covered with natural steppe vegetation and water bodies decreased in the basin. In contrast, the sparsely and densely vegetated soil covers, which mostly denote agricultural areas, increased. Changes in LST values were observed from 1984 to 2022 as a result of climatic factors and land use/cover changes. LST changes were variable across different land use/cover types; LST decreased in irrigated areas and increased in lakes that went dry over years. LST changes proved useful for evaluating land use/cover changes and climatic variations in agricultural basins.

TI  - Habitat heterogeneity promotes bird diversity in agricultural landscapes: Insights from remote sensing data
T2  - BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the main drivers of biodiversity loss in Europe's agricultural landscapes has been a research priority in the last decades. One of the most important factors promoting biodiversity in farmed landscapes is habitat heterogeneity, which has often proved crucial for avian species and communities. Birds are highly sensitive to environmental changes and make use of a broad range of ecological niches, thus being exceptionally sensitive to the loss of habitat heterogeneity. Remote sensing data are particularly suited to quantify habitat heterogeneity at fine scales over relatively large extents, allowing to consider how dif-ferent measures of heterogeneity may affect biotic communities at a regional scale. Here, we used airborne LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) and satellite multispectral data to derive vegetation canopy height and primary productivity for 118 sites in complex agricultural landscapes in a region in the Central Alps. We computed different bird diversity indices and classi-fied bird species into guilds according to specific traits to analyse the relationship between avian communities and different fac-ets of habitat heterogeneity. Results confirmed that habitat heterogeneity is essential in shaping rich and diverse bird communities, and it is particularly important for several farmland birds. By comparing the effects of canopy height, primary productivity, and specific vegetation features (e.g., cover of grassland, shrub, and tree layers), we showed how different habitat characteristics as well as landscape heterogeneity affected bird richness, diversity, functional entropy, and trait patterns. Land-scape and height heterogeneity, estimated by NDVI and LiDAR Rao's Q indices, strongly influenced all response variables, for example, high NDVI values promoted species diversity and ground-understory nesters, and shrub layer was important for ground-understory nesters and forest specialists. Finally, we provide recommendations for conservation practices and mitiga-tion measures to improve bird diversity in agricultural landscapes.

AB  - In this commentary, I pose a question regarding how critical geographers will position themselves toward Islam as a different mode of decolonising (or something beyond it) that is fundamentally different from mainstream critical geography. To build this argument, I first expand on Sidaway's account of how one should understand Islam and its consequences. I then argue that critical geography is an extension of a secularisation project whose presuppositions negate the Islamic worldview. To conclude, I reflect on my engagement with critical geography as a Muslim and lay out some questions to be considered by critical geographers.

TI  - Probabilistic Wildfire Segmentation Using Supervised Deep Generative Model from Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are one of the major disasters among many and are responsible for more than 6 million acres burned in the United States alone every year. Accurate, insightful, and timely wildfire detection is needed to help authorities mitigate and prevent further destruction. Uncertainty quantification is always a crucial part of the detection of natural disasters, such as wildfires, and modeling products can be misinterpreted without proper uncertainty quantification. In this study, we propose a supervised deep generative machine-learning model that generates stochastic wildfire detection, allowing fast and comprehensive uncertainty quantification for individual and collective events. In the proposed approach, we also aim to address the patchy and discontinuous Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) wildfire product by training the proposed model with MODIS raw and combined bands to detect fire. This approach allows us to generate diverse but plausible segmentations to represent the disagreements regarding the delineation of wildfire boundaries by subject matter experts. The proposed approach generates stochastic segmentation via two model streams in which one learns meaningful stochastic latent distributions, and the other learns the visual features. Two model branches join eventually to become a supervised stochastic image-to-image wildfire detection model. The model is compared to two baseline stochastic machine-learning models: (1) with permanent dropout in training and test phases and (2) with Stochastic ReLU activations. The visual and statistical metrics demonstrate better agreements between the ground truth and the proposed model segmentations. Furthermore, we used multiple scenarios to evaluate the model comprehension, and the proposed Probabilistic U-Net model demonstrates a better understanding of the underlying physical dynamics of wildfires compared to the baselines.

TI  - Confidence Intervals and Regions for Proportions under Various Three-Endmember Linear Mixture Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies in recent years have been devoted to estimating the per-pixel proportions of three broad classes of materials (e.g., photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation and bare soil) using data from multispectral sensors. Oftentimes, the estimated proportions are used to monitor environmental change in both urban and non-urban environments. Many of these papers use proportion estimation methods based on the linear mixture model. Very few of these papers assess the accuracy of their estimators. This paper shows how to produce confidence intervals (CIs) and joint confidence regions (JCRs) for the proportions associated with various linear mixture models. There are two main models, both of which assume that the coefficients in the model are non-negative. The first model assumes that the coefficients sum to 1. The second does not, but uses rescaling of the estimated coefficients to produce estimated proportions. Three variants of these two models are also analysed. JCRs are shown to be particularly informative, because they are typically better at localising the information than CIs are. The methodology is illustrated using examples from Landsat Thematic Mapper data at 1169 locations across Australia, each of which has associated field observations. There is also a discussion about the extent to which the methodology can be extended to hyperspectral data.

TI  - Water storage changes in the North China Plain from 2004 to 2019
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-TECHNOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past few decades, the irrational use of water resources has resulted in many issues such as land subsidence in the North China Plain (NCP), hindering its socio-economic development. An accurate understanding of water resource changes is important for the allocation of water resources in the NCP. In this study, we employed Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data to monitor the total water storage (TWS) change in the NCP during 2004-2019. Evapotranspiration, precipitation, and runoff during 2004-2019 were sequentially examined, using the water balance formula (WBF), to retrieve TWS change. Furthermore, the soil moisture, snow water equivalent, and canopy water storage from the Global Land Data Assimilation System were used to calculate the natural component of the TWS variations. A comparison of these results revealed the drivers of the changes in water resources. The results showed that: (1) overall TWS retrieved by GRACE decreased substantially as a consequence of human activity, while TWS obtained by WBF fluctuated periodically around zero under the impact of three natural drivers; (2) TWS in the NCP fell at a remarkable rate of -12.39 mm/y from 2004 to 2019, and the natural part of TWS experienced two significant declines, during 2004-2010 and 2013-2016; (3) variations in runoff, precipitation, and evapotranspiration from 2004 to 2019 were not significant, but human activities contributed more to the decreasing TWS than natural factors. This study provides a reference for water resource management and groundwater exploitation across the NCP under climate change.

TI  - Sensor-based field methods for pedology and soil surveys: Protocol suggestions for Brazilian tropical soils
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Although limited alternatives have been proposed to describe soils by using proximal sensors under natural conditions, efforts must be made to apply the newest technologies to assist in soil characterization and mapping. Our main objective was: to create a protocol incorporating technology that assists pedologists: (i) to compare soil horizonation by using visible, near, and shortwave infrared (Vis-NIR-SWIR) spectroscopy, mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) indices, and conventional field observations; (ii) to identify mineralogical and physico-chemical variations between soil horizons by using proximal sensors, with inferences about pedogenic processes; and (iii) to expand punctual information to spatial dimensions with RGB images and terrain attributes. Seven soil profiles located through a toposequence evaluation were analyzed on a farm in the Sa & SIM;o Paulo State, Brazil. First, when the area consisted of exposed soils, images were obtained by Landsat and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and a digital surface model (DSM) was then built by stereoscopy, which was subsequently used to calculate thirteen terrain attributes. Each soil profile was evaluated with devices directly in the field (except for the MIR analyses, for which soil samples were brought to the laboratory and dried). Several indices were calculated from the pXRF data during the profile analysis, while principal component analyses (PCA) were performed to reduce the dimensions of the spectral data. Four datasets for each soil profile (VIS-NIRSWIR, pXRF, MIR, and a combination of all the data) were submitted for k-means clustering analysis and the similarities among the layers were evaluated. Following the profile evaluation, spatialization was performed based on single bands from the RGB image and PCA using terrain attributes. The data were sampled to a punctual view of 370 points, classified, and then interpolated with the spline method. The Vis-NIR-SWIR spectral range, together with soil color, provided better correspondence with conventional field observations. We observed that the combined use of Vis-NIR-SWIR, MIR, and pXRF helped to identify and describe the soil profiles appropriately. Proximal sensors also allowed us to make more robust inferences regarding pedogenesis. We delineated soil information profiles in soil units by using the spatial dimension's terrain attributes and, RGB images from a UAV.

TI  - Utilization of synthetic minority oversampling technique for improving potato yield prediction using remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms with small sample size of yield data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the integration of machine learning (ML) algorithms and remote sensing data has been the commonly deployed practice for potato yield prediction in different scales. Since the quantity and quality of training data significantly affect ML algorithms' applicability, their effective use in some cases can be challenging and expensive. In this paper, we utilized the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) algorithm to generate synthetic data for potato yield prediction. We conducted several experiments in two study sites called CS1 and CS2. The SMOTE algorithm was employed to produce synthetic data at five multiplication rates (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80). Six ML algorithms including random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), Knearest neighbor (KNN), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), deep neural network (DNN), and stacked autoencoder of neural network (SAE) were used for potato yield prediction. To train the ML algorithms, multiple sets of synthetically generated data were combined with the original data. The similarity of synthetic data and original data was evaluated by two metrics (Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) and Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD)), as well as PCA-based visualization. On the other hand, the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) metrics were calculated to evaluate the performance of ML algorithms in potato yield prediction. Both quantitative and visual evaluations showed close similarity between the synthetic and original data. The average JSD (KLD) in CS1 and CS2 were 0.00028 (0.0031) and 0.161 (0.271), respectively. The ML algorithms showed noticeable differences when it comes to utilizing synthetic data. The RFR, XGB, DNN, and SAE algorithms positively responded to the addition of synthetic data, while SVR and KNN were the only ML algorithms that negatively responded to the addition of synthetic data. The DNN algorithm exhibited the highest positive response to the addition of synthetic data with an average RMSE change of -2.35 point percentage in CS1 and -24.54 point percentage in CS2. Although none of the ML algorithms and synthetic sample sizes provided the highest prediction performance in all the settings, which was plausible given the inherent differences among the selected ML algorithms, the RFR algorithm trained with the combination of original and quintupled synthetic data was the most appropriate choice for potato yield prediction.

TI  - Regional-Scale Topsoil Organic Matter Estimation Based on a Geographic Detector Model Using Landsat Data, Pingtan Island, Fujian, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatial distribution of soil organic matter (SOM) is important for land use management, but conventional sampling methods require significant human and financial resources. How to map SOM and monitor its changes using a limited number of sample points combined with remote sensing techniques that provide long-time series data is crucial. This study aimed to generate a regional-scale near-surface SOM map using 70 soil samples and covariate environmental factors extracted mainly from Landsat 8 OLI. Firstly, the sensitivity of each environmental factor to SOM was tested using a geographic detector model (GDM). Secondly, the tested factors were selected for modeling and mapping by ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression kriging (GWRK). The performance of these two models was compared. Finally, the mapping results of the better model (GWRK) were compared and analyzed with the traditional interpolation results based solely on sampling points to verify the rationality of the proposed method. The results show that three environmental factors, ratio vegetation index (RVI), differential vegetation index (DVI), and terrain roughness (TR), have a strong influence on the spatial variability of SOM. Using these three factors in combination with the GWRK method, a more accurate and refined spatial distribution map of SOM can be obtained. Comparing the SOM maps of GWRK and the traditional interpolation method, the results show that the accuracy of GWRK (R-2 = 0.405; mean absolute error = 0.637, and root mean square error = 0.813) is higher than that of traditional interpolation methods (R-2 = 0.291, MAE = 0.609, and RMSE = 0.863). The spatial recognition rate (fineness) of SOM patches at all levels using the GWRK method increased by more than 73 times compared to the traditional kriging. We conclude that the combination of limited SOM samples, environmental variables, GDM, and GWRK is a pragmatic approach for estimating regional-scale SOM.

TI  - Assessing fire severity in Turkey's forest ecosystems using spectral indices from satellite images
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity classifications determine fire damage and regeneration potential in post-fire areas for effective implementation of restoration applications. Since fire damage varies according to vegetation and fire characteristics, regional assessment of fire severity is crucial. The objectives of this study were: (1) to test the performance of different satellite imagery and spectral indices, and two field-measured severity indices, CBI (Composite Burn Index) and GeoCBI (Geometrically structured Composite Burn Index) to assess fire severity; (2) to calculate classification thresholds for spectral indices that performed best in the study areas; and (3) to generate fire severity maps that could be used to determine the ecological impact of forest fires. Five large fires in Pinus brutia (Turkish pine) and Pinus nigra subsp. pallasiana var. pallasiana (Anatolian black pine)-dominated forests during 2020 and 2021 were selected as study sites. The results show that GeoCBI provided more reliable estimates of field-measured fire severity than CBI. While Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8/OLI images performed similarly well, MODIS performed poorly. Fire severity classification thresholds were determined for Sentinel-2 based RdNBR, dNBR, dSAVI, dNDVI, and dNDMI and Landsat-8/OLI based dNBR, dNDVI, and dSAVI. Among several spectral indices, the highest accuracy for fire severity classification was found for Sentinel-2 based RdNBR (72.1%) and Landsat-8/OLI based dNBR (69.2%). The results can be used to assess and map fire severity in forest ecosystems similar to those in this study.

TI  - Global monitoring of soil multifunctionality in drylands using satellite imagery and field data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Models derived from satellite image data are needed to monitor the status of terrestrial ecosystems across large spatial scales. However, a remote sensing-based approach to quantify soil multifunctionality at the global scale is missing despite significant research efforts on this topic. A major constraint for doing so is the availability of suitable global-scale field data to calibrate remote sensing indicators (RSI) and, to a lesser extent, the sensitivity of spectral data of available satellite sensors to soil background and atmospheric conditions. Here, we aimed to develop a soil multifunctionality model to monitor global drylands coupling ground data on 14 soil functions of 222 dryland areas from six continents to 18 RSI derived from a time series (2006-2013) Landsat dataset. Among the RSI evaluated, the chlorophyll absorption ratio index was the best predictor of soil multifunctionality in single-variable-based models (r = 0.66, P < 0.01, NMRSE = 0.17). However, a multi-variable RSI model combining the chlorophyll absorption ratio index, the global environment monitoring index and the canopy-air temperature difference improved the accuracy of quantifying soil multifunctionality (r = 0.73, P < 0.01, NMRSE = 0.15). Furthermore, the correlation between RSI and soil variables shows a wide range of accuracy with upper and lower values obtained for AMI (r = 0.889, NMRSE = 0.05) and BGL (r = 0.685, NMRSE = 0.18) respectively. Our results provide new insights on assessing soil multifunctionality using RSI that may help to monitor temporal changes in the functioning of global drylands effectively.

TI  - Urban sprawl at the expense of cultivated land: decadal land use and land cover changes and future projections in the upper Awash basin of central Ethiopia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionUrban sprawl in developing countries affects future sustainability concerns related to environment, ecology and cropland losses. This study aimed at identifying, classifying and quantifying the changes in land-use and land-cover (LULC) during the last two decades (2000-2020) and predict the decadal pattern for the next three decades (2030-2050), with particular emphasis on urban sprawl at the expense of cultivated land in the upper Awash basin of central Ethiopia. MethodsLandsat images were used to analyze the LULC change dynamics using hybrid image classification and maximum likelihood classifier techniques. The Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CAMC) Model was used to predict its future LULC change dynamics. A detailed analysis of the urban sprawl in the cities of Addis Ababa, Adama, and Mojo was also conducted. ResultsIt was observed that during the last two decades, settlements, particularly urban sprawls, substantially expanded at the expense of cultivated land, whereas the latter modestly expanded at the expense of forestland, bare land, and shrubland. From its size in 2000, the urban sprawl of Addis Ababa has grown in all directions towards cultivated land by more than six times in 2020 and is expected to become double of that by 2050 in the urban and peri-urban areas of the basin. Adama city has expanded by the same rate of 9.7% in the past two decades, while Mojo town has sprawled 9 folds between 2010 and 2020. The predicted percentage change in settlement for Addis Ababa and its neighboring districts within 22 km radius from the centroid shows a 40% expansion in 2030, 77% in 2040, and 87% in 2050 compared with the reference year 2020. Similarly, the Mojo town will expand significantly in 2030 (54%), 2040 (119%), and 2050 (by a staggering magnitude of 244%), while Adama will expand within the 12 km radius by 18%, 42%, and 117% in the next three respective decades. DiscussionThe rapid cultivated land conversions in the basin may contribute to major shifts in urban and peri-urban ecological environments. Our predictive LULC change maps and urban sprawling could be useful for developing effective and sustainable land-use policies for environmental and ecological management in the upper Awash basin.

TI  - Sentinel-3 OLCI observations of Chinese lake turbidity using machine learning algorithms
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity has a substantial effect on light propagation in water and is an optical indicator for monitoring water quality. The Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) installed in the Sentinel-3 satellite could help to monitor turbidity variations due to its narrow spectral bandwidth and high revisit time. This makes us develop suitable turbidity algorithms for mapping the dynamics of lake turbidity using OLCI imagery. In this study, a total of 1081 samples were collected from 73 typical lakes across China during 2017-2022. Here, we developed and proposed applicable turbidity algorithms i.e., SR (simple regression), PLSR (partial least squares regression), SVR (support vector regression), BP (backpropagation neural network), KNN (K-nearest neighbor), RF (random forest), and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting), which integrate a broad scale dataset of turbidity ranging from 0.15 NTU to 262.57 NTU using OLCI imagery. The performance results of developed turbidity algorithms demonstrated that RF obtained performed best with good agreements of measured-and derived-fitting (validation dataset: R2 = 0.92, MAPE = 54.32%, RMSE = 12.65 NTU). This allowed us to estimate turbidity concentration in Chinese lakes with a surface area>20 km2. The averaged turbidity level of lake groups in five lake regions was inves-tigated with a decreased tendency as Northeast Plain Lake Region (NPL, 63.31 NTU) > Eastern Plain Lake Region (EPL, 58.30 NTU) > Inner Mongolia-Xinjiang Lake Region (IMXL, 16.64 NTU) > Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau Lake Region (YGPL, 11.63 NTU) > Tibetan Plateau Lake Region (TPL, 7.05 NTU). Further, we analyze the distribu-tions of lake turbidity considering different land use types, and the results showed a decreasing tendency as cropland (56.97 NTU) > barren land (11.22 NTU) > grassland (8.06 NTU) > forest (4.71 NTU). Our results demonstrated and highlighted the quantification of lake turbidity concentrations using OLCI imagery and the stability of the RF algorithm, which can generate turbidity data for large-scale monitoring and decision-making related to environmental protection.

TI  - Geospatial-Temporal Dynamics of Land Use in the Juarez Valley: Urbanization and Displacement of Agriculture
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and industrial development in the Juarez Valley, Chihuahua, Mexico, have led to the abandonment and loss of productive agricultural areas. However, the extent and dynamics of this phenomenon are not precisely known due to the lack of updated information. Therefore, it is necessary to geospatially represent these changes over time and predict their probability of persistence into the future to provide decision-making tools for this border region of Mexico. Landsat images were processed, and random forest was applied as a classifier to obtain land uses from 1980 to 2020. The Land Change Modeler options in Terrset (TM) were executed to generate land use changes, persistence and probabilities. Results showed that urban, built-up areas gained 19,962 ha by 2020 while crops lost 1675 ha. Agricultural permanence has been consolidated over time (persistence until 2020 of 0.83), but evidence suggests that this persistence will decrease in the future due to urbanization (decreasing to 0.59 by 2100). This could jeopardize the availability of primary products and food, lead to land abandonment and exacerbate socio-demographic expansion in this vulnerable region.

TI  - Subcutaneous mast cell tumours: A prospective multi-institutional clinicopathological and prognostic study of 43 dogs
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundCanine subcutaneous mast cell tumours (ScMCTs) reportedly have a good prognosis. However, biomarkers that can be used to predict outcome are currently limited. MethodsA multicentre prospective study was conducted to identify new prognostic markers. Dogs with a first occurrence of ScMCT were enrolled upon primary tumour removal and regional lymphadenectomy. In the absence of metastasis, dogs were monitored, while dogs with overtly metastatic lymph nodes (histological node 3, HN3) received adjuvant vinblastine. ResultsForty-three dogs were enrolled: 15 (34.9%) had at least one HN3 lymph node and received vinblastine, and 28 (65.1%) were monitored. Three tumours harboured exon 8 and 9 c-kit mutations. Eight (18.6%) dogs experienced tumour progression, and five (11.6%) died of MCT-related causes. The 1- and 2-year survival rates were 90% and 77%, respectively. Variables significantly associated with an increased risk of progression included high cytograde, a mitotic count (MC) greater than 4/10 high-power fields (hpf) and Ki67-index greater than 23. An MC greater than 4/10 hpf was also associated with an increased risk of tumour-related death. LimitationsRegional rather than sentinel lymphadenectomy was performed in these dogs. Dogs were enrolled in oncology referral centres, constituting a different population compared to previous studies. ConclusionsScMCTs have a good prognosis. However, the metastatic rate at admission was higher in this study than previously reported, and a subset of tumours were associated with a fatal outcome despite multimodal treatment. Proliferative activity and cytograding may predict more aggressive behaviour in ScMCTs.

TI  - The Role of Wild Boars in the Circulation of Tick-Borne Pathogens: The First Evidence of <i>Rickettsia monacensis</i> Presence
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: Wildlife has a major role in the transmission and maintenance of zoonotic agents, as most emerging infectious diseases are of wildlife origin. Among the great variety of wildlife species, wild boars (Sus scrofa) are species with continuously increasing abundance and geographical distribution. Wild boars were suggested as appropriate sentinel species for the distribution and abundance of certain tick species in America and Europe. Therefore, these species may also be suitable sentinel species for screening for tick-borne pathogens. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of tick-borne pathogens in wild boars in Romania. A total of 203 blood samples were collected from wild boars (Sus scrofa) from two Transylvanian counties (Cluj, Salaj) in Romania. Three emerging zoonotic pathogens were identified, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and two Rickettsia species (R. helvetica, R. monacensis) DNA, in the blood of tested animals. These results suggest the involvement of wild boars in the epidemiology of Rickettsia species and A. phagocytophilum. Hence, this species may be used as a sentinel for the general surveillance of these zoonotic pathogens.Most wild mammals can serve as hosts both for tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) and for the ticks themselves. Among these, wild boars, due to their large body size, habitat and life span, show high exposure to ticks and TBPs. These species are now one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widespread suid. Despite the fact that certain local populations have been decimated by African swine fever (ASF), wild boars are still considered overabundant in most parts of the world, including Europe. Altogether, their long-life expectancy, large home ranges including migration, feeding and social behaviors, wide distribution, overabundance and increased chances of interactions with livestock or humans make them suitable sentinel species for general health threats, such as antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, pollution and ASF geographical distribution, as well as for the distribution and abundance of hard ticks and also for certain TBPs, such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of rickettsial agents in wild boars from two counties in Romania. Among 203 blood samples of wild boars (Sus scrofa ssp. attila) collected during 3 (2019-2022) hunting seasons (September-February), 15 were found positive for tick-borne pathogen DNA. Six wild boars were positive for A. phagocytophilum DNA presence and nine for Rickettsia spp. The identified rickettsial species were R. monacensis (six) and R. helvetica (three). No animal was positive either for Borrelia spp., Ehrlichia spp. or Babesia spp. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of R. monacensis in European wild boars, thus adding the third species from the SFG Rickettsia, in the epidemiology of which this wild species may have a role as a reservoir host.

TI  - Extended growing seasons and decreases in hydrologic connectivity indicate increasing water stress in humid, temperate forests
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forested headwater catchments are important sources of stable and abundant freshwater resources. Interactions between vegetation and topography influence lateral hydrologic connectivity by altering shallow subsurface flow paths. This in turn influences vegetation density along those paths, and subsequent hydrologic partitioning between localized water use and subsurface flows at catchment scales. Climate change impacts on forests, and the degree to which they reshape feedbacks between evapotranspiration (ET) and hydrologic connectivity, remain unclear. To clarify the extent and drivers of changing lateral hydrologic connectivity, we assessed relative changes in upslope to downslope vegetation density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from 1984 - 2021 in 30,044 forested catchments across the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Increasing upslope NDVI relative to downslope NDVI was used as a proxy for decreasing lateral hydrologic connectivity. We then related changes in connectivity to climate and streamflow dynamics across 28 sub-regional reference watersheds. We found decreases in the ratio of downslope to upslope NDVI in almost half of the catchments (48.5%), pri-marily due to increasing upslope NDVI. This indicates increasing ET upslope and a decline in lateral hydrologic subsidy to downslope given precipitation. This was also supported by faster streamflow recession and increasing ET estimates relative to precipitation in over half of reference watersheds. The strongest predictor of decreasing connectivity was growing season minimum temperature (Tmin),which increased in 88% of catchments (Mean R2 = 0.27 +/-0.13). While Tmin is not a dominant atmospheric driver of ET, this pattern has been closely linked to lengthened growing seasons. This suggests that alteration of lateral hydrologic connectivity is mainly driven by ecophysiological responses to changing climate rather than directly by atmospheric drivers. Our results emphasize the importance of vegetation dynamics shifting hydrologic partitioning and driving water limitations even in humid, temperate forests.

TI  - Quantitative Assessment of Cropland Exposure to Agricultural Drought in the Greater Mekong Subregion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable information on the spatiotemporal characteristics of agricultural drought is important in understanding complicated drought processes and their potential impacts. We proposed an integrated approach for detecting agricultural droughts and their cropland exposure using remote sensing data over the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) collected from 2001 to 2020. The soil moisture (SM) dataset (0.05 degrees) was first reconstructed based on an ESACCI SM dataset using a random forest (RF) model. Subsequently, the standardized soil moisture index (SSMI) was used to identify the agricultural droughts by a three-dimensional (latitude-longitude-time) identification method. In addition, the cropland's exposure to agricultural droughts was evaluated. Results showed that: (1) the reconstructed SM data achieved spatial continuity and improved spatial resolution. The verified consequences showed that the reconstructed SM data agreed well with the in situ SM data. Additionally, the SSMI based on reconstructed SM had good correlations with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) calculated from station observations. (2) Twenty agricultural drought events lasting at least 3 months were identified over the GMS region. The averaged durations, areas, and severity were 7 months, 9 x 105 km(2), and 45.6 x 105 month.km(2), respectively. The four worst drought events ranked by severity were the 2019-2020 event, the 2015-2016 event, the 2009-2010 event, and the 2004-2005 event. (3) Based on the 20 identified agricultural drought events, cropland exposure was high in Myanmar, Thailand, and Cambodia. On average, the cropland exposure over the GMS was 1.71 x 105 km(2), which accounts for 34% of the total cropland. Notably, the four severest drought events swept over 80% of the total cropland area. This study enriched our understanding of the development process of agricultural droughts from a space-time perspective, which was pivotal for assessing drought impacts and managing agricultural water resources.

TI  - Development of PROMETHEE-Entropy data mining model for groundwater potentiality modeling: a case study of multifaceted geologic settings in south-western Nigeria
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This work looks at developing an object-driven decision support system (DSS) model with the goal of improving the prediction accuracy of the present expert-driven DSS model in assessing groundwater potentiality. The database of remote sensing, geological, and geophysical information was constructed using the technological efficiency of GIS, data mining, and programming tools. Groundwater potential conditioning factors (GPCF) extracted from the datasets include lithology (Li), hydraulic conductivity (K), lineament density (Ld), transmissivity (T), and transverse resistance (TR) for groundwater potentiality mapping in a typical hard rock multifaceted geologic setting in south-western Nigeria. A Python-based entropy approach was used to objectively weight these factors. The weightage findings determined that the greatest and lowest given values for Ld and K were 0.6 and 0.03, respectively. The produced Python-based PROMETHEE-Entropy model algorithm was born through combining the weight findings with the Python-based PROMETHEE-II method. The groundwater potentiality model (GPM) map of the area was created using the model algorithm's outputs on the gridded raster of GPCF themes. Based on the suggested approach, the validated results of the created GPM maps using the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve technique yielded an accuracy of 86%. An object-driven DSS model was created using the approaches that were used. The created object-driven model is a viable alternative to existing approaches in groundwater hydrology and aids in the automation of groundwater resource management in the research region.

TI  - The international DORIS service contribution to ITRF2020
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For the realization of the 2020 International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF2020), the International DORIS Service delivered to the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) a set of 1456 weekly solution files from 1993.0 to 2021.0 includ-ing station coordinates and Earth orientation parameters (EOPs). The data come from fourteen DORIS satellites: TOPEX/Poseidon, SPOT-2, SPOT-3, SPOT-4, SPOT-5, Envisat, Jason-1, Jason-2, Cryosat-2, Saral, HY-2A, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B. In their processing, the four analysis centers which contributed to the DORIS combined solution used the latest time variable gravity models, the new mean pole and diurnal-subdiurnal tidal EOP models recommended by IERS. In addition, all the analysis centers included in their processing precise SPOT-5 solar panel angle values and quaternions for, at least, the Jason satellites. Furthermore, a new Alcatel phase center variation model was implemented for the ITRF2020 processing. The main objective of this study is to present the combination process and to analyze the impact of the new modeling on the performance of the new combined solution. Comparisons with the IDS contribution to ITRF2014 show that i) the application of the new phase center variations for the Alcatel DORIS ground antennas in the data processing combined with the gradual replacement over time of the Alcatel by Starec antennas implies a scale drift from 1993.0 to 2002.5 and ii) thanks to a better modeling of the surface forces on the satellites, the new combined solution shows smaller annual and 118-day signals in the geocenter. A new DORIS terrestrial reference frame was computed to evaluate the intrinsic quality of the new combined solution. That evaluation shows that over almost the full time span the intrinsic IDS scale values lie in a range of +/- 5 mm. After mid-2008, the new DORIS reference frame has an internal position consistency in North-East-Up better than 7:5 mm.(c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detecting abandoned citrus crops using Sentinel-2 time series. A case study in the Comunitat Valenciana
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment (ALA) is becoming a growing phenomenon around the world that needs to be monitored and quantified. A massive abandonment of citrus orchards has been experienced in the last years in the Comunitat Valenciana (CV) region (Spain) driven by different socio-economic factors. Therefore, developing time and cost-efficient methods for monitoring ALA is a priority. Citrus are a perennial crop trees which make orchards have low spectral variation during the year. In the CV region, they are planted in relatively small parcels, thus creating a highly fragmented and heterogeneous landscape. This study proposes a machine learningbased classification framework that uses annual time series of spectral indices extracted from Sentinel-2 images to identify crop status at parcel level. The method is based on features extracted from the reconstructed OSAVI and NDMI time series used to train a Random Forest classifier. Then, a parcel-based classification is performed using the parcel boundaries and the probabilities of belonging to each category for the full pixels inside the boundaries. The research assessed the potential to identify three statuses of crops (non-productive, productive, and abandoned). Results on three different temporal and spatial datasets provided an overall accuracy ranging from 89 to 92 %, demonstrating the importance of multi-temporal data to identify the abandonment of perennial crops. Furthermore, we studied the ability of the model to be spatially and temporally transferred. Limitations to recall the abandoned parcels when using models trained in other areas or time periods are exposed, opening the way to model improvements.

TI  - Evapotranspiration partitioning and agricultural drought quantification with an optical trapezoidal framework
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Optical Trapezoidal method is a recently proposed method using solely optical remote sensing data with promising potential in hydroclimatic applications; however, its application in evapotranspiration (ET) parti-tioning is still questionable. This study therefore improved an Optical Trapezoidal-based Evaporative Fraction (OPTREF) model reliant on the physical association between soil surface properties and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (STR). The proposed model was parameterized using trapezoidal shapes formed by STR and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) retrieved from Sentinel-2 to compute contribution of transpiration to ET (T/ET) in the Central Valley region of California, United States. Results indicated that the OPTREF model efficiently captured regional plant characteristics and seasonal variation of T/ET for three typical land cover types in study region (cropland, grassland, and savanna), particularly T/ET discrepancies rising from alternative cropping systems in cropland. Importantly, predicted T/ET values were in good agreement with previous modelling and empirical reports; for example, T/ET ranges in [0.37-0.75] for cropland, [0.30-0.82] for grassland, and [0.39-0.77] for savanna. In addition, applicability of the OPTREF approach was investigated in tracking agricultural drought using evaporative drought index (EDI), together with analysis of physiological response of T/ET to drought. The OPTREF-based EDI consistently reflected the same drought patterns indicated by records of vegetation health index and drought area percentages data from NOAA. Also, our findings un-covered that under extreme drought, the T/ET ratio is likely to increase and might be approximately equal to 1.0 in areas covered by drought-tolerant plants. Overall, this OPTREF approach offers novelty, simplicity, and versatility to satellite-based remote sensing of ET partitioning and identifying agricultural drought, especially in the context of rapid climate variation.

In eastern India, tea plantations have a significant role in its economy. Sonitpur, Jorhat, Sibsagar, Dibrugarh, and Tinsukia are major tea-producing districts in Assam. Due to the rapid increase in tea plantations and the burgeoning population, a detailed mapping and regular monitoring of tea plantations are imperative for understanding land use alteration.ObjectivesThe present study aims to analyse the dynamics of tea plantations from 1990 to 2022 at a decadal scale, using satellite data, such as Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2.MethodsA supervised classifier called Random Forest (RF) was deployed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to classify tea plantations.ResultsThe results showed significant growth in tea plantations in the district of Dibrugarh (112%), whereas the remaining districts had a growth rate of 45-89%. During 32 years (1990-2022), about 1280.47 km(2) (78.71%) of areas of tea plantations expanded across five districts of Assam. Precision and recall were used to measure the accuracy of tea plantations classification, which exhibited considerably high F1 scores (0.80 to 0.96).ConclusionsThis study helps to demonstrate the application of remote sensing techniques to evaluate the dynamics of tea plantations which can help policymakers to manage the tea estates and underlying changes in land cover.

TI  - Prediction of Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis in Clinically Node-Negative T1 and T2 Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma Using Supervised Machine Learning Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is generally considered an indolent cancer. However, patients with cervical lymph node metastasis (LNM) have a higher risk of local recurrence. This study evaluated and compared four machine learning (ML)-based classifiers to predict the presence of cervical LNM in clinically node-negative (cN0) T1 and T2 PTC patients. The algorithm was developed using clinicopathological data from 288 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and prophylactic central neck dissection, with sentinel lymph node biopsy performed to identify lateral LNM. The final ML classifier was selected based on the highest specificity and the lowest degree of overfitting while maintaining a sensitivity of 95%. Among the models evaluated, the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier was found to be the best fit, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72, and sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, F1 and F2 scores of 98%, 27%, 56%, 93%, 72%, and 85%, respectively. A web application based on a sensitivity-optimized kNN classifier was also created to predict the potential of cervical LNM, allowing users to explore and potentially build upon the model. These findings suggest that ML can improve the prediction of LNM in cN0 T1 and T2 PTC patients, thereby aiding in individual treatment planning.

TI  - Machine Learning Algorithms for the Estimation of Water Quality Parameters in Lake Llanquihue in Southern Chile
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The world's water ecosystems have been affected by various human activities. Artificial intelligence techniques, especially machine learning, have become an important tool for predicting the water quality of inland aquatic ecosystems. As an excellent biological indicator, chlorophyll-a was studied to determine the state of water quality in Lake Llanquihue, located in southern Chile. A 31-year time series (1989 to 2020) of data collected in situ was used to determine the evolution of limnological parameters at eight spaced stations covering all of the main points of the lake, and the year, month, day, and hour time intervals were selected. Using machine learning techniques, out of eight estimation algorithms that were applied with real data to estimate chlorophyll-a, three models showed better performance (XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost). The results for the best models show excellent performance, with a coefficient of determination between 0.81 and 0.99, a root-mean-square error of between 0.03 ug/L and 0.46 ug/L, and a mean bias error of between 0.01 and 0.27 ug/L. These models are scalable and applicable to other lake systems of interest that present similar conditions and can support decision making related to water resources.

TI  - On precise orbit determination based on DORIS, GPS and SLR using Sentinel-3A/B and-6A and subsequent reference frame determination based on DORIS-only
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Helmholtz-Zentrum Potsdam GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences is one of the Associate Analysis Centers of the International Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite (DORIS) Service (IDS). In the framework of a recent reprocessing campaign for the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) the suite of DORIS-derived satellite products was extended and improved with respect to reference frame determination. Among others the Copernicus Sentinel-3A/3B and 6A Michael Freilich (MF) satellites were used for this purpose. The orbits were generated based on DORIS-only and on the combination of DORIS and Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) observations, and attempts were made to optimize their accuracy. Also for these satellites, GFZ gen-erates Global Positioning System (GPS) based orbits within the Copernicus Precise Orbit Determination (CPOD) quality working group (CPOD-QWG). The GPS orbits contribute to a combined CPOD orbit solution, which is assumed to have superior absolute accuracy and minimal residual systematic errors. The DORIS-only, the combined DORIS and SLR, and the GPS-only orbits are compared to the CPOD combined solution serving as reference solution. The accuracy of the orbits shows up in radial direction for all techniques and combinations with values of 0.60 to 0.82 cm. In transverse and normal direction the RMS values achieved with GPS are up to around 50% lower as with DORIS, which sizes at around 1.5-2 cm. Subsequently the reference points of the observation techniques were esti-mated. With a multi-technique approach, a center-of-mass deviation according to Montenbruck et al. (2017) could be reproduced for Sentinel-3A. In addition, for both Sentinel-3 satellites the DORIS reference point values show a deviation in normal direction of 8-9 mm and a drift in radial direction of about 3 mm/year with respect to manufacturer's data, reference point values for Sentinel-6A (MF) show a good agreement. With the confidence gained on the DORIS-only orbit solutions, weekly local reference frames are com-puted for each of the three satellites as well as a combined solution and evaluated in terms of the reference frame defining parameters, i.e. origin, scale, and orientation. The accuracy achieved here is in the range of a few mm to cm region. The scale remains stable, except for Sentinel-3A, which shows a scale drift of about-1.5 mm/year, whose cause is not clear yet. Standard deviations of station coordinate residuals (North, East, Up) are in the range of 2-4 mm, 5-9 mm and 5-7 mm respectively. (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The GOP analysis center: DORIS contribution to ITRF2020
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Geodetic Observatory Pecny ' (GOP) analysis center of the International DORIS Service (IDS) has participated in the ITRF2020 IDS DORIS data reprocessing. This participation followed previous contributions for the ITRF2014 and ITRF2008. The processing standards have changed since the ITRF2014 realization, in particular by switching to data processing based on RINEX observation files, keeping compatibility with the recent operational version of the IERS2010 conventions and with the IDS recommendations. The orbit parametrization and various models have been updated to reach the recent highest standards. The analysis strategy is completely inde-pendent of the auxiliary information from the data provider such as quality indicators and center of mass corrections. Several testing campaigns have been performed to optimize the strategy. Jason-1 data have been completely excluded, while SPOT-5 data have fully contributed. A specific strategy for handling the South Atlantic Anomaly was applied for the satellites SPOT-5 and Jason-3.When compared to the GOP solution for ITRF2014, changes in modeling and processing strategy resulted in several significant improvements in the solution statistics and the series of estimated parameters as the stability of the scale and the scattering of the trans-lation series. The analysis of the WRMS of the station position residuals confirmed improvements in particular between mid-2002 and mid-2008 (reduction by more than 1 mm) and after mid-2008 (reduction by about 3 mm). The decrease of the standard deviations in the estimated pole coordinate series reaches 40 percent after adding of Jason-2 in mid-2008. (c) 2022 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - On the potential of Sentinel-1 for sub-field scale soil moisture monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) datasets at high spatial resolutions are beneficial for a wide range of applications, such as monitoring and prediction of hydrological extremes, numerical weather prediction, and precision agriculture. For large scale applications in particular, remotely sensed SM has advantages over in situ data because it provides gridded estimates and because it is less labour-intensive. However, until present, active microwave SM data have not been presented at their native spatial resolution, since the quality of these data is limited by speckle. We explored the potential and limits of high spatial resolution of active microwave SM observations. We used a Sentinel-1 C-band SAR SM dataset at six spatial resolutions ranging from 20 x 20 to 120 x 120 m2. This was compared to a closely spaced (20 m) in situ dataset collected on a non-irrigated agricultural field (+/- 2.5 ha) in the Southeast of Luxembourg. A comparison of the field and satellite datasets demonstrated how Sentinel-1 data with a high spatial resolution can be used to quantify temporal within-field SM variability. SM was accurately estimated at spatial resolutions of 60 x 60 m2 and coarser, where the temporal correlation was found to be 0.67 and sub-field variations in SM were still detected. Spatial correlation was limited by the absence of SM variability within the field. These results indicate that high spatial resolution SM estimates from Sentinel-1 data can be valuable for monitoring temporal SM variations within agricultural fields.

TI  - Trends of Axillary Treatment in Sentinel Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Mastectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The ACOSOG-Z0011- and the AMAROS-trial obviated the need for axillary surgery in most sentinel node-positive (SLN+) breast cancer patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS). Data for patients who undergo mastectomy is scarce. The purpose of this study was to investigate patterns of axillary treatment in SLN+ patients treated by mastectomy in the years after the publication of landmark studies regarding axillary treatment in SLN+ breast cancer patients undergoing BCS.Methods This was a population-based study in cT1-3N0M0 breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy and staged as SLN+ between 2009 and 2018. The performance of an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and/or administration of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) were primary outcomes and were studied over time.Results The study included 10,633 patients. The frequency of ALND performance decreased from 78% in 2009 to 10% in 2018, whereas PMRT increased from 4 to 49% (P < 0.001). In >= N1a patients, ALND performance decreased from 93 to 20%, whereas PMRT increased to 70% (P < 0.001). In N1mi and N0itc patients, ALND was abandoned during the study period, whereas PMRT increased to 38% and 13% respectively (P < 0.001), respectively. Age, tumor subtype, N-stage, and hospital type affected the likelihood that patients underwent ALND.Conclusions In this study in SLN+ breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomy, use of ALND decreased drastically over time. By the end of 2018 most >= N1a patients received PMRT as the only adjuvant axillary treatment, whereas the majority of N1mi and N0itc patients received no additional treatment.

TI  - New devices in radioguided surgery
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - PurposeMolecular imaging technologies are increasingly used not only to diagnose, monitor and guide cancer treatment, but also to intraoperatively identify disease. Radioguided surgery (RGS), one of the earliest and still most used forms of interventional molecular imaging, allows selective resection of tissues previously marked with a radiotracer (molecular targeted image-guided surgery). Classical applications, using handheld probes or portable devices, range from implanted radioactive seeds to detection of local administered radiotracer deposits in either the tumor or sentinel lymph nodes. There are, however, specific restrictions and limitations, but also great potentials, requiring refurbishment or improvement of these conventional devices.MethodsThis narrative review provides an overview of the diversity of technologies available in the conventional and more advanced uses of RGS, such as robotic laparoscopic surgery and the newest issues to be potentially implemented toward full integration of radioguidance and hybrid guidance modalities.ResultsSurgical planning is enhanced by the information provided by presurgical scintigraphies with the aid of SPECT/CT and PET/CT, essential in those cases with a complex anatomical area, drainage or tracer distribution. Radioguidance modalities for low- to mid-energy gamma emitting tracers remain the most widely applied issues in RGS. PET probes have been available for over 20 years, but despite the high prevalence and clinical relevance of PET scanning, they have not found a routine place in RGS for cancer yet. beta probes could help to precisely define clear tumor margin resection and could potentially support lesion detection in high background areas. New designs and technologies have been introduced such as flexible DROP-IN probes, Click-On probes and combined technologies (optical, bimodal devices) to improve radioguidance.ConclusionsA significant growth in RGS has been observed during the last 30 years. The appearance of new clinical demands, the introduction of robot-assisted procedures and the steps to modernize RGS equipment warrant the evolution and refinement of conventional devices to improve the detection in the era of precision medicine.

TI  - Research on the Monitoring Ability of Fengyun-Based Quantitative Precipitation Estimates for Capturing Heavy Precipitation: A Case Study of the "7.20" Rainstorm in Henan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important tasks of the Chinese geostationary and meteorological satellite Fengyun-2 (FY2) series is to provide quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) with high spatiotemporal resolutions for East Asia. To analyze the monitoring capabilities of FY2-based QPEs in extreme rainfall events, this study comprehensively evaluated and compared the performances of FY-2G and FY-2H QPEs for the "7.20" rainstorm in Henan province, China from 17 July 2021 to 22 July 2021. Three continuous metrics and three categorical metrics were adopted to assess the accuracies of FY-2G and FY-2H QPEs, referenced by gauge observations from 116 meteorological stations. The results show that the FY-2G QPE has lower BIAS (-9.64% for FY-2G, -46.22% for FY-2H) and RMSE (5.83 mm/h for FY-2G, 8.4 mm/h for FY-2H) and higher CC (0.57 for FY-2G, 0.24 for FY-2H) than FY-2H QPE in this rainstorm event. Moreover, the FY-2G QPE is not only more consistent with the ground reference with respect to the rainfall amount, but also has higher detecting capability in the "7.20" rainstorm event when compared with the FY-2H QPE. The FY-2G QPE presented a higher capability to correctly capture the precipitation event for the "7.20" rainstorm because of higher POD (probability of detection) and CSI (critical success index) relative to FY-2H QPE, especially in complex topography. From the spatial distribution of precipitation amount, the FY-2G QPE captured the rainstorm center of extreme precipitation more accurately relative to the latest FY-2H product. On the other hand, the previous generation of FY-2G QPE was closer to the continuous rainfall process and precipitation duration with ground observations than the latest FY-2H QPE. Therefore, the precipitation retrieval algorithm of FY-2H QPE still had room to improve. It is necessary to introduce error correction algorithms, especially in complex topography for rainstorm events.

TI  - Spatial Probability Characteristics of Waves Generated by Polar Lows in Nordic and Barents Seas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar lows (PLs) are mesoscale, up to 1000 km, rather short lifetime (less than 15-30 h) cyclonic atmospheric systems formed in polar latitudes and associated with cold outbreak events. Strong winds, higher than 15 m/s, can then generate high surface waves which may pose danger to marine and coastal infrastructures. To investigate the probability of high waves generated by PLs in the Nordic and Barents Seas, analysis can be performed using available PL statistical distributions obtained from satellite passive microwave data, MODIS infrared imagery and ASCAT scatterometer data. Classical self-similar laws for wind waves development based on the extended duration concept are used to obtain first-guess estimates of significant wave height and the wavelength of waves generated by PL. All possible combinations of PL parameters (maximum wind speed, lifetime, diameter, translation velocity and direction of propagation) are considered to obtain the occurrence of waves exceeding specified levels, ranging from 2 to 15 m for significant wave height and from 100 to 500 m for wavelength. Particularly, PL-generated waves higher than 4 m occur up to 6 times a year, higher than 8 m occur up to 2-3 times a year, higher than 10 m occur up to once a year, the probability of 12 m waves is one event in several years and 15 m SWHs occur less than once in a decade. The area most affected by strong waves from PLs is the near shore zone around the Scandinavian peninsula, northward from the North Cape. The relative contribution of PLs in the formation of the waves field in the Nordic and Barents Seas is discussed.

TI  - Synergy of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Imagery for Crop Classification Based on DC-CNN
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, remote sensing technology has become an important means to obtain accurate agricultural production information, such as crop type distribution, due to its advantages of large coverage and a short observation period. Nowadays, the cooperative use of multi-source remote sensing imagery has become a new development trend in the field of crop classification. In this paper, the polarimetric components of Sentinel-1 (S-1) decomposed by a new model-based decomposition method adapted to dual-polarized SAR data were introduced into crop classification for the first time. Furthermore, a Dual-Channel Convolutional Neural Network (DC-CNN) with feature extraction, feature fusion, and encoder-decoder modules for crop classification based on S-1 and Sentinel-2 (S-2) was constructed. The two branches can learn from each other by sharing parameters so as to effectively integrate the features extracted from multi-source data and obtain a high-precision crop classification map. In the proposed method, firstly, the backscattering components (VV, VH) and polarimetric components (volume scattering, remaining scattering) were obtained from S-1, and the multispectral feature was extracted from S-2. Four candidate combinations of multi-source features were formed with the above features. Following that, the optimal one was found on a trial. Next, the characteristics of optimal combinations were input into the corresponding network branches. In the feature extraction module, the features with strong collaboration ability in multi-source data were learned by parameter sharing, and they were deeply fused in the feature fusion module and encoder-decoder module to obtain more accurate classification results. The experimental results showed that the polarimetric components, which increased the difference between crop categories and reduced the misclassification rate, played an important role in crop classification. Among the four candidate feature combinations, the combination of S-1 and S-2 features had a higher classification accuracy than using a single data source, and the classification accuracy was the highest when two polarimetric components were utilized simultaneously. On the basis of the optimal combination of features, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified. The classification accuracy of DC-CNN reached 98.40%, with Kappa scoring 0.98 and Macro-F1 scoring 0.98, compared to 2D-CNN (OA reached 94.87%, Kappa scored 0.92, and Macro-F1 scored 0.95), FCN (OA reached 96.27%, Kappa scored 0.94, and Macro-F1 scored 0.96), and SegNet (OA reached 96.90%, Kappa scored 0.95, and Macro-F1 scored 0.97). The results of this study demonstrated that the proposed method had significant potential for crop classification.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Evolution of Inland Lakes and Their Relationship with Hydro-Meteorological Factors in Horqin Sandy Land, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the inland closed area of Horqin Sandy Land, China, lakes are the most important source of water, and they maintain the regional hydrological balance and ecosystem health. Clarifying long-term continuous changes of inland lake surface area and water storage in the sandy land is thus of great significance to the management of water resources in arid and semi-arid areas. This study estimated changes in the surface area and water storage of small lakes in the sandy land during 1984-2021 using a multiple index threshold method and an empirical equation based on Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM (digital elevation model) data and Landsat 5/7/8 images. Hydro-meteorological variables were also incorporated to explore their potential relationship with changes in the lake elements. The lakes in the sandy land resemble stars or dots, with distinct inhomogeneity. Permanent lakes account for the majority of the total lake area, mostly distributed in the center and east of the study area, whereas most seasonal lakes are small water bodies, with surface areas of 0.1-0.5 km(2) and irregularly distributed. Lake surface area and water storage underwent frequent changes during the 38 years, and could be divided into three characteristic fluctuation phases. From 1984 to 1999, the lake surface area fluctuated greatly, and the water storage increased by approximately 0.3732 Gt, with an average expansion rate of 0.0572 Gt/y. Specifically, lakes with a surface area >2 km(2) primarily accounted for the expansion. From 1999 to 2004, the lake area shrank sharply to the lowest point, and the water storage capacity decreased by approximately 0.4003 Gt. From 2004 to 2021, the lake surface area and water storage tended to be stable. Annual fluctuations of lake surface area and water storage were mostly affected by precipitation and evapotranspiration, followed by vapor pressure deficit, wet day frequency, and temperature, which have significant periodicity and hysteresis.

TI  - Evaluating the Capability of Sentinel-1 Data in the Classification of Canola and Wheat at Different Growth Stages and in Different Years
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canola and wheat are the main oilseed crop and grain crop, respectively, and they often have similar phenological stages. The understanding of the interactions between microwave signals with wheat and canola in different stages is important for their monitoring using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. This paper investigates the characteristics of canola and wheat through the use of backscattering profiles from multi-year Sentinel-1 images. Large fluctuations are observed for the temporal backscattering profiles of canola and wheat in different growth statuses induced by agrometeorological conditions in different years. The capability and stability of Sentinel-1 for wheat and canola mapping is further investigated using single- and multi-temporal SAR images hosted in Google Earth Engine (GEE) using the random forest classifier. Although different agrometeorological conditions and field managements make the temporal profiles of backscattering variations, the large difference in canopy structure allows SAR images to make the separability of canola and wheat stable on Sentinel-1 images in different phenology stages. The classification accuracies and the feature importance scores from multi-temporal classification in different years show that the backscattering features obtained at flowering to maturity stages make more contributions to the good-quality mapping of canola and wheat than those at other stages. The F1 scores of canola and wheat achieve 0.95 during the canola flowering and podding period, and the minimum F1 scores of 0.85 were also obtained at other stages. These findings show that SAR images have great potential in the good-quality mapping of canola and wheat in a wide phenology window.

TI  - Mapping spatial and temporal distribution information of plantations in Guangxi from 2000 to 2020
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Plantations are formed entirely by artificial planting which are different from natural forests. The rapid expansion of plantation forestry has brought about a series of ecological and environmental problems. Timely and accurate information on the distribution of plantation resources and continuous monitoring of the dynamic changes in plantations are of great significance. However, plantations have similar spectral and texture characteristics with natural forests. In addition, cloud and rain greatly affected the image quality of large area mapping. Here, we tested the possibility of applying Continuous Change Detection and Classification to distinguish plantations from natural forests and described the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of plantations. We adopted the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm and used all available Landsat images from 2000 to 2020 to map annual plantation forest distribution in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China and analyzed their spatial and temporal dynamic changes. The overall accuracy of the plantation extraction is 88.77%. Plantations in Guangxi increased significantly in the past 20 years, from 2.37 x 10(6) ha to 5.11 x 10(6) ha. Guangxi is expanding new plantation land every year, with the largest expansion area in 2009 of about 2.58 x 10(5) ha. Over the past 20 years, plantations in Guangxi have clearly shown a tendency to expand from the southeast to the northwest, transformed from natural forests and farmland. 30% of plantations have experienced at least one logging-and-replanting rotation event. Logging rotation events more intensively occur in areas with dense plantation forests. Our study proves that using fitting coefficients from Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm is effective to extract plantations and mitigating the adverse effects of clouds and rain on optical images in a large scale, which provides a fast and effective method for long-time and large-area plantation identification and spatiotemporal distribution information extraction, and strong data support and decision reference for plantation investigation, monitoring and management.

TI  - Fully automated land surface temperature downscaling based on RGB very high spatial resolution images
T2  - CITY AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Downscaling is a particularly needed process in many environmental, social and governance applications at the fine scale. The need for an automated and reliable very high spatial resolution downscaling approach is then required. In this paper, a fully-automated open-access downscaling approach was proposed, named HSR-LST. It is based on the High Spatial Resolution (HSR) Red, Green and Blue (RGB) bands collected from commercial and free-to-access satellite images, generating LST values lower than 2-m spatial resolutions. This is based on the Landsat-8 thermal datasets and while implementing a fully-automated Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) approach. HSR-LST was implemented over Beirut, Boston and Dubai between 2016 and 2018. In comparison to an airborne LST image captured over ElKhorn River in Nebraska, USA, HSR-LST showed an AME of 0.88 degrees C and a R-squared value of 86.33%. Main results showed the variability of LST based on the sensed land features' type. Different LST distribution footprints (i.e., irregular in Beirut, intermitted in Boston, systematic in Dubai) were highlighted depicting a characteristic urban configuration in each city. This latter along buildings' material, density and height appear also to show a different effect on the local and surrounding LST values. By implementing the automated HSR-LST model in cities around the Globe, urban planners, policy makers and inhabitants can acquire improved information to assess urban heat islands, to propose more adequate planning policies, but more importantly to tackle urban heat and thermal comfort at the finest scales. HST-LST will effectively address the low spatial resolution of thermal bands. As HSR-LST is both automated and dynamic, it can be portable to other urban areas with diverse climatic regions.

TI  - Climate-induced vegetation dynamics associated with the prevalence of charcoal oak disease in Zagros forests
T2  - INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Zagros forests are the important ecosystem for water and soil protection. Recently, these forests have been affected by extensive die-back associated with drought and pathogens. In this study, an epidemiological approach was adopted to investigate oak die-back in four sites of unexplored Zagros forests of western Iran, Lorestan. The pathogenic agent was identified and an index of disease severity (IDS) was designated for more than 100 trees in each site. High-risk zone mapping was determined based on disease dispersal and inverse distance weighting (IDW) was utilized for interpolation analysis. To evaluate the precipitation role in the regeneration of oak sites, remote sensing (RS) analysis (using NDVI) was carried out based on the processing of Sentinel-2A satellite images from 2016 to 2019, and the logistic regression (LR) model was used to study the correlation between disease incidence and climatic factors. Mean annual maximum temperature (MAMT), mean annual relative humidity (MARH), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and wet-bulb temperature (WBT) of 10 years were included as independent variables. An ITS-based phylogenetic analysis showed that the isolated fungus infecting the oak trees was Biscogniauxia mediterranea. Also, the Sarab-Doure area with a value of 321.5 ranked as the most infected area followed by Mela-Shabane (232.3) and Sarab-Navkesh (168.6), and Kaka-Reza was the healthy area, Kruskal-Wallis test (chi-square; p-value < 0.0001). Based on the LR model, the highest risk was predicted at MAMT of 28 degrees C (Wald chi 2 = 6.61, p-value < 0.05), MARH of 38% (Wald chi 2 = 6.20, p-value < 0.01), and wet-bulb temperature (WBT) of 11 degrees C (Wald chi 2 = 4.84, p-value < 0.02). Compared to the infected areas, the healthy site, Kaka-Reza, had a significantly greater degree of NDVI from 2016 to 2019. In 2019, NDVI value for all studied sites increased which is promising for the rehabilitation of the infected forest areas. IDW analysis showed that the west of the province is more prone to die-back. Overall, this study showed that oak decline syndrome is extremely a drought-induced phenomenon in the Zagros regions.

TI  - Analysis of Relationship between Grain Yield and NDVI from MODIS in the Fez-Meknes Region, Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the relationship between cereal yield and the remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is of great importance to decision-makers and agricultural stakeholders. In this study, an approach based on the Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression is carried out to reveal the relationship between cereal yield and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data in the Fez-Meknes region of Morocco. The results obtained show strong correlations reaching 0.70 to 0.89 between the NDVI and grain yield. The linear regression model explains 58 to 79% of the variability in yield in regional provinces marked by the importance of cereal cultivation, and 51 to 53% in the mountainous provinces with less agricultural land devoted to major cereals. The regression slopes indicate that a 0.1 increase in the NDVI results in an expected increase in grain yield of 4.9 to 8.7 quintals (q) per ha, with an average of 6.8 q/ha throughout the Fez-Meknes region. The RMSE ranges from 2.12 to 4.96 q/ha. These results are promising in terms of early yield forecasting based on MODIS-NDVI data, and consequently, in terms of grain import planning, especially since the national grain production does not cover the demand. Such remote sensing data are therefore essential for administrations that are in charge of food security decisions.

TI  - The role of teacher agency in using GIS to teach sustainability: an evaluation of a lower secondary school story mapping GIS initiative in Ireland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN GEOGRAPHICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - This paper investigates the role of teacher agency for those who were trained in using an innovative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) approach and incorporated GIS into their teaching. While national curricula increasingly emphasise STEM and sustainability approaches, there has been limited analysis of how teachers can bring new software, including GIS, and new approaches into the classroom. Through an evaluation of a teaching initiative "5*S: Space, Surveyors and Students - STEM and the Sustainable Development Goals" designed to bring GIS technology, satellite data, and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into classrooms as activities and resources for teachers and students in Ireland, we examine how teachers can introduce new teaching strategies and platforms into their classrooms. In interviews and a focus group, teachers expressed eagerness for GIS teaching resources for the classroom and identified effective ways they were able to draw on their own teaching philosophy in introducing new concepts around sustainability and STEM education in the classroom. We argue that teacher agency and autonomy play an important role in the ability and development of teachers, departments, and schools to bring new approaches and GIS into the classroom, and we identify key learnings from teachers who were able to utilise the 5*S resources.

TI  - Remote sensing data applied to the reconstruction of volcanic activity in the Valley of the Volcanoes, Central Volcanic Zone, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Valley of the Volcanoes is a representative area of the extension of the Quaternary Andahua Group with which it overlaps. Some of its eruption centres have renewed activity after more than 500 ka. Recreating the history of the Valley of the Volcanoes activity required satellite data and remote sensing-based methods for visualizing the terrain surface. We used SRTM 30 m DEM, channels 4, 3, 2; Landsat 7, 8 and ASTER images. We verified and refined the obtained data during field works using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to create of 3D models of selected geoforms. Satellite data allowed us to create: Red Relief Image Map, Topographic Position Index and Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) maps. In the Valley of the Volcanoes, we analysed 12 lava fields with a total area of 326.3 km2 and a volume of approx. 20 km3. We determined the number of eruption centres that yielded to 41 small lava domes and 23 scoria cones. This domes are classified as monogenetic volcanoes, however five of them can be considered polygenetic e.g. Puca Mauras. We used NDVI to develop chronology map of lavas. This allowed us to extract same-age eruption centres and associated volcanoes that represent the same eruptive time phase connected by fault lines: first generation (0.5-0.27 Ma) NW-SE and NE -SW, second (Pleistocene/Holocene) NNW-SSE and third (Holocene-Historical) again NW-SE and NE-SW. We carried out the reconstruction of the central part of the Valley of the Volcanoes because only there repeated phases of volcanic activity can be inferred with remote sensing and geological mapping. The results of this study led us to indicate that this area should be observed since it is very likely that future eruptions will occur.

TI  - Where are the outcrops? Automatic delineation of bedrock from sediments using Deep-Learning techniques
T2  - APPLIED COMPUTING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The delineating of bedrock from sediment is one of the most important phases in the fundamental process of regional bedrock identification and mapping, and it is usually manually performed using high-resolution optical remote-sensing images or Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. This task, although straightforward, is time consuming and requires extensive and specialized labor. We contribute to this line of research by proposing an automated approach that uses cloud computing, deep learning, fully convolutional neural networks, and a U-Net model applied in Google Collaboratory (Colab). Specifically, we tested this method on a site in southwestern Norway using both a set of explanatory variables generated from a 10 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and, for comparison, cloud-based Landsat 8 data. Results show an automatic delineation performance measured by an F1 score between 77% and 84% for DEM terrain derivatives against a manually-mapped ground truth. Overall, our automated bedrock identification model reveals very promising results within its constraints.

TI  - Assessment of the impact of discontinuity in satellite instruments and retrievals on global PM2.5 estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is the leading environmental risk factor for mortality globally. Satellite-derived estimates of surface PM2.5 developed from a combination of satellites, simulations, and ground monitor data are relied upon for health impact studies. The ability to develop satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates requires the continued availability of aerosol optical depth (AOD) sources. This work examines the impact of the addition or loss of satellite AOD data sources on global PM2.5 estimation and the impact of continuing the longterm record with AOD from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi-National Polar orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) satellite after the loss of the MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua satellites. We find that the addition of VIIRS S-NPP AOD products to geophysical PM2.5 estimates from satellites and simulations causes regional differences that correspond to differences in the VIIRS and MODIS Deep Blue AOD algorithms and sampling. Changes in long-term trends and timeseries due to the addition or loss of AOD data sources are generally within their uncertainties. Statistical fusion with ground monitor data partially corrects for changes due to sampling differences when introducing the VIIRS AOD products, but uncertainty remains over desert regions where ground monitor coverage is sparse. This work provides promise for the sustained development of global satellite-derived PM2.5 estimates, despite discontinuities in instruments and retrieval methods.

TI  - A novel index combining temperature and vegetation conditions for monitoring surface mining disturbance using Landsat time series
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploitation and utilization of mineral resources have significantly contributed to economic and social development; however, the procession has also negatively impacted the ecological environment. Thus, it is necessary to effectively monitor coalfields, an important basis for reasonable development and utilization of coalfields and following ecological reclamation. Based on MODIS Global Damage Index, We couple the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and proposal the Mine Landscape Damage Index (MLDI) and Mine Landscape Reclamation Index (MLRI) to supervise the disturbed vegetation of mines. Huolinhe coalfield, one of the largest mines in China, is monitored in this research. 3675 Landsat imageries from 1990 to 2020 are analyzed using the LandTrendr algorithm with MLDI and MLRI time series data on Google Earth Engine. The results demonstrate that this method could distinguish the region and disturbing process of damage and reclamation due to its effectiveness proved by visual interpretation of high-resolution imageries and verification of field investigation. The total detected area of vegetation damage was 16505.10 ha, and the vegetation damage in the mining was active from 2006 to 2011, with average annual damage of more than 1000 ha. The total area of vegetation restoration in the mine is 8640.81 ha, accounting for 52.35% of the vegetation damage. Vegetation restoration has increased gradually since 2010. In the past three years, vegetation restoration accounted for 47.61% of the total reclamation area. A novel index for monitoring the effects of surface damage in multi-open-pit mining areas is provided to us, and the detection is reliable. It can give the government an effective practical data reference in the sustainable development of utilization management and ecological reclamation in coalfield.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses to analyse the impact of land use changes on short range weather forecasts over Indian region. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulation experiments are conducted by using land use data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) satellites for pre-monsoon and monsoon season. MODIS 2001 land use is used in control (CNT) experiment and updated land use with recent urban class from MODIS (EXP1) and ISRO (EXP2) for the year 2019 is used to generate model lower boundary conditions in other two experiments. Quantitative error measures and skill score computed for rainfall forecast showed that model skill is better with the use of realistic recent land use data from MODIS and ISRO during pre-monsoon and monsoon period. Extreme Dependency Index score computed also revealed that model skill in predicting extreme rare rainfall events is improved with recent landuse data. Model simulated surface meteorological variables and profiles at lower levels also found to be improved with the inclusion of realistic land use class from MODIS and ISRO. Between the two experiments, the one which used ISRO based land use showed larger improvement particularly during the monsoon season.

TI  - Mercury poisoning in Eurasian river otter (Lutra lutra)
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - An adult male Eurasian river otter ( Lutra lutra) with ataxia and lethargy was rescued. Through the necropsy of this otter with neurological symptoms, a broad range of vascular damage caused by mercury toxicity in several organs, hepatocellular necrosis, and vacuolation in the brain. In mercury examination, liver, kidney, and hair showed values of 0.878 +/- 0.027, 1.807 +/- 0.049, and 5.712 +/- 0.102 mu g/ g, respectively. Compared with certified reference material, it was confirmed that the concentration of mercury were 6.7 times, 13.7 times, and 43.3 times higher, respectively. When the symptoms and diagnosis results were comprehensively reviewed, this otter's demise was revealed due to mercury poisoning. The mercury concentration in the liver does not exceed the lowest observed effect level of 3.4 mu g/ g. However, even at low concentrations, long-term accumulation can cause symptoms including neuropathy, and the possibility that these heavy metals have accumulated in other wild animals cannot be ruled out. It seems that continuous monitoring using sentinel animals is necessary.

TI  - Value of total tumor load as a clinical and pathological factor in the prognosis of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Comparison of three populations with three different surgical approaches: NEOVATTL Pro 3 Study
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to compare the prognosis in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) in three populations of women with breast cancer (BC) treated with neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NAST) in which axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed based on different total tumor load (TTL) thresholds in the sentinel nodes.MethodsThis was an observational, retrospective study carried out in three Spanish centers. Data from patients with infiltrating BC who underwent BC surgery after NAST and intraoperative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) performed by One Step Nucleic acid Amplification (OSNA) technique during 2017 and 2018 were analyzed. ALND was performed according to the protocol of each center, based on three different TTL cut-offs (TTL > 250, TTL > 5000, and TTL > 15,000 CK19-mRNA copies/mu L for centers 1, 2, and 3, respectively).ResultsA total of 157 BC patients were included in the study. No significant differences in DFS were observed between centers (Hazard ratio [HR] center 2 vs 1: 0.77; p = 0.707; HR center 3 vs 1: 0.83; p = 0.799). Patients with ALND had a shorter DFS (HR 2.43; p = 0.136), albeit not statistically significant. Patients with a triple negative subtype had a worse prognosis than those with other molecular subtypes (HR 2.82; p = 0.056).ConclusionNo significant differences in DFS were observed between three centers with different surgical approaches to ALND based on different TTL cut-offs in patients with BC after NAST. These results suggest that restricting ALND to those patients with TTL >= 15,000 copies/mu L is a reliable approximation, avoiding unnecessary morbidities caused by ALND.

TI  - German farmers' perceived usefulness of satellite-based index insurance: insights from a transtheoretical model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL FINANCE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeIndex insurance is promising to mitigate drought-related income losses in agriculture. To reduce the basis risk of index insurance, the integration of satellite data is of growing interest in research. The objective of this study is to obtain preliminary evidence regarding farmers' perceived usefulness (PU) of satellite-based index insurance.Design/methodology/approachBy modifying the transtheoretical model of change to a transtheoretical model of PU, German farmers' gradual PU of satellite-based index insurance was investigated.FindingsThe results show that the average farmer perceives satellite-based index insurance as useful. It can be particularly seen that a higher level of education in an agricultural context as well as higher trust in index insurance products increases farmers' gradual PU. Moreover, higher relative weather-related income losses increase farmers' gradual PU.Research limitations/implicationsIt is recommended to apply latent variables when conducting future investigations regarding farmers' PU.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore farmers' PU of upcoming satellite-based index insurance by modifying and applying the transtheoretical model in a new way.

M3  - Article
AB  - Aging leads to escalated systemic inflammation. As the sentinel of immune system, natural killer (NK) cells are early responders that sense cues and signals from target organs and swiftly orchestrate local inflammation upon their arrival. Emerging evidence indicates a profound role of NK cells in the initiation and evolution of neuro-inflammation in aging and age-related diseases. Here we discuss recent advances in NK cell biology and the organ-specific features of NK cells in normal brain aging, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke. Our increasing understanding of NK cells and their unique features in aging and age-related diseases may facilitate the future design of immune therapies targeting NK cells to benefit the old population.

TI  - The use of muscle biomarkers for assessing physiological effects of heavy metal pollution in the greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula)
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The greater white-toothed shrew Crocidura russula has been used as a sentinel species for estimating environmental risks to human populations. Previous studies in mining areas have focused on the liver of shrews as the primary target of physiological and metabolic changes due to heavy metal pollution. However, populations persist even when detoxification by the liver seems to be compromised and damage is observed. These pollutant-adapted individuals inhabiting contaminated sites may exhibit altered biochemical parameters that confer increased tolerance in various tissues other than the liver. The skeletal muscle tissue of C. russula might be an alternative tissue that allows the survival of organisms inhabiting historically polluted sites due to the detoxification of redistributed metals. Organisms from two heavy metal mine populations and one population derived from an unpolluted site were used to determine the detoxification activities, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative damage, as well as cellular energy allocation parameters and acetylcholinesterase activity (a biomarker of neurotoxicity). Muscle biomarkers differ between shrews from polluted sites and shrews from the unpolluted location, with the mine animals showing: (1) a decreased energy consumption concomitant with increased energy reserves and total available energy; (2) reduced cholinergic activity, suggesting an impairment of neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction; (3) an overall decrease in detoxification capacity and enzymatic antioxidant response and a higher level of lipid damage. Also, some of these markers differed between females and males. These changes may have resulted from a decreased detoxifying capacity of the liver and could potentially bring about significant ecological effects for this highly active species. Heavy metal pollution induced physiological changes in Crocidura russula showing that skeletal muscle may serve as a backup sink organ allowing rapid species adaptation and evolution.

TI  - A Spatial Model Comparing Above- and Belowground Blue Carbon Stocks in Southwest Florida Mangroves and Salt Marshes
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves and salt marshes store large amounts of carbon (C) in the form of plant biomass and soils that are often rich in organic matter. These C stocks have a high degree of spatial variability within and among coastal wetland ecosystem types, but quantifying location-specific C stocks is both labor intensive and time-consuming. Above- and belowground C stock data were compiled from field efforts in Southwest Florida and from published georeferenced C data. These data were used in conjunction with ecosystem maps, remote-sensing parameters, and existing vegetation models to create 30-m resolution spatial models quantifying aboveground C stocks and belowground C stocks up to 1-m depth in mangroves and salt marshes along 360 km of coast in Southwest Florida (Tampa Bay to the Everglades). Based on modeling results, mangroves and salt marshes in Southwest Florida store an average of 393.9 +/- 107.1 and 286.7 +/- 71.9 Mg C ha(-1), respectively, in above- and belowground C stocks. Soil C density and belowground C stocks increased at lower latitudes within the study region. Total C stocks in mangroves increased from 265.1 +/- 43.2 Mg ha(-1) in Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay to 409 +/- 104.4 Mg ha(-1) in the Everglades. Substrate stability and C stocks are susceptible to impacts from climate change, sea-level rise, hydrologic changes, and episodic disturbances such as tropical cyclones. The long-term storage of C in these ecosystem types depends on ecosystem stability in the face of these stressors.

TI  - Support for religious minorities' rights among (non)religious national majority group members: A motivational approach to worldviews
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY & APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Increasing religious diversity caused by immigration is often perceived as a threat to national majority members' (non)religious worldviews. However, defensive reactions to diversity are not inevitable. Building on the social identity approach and motivated identity construction theory, we argue that (non)religious worldviews that satisfy motivational needs may promote support for religious minorities' rights. We tested this hypothesis in a sample of 1,499 national majority group members in four countries with Christian traditions (Australia, Finland, Germany, and Norway). Participants reported their adherence to a (non)religious worldview in terms of their (dis)belief in God, and also the extent to which their worldview satisfied their needs for belonging, continuity, and meaning in life. The more religious worldview was perceived to satisfy these motives, the more religious majority group members supported religious minorities' rights. Worldview motive satisfaction was not associated with support for religious minorities' rights among the non-religious. In addition, perceived diversity threat was associated with weaker support for minority rights, but again, this negative effect of threat was less evident among religious participants whose religious worldview satisfied their needs for belonging, continuity, and meaning. We conclude that communities based on a shared (religious) worldview should invest in fulfilling the motivational needs of their members, to foster interreligious solidarity.

TI  - Joint Classification of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Using Binary-Tree Transformer Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The joint utilization of multi-source data is of great significance in geospatial observation applications, such as urban planning, disaster assessment, and military applications. However, this approach is confronted with challenges including inconsistent data structures, irrelevant physical properties, scarce training data, insufficient utilization of information and an imperfect feature fusion method. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel binary-tree Transformer network (BTRF-Net), which is used to fuse heterogeneous information and utilize complementarity among multi-source remote sensing data to enhance the joint classification performance of hyperspectral image (HSI) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. Firstly, a hyperspectral network (HSI-Net) is employed to extract spectral and spatial features of hyperspectral images, while the elevation information of LiDAR data is extracted using the LiDAR network (LiDAR-Net). Secondly, a multi-source transformer complementor (MSTC) is designed that utilizes the complementarity and cooperation among multi-modal feature information in remote sensing images to better capture their correlation. The multi-head complementarity attention mechanism (MHCA) within this complementor can effectively capture global features and local texture information of images, hence achieving full feature fusion. Then, to fully obtain feature information of multi-source remote sensing images, this paper designs a complete binary tree structure, binary feature search tree (BFST), which fuses multi-modal features at different network levels to obtain multiple image features with stronger representation abilities, effectively enhancing the stability and robustness of the network. Finally, several groups of experiments are designed to compare and analyze the proposed BTRF-Net with traditional methods and several advanced deep learning networks using two datasets: Houston and Trento. The results show that the proposed network outperforms other state-of-the-art methods even with small training samples.

TI  - Quantifying seasonal ground deformation in Taiyuan basin, China, by Sentinel-1 InSAR time series analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of seasonal surface deformation in areas that are subsiding/uplifting due to groundwater pumping/ recovery can indicate aquifer recharge. Understanding seasonal surface deformation and the existing relationship between triggering factors and the deformation supports effective groundwater management and subsidence mitigation. Here, we investigated seasonal ground displacement in response to the aquifer compaction and expansion due to groundwater extraction and recharge within the Taiyuan basin, Northern China. We obtained Sentinel-1 InSAR displacement time series data from 2017 to 2020 and quantitatively analyzed relationships between triggering factors (e.g., groundwater level and precipitation) and the associated displacements using wavelet-based methods. The results show that the seasonal deformation is concentrated in the irrigated areas within the central basin, with a 1-year periodicity. The annual peak-to-peak amplitude was up to 2 cm, peaking in March with troughs in August. This seasonality present in the displacement time series is found to be 'in-phase' with respect to groundwater levels and 'anti-phase' in relation to natural precipitation. These results are consistent with the irrigation pumping practices in the basin, with increased groundwater withdrawals to meet irrigation water demand prior to the monsoon precipitation season, resulting in water level decline and land subsidence from mid-March to mid-August. During the non-irrigated season, groundwater extraction decreases, and the aquifer systems are replenished by precipitation, causing water levels to recover and the ground to uplift from late August to mid-March. A geological analysis indicates that the seasonal deformation is controlled by the thickness of Quaternary strata and fault systems, which play a critical role in forming the earth fissures in the basin. The elastic and inelastic deformation was separated; the estimated elastic/inelastic ratio was about 0.6-0.7, indicating that the inelastic component dominates the main aquifer compaction in the central basin. Our analysis is of hydrologic importance which could be used to guide groundwater management and subsidence mitigation, given the inter-basin water diversion projects in this arid basin.

TI  - Study on the spatio-temporal evolution and influencing factors of farmland abandonment on a county scale
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The protection of farmland resources is related to world food security, as well as the smooth realization of the goals of UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and China's Rural Revitalization Plan. As the most active region in the global economic development and one of the main grain producing areas, the problem of farmland abandonment in the Yangtze River Delta gradually appears with the rapid development of urbanization. Therefore, based on the interpretation data of remote sensing images and field survey data of three periods in 2000, 2010, and 2018, this study used Moran's I and geographical barycenter model to reveal the spatiotemporal evolution law of farmland abandonment in Pingyang County of the Yangtze River Delta. And then, this study selected 10 indicators covering four categories: geography, proximity, distance, and policy, and used random forest model to reveal the main influencing factors of farmland abandonment in the study area. The results showed that the abandoned farmland increased from 441.58 hm(2) in 2000 to 5797.40 hm(2) in 2018. The hot spot and barycenter of land abandonment gradually shifted from the western mountainous areas to the eastern plain areas. Altitude and slope were the main factors affecting the farmland abandonment. The high the altitude and the great the slope, the farmland abandonment in mountainous areas were serious. The proximity factors had a greater impact on the expansion of farmland abandonment from 2000 to 2010, and then the impact weakened. In view of the above analysis, the countermeasures and suggestions for maintaining food security were finally put forward.

T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution process of socio-ecological systems from 1990 to 2020 in the Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, located in the National Key Ecological Function Area of western China, was analyzed quantitatively based on resilience theory and methodology combined with catastrophe theory and adaptive cycle theory, through field investigation, questionnaires and interviews, social data collection and remote sensing data analysis. The results show that the coordinated development of socio-ecological systems has made great progress in recent decades in the study area, and the coordinated development of social systems and ecosystems has a high degree of coupling and a strong connection. Changes in ecosystem resilience regularly surpassed changes in the social system, indicating the significant impact and success of ecological protection policies and projects in recent decades. In future, improvements in the social sub-system will be the key to developing the socio-ecological system in the study area. Enhancing social sub-system resiliency, implementing transformational development and green industry development, and transforming and realizing ecological product values are important topics for further investigation in the study area. Substantial changes in policy, production, population and climate change are needed to promote the evolution of socio-ecological systems. Stable national policies are crucial for improving people's livelihoods and providing ecological protections.

TI  - Estimation of Instantaneous Air Temperature under All-Weather Conditions Based on MODIS Products in North and Southwest China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (T-a) is a common meteorological element involved in many fields, such as surface energy exchange and water circulation. Consequently, accurate T-a estimation is essential for the establishment of hydrological, climate, and environmental models. Unlike most studies concerned with the estimation of daily T-a from land surface temperature, this study focused on the estimation of instantaneous T-a from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) atmospheric profile products aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. The applicability of various estimation methods was examined in two regions with different geomorphological and climate conditions, North and Southwest China. Specifically, the spatiotemporal trend of T-a under clear sky conditions can be reflected by the atmospheric profile extrapolation and average methods. However, the accuracy of T-a estimation was poor, with root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 3.5 to 5.2 degrees C for North China and from 4.0 to 7.7 degrees C for Southwest China. The multiple linear regression model significantly improved the accuracy of Ta estimation by introducing auxiliary data, resulting in RMSE of 1.6 and 1.5 degrees C in North China and RMSE of 2.2 and 2.3 degrees C in Southwest China for the Terra and Aqua datasets, respectively. Since atmospheric profile products only provide information under clear sky conditions, a new multiple linear regression model was established to estimate the instantaneous T-a under cloudy sky conditions independently from atmospheric profile products, resulting in RMSE of 1.9 and 1.9 degrees C in North China and RMSE of 2.5 and 2.8 degrees C in Southwest China, for the Terra and Aqua datasets, respectively. Finally, instantaneous T-a products with high accuracy were generated for all-weather conditions in the study regions to analyze their Ta spatial patterns. The accuracy of T-a estimation varies depending on MODIS datasets, regions, elevation, and land cover types.

TI  - Mapping alteration zones in the Southern section of Yulong copper belt, Tibet using multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for extracting mineralized alteration information using remote sensing images have recently become both efficient and cost-effective. Technology involving the extraction of alteration information based on multi-spectral data has been widely practiced and effectively verified. In recent years, research on fine mineral extraction methods based on hyperspectral data has also been rapidly developing. The Yulong copper belt is a porphyry copper belt located in China with high prospects for mineralization. However, most previous studies focused on the northern section of the Yulong copper belt, with limited exploration of the southern section. In this study, alteration information of the southern section of the Yulong copper belt was extracted from remote sensing data from Landsat-8 OLI, ASTER, and ZY1-02D, and the prospecting potential of this area was evaluated. Principal component analysis was used to extract iron oxide and hydroxyl alteration from Landsat-8 data, in addition to Al hydroxyl and propylitic alterations from ASTER data. Considering the challenge of the extraction of too many pseudo-anomalies using traditional methods, the mixture-tuned matched filtering (MTMF) method was used to more accurately extract iron oxide alterations. Regarding hyperspectral data, the minimum noise fraction and pure pixel index algorithms were used to extract white mica and carbonatite endmembers. The MTMF method was also used for alteration mapping, which took advantage of sub-pixel abundance mapping to finely divide the white mica and carbonatite alterations into five classes. The extraction results of multi-source remote sensing data were then compared and analyzed to avoid occasional single-image extraction results, which confirmed the superiority of the hyperspectral remote sensing and MTMF methods. Combined with field verification, the mineralization alteration information coincided with the spatial location of the Secuo, Mamupu, and Jicuo deposits, which confirmed the accuracy of alteration information extraction. The results of this study confirmed the application potential of remote sensing alteration information extraction in the field of mineral resource exploration. The results have important reference significance for further geological prospecting and exploration in the southern section of the Yulong copper belt.

TI  - Generation of global 1 km daily soil moisture product from 2000 to 2020using ensemble learning
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Motivated by the lack of long-term global soil moisture products with both high spatial and temporal resolutions, a global 1 km daily spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture product (GLASS SM) was generated from 2000 to 2020 using an ensemble learning model (eXtreme Gradient Boosting - XGBoost). The model was developed by integrating multiple datasets, including albedo, land surface temperature, and leaf area index products from the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite, as well as the European reanalysis (ERA5-Land) soil moisture product, in situ soil moisture dataset from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN), and auxiliary datasets (Multi-Error-Removed Improved-Terrain (MERIT) DEM and Global gridded soil information (SoilGrids)). Given the relatively large-scale differences between point-scale in situ measurements and other datasets, the triple collocation (TC) method was adopted to select the representative soil moisture stations and their measurements for creating the training samples. To fully evaluate the model performance, three validation strategies were explored: random, site independent, and year independent. Results showed that although the XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy on the random test samples, it was clearly a result of model overfitting. Meanwhile, training the model with representative stations selected by the TC method could considerably improve its performance for site- or year-independent test samples. The overall validation accuracy of the model trained using representative stations on the site-independent test samples, which was least likely to be overfitted, was a correlation coefficient ( R) of 0.715 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.079m(3) m(-3). Moreover, compared to the model developed without station filtering, the validation accuracies of the model trained with representative stations improved significantly for most stations, with the median R and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) of the model for each station increasing from 0.64 to 0.74 and decreasing from 0.055 to 0.052m(3) m(-3), respectively. Further validation of the GLASS SM product across four independent soil moisture networks revealed its ability to capture the temporal dynamics of measured soil moisture ( R D 0.69-0.89; ubRMSE D 0.033-0.048m(3) m(-3)). Lastly, the intercomparison between the GLASS SM product and two global microwave soil moisture datasets - the 1 km Soil Moisture Active Passive/Sentinel-1 L2 Radiometer/Radar soil moisture product and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative combined soil moisture product at 0.25 degrees - indicated that the derived product maintained a more complete spatial coverage and exhibited high spatiotemporal consistency with those two soil moisture products. The annual average GLASS SM dataset from 2000 to 2020 can be freely downloaded from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7172664 (Zhang et al., 2022a), and the complete product at daily scale is available at http://glass.umd.edu/soil_moisture/ (last access: 12 May 2023).

TI  - National-scale spatial prediction of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen using long-term optical and microwave satellite observations in Google Earth Engine
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling accurate and detailed soil spatial information is essential for environmental modeling, precision soil management and decision-making. In this study, we integrated long-term optical (Sentinel-2) and radar (Sentinel-1) satellite observations via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for high-resolution national-scale digital mapping of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) in Austria. Our soil predictive models based on boosted regression tree (BRT) and regression kriging (RK) methods were constructed from 449 soil samples (0-20 cm) covering the study area in the LUCAS soil database and Sentinel observations synthesized with different time intervals. The different input predictors of these soil predictive models resulted in seven modeling scenarios, and their prediction performance was evaluated by a cross-validation technique. Comparative analysis indicated that satellite sensors, modeling techniques, and SAR data acquisition configurations greatly affected the model outputs. Cross-polarization and co-polarization had similar performance in TSN and SOC predictions, and their combination improved the prediction accuracy. Predictive models based on Sentinel-1 with the "ASCENDING" orbits outperformed the models involving the "DESCENDING" orbits; the prediction accuracy of the former was comparable to models involving two orbital data. The models built by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 performed similarly in predicting SOC (R2 = 0.51 vs. R2 = 0.52, respectively) and TSN (their R2 were both 0.42); their synergistic utilization improved the prediction results. Models involving more years of Sentinel observations on the GEE platform provided more accurate modeling results. The best soil predictive models explained 55% and 45% of soil variability for SOC and TSN, respectively, both constructed from long-term Sentinel-1/2 observations using the RK method. The overall trends of the mapping results of the models constructed by Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 and their combinations were consistent. The predicted digital soil maps displayed high spatial heterogeneity: SOC and TSN-shared similar spatial patterns-were greater in highaltitude central and western regions than other regions. This study provides valuable information for revealing the effects of satellite sensors, modeling techniques and SAR configurations on mapping SOC and TSN.

TI  - Responses of Vegetation Phenology to Urbanisation and Natural Factors along an Urban-Rural Gradient: A Case Study of an Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the responses of vegetation phenology to natural and human disturbances is essential for better understanding ecosystems. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data and products were used together with other relevant data to analyse vegetation phenological responses to urbanisation and natural factors in the major urban agglomerations of the Urumqi-Changji, Shihezi-Manasi, and Wusu-Kuidun-Dushanzi regions on the Urban Agglomeration on the Northern Slope of the Tianshan Mountains (UANSTM). Vegetation phenology distributed along an urban-rural gradient showed distinct variability, with start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and growing season length (GSL) occurring earlier, later, and longer, respectively, in urban areas than those in suburban and rural areas. In the Urumqi-Changji region, the earliest SOS, the later EOS, and the longest GSL occurred. Surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) was most pronounced in the Urumqi-Changji region, with a heat island intensity of 1.77-3.34 & DEG;C. Vegetation phenology was influenced by both urbanisation and natural factors, whose contributions were 44.2% to EOS and 61.8% to SOS, respectively. The results of this study emphasise the importance of quantifying the vegetation phenological responses to human disturbances, including climate change, along the urban-rural gradient on the UANSTM.

TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in human health in Tanzania: 2016-2021
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance plays an important role in early detection of resistant strains of pathogens and informs treatments decisions at local, regional and national levels. In 2017, Tanzania developed a One Health AMR Surveillance Framework to guide establishment of AMR surveillance systems in the human and animal sectors. Aim: We reviewed AMR surveillance studies in Tanzania to document progress towards establishing an AMR surveillance system and determine effective strengthening strategies. Methods: We conducted a literature review on AMR studies conducted in Tanzania by searching Google Scholar, PubMed, and the websites of the Tanzania Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization for articles written in English and published from January 2012 to March 2021 using relevant search terms. Additionally, we reviewed applicable guidelines, plans, and reports from the Tanzanian Ministry of Health. Results: We reviewed 10 articles on AMR in Tanzania, where studies were conducted at hospitals in seven of Tanzania's 26 regions between 2012 and 2019. Nine AMR sentinel sites had been established, and there was suitable and clear coordination under 'One Health'. However, sharing of surveillance data between sectors had yet to be strengthened. Most studies documented high resistance rates of Gram-negative bacteria to third-generation cephalosporins. There were few laboratory staff who were well trained on AMR. Conclusion: Important progress has been made in establishing a useful, reliable AMR surveillance system. Challenges include a need to develop, implement and build investment case studies for the sustainability of AMR surveillance in Tanzania and ensure proper use of third-generation cephalosporins. What this study adds: This article adds to the knowledge base of AMR trends in Tanzania and progress made in the implementation of AMR surveillance in human health sector as a contribution to the global AMR initiatives to reduce AMR burden worldwide. It has highlighted key gaps that need policy and implementation level attention.

TI  - Performance Assessment of Four Data-Driven Machine Learning Models: A Case to Generate Sentinel-2 Albedo at 10 Meters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution albedo has the advantage of a higher spatial scale from tens to hundreds of meters, which can fill the gaps of albedo applications from the global scale to the regional scale and can solve problems related to land use change and ecosystems. The Sentinel-2 satellite provides high-resolution observations in the visible-to-NIR bands, giving possibilities to generate a high-resolution surface albedo at 10 m. This study attempted to evaluate the performance of the four data-driven machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest (RF), artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and XGBoost (XGBT)) for the generation of a Sentinel-2 albedo over flat and rugged terrain. First, we used the RossThick-LiSparseR model and the 3D discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to build the narrowband surface reflectance and broadband surface albedo, which acted as the training and testing datasets over flat and rugged terrain. Second, we used the training and testing datasets to drive the four machine learning models, and evaluated the performance of these machine learning models for the generation of Sentinel-2 albedo. Finally, we used the four machine learning models to generate a Sentinel-2 albedo and compared them with in situ albedos to show the models' application potentials. The results show that these machine learning models have great performance in estimating Sentinel-2 albedos at a 10 m spatial scale. The comparison with in situ albedos shows that the random forest model outperformed the others in estimating a high-resolution surface albedo based on Sentinel-2 datasets over the flat and rugged terrain, with an RMSE smaller than 0.0308 and R-2 larger than 0.9472.

TI  - Tree Species Classification in Subtropical Natural Forests Using High-Resolution UAV RGB and SuperView-1 Multispectral Imageries Based on Deep Learning Network Approaches: A Case Study within the Baima Snow Mountain National Nature Reserve, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on dominant tree species and their spatial distribution in subtropical natural forests are key ecological monitoring factors for accurately characterizing forest biodiversity, depicting the tree competition mechanism and quantitatively evaluating forest ecosystem stability. In this study, the subtropical natural forest in northwest Yunnan province of China was selected as the study area. Firstly, an object-oriented multi-resolution segmentation (MRS) algorithm was used to segment individual tree crowns from the UAV RGB imagery and satellite multispectral imagery in the forests with different densities (low (547 n/ha), middle (753 n/ha) and high (1040 n/ha)), and parameters of the MRS algorithm were tested and optimized for accurately extracting the tree crown and position information of the individual tree. Secondly, the texture metrics of the UAV RGB imagery and the spectral metrics of the satellite multispectral imagery within the individual tree crown were extracted, and the random forest algorithm and three deep learning networks constructed in this study were utilized to classify the five dominant tree species. Finally, we compared and evaluated the performance of the random forest algorithm and three deep learning networks for dominant tree species classification using the field measurement data, and the influence of the number of training samples on the accuracy of dominant tree species classification using deep learning networks was investigated. The results showed that: (1) Stand density had little influence on individual tree segmentation using the object-oriented MRS algorithm. In the forests with different stand densities, the F-1 score of individual tree segmentation based on satellite multispectral imagery was 71.3-74.7%, and that based on UAV high-resolution RGB imagery was 75.4-79.2%. (2) The overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification using the light-weight network MobileNetV2 (OA = 71.11-82.22%), residual network ResNet34 (OA = 78.89-91.11%) and dense network DenseNet121 (OA = 81.11-94.44%) was higher than that of the random forest algorithm (OA = 60.00-64.44%), among which DenseNet121 had the highest overall accuracy. Texture metrics improved the overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification. (3) For the three deep learning networks, the changes in overall accuracy of dominant tree species classification influenced by the number of training samples were 2.69-4.28%.

TI  - Integration of DInSAR-PS-Stacking and SBAS-PS-InSAR Methods to Monitor Mining-Related Surface Subsidence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over-exploitation of coal mines leads to surface subsidence, surface cracks, collapses, landslides, and other geological disasters. Taking a mining area in Nalintaohai Town, Ejin Horo Banner, Ordos City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, as an example, Sentinel-1A data from January 2018 to October 2019 were used as the data source in this study. Based on the high interference coherence of the permanent scatterer (PS) over a long period of time, the problem of the manual selection of ground control points (GCPs) affecting the monitoring results during refinement and re-flattening is solved. A DInSAR-PS-Stacking method combining the PS three-threshold method (the coherence coefficient threshold, amplitude dispersion index threshold, and deformation velocity interval) is proposed as a means to select ground control points for refinement and re-flattening, as well as a means to obtain time-series deformation by weighted stacking processing. A SBAS-PS-InSAR method combining the PS three-threshold method to select PS points as GCPs for refinement and re-flattening is also proposed. The surface deformation results monitored by the DInSAR-PS-Stacking and SBAS-PS-InSAR methods are analyzed and verified. The results show that the subsidence location, range, distribution, and space-time subsidence law of surface deformation results obtained by DInSAR-PS-Stacking, SBAS-PS-InSAR, and GPS methods are basically the same. The deformation results obtained by these two InSAR methods have a good correlation with the GPS monitoring results, and the MAE and RMSE are within the acceptable range. The error showed that the edge of the subsidence basin was small and that the center was large. Both methods were found to be able to effectively monitor the coal mine, but there were also shortcomings. DInSAR-PS-Stacking has a strong ability to monitor the settlement center. SBAS-PS-InSAR performed well in monitoring slow and small deformations, but its monitoring of the settlement center was insufficient. Considering the advantages of these two InSAR methods, we proposed fusing the time-series deformation results obtained using these two InSAR methods to allow for more reliable deformation results and to carry out settlement analysis. The results showed that the automatic two-threshold (deformation threshold and average coherence threshold) fusion was effective for monitoring and analysis, and the deformation monitoring results are in good agreement with the actual situation. The deformation information obtained by the comparison, and fusion of multiple methods can allow for better monitoring and analysis of the mining area surface deformation, and can also provide a scientific reference for mining subsidence control and early disaster warning.

TI  - Evaluation of UTFVI index effect on climate change in terms of urbanization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island density and occurrence are closely related to land use/land cover and land surface temperature variation. The effect of UHI can be described quantitatively with the urban thermal area variance index. This study aims to evaluate the UHI effect of the city of Samsun with the UTFVI index. LST data from 2000 ETM + and 2020 OLI/TIRS Landsat images were used to analyze UHI. The results showed that the UHI effect increased in Samsun's coastline band in 20 years. As a result of the field analysis made from the UTFVI maps created, in 20 years, 84% decrease in the none slice, 104% increase in the weak slice, 10% decrease in the middle slice, 15% decrease in the strong slice, 8% increase in the stronger slice, and 179% increase in the strongest slice are observed. The slice with the most intense increase is in the strongest slice and reveals the UHI effect.

TI  - Active faults studies in Delhi and national capital region (NCR): Inferences from satellite data and field investigations
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi has experienced several earthquakes ranging in magnitude from 1.0 to 6.7. According to the last 50 years of earthquake data, the majority of earthquakes in the NCR have occurred near the Mahendragarh Dehradun Fault (MDF) and the Sohna Fault (SF). The region is bounded by a number of subsurface Ridges, Faults, and Lineaments, which are also influenced by the active plate boundary of the Indian and Eurasian plates. Active fault mapping is critical for the precise identification and marking of active fault traces in the NCR area for a precise seismic hazard assessment. We used high resolution Cartosat-1 stereopair data obtained from NRSC, Hyderabad, and Anaglyph (A 3D representation of the surface) and DEM prepared with ENVI software to map the active faults. We identified 12 sites in the NCR region based on satellite data interpretation, primarily along the MDF and Sohna Fault and their extensions. The presence of tectono-geomorphic markers along the MDF and Sohna Fault, such as warped surfaces indicative of fault scarps, stream offsets, gully erosion, and sag ponds, suggests active tectonic movement along these faults, most likely in the recent geological past. We believe the MDF is a right-lateral strike-slip fault with a compressional component on the western side and an extensional component on the eastern side. It acts as a segment boundary between compressional and extensional boundaries. We also identified the right lateral Nuh-Jhirka fault (NJF), which can be the Sohna Fault's southern extension from Nuh to Jhirka. The western limb of the Delhi Mega fold has also seen a few right-lateral strike-slip movements that have extended up to the eastern bank of the Yamuna River, where the river reflects the base-level change and tight meandering on its upward side and a straight pattern on its downward side. This fault is known as the Delhi Fault (DF). The findings are preliminary, and further research would be required to create a detailed active fault map of the Delhi-NCR region to conduct a precise Seismic Hazard Assessment (SHA) of the region.

TI  - MARC-Net: Terrain Classification in Parallel Network Architectures Containing Multiple Attention Mechanisms and Multi-Scale Residual Cascades
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - To address the problem that traditional deep learning algorithms cannot fully utilize the correlation properties between spectral sequence information and the feature differences between different spectra, this paper proposes a parallel network architecture land-use classification based on a combined multi-head attention mechanism and multiscale residual cascade called MARC-Net. This parallel framework is firstly implemented by deeply mining the features generated by grouped spectral embedding for information among spectral features by adding a multi-head attention mechanism, which allows semantic features to have expressions from more subspaces while fully considering all spatial location interrelationships. Secondly, a multiscale residual cascade CNN (convolutional neural network) is designed to fully utilize the fused feature information at different scales, thereby improving the network's ability to represent different levels of information. Lastly, the features obtained by the multi-head attention mechanism are fused with those obtained by the CNN, and the merged resultant features are downgraded through the fully connected layer to obtain the classification results and achieve pixel-level multispectral image classification. The findings show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has an aggregate precision of 97.22%, compared to that of the Vision Transformer (ViT) with 95.08%; its performance on the Sentinel-2 dataset shows a huge improvement. Moreover, this article mainly focuses on the change rate of forest land in the study area. The Forest land area was 125.1143 km(2) in 2017, 105.6089 km(2) in 2019, and 76.3699 km(2) in 2021, with an increase of 15.59%, an decrease of 0.97%, and increase of 14.76% in 2017-2019, 2019-2021 and 2017-2021, respectively.

TI  - New Technique for Monitoring High Nature Value Farmland (HNVF) in Basilicata
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The definition of High Nature Value Farmland Areas (HNVF) was provided by Andersen in 2003: "HNVF comprises those areas in Europe where agriculture is the major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports or is associated with either a high species and habitat diversity, or the presence of species of European conservation concern or both". The present work focuses on an overview of the techniques used to produce HNVF maps at different spatio-temporal resolutions. The proposed approach is based on the statistical approach. The study area is the Basilicata region (southern Italy) in 2012, mapped at municipal spatial resolution. The HNVF areas were identified by applying a threshold to the sum of the contributions of the main characterizing indicators. Three indicators contribute to the calculation of the HNVF areas: crop variability (CD Index), extensive practices (EP Index), and the presence of natural elements (Index Ne). Good agreement was found between our HNVF map and the results of the literature, although the analysis approaches were different. The main advantages of the proposed methodology derive from only free input data being used, and include remote sensing images and the adaptability to different spatial resolutions (local, regional, and national).

TI  - Evaluating the Efficacy of Different DEMs for Application in Flood Frequency and Risk Mapping of the Indian Coastal River Basin
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are among the most occurring natural hazards that cause severe damage to infrastructure and loss of life. In India, southern Gujarat is affected during the monsoon season, facing multiple flood events in the Damanganga basin. As the basin is one of the data-scarce regions, evaluating the globally available dataset for flood risk mitigation studies in the Damanganga basin is crucial. In the present study, we compared four open-source digital elevation models (DEMs) (SRTM, Cartosat-1, ALOS-PALSAR, and TanDEMX) for hydrodynamic (HD) modeling and flood risk mapping. The simulated HD models for multiple flood events using HEC-RAS v6.3 were calibrated by adopting different roughness coefficients based on land-use land cover, observed water levels at gauge sites, and peak flood depths in the flood plain. In contrast to the previous studies on the Purna river basin (the neighboring basin of Damanganga), the present study shows that Cartosat-1 DEM provides reliable results with the observed flood depth. Furthermore, the calibrated HD model was used to determine the flood risk corresponding to 10, 25, 50, and 100-year return period floods calculated using Gumbel's extreme value (GEV) and log-Pearson type III (LP-III) distribution techniques. Comparing the obtained peak floods corresponding to different return periods with the observed peak floods revealed that the LP-III method gives more reliable estimates of flood peaks for lower return periods, while the GEV method gives comparatively more reliable estimates for higher return period floods. The study shows that evaluating different open-source data and techniques is crucial for developing reliable flood mitigation plans with practical implications.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of spatiotemporal land use and land cover changes on soil loss across agroecologies and slope categories using GIS and RUSLE model in Zoa watershed, southwest Ethiopia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Soil erosion in Ethiopian highlands is highly consistent with land use/land cover (LULC) changes that are associated with deforestation and a decline in biodiversity. However, identifying soil erosion-prone areas and quantifying soil loss in rugged terrains and various agroecologies due to LULC changes have not been dedicated to scientific studies. Therefore, we quantified the impacts of spatiotemporal LULC changes on soil loss across agroecologies and slope categories using GIS and RUSLE model from 1985 to 2021 in Zoa watershed, southwest Ethiopia. Moreover, prioritizing erosion severity risks at sub-watersheds and quantifying temporal sediment yield is essential for better conservation planning. Landsat images, rainfall, Digital Elevation Model, and soil data were obtained from field observations and secondary sources.Results Bareland and farmland have been expanding at the expense of other land use types. The annual soil loss in the watershed ranged from 0 to 113.21 t -ha(-1) year(-1), 0 to 163.16 t ha(-1) year(-1), and 0 to 194.58 t ha(-1) year(-1) with a mean annual soil loss of 21.07, 29.35 and 40.93 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1985, 2000, and 2021, respectively. Among LULC classes, the highest soil loss was generated from bareland (31.73 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and farmland (27.08 t ha(-1) year(-1)) in 1985 later upsurged to 35.52 t ha(-1) year(-1)and 59.91 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2021, respectively, due to the maximum susceptibility of soil erosion risks from unprotected surfaces. The results also revealed that the lowland agroecology generated the highest mean soil loss of 24.05 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 1985, 39.74 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2000, and increased to 57.55 t ha(-1) year(-1) in 2021. Considering the slope categories, the highest and most excruciating soil loss was engendered from steep (35.55-60.78 t ha(-1) year(-1)) and very steep (52.48-72.69 t ha(-1) year(-1)) slope terrains during 1985-2021. The northwestern part of the watershed is the most erosion-prone area which is now expanding to the central and western parts of the watershed. The sediment yield increased at the fastest rate at the watershed outlet, from 39.3% in 1985 to 94.26% in 2021.Conclusions The results of this study indicated that the conversion of other LULC categories into farmland was the most detrimental to a watershed in terms of soil loss, which necessitates the implementation of appropriate soil and water conservation measures with effective design by considering spatial variability to reduce soil erosion hazards.

TI  - Closed-Form Method for Atmospheric Correction (CMAC) of Smallsat Data Using Scene Statistics
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Featured Application CMAC software provides reliable and accurate conversion of degraded top-of-atmosphere imagery to surface reflectance. Accomplished in near real-time using only scene statistics, CMAC can reside in-satellite to support low-latency corrected image output to support smallsat's emerging role for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.High-cadence Earth observation smallsat images offer potential for near real-time global reconnaissance of all sunlit cloud-free locations. However, these data must be corrected to remove light-transmission effects from variable atmospheric aerosol that degrade image interpretability. Although existing methods may work, they require ancillary data that delays image output, impacting their most valuable applications: intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Closed-form Method for Atmospheric Correction (CMAC) is based on observed atmospheric effects that brighten dark reflectance while darkening bright reflectance. Using only scene statistics in near real-time, CMAC first maps atmospheric effects across each image, then uses the resulting grayscale to reverse the effects to deliver spatially correct surface reflectance for each pixel. CMAC was developed using the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 imagery. After a rapid calibration that customizes the method for each imaging optical smallsat, CMAC can be applied to atmospherically correct visible through near-infrared bands. To assess CMAC functionality against user-applied state-of-the-art software, Sen2Cor, extensive tests were made of atmospheric correction performance across dark to bright reflectance under a wide range of atmospheric aerosol on multiple images in seven locations. CMAC corrected images faster, with greater accuracy and precision over a range of atmospheric effects more than twice that of Sen2Cor.

TI  - Image feature learning combined with attention-based spectral representation for spatio-temporal photovoltaic power prediction
T2  - IET COMPUTER VISION
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Clean energy is a major trend. The importance of photovoltaic power generation is also growing. Photovoltaic power generation is mainly affected by the weather. It is full of uncertainties. Previous work has relied chiefly on historical photovoltaics data for time series forecasts. However, unforeseen weather conditions can sometimes skew. Consequently, a spatial-temporal-meteorological-long short-term memory prediction model (STM-LSTM) is proposed to compensate for the shortage of photovoltaic prediction models for uncertainties. This model can simultaneously process satellite image data, historical meteorological data, and historical power generation data. In this way, historical patterns and meteorological change information are extracted to improve the accuracy of photovoltaic prediction. STM-LSTM processes raw satellite data to obtain cloud image data. It can extract cloud motion information using the dense optical flow method. First, the cloud images are processed to extract cloud position information. By adaptive attentive learning of images in different bands, a better representation for subsequent tasks can be obtained. Second, it is important to process historical meteorological data to learn meteorological change patterns. Last but not least, the historical photovoltaic power generation sequences are combined to obtain the final photovoltaic prediction results. After a series of experimental validation, the performance of the proposed STM-LSTM model has a good improvement compared with the baseline model.

TI  - Evaluation of the Health Status of Indonesian Watersheds Using Impervious Surface Area as an Indicator
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces affect the ecosystem function of watersheds. Therefore, the impervious surface area percentage (ISA%) in watersheds has been regarded as an important indicator for assessing the health status of watersheds. However, accurate and frequent estimation of ISA% from satellite data remains a challenge, especially at large scales (national, regional, or global). In this study, we first developed a method to estimate ISA% by combining daytime and nighttime satellite data. We then used the developed method to generate an annual ISA% distribution map from 2003 to 2021 for Indonesia. Third, we used these ISA% distribution maps to assess the health status of Indonesian watersheds according to Schueler's criteria. Accuracy assessment results show that the developed method performed well from low ISA% (rural) to high ISA% (urban) values, with a root mean square difference value of 0.52 km(2), a mean absolute percentage difference value of 16.2%, and a bias of -0.08 km(2). In addition, since the developed method uses only satellite data as input, it can be easily implemented in other regions with some modifications according to differences in light use efficiency and economic development in each region. We also found that 88% of Indonesian watersheds remain without impact in 2021, indicating that the health status of Indonesian watersheds is not a serious problem. Nevertheless, Indonesia's total ISA increased significantly from 3687.4 km(2) in 2003 to 10,505.5 km(2) in 2021, and most of the increased ISA was in rural areas. These results indicate that negative trends in health status in Indonesian watersheds may emerge in the future without proper watershed management.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns and environmental drivers of eastern redcedar (<i>Juniperus virginiana</i>) abundance along the Missouri River, USA
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ContextChanges in disturbance regimes, including reductions in flooding and geomorphic dynamism from dam construction and flow regulation, have facilitated invasion by eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.), an upland tree species, in the understory of floodplain forests along the Missouri National Recreational River (MNRR).ObjectivesOur aim was to determine the spatiotemporal patterns and environmental drivers of redcedar invasion along the MNRR.MethodsWe used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from winter Landsat imagery to construct a time series of maps showing spatial changes in redcedar abundance and distribution from 1982 to 2017 in both riparian and upland habitats along the MNRR. We determined how environmental factors (e.g., soil drainage ability, flood recurrence interval, 1980s LULC, lateral distance to the river, and channel incision) have influenced current (2017) redcedar occurrence and abundance in riparian habitats using random forest models (RFM).ResultsTime-series maps indicated that detectable redcedar cover occurred over less than 5% of the study area before 1985, increased steadily from 1985 to 2000, and more than tripled from 2000 to 2010. After 2010, redcedar abundance continued to increase in upland areas but declined following the 2011 Missouri River flood in the floodplain. RFMs indicated that river incision, distance to the river, soil drainage, 1984 LULC, and flood recurrence interval were important features influencing redcedar occurrence and abundance in the floodplain.ConclusionUnless preventive measures are implemented, lack of floods and ongoing flow regulation will enable the continued spread of redcedar along the MNRR and other regulated rivers in the eastern Great Plains.

TI  - An arrayed optofluidic system for three-dimensional (3D) focal control via electrowetting
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new lens capability for three-dimensional (3D) focal control is presented using an optofluidic system consisting of n x n arrayed liquid prisms. Each prism module contains two immiscible liquids in a rectangular cuvette. Using the electrowetting effect, the shape of the fluidic interface can be rapidly adjusted to create its straight profile with the prism's apex angle. Consequently, an incoming ray is steered at the tilted interface due to the refractive index difference between two liquids. To achieve 3D focal control, individual prisms in the arrayed system are simultaneously modulated, allowing incoming light rays to be spatially manipulated and converged on a focal point located at P-focal (f(x), f(y), f(z)) in 3D space. Analytical studies were conducted to precisely predict the prism operation required for 3D focal control. Using three liquid prisms positioned on the x-, y-, and 45 degrees-diagonal axes, we experimentally demonstrated 3D focal tunability of the arrayed optofluidic system, achieving focal tuning along lateral, longitudinal, and axial directions as wide as 0 <= f(x) <= 30 mm, 0 <= f(y) <= 30 mm, and 500 mm <= f(z) <= infinity. This focal tunability of the arrayed system allows for 3D control of the lens's focusing power, which could not be attained by solid-type optics without the use of bulky and complex mechanical moving components. This innovative lens capability for 3D focal control has potential applications in eye-movement tracking for smart displays, autofocusing of smartphone cameras, or solar tracking for smart photovoltaic systems.

TI  - Biomass Spatial Pattern and Driving Factors of Different Vegetation Types of Public Welfare Forests in Hunan Province
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An ecological public welfare forest is an important basis for the construction of national ecological security. This study took public welfare forests at the provincial level or above in Hunan Province as the research object. Based on the in situ monitoring data and remote sensing data, we constructed a random forest (RF) model for inversing the biomass of public welfare forests with different types. Then, based on the inversion results, we investigated the biomass spatial pattern. Combined with topographical and socio-economic factors, we constructed a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to analyze the biomass driving factors of different vegetation types in public forests. The results showed the following: (1) The biomass of public welfare forests in Hunan Province presented a strip distribution pattern that gradually increases from the central to the southwest and northeast. The total biomass of public welfare forests in Hunan Province was 338.13 million tons, with an average biomass of 68.31 t center dot hm(-2). In the different types of public welfare forests, the mean biomass of the types were as follows: shrub (4.65 t center dot hm(-2)) < broadleaf forest (59.27 t center dot hm(-2)) < conifer-broadleaf mixed forest (62.44 t center dot hm(-2)) < bamboo forest (71.33 t center dot hm(-2)) < coniferous forest (100.33 t center dot hm(-2)). (2) Topographic and socio-economic factors have a significant impact on the spatial pattern of biomass in public welfare forests. Slope had the greatest effect on coniferous forest, conifer-broadleaf mixed forest, and shrub forest, while POP had the greatest effect on broadleaf forest and bamboo forest. This study investigates the spatial patterns and driving factors of biomass in public welfare forests at the provincial level, filling the gap in forest biomass monitoring in public welfare forests in Hunan Province. It provides a new method to improve the accuracy of forest biomass estimation and data support for the sustainable management of public welfare forests.

TI  - Seasonal fluctuations of marsh wetlands in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus Rivers, Tibetan Plateau based on the adapted LandTrendr model
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marsh wetlands present a rich variety of ecosystem goods and services, including important carbon sinks, of great significance to changes in the global environment. However, seasonal responses of marsh wetlands remain understudied and poorly understood. Therefore, this study adapted the Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery (LandTrendr) model using field and Landsat data during 1990-2017 to identify the seasonal and spatial variations in marsh wetlands in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Indus Rivers (HBGIR) and analyze the drivers of their spatiotemporal changes. The spatiotemporal change in the marsh wetlands was divided into the three stages of expansion (1990-1998), retreat (1998-2004), and stability (2004-2017). The marsh wetland area showed an increasing trend before 1998 and a stable and slightly increasing trend after 2004. The expansion area of the marsh wetlands was located in the reserves of Shiquanhe and Manasarovar and their surrounding areas. The marsh wetlands were subjected to the largest expansion in summer (114.45 km2), followed by spring (80.45 km2). The expansion of the marsh wetlands in summer was mainly driven by snow depth and temperature, with the strongest interaction factor of 0.6 between them. However, the retreat of the marsh wetlands was driven by the expansion of construction and cultivated lands in the HBGIR. Finally, the LandTrendr model modified in this study was useful for improving the change-detection accuracy of the marsh wetlands. This study provides an important theoretical basis for wetland protection and management for the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Satellite-Based Estimation of Roughness Length over Vegetated Surfaces and Its Utilization in WRF Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on morphological methods, MODIS satellite remote sensing data were used to establish a dataset of the local roughness length (Z(0)) of vegetation-covered surfaces in Guangdong Province. The local Z(0) was used to update the mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in order to quantitatively evaluate its impact on the thermodynamic environment of vegetation-covered surfaces. The specific results are as follows: evergreen broad-leaved forests showed the largest average Z(0) values at 1.27 m (spring), 1.15 m (summer), 1.03 m (autumn), and 1.15 m (winter); the average Z(0) values of mixed forests ranged from 0.90 to 1.20 m; and those for cropland-covered surfaces ranged from 0.17 to 0.20 m. The Z(0) values of individual vegetation coverage types all exhibited relatively high values in spring and low values in autumn, and the default Z(0) corresponding to specific vegetation-covered surfaces was significantly underestimated in the WRF model. Modifying the default Z(0) of surfaces underlying evergreen broad-leaved forests, mixed forests, and croplands in the model induced only relatively small changes (<1%) in their 2 m temperature, relative humidity, skin surface temperature, and the planetary boundary layer height. However, the average daily wind speed of surfaces covered by evergreen broad-leaved forests, mixed forests, and croplands was reduced by 0.48 m/s, 0.43 m/s, and 0.26 m/s, respectively, accounting for changes of 12.0%, 11.1%, and 6.5%, respectively.

TI  - Tonic TNF conditioning of macrophages safeguards stimulus-specific inflammatory responses
T2  - EMBO REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a key inflammatory cytokine that warns recipient cells of a nearby infection or tissue damage. Acute exposure to TNF activates characteristic oscillatory dynamics of the transcription factor NF?B and induces a characteristic gene expression program; these are distinct from the responses of cells directly exposed to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Here, we report that tonic TNF exposure is critical for safeguarding TNF's specific functions. In the absence of tonic TNF conditioning, acute exposure to TNF causes (i) NF?B signaling dynamics that are less oscillatory and more like PAMP-responsive NF?B dynamics, (ii) immune gene expression that is more similar to the Pam3CSK4 response program, and (iii) broader epigenomic reprogramming that is characteristic of PAMP-responsive changes. We show that the absence of tonic TNF signaling effects subtle changes to TNF receptor availability and dynamics such that enhanced pathway activity results in non-oscillatory NF?B. Our results reveal tonic TNF as a key tissue determinant of the specific cellular responses to acute paracrine TNF exposure, and their distinction from responses to direct exposure to PAMPs.

TI  - Spatially-optimized urban greening for reduction of population exposure to land surface temperature extremes
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The population experiencing high temperatures in cities is rising due to anthropogenic climate change, settlement expansion, and population growth. Yet, efficient tools to evaluate potential intervention strategies to reduce population exposure to Land Surface Temperature (LST) extremes are still lacking. Here, we implement a spatial regression model based on remote sensing data that is able to assess the population exposure to LST extremes in urban environments across 200 cities based on surface properties like vegetation cover and distance to water bodies. We define exposure as the number of days per year where LST exceeds a given threshold multiplied by the total urban population exposed, in person center dot day. Our findings reveal that urban vegetation plays a considerable role in decreasing the exposure of the urban population to LST extremes. We show that targeting high-exposure areas reduces vegetation needed for the same decrease in exposure compared to uniform treatment.

TI  - Non-contrast computed tomography features predict intraventricular hemorrhage growth
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - ObjectivesNon-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers are robust predictors of parenchymal hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We investigated whether NCCT features can also identify ICH patients at risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) growth.MethodsPatients with acute spontaneous ICH admitted at four tertiary centers in Germany and Italy were retrospectively included from January 2017 to June 2020. NCCT markers were rated by two investigators for heterogeneous density, hypodensity, black hole sign, swirl sign, blend sign, fluid level, island sign, satellite sign, and irregular shape. ICH and IVH volumes were semi-manually segmented. IVH growth was defined as IVH expansion > 1 mL (eIVH) or any delayed IVH (dIVH) on follow-up imaging. Predictors of eIVH and dIVH were explored with multivariable logistic regression. Hypothesized moderators and mediators were independently assessed in PROCESS macro models.ResultsA total of 731 patients were included, of whom 185 (25.31%) suffered from IVH growth, 130 (17.78%) had eIVH, and 55 (7.52%) had dIVH. Irregular shape was significantly associated with IVH growth (OR 1.68; 95%CI [1.16-2.44]; p = 0.006). In the subgroup analysis stratified by the IVH growth type, hypodensities were significantly associated with eIVH (OR 2.06; 95%CI [1.48-2.64]; p = 0.015), whereas irregular shape (OR 2.72; 95%CI [1.91-3.53]; p = 0.016) in dIVH. The association between NCCT markers and IVH growth was not mediated by parenchymal hematoma expansion.ConclusionsNCCT features identified ICH patients at a high risk of IVH growth. Our findings suggest the possibility to stratify the risk of IVH growth with baseline NCCT and might inform ongoing and future studies.

TI  - Birds and bats enhance cacao yield despite suppressing arthropod mesopredation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bird- and bat-mediated biocontrol benefits the productivity of tropical commodity crops such as cacao, but the ecological interactions driving these ecosystem services remain poorly understood. Whereas birds and bats prey on herbivorous arthropods, they may also prey on arthropod mesopredators such as ants, with poorly understood consequences for pest biocontrol. We used a full-factorial experiment excluding birds, bats, and ants to assess their effects on (a) the abundance of multiple arthropod groups; (b) predation pressure on arthropods evaluated through artificial sentinel caterpillars; and (c) cacao yield over 1 year in shaded agroforestry systems of native cacao varieties in Peru. Birds and bats increased cacao yield by 118%, which translates in smallholder benefits of ca. US $959 ha(-1) year(-1). Birds and bats decreased predation by ants and other arthropods, but contributed to the control of phytophagous taxa such as aphids and mealybugs. By contrast, ant presence increased the abundance of these sap-sucking insects, with negative impacts for cacao yield. Notably, high abundances of the dominant ant Nylanderia sp., known to attend sap-sucking insects, were associated with lower cacao yield along a distance gradient from the closest forest edge. According to these results, arthropod predation by birds and bats, rather than mesopredation by arthropods, was most responsible for increases in cacao yield. Moving forward, detailed research about their trophic interactions will be necessary to identify the cause of such benefits. Retaining and restoring the large benefits of birds and bats as well as minimizing disservices by other taxa in cacao agroforests can benefit from management schemes that prioritize preservation of shade trees and adjacent forests within agroforestry landscapes.

TI  - Impact of Land Cover Changes on Reducing Greenhouse Emissions: Site Selection, Baseline Modeling, and Strategic Environmental Assessment of REDD plus Projects
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) is way key to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) while also protecting vulnerable forest ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to recognize suitable areas for REDD+ Programme projects and calculate the reduction in CO2 emissions through the prevention of forest cover degradation in the Central Hyrcanian forests. For this purpose, the cover changes of the Central Hyrcanian forests were assessed using LANDSAT satellite images. Applying the voluntary carbon standard (VCS) methodology and the calibration period 1984-2014 (30 years), forest cover changes were predicted. The results showed that under the business-as-usual scenario, 155,698 ha of Central Hyrcanian forests will be declined by 2044. In general, the REDD+ Programme project implementation will prevent the release of 1,209,231 tCO(2)e. Based on the social cost of carbon (SCC) approach, the REDD+ Programme project implementation can save 12,092,310 US$. In addition, this approach can be used for the project design document (PDD) of the forest development mechanism.

TI  - InterpolatiON of InSAR Time series for the dEtection of ground deforMatiOn eVEnts (ONtheMOVE): application to slow-moving landslides
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this work is to develop an innovative methodology to analyse the time series (TS) of interferometric satellite data. TS are important tools for the ground displacement monitoring, mostly in areas in which in situ instruments are scarce. The proposed methodology allows to classify the trend of TS in three classes (uncorrelated, linear, non-linear) and to obtain the parameters of non-linear time series to characterise the magnitude and timing of changes of ground instabilities. These parameters are the beginning and end of the non-linear deformation break(s), the length of the event(s) in days, and the quantification of the cumulative displacement in mm. The methodology was tested on two Sentinel-1 datasets (2014-2020) covering the Alpine and Apennine sectors of the Piemonte region, an area prone to slow-moving slope instabilities. The results were validated at the basin scale (Pellice-Chisone and Piota basin) and at a local scale (Brenvetto, Champlas du Col and Casaleggio Boiro landslides) comparing with in situ monitoring system measurements, possible triggering factors (rainfall, snow) and already-collected events of the territory. The good correlation of the results has proven that the methodology can be a useful tool to local and regional authorities for risk planning and management of the area, also in terms of near real-time monitoring of the territory both at local and regional scale.

M3  - Early Access
AB  - Local Climate Zone (LCZ) is an effective classification scheme for quantifying and understanding the Urban Heat Island (UHI). There is a need of research that analyze the relationship of LST with LCZ and its seasonal variation in the metropolitan cities of India as they are facing a continuous loss of natural landcover and an increase in impervious land. This study aims to visualize and assess seasonal variations in LST and its LCZ-wise variation. In this paper, LCZ mapping is performed using SAGA GIS according to the guidelines of WUDAPT (World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools). Seasonal LST mapping is also done to get an idea about the average temperature of a particular LCZ class in a specific season of the year. The results confirmed that: (1) Average seasonal LST has difference of 3-4 degrees C among inter urban LCZs except in New Delhi in winter season. (2) Among all the built-up categories, open mid-rise (LCZ-5) has comparatively higher LST in all seasons. (3) Among non-built-up categories, rock or paved surfaces (LCZ E) have the highest LST, while shrubs or bushes (LCZ-C) have the lowest LST. The findings of this research could be adopted by urban planners for climate-sensitive sustainable development.

TI  - Landsat Satellite Image-Derived Area Evolution and the Driving Factors Affecting Hulun Lake from 1986 to 2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The area fluctuation of lakes directly affects the stability of the surrounding ecological environment. Research on the area evolution of lakes and the driving factors affecting it plays an important role in sustainable water resource management. In this study, Hulun Lake, located in the Hulunbuir grassland, was taken as the research object. Based on remote sensing images of the Hulun Lake area from 1986 to 2020, MNDWI interpretation was used to obtain the change law of lake surface area over a long time frame. Combined with natural factors and anthropogenic factors, Pearson correlation analysis and principal component analysis were used to analyze the driving force. The results showed that (1) in the past 35 years, the water surface area of Hulun Lake has decreased significantly. The dynamic change in water area could be divided into four stages. The areas with dramatic changes in water area are distributed mainly in the northeast and south of Hulun Lake. (2) In terms of natural factors, the meteorological factors based on evaporation and relative humidity, the runoff of rivers entering the lake, and the vegetation with medium-high coverage and medium-low coverage had significant effects. In terms of anthropogenic factors, the population had the most significant impact. The artificial water diversion project had different degrees of influence on the response of the Hulun Lake area change to natural factors. (3) Anthropogenic factors were the main driving force causing the rapid change in the Hulun Lake area from 2000 to 2016, explaining 48% of the change in the Hulun Lake area. These research results can provide a scientific basis for the development and utilization of water resources and sustainable development in the Hulun Lake area.

TI  - Recognizing Urban Functional Zones by GF-7 Satellite Stereo Imagery and POI Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of urban functional zones (UFZs) is crucial for urban planning and optimizing industrial layout. Fusing remote sensing images and social perception data is an effective way to identify UFZs. Previous studies on UFZs recognition often ignored band information outside the red-green-blue (RGB), especially three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology information. In addition, the probabilistic methods ignore the potential semantic information of Point of Interest (POI) data. Therefore, we propose an "Image + Text" multimodal data fusion framework for UFZs recognition. To effectively utilize the information of Gaofen-7(GF-7) stereo images, we designed a semi-transfer UFZs recognition model. The transferred model uses the pre-trained model to extract the deep features from RGB images, and a small self-built convolutional network is designed to extract the features from RGB bands, near-infrared (NIR) band, and normalized digital surface model (nDSM) generated by GF-7. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is employed to extract POI semantic features. The fusion features of the deep features of the GF-7 image and the semantic features of POI are fed into a classifier to identify UFZs. The experimental results show that: (1) The highest overall accuracy of 88.17% and the highest kappa coefficient of 83.91% are obtained in the Beijing Fourth Ring District. (2) nDSM and NIR data improve the overall accuracy of UFZs identification. (3) POI data significantly enhance the recognition accuracy of UFZs, except for shantytowns. This UFZs identification is simple and easy to implement, which can provide a reference for related research. However, considering the availability of POI data distribution, other data with socioeconomic attributes should be considered, and other multimodal fusion strategies are worth exploring in the future.

TI  - A Self-Adaptive Thresholding Approach for Automatic Water Extraction Using Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery Based on OTSU Algorithm and Distance Block
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an indispensable material for animals, plants and human beings, obtaining accurate water body information rapidly is of great significance to maintain the balance of ecosystems and ensure normal production and the life of human beings. Due to its independence of the time of day and the weather conditions, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have been increasingly applied in the extraction of water bodies. However, there is a great deal of speckle noise in SAR images, which seriously affect the extraction accuracy of water. At present, most of the processing methods are filtering methods, which will cause the loss of detailed information. Based on the characteristic of side-looking SAR, this paper proposed a self-adaptive thresholding approach for automatic water extraction based on an OTSU algorithm and distance block. In this method, the whole images were firstly divided into uniform image blocks through a distance layer which was produced by the distance to the orbit. Then, a self-adaptive processing was conducted for merging blocks. The OTSU algorithm was used to obtain a threshold for classification and the Jeffries-Matusita (JM) distance was calculated with the classification result. The merge processing continued until the separability of image blocks reached the maximum. Subsequently, we started from the next block to repeat the merger, and so on until all blocks were processed. Ten study areas around the world and the local Dongting Lake area were applied to test the feasibility of the proposed method. In comparison with five other global threshold segmentation algorithms such as the traditional OTSU, MOMENTS, MEAN, ISODATA and MINERROR, the proposed method obtains the highest overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient (KC), while this approach also demonstrates greater robustness in the analysis of time series. The findings of this study offer an effective method to improve water detection accuracy as well as reducing the influence of speckle noise and retaining details in the image.

TI  - Current availability and distribution of Congo Basin's freshwater resources
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water storage-discharge analysis shows that Congo Basin's Total Drainable Water Storage amounts to 476-502 km(3), is unevenly distributed, with 63% in the southern sub-basins, and would take approximately 4.3 months to drain entirely.The Congo Basin is of global significance for biodiversity and the water and carbon cycles. However, its freshwater availability and distribution remain relatively unknown. Using satellite data, here we show that currently the Congo Basin's Total Drainable Water Storage lies within a range of 476 km(3) to 502 km(3), unevenly distributed throughout the region, with 63% being stored in the southernmost sub-basins, Kasai (220-228 km(3)) and Lualaba (109-169 km(3)), while the northern sub-basins contribute only 173 +/- 8 km(3). We further estimate the hydraulic time constant for draining its entire water storage to be 4.3 +/- 0.1 months, but, regionally, permanent wetlands and large lakes act as resistors resulting in greater time constants of up to 105 +/- 3 months. Our estimate provides a robust basis to address the challenges of water demand for 120 million inhabitants, a population expected to double in a few decades.

TI  - Evaluating the Applicability of Global LULC Products and an Author-Generated Phenology-Based Map for Regional Analysis: A Case Study in Ecuador's Ecoregions
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and detailed understanding of land-use change affected by anthropogenic actions is key to environmental policy decision-making and implementation. Although global land cover products have been widely used to monitor and analyse land use/land cover (LULC) change, the feasibility of using these products at the regional level needs to be assessed due to the limitation and biases of generalised models from around the world. The main objective of the present study was to generate regional LULC maps of three target areas located in the main ecoregions of Ecuador at a resolution of 10 m using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud-based computing. Our approach is based on (1) Single Date Classification (SDC) that processes Sentinel-2 data into fuzzy rule-driven thematic classes, (2) rule refinement using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data, and (3) phenology-based synthesis (PBS) classification that combines SDC into LULC based on the occurrence rule. Our results show that the three target areas were classified with an overall accuracy of over 80%. In addition, cross-comparison between the global land cover products and our LULC product was performed and we found discrepancies and inaccuracies in the global products due to the characteristics of the target areas that included a dynamic landscape. Our LULC product supplements existing official statistics and showcases the effectiveness of phenology-based mapping in managing land use by providing precise and timely data to support agricultural policies and ensure food security.

TI  - Forel-Ule index extraction and spatiotemporal variation from MODIS imagery in the Bohai Sea of China
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In large-scale water quality evaluation, traditional field-measured data lack spatial -temporal representativeness, and the role of conventional remote sensing parameters (SST, Chla, TSM, etc.) is controversial. By calculating and grading the hue angle of a water body, a Forel-Ule index (FUI) can be obtained, which provides a comprehensive statement of water condition. Using MODIS imagery, hue angles are extracted with better accuracy than the literature's method. It is found that FUI changes in the Bohai Sea have correlated consistently with water quality. The decreasing trend of non-excellent water quality areas in the Bohai Sea was highly correlated with FUI (R2 = 0.701) during the government-dominated land-based pollution reduction program (2012-2021). FUI can monitor and evaluate seawater quality.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns and drivers of carbon-water coupling in frozen soil zones across the gradients of freezing over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The carbon and water cycle patterns of frozen soil ecosystems in regions, such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), which have fragile and sensitive ecologies, are possibly affected by climate change. However, these patterns along the gradients of varying degrees of freezing remain poorly understood. In this study, we examine the spatio-temporal patterns of water use efficiency (WUE), gross primary productivity (GPP), and evapotrans-piration (ET) in six frozen soil zones of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) with varying degrees of frozen soil. The analysis is based on the frozen soil classification criteria and remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020. The in-fluences of six climatic, nine edaphic, and two botanic parameters on these patterns is also investigated. The results indicate that 48.05%, 24.07%, and 20% of the regions in QTP exhibit significantly upward trends of GPP, ET, and WUE, respectively. The highest increase trends were observed in GPP in the middle-thick seasonally frozen ground zone (2.36 g C m  2 yr  1), ET in the mountain permafrost zone (2.35 mm yr  1), and WUE in the predominantly continuous permafrost zone (0.003 g C kg  1 H2O yr  1). Meanwhile, GPP and WUE decrease progressively with the increase of freezing degrees, from the short-time frozen ground zone (GPP: 604.99 & PLUSMN; 51.99 g C m  2; WUE: 2.34 & PLUSMN; 0.15 g C kg  1 H2O) to the predominantly continuous permafrost zone (GPP: 114.07 & PLUSMN; 11.77 g C m  2; WUE: 0.33 & PLUSMN; 0.04 g C kg  1 H2O), while ET does not show significant differences across the three permafrost zones. The enhanced vegetation index is the primary factor affecting GPP and WUE in most frozen soil zones, whereas climate variables mainly impact ET. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering the effects of different freezing degrees of frozen soil when analyzing the response of the carbon and water cycles in the QTP in the context of climate change.

TI  - Establishing the Position and Drivers of the Eastern Andean Treeline with Automated Transect Sampling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Andean treeline (EATL) is the world's longest altitudinal ecotone and plays an important role in biodiversity conservation in the context of land use/cover and climate change. The purpose of this study was to assess to what extent the position of the tropical EATL (9 degrees N-18 degrees S) is in near-equilibrium with the climate, which determines its potential to adapt to climate change. On a continental scale, we have used land cover maps (MODIS MCD12) and elevation data (SRTM) to make the first-order assessment of the EATL position and continuity. For the assessment on a local scale and to address the three-dimensional nature of environmental change in mountainous environments, a novel method of automated delineation and assessment of altitudinal transects was devised and applied to Landsat-based forest maps (GLAD) and fine-resolution climatology (CHELSA). The emergence of a consistent longitudinal gradient of the treeline elevation over half of the EATL extent, which increases towards the equator by similar to 30 m and similar to 60 m per geographic degree from the south and north, respectively, serves as a first-order validation of the approach, while the local transects reveal a more nuanced aspect-dependent pattern. We conclude that the applied dual-scale approach with automated mass transect sampling allows for an improved understanding of treeline dynamics.

TI  - A time-series InSAR processing chain for wide-area geohazard identification
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series InSAR technology has been widely applied to the identification of various types of surface deformation information, but its traditional processing chain of being applied to the detection, extraction and monitoring of wide-area geohazards requires a large amount of disk space, computing resources and processing time and has high requirements for data, personnel and equipment, which makes it difficult to promote its application in wide-area geohazard identification. Based on this background, this study constructs a time-series InSAR processing chain that makes it easy to achieve fast detection and effective extraction and monitoring of wide-area geohazards. First, the well-coherent HyP3 InSAR online service interferometric dataset is selected for time-series InSAR processing to detect the wide-area surface deformation rate. Then, the deformation anomaly regions in the wide-area range are extracted by combining multi-threshold segmentation and aggregation point (polygon) analysis methods. And then, the original Sentinel-1A SLC data are subjected to interferometric processing and time-series InSAR analysis using the open-source desktop program EZ-InSAR in the extracted typical small-area deformation anomaly regions of interest to obtain more refined deformation information. Nanjian County, Yunnan Province, China, is used as the study area, and a total of 119 potential geohazards with deformation anomalies were detected and extracted in this region, approximately half of which coincided with the results of the field survey and visual interpretation of optical images. The processing chain considers the advantages of wide-area detection of InSAR online service datasets and the advantages of raw resolution of SAR SLC data, and the data and software used are open source with low hardware requirements, which is expected to provide an effective processing chain for wide-area creep geohazard identification.

TI  - Comparison of Forest Restorations with Different Burning Severities Using Various Restoration Methods at Tuqiang Forestry Bureau of Greater Hinggan Mountains
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances and restoration are key processes in carbon transmission between the terrestrial surface and the atmosphere. In boreal forests, fire is the most common and main disturbance. The reconstruction process for post-disaster vegetation plays an essential role in the restoration of a forest's structure and function, and it also maintains the ecosystem's health and stability. Remote sensing monitoring could reflect dynamic post-fire features of vegetation. However, there are still major differences in the remote sensing index in terms of regional feasibility and sensibility. In this study, the largest boreal primary coniferous forest area in China, the Greater Hinggan Mountains forest area, was chosen as the sampling area. Based on time series data from Landsat-5 TM surface reflectance (SR) and data obtained from sample plots, the burned area was extracted using the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). We used the pre- and post-fire difference values (dNBR) and compared them with survey data to classify the burn severity level. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) (based on spectrum combination) and the Disturbance Index (DI) (based on Tasseled-Cap transformation) were chosen to analyze the difference in the degree of burn severity and vegetation restoration observed using various methods according to the sequential variation feature from 1986 to 2011. The results are as follows: (1) The two remote sensing indexes are both sensitive to fire and the burn severity level. When a fire occurred, the NDVI value for that year decreased dramatically while the DI value increased sharply. Alongside these findings, we observed that the rangeability and restoration period of the two indexes is significantly positively correlated with the degree of burn severity. (2) According to these two indexes, natural vegetation restoration was faster than the restoration achieved using artificial methods. However, compared with the NDVI, the DI showed a clearer improvement in restoration, as the restoration period the DI could evaluate was longer in two different ways: the NDVI illustrated great changes in the burn severity in the 5 years post-fire, while the DI was able to show the changes for more than 20 years. Additionally, from the DI, one could identify felling activities carried out when the artificial restoration methods were initially applied. (3) From the sample-plot data, there were few differences in forest canopy density-the average was between 0.55 and 0.6-between the diverse severity levels and restoration methods after 33 years of recovery. The average diameter at breast height (DBH) and height values of trees in naturally restored areas decreased with the increase in burn severity, but the values were obviously higher than those in artificially restored areas. This indicates that both the burn severity level and restoration methods have important effects on forest restoration, but the results may also have been affected by other factors.

TI  - Cross-scene target detection based on feature adaptation and uncertainty-aware pseudo-label learning for high resolution SAR images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are easily affected by factors such as sensor parameters, imaging scenes, etc., which may lead to data distributional discrepancies between the ideal training phase and the practical application phase, resulting in generalization performance degradation of deep learning based detectors in practice. In this paper, an accurate and fast domain adaptive detection method is proposed to address the performance degradation problem of cross-scene detection without requiring additional manual annotations. The cross-scene detection performance is gradually improved by confidence-induced unsupervised feature adaptation (CUFA) and uncertainty-aware adaptive pseudo-label learning (UAPL). In CUFA, image-level and instance-level feature adaptation are progressively implemented to bridge the distribution discrepancies between the source and the target domain in the latent feature space. Then, UAPL is performed to adaptively introduce accurate and stable supervisions of target domain according to the learning status of the detector, avoiding error accumulations and further improving the cross-scene target detection performance. The proposed cross-scene detection method is validated on airborne and spaceborne SAR image datasets of different imaging scenes. The experimental results show that by combining both CUFA and UAPL, compared with the second-best comparison method, the proposed method significantly improves the cross-scene target detection performance in SAR images (at least + 6.5% AP50 and F1 in miniSAR and FARAD cross-scene tasks, and at least + 7.5% AP50 and F1 in Gaofen-3 and Sentinel-1 cross-scene tasks), which facilitates application of the deep learning based detectors in the realistic scenarios.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Change Analysis Using Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study of Tigris and Euphrates Rivers Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal land use/land cover (LULC) change analysis is essential for environmental planning and recourses management. Various global LULC datasets are available now. However, they do not show strong consistency on a regional scale and are mainly time limited. Therefore, high-quality multi-temporal LULC mapping with reasonable consistency on a regional scale is still demanding. In this study, using the Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and the NASA digital elevation model (DEM), LULC mapping of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers basin (TEB) was performed by random forest (RF) classifier in the Google Earth Engine platform during 2000-2022. The spectral bands, spectral indices, morphological, and textural features were applied in the developed procedure. The results indicated that the proposed approach had accurate performance (accuracy = 0.893 and an F score = 0.820) with a good consistency with previous studies. The feature importance evaluation was carried out using Gini index, and spectral indices were identified as the most important features in LULC mapping. Overall, severe LULC change has happened in the TEB during the last two decades. Our results revealed the expansion of water and built-up classes while trees class has experienced a decreasing trend. From a regional perspective, three main areas in the east and south-east of Iraq, north-west of Iraq, and east of Syria were identified where LULC change was intense. These areas are prone to land degradation and dust storms emission problems, and it is necessary to take steps to prevent severe LULC changes in them.

TI  - Exploring the Relationship between Hydroclimate and Lake Area in Source Area of the Yellow River: Implications for the Paleoclimate Studies
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The large tectonic lake is one of the most important water bodies in the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR), northeastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). It plays a key role in decelerating climatic change and regulating regional climate patterns. In this study, we used Landsat images (MSS, TM, ETM+ and OLI) of Lake Gyaring and Lake Ngoring (the Two Sisters Lakes), which are the two largest tectonic lakes in the SAYR, to determine annual lake area fluctuations from 1986 to 2020. The results show that lake area increases were generally consistent with a warming trend in the SAYR. The temperature signals were separated from the lake area changes by using a detrending analysis and found that the processed data are closely correlated with variations of precipitation and streamflow in the SAYR, and the previously reported paleoclimate records, which include the d(18)O record from stalagmite, A/C (Artemisia/Chenopodiaceae) ratio from lake sediment and scPDSI (self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index) from the tree ring on the northeastern margin of the QTP. The phase of relatively large lake areas typically coincides with a negative excursion in d(18)O, a high A/C ratio, and elevated scPDSI values, while the opposite is true for smaller lake areas. It is suggested that the total area of the Two Sisters Lakes is closely associated with hydroclimatic conditions in the SAYR. Furthermore, an association of high TSI anomalies with the water area expansion of the Two Sisters Lakes is also observed, implying that solar activity is the key driving factor for the hydrologic variability in the SAYR on decadal timescales. The findings of our study highlight the validity of previous paleoclimate archives in the northeastern QTP and demonstrate the potential of using remote sensing techniques to investigate paleoclimate.

TI  - Comparing actual evapotranspiration estimations by METRIC to in-situ water balance measurements over an irrigated field in Turkey
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates in large-scale irrigation schemes is of great importance to improve water use efficiency. Crop types can be determined by employing remote sensing techniques coupled with ground truth data. This study aimed to: (a) conduct a water balance study by making in-situ water balance measurements, (b) derive cropping pattern maps, (c) acquire crop evapotranspiration (ETc), (d) generate fully distributed ETa maps, and (e) compare ETa estimations with ETc and in-situ water balance. Landsat 7 and 8 satellite data, and meteorological data were used to estimate ETa in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey in the 2021 hydrological year. Crop types were classified using Sentinel 2A-2B satellite images. The change in catchment storage was +67.08 mm with a 3.34% water balance closure error. The correlation between ETa and ETc for irrigated wheat, potato, lettuce, corn-1, peanut-1, soybean-2, and citrus was significant in the growing season.

TI  - Investigating Gravitational Slope Deformations with COSMO-SkyMed-Based Differential Interferometry: A Case Study of San Marco dei Cavoti
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides pose significant risks to towns and villages in Southern Italy, including the San Marco dei Cavoti hamlet (Benevento, Campania), where settlements have expanded into areas threatened by landslides, leading to property damage, disruption to the social fabric and loss of life. This study aims to investigate the surface deformations in the area using Differential Interferometry SAR (DInSAR) analysis on COSMO-SkyMed radar imagery and to assess the potential implications for landslide activity. The DInSAR analysis methodology allowed us to obtain high-precision results presented as time series diagrams and maps of cumulative displacement for the study area. Furthermore, the displacement rates derived from the DInSAR analysis were decomposed into vertical and horizontal components to provide better insights into the slope processes and their potential impacts on the San Marco dei Cavoti hamlet. Our significant findings revealed active slope movements and the uphill enlargement of previously inventoried landslides threatening the San Marco dei Cavoti hamlet. These insights contribute to a better understanding of the landslide dynamics in the region and highlight the areas that may require further investigation or intervention measures. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of DInSAR analysis in providing valuable insights into landslide dynamics and informing potential mitigation measures for at-risk communities. This technique could be applied to other landslide-prone regions to support informed decision-making and enhance the safety and resilience of affected communities.

TI  - Bias-Corrected RADARSAT-2 Soil Moisture Dynamics Reveal Discharge Hysteresis at An Agricultural Watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites are designed to monitor geospatial data over large areas at a catchment scale. However, most of satellite validation works are conducted at local point scales with a lack of spatial representativeness. Although upscaling them with a spatial average of several point data collected in the field, it is almost impossible to reorganize backscattering responses at pixel scales. Considering the influence of soil storage on watershed streamflow, we thus suggested watershed-scale hydrological validation. In addition, to overcome the limitations of backscattering models that are widely used for C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) soil moisture but applied to bare soils only, in this study, RADARSAT-2 soil moisture was stochastically retrieved to correct vegetation effects arising from agricultural lands. Roughness-corrected soil moisture retrievals were assessed at various spatial scales over the Brightwater Creek basin (land cover: crop lands, gross drainage area: 1540 km(2)) in Saskatchewan, Canada. At the point scale, local station data showed that the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs), Unbiased RMSEs (ubRMSEs) and biases of Radarsat-2 were 0.06 similar to 0.09 m(3)/m(3), 0.04 similar to 0.08 m(3)/m(3) and 0.01 similar to 0.05 m(3)/m(3), respectively, while 1 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) showed underestimation at RMSEs of 0.1 similar to 0.22 m(3)/m(3) and biases of -0.036 similar to-0.2080 m(3)/m(3). Although SMAP soil moisture better distinguished the contributing area at the catchment scale, Radarsat-2 soil moisture showed a better discharge hysteresis. A reliable estimation of the soil storage dynamics is more important for discharge forecasting than a static classification of contributing and noncontributing areas.

TI  - Sensitivity Assessment of Land Desertification in China Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification, a current serious global environmental problem, has caused ecosystems and the environment to degrade. The total area of desertified land is about 1.72 million km(2) in China, which is extensively affected by desertification. Estimating land desertification risks is the top priority for the sustainable development of arid and semi-arid lands in China. In this study, the Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) model was used to assess the sensitivity of land desertification in China. Based on multi-source remote sensing data, this study integrated natural and human factors, calculated the land desertification sensitivity index by overlaying four indicators (soil quality, vegetation quality, climate quality, and management quality), and explored the driving forces of desertification using a principal component and correlation analysis. It was found that the spatial distribution of desertification sensitivity areas in China shows a distribution pattern of gradually decreasing from northwest to southeast, and the areas with very high and high desertification sensitivities were about 620,629 km(2) and 2,384,410 km(2), respectively, which accounts for about 31.84% of the total area of the country. The very high and high desertification sensitivity areas were mainly concentrated in the desert region of northwest China. The principal component and correlation analysis of the sub-indicators in the MEDALUS model indicated that erosion protection, drought resistance, and land use were the main drivers of desertification in China. Furthermore, the aridity index, soil pH, plant coverage, soil texture, precipitation, soil depth, and evapotranspiration were the secondary drivers of desertification in China. Moreover, the desertification sensitivity caused by drought resistance, erosion protection, and land use was higher in the North China Plain region and Guanzhong Basin. The results of the quantitative analysis of the driving forces of desertification based on mathematical statistical methods in this study provide a reference for a comprehensive strategy to combat desertification in China and offer new ideas for the assessment of desertification sensitivity at macroscopic scales.

TI  - Time-Frequency Characteristics and SARIMA Forecasting of Atmospheric Water Vapor in East Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the increasing impact of extreme rainfall and flooding on human life, studying and predicting changes in atmospheric water vapor (AWV) becomes particularly important. This paper analyzes the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data of the East Asian region from January 2003 to February 2023. The AWV data are examined in the time and frequency domain using methods such as empirical orthogonal function (EOF), Mann-Kendall (MK) analysis, and others. Additionally, four prediction models are applied to forecast the monthly average AWV data for the next year. The accuracy of these models is evaluated using metrics such as mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R-2). The findings reveal several key insights: (1) The East Asian region exhibits highly variable seasonal variability in AWV, with identified mutation points after the MK test. (2) Spatial analysis shows high AWV data in the southern coastal areas of China, Thailand, Myanmar, Nansha Islands, and other regions during winter, while the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region experiences low AWV during summer. (3) The first mode obtained through EOF decomposition contributes over 60% of the variance. Analysis of this mode reveals an increasing trend in AWV data for regions such as the Indian peninsula, Mongolia, and central and northeastern China over the past nine years. Conversely, the Bay of Bengal, Spratly Islands, eastern coast, and certain areas display a decreasing trend. (4) Employing the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), the study identifies AWV data as a non-stationary series with an overall decreasing trend from 2003 to 2022. The filtered AWV series undergoes fast Fourier transform (FFT), uncovering periodicities of 2.6 years, 5 years, and 19 years. (5) Among the four forecasting models compared, the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model (SARIMA) demonstrates superior performance with the smallest MSE of 0.00782, MAE of 0.06977, RMSE of 0.08843, and the largest R-2 value of 0.98454. These results clearly indicate that the SARIMA model provides the best fit. Therefore, the SARIMA forecasting model can be effectively utilized for forecasting AWV data, offering valuable insights for studying weather variability.

TI  - An Efficient Cloud Classification Method Based on a Densely Connected Hybrid Convolutional Network for FY-4A
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding atmospheric motions and projecting climate changes depends significantly on cloud types, i.e., different cloud types correspond to different atmospheric conditions, and accurate cloud classification can help forecasts and meteorology-related studies to be more effectively directed. However, accurate classification of clouds is challenging and often requires certain manual involvement due to the complex cloud forms and dispersion. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an improved cloud classification method based on a densely connected hybrid convolutional network. A dense connection mechanism is applied to hybrid three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) architectures to use the feature information of the spatial and spectral channels of the FY-4A satellite fully. By using the proposed network, cloud categorization solutions with a high temporal resolution, extensive coverage, and high accuracy can be obtained without the need for any human intervention. The proposed network is verified using tests, and the results show that it can perform real-time classification tasks for seven different types of clouds and clear skies in the Chinese region. For the CloudSat 2B-CLDCLASS product as a test target, the proposed network can achieve an overall accuracy of 95.2% and a recall of more of than 82.9% for all types of samples, outperforming the other deep-learning-based techniques.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Correlation Considering Environmental Factor Fusion for Estimating Gross Primary Productivity in Tibetan Grasslands
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is an important indicator in research on carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. High-accuracy GPP prediction is crucial for ecosystem health and climate change assessments. We developed a site-level GPP prediction method based on the GeoMAN model, which was able to extract spatiotemporal features and fuse external environmental factors to predict GPP on the Tibetan Plateau. We evaluated four models' behavior-Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and GeoMAN-in predicting GPP at nine flux observation sites on the Tibetan Plateau. The GeoMAN model achieved the best results (R-2 = 0.870, RMSE = 0.788 g Cm-2 d(-1), MAE = 0.440 g Cm-2 d(-1)). Distance and vegetation type of the flux sites influenced GPP prediction, with the latter being more significant. The different grassland vegetation types exhibited different sensitivity to environmental factors (Ta, PAR, EVI, NDVI, and LSWI) for GPP prediction. Among them, the site located in the alpine swamp meadow was insensitive to changes in environmental factors; the GPP prediction accuracy of the site located in the alpine meadow steppe decreased significantly with the changes in environmental factors; and the GPP prediction accuracy of the site located in the alpine Kobresia meadow also varied with environmental factor changes, but to a lesser extent than the former. This study provides a good reference that deep learning model is able to achieve good accuracy in GPP simulation when considers spatial, temporal, and environmental factors, and the judgement made by deep learning model conforms to basic knowledge in the relevant field.

TI  - Geospatial-Based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Weighted Product Model (WPM) Techniques for Mapping and Assessing Flood Susceptibility in the Wadi Hanifah Drainage Basin, Riyadh Region, Saudi Arabia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aimed to map areas prone to flooding in the Wadi Hanifah drainage basin located in the Riyadh region, and identify the most important factors that contribute to flooding through examining the influence of ten topographical, hydrological, and environmental variables affecting flood occurrence. Remote sensing data from Landsat-8, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and other ancillary datasets were used to map relevant variables. Two weighted overlay techniques were used, including: analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and weighted product model (WPM). A correlation matrix and optimum index factor (OIF) were employed to identify the relative importance of each factor. The two derived flood susceptibility maps were assessed through validation by comparing the locations of historical flood events to susceptibility zones. The results confirmed the validity of the WPM map. The results also showed that nearly 50% of the study area was dominated by the "moderate" flood susceptibility zone, while about 33% of the total land area was classified as a "high" flood susceptibility zone. The "slope" factor was found to be the most effective variable for flood occurrence, followed by the "geology" variable, while the "distance to the drainage network" was the least important variable. The results of the OIF indicated that the best combination of factors dictating the variability of all flood susceptibility areas were "geology", "land use/cover (LULC)", and "soil type". The study findings are expected to be useful in understanding the effects of each factor on the spatial variation in flood occurrence and in improving flood control, and can be reapplied to other regions with similar climatic and environmental conditions worldwide.

TI  - Climatic and topographic controls on glacial changes (1973-2020) in Shigar Basin, Central Karakoram, Northern Pakistan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hindukush, Karakorum, and Himalaya (HKH) mountains are often referred to as the "Third Pole" because of high snow, being a major freshwater resource and early indicator of climate change. Therefore, research on the dynamics of glacier changes and their relationship with climate and topographic variability is essential for sustainable water resource management and adaptation strategies in Pakistan. In this contribution, we delineated 187 glaciers and examined these glacier changes in the Shigar Basin from 1973 to 2020 using Corona, Landsat Operational Land Imager/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus/Thematic Mapper/Multispectral Scanner System (OLI/ETM/TM/MSS), Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) imageries. The total glacier area decreased from 2796.31 +/- 132 km(2) in 1973 to 2756.27 +/- 63 km(2) in 2020 at an average rate of - 0.83 +/- 0.03 km(2)yr(-1). Specifically, during the period of 1990-2000, these glaciers shrank most heavily at an average rate of - 2.372 +/- 0.08 km(2)yr(-1). In contrast, an increased rate of 0.57 +/- 0.02 km(2)yr(-1) in total glacier area was observed during the recent decade (2010-2020). Moreover, the glaciers with gentle slopes retreated less heavily than the steep ones. There was reduction in glacier coverage and length for all slope classes, and a small reduction was observed with gentle slopes, while higher losses were observed on steep slope gradients. The transition of glaciers in the Shigar Basin may be attributed by the direct influence of glacier size and topographical characteristics. By comparing with climate records, our findings suggest that the overall reduction in glacier area from 1973 to 2020 was associated with declining precipitation (- 0.78 mmm/year) and rising temperature (0.045 degrees C/year) trends in the region, and glacier advances in recent decade (2010-2020) were likely to be driven by increased winter and autumn precipitation.

TI  - Spatial analysis of forest cover and quality dynamics of Jalthal forest in the Jhapa district, Nepal
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts of community forest users show positive changes in forest cover and quality but there was limited study regarding this. Thus, this study was objectively conducted to assess dynamics of forest cover and quality between 1990 and 2021 in Jalthal Jhapa, Nepal. Supervised classification with a maximum likelihood algorithm was applied to classify forest cover to produce maps of 1990, 2005 and 2021. Forest quality change was assessed using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Moisture Index (SVI). A total of 114.0 ha non-forest was converted into forest between 2005 and 2011. Overall accuracy of classified maps of 1990, 2005 and 2021 was 85.29%, 84.08% and 88.13%, respectively. Sparse forest was converted into dense forest by 0.06% between 1990 and 2021. Principal Component Analysis showed successful implementation of community forest program and control grazing were main factors positively affecting to increase forest cover and quality. Value of NDVI showed that high vegetation forest covers around 42.27% in 2021 and SMI was the highest. Kaiser-Meyer-Olk in (KMO) (0.474) and Bartlett Sphericity tests (p = 0.001) showed there was linear relationship between factors affecting forest cover and quality. This paper will be useful for academicians and policymakers to monitor forest.

TI  - Detecting Individual Plants Infected with Pine Wilt Disease Using Drones and Satellite Imagery: A Case Study in Xianning, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, remote sensing techniques such as satellite and drone-based imaging have been used to monitor Pine Wilt Disease (PWD), a widespread forest disease that causes the death of pine species. Researchers have explored the use of remote sensing imagery and deep learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of PWD detection at the single-tree level. This study introduces a novel framework for PWD detection that combines high-resolution RGB drone imagery with free-access Sentinel-2 satellite multi-spectral imagery. The proposed approach includes an PWD-infected tree detection model named YOLOv5-PWD and an effective data augmentation method. To evaluate the proposed framework, we collected data and created a dataset in Xianning City, China, consisting of object detection samples of infected trees at middle and late stages of PWD. Experimental results indicate that the YOLOv5-PWD detection model achieved 1.2% higher mAP compared to the original YOLOv5 model and a further improvement of 1.9% mAP was observed after applying our dataset augmentation method, which demonstrates the effectiveness and potential of the proposed framework for PWD detection.

TI  - A Deep-Learning Scheme for Hydrometeor Type Classification Using Passive Microwave Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a novel approach for hydrometeor classification using passive microwave observations. The use of passive measurements for this purpose has not been extensively explored, despite being available for over four decades. We utilize the Micro-Wave Humidity Sounder-2 (MWHS-2) to relate microwave brightness temperatures to hydrometeor types derived from the global precipitation measurement's (GPM) dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR), which are classified into liquid, mixed, and ice phases. To achieve this, we utilize a convolutional neural network model with an attention mechanism that learns feature representations of MWHS-2 observations from spatial and temporal dimensions. The proposed algorithm classified hydrometeors with 84.7% accuracy using testing data and captured the geographical characteristics of hydrometeor types well in most areas, especially for frozen precipitation. We then evaluated our results by comparing predictions from a different year against DPR retrievals seasonally and globally. Our global annual cycles of precipitation occurrences largely agreed with DPR retrievals with biases being 8.4%, -11.8%, and 3.4%, respectively. Our approach provides a promising direction for utilizing passive microwave observations and deep-learning techniques in hydrometeor classification, with potential applications in the time-resolved observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats (TROPICS) algorithm development.

TI  - ROBOT: A spatiotemporal fusion model toward seamless data cube for global remote sensing applications
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time-series high-resolution satellite images are extremely valuable for long-term monitoring of land dynamics. Spatiotemporal fusion (STF) techniques have been developed to integrate multi-resolution satellite images to produce data with high spatial resolution and temporal frequency. Due to the large volume and diversity of higher resolution global Earth Observation (EO) data, large-scale data processing methods need to be computationally efficient, free of parameter fine-tuning, and adaptive to various data structures without process customization. These requirements are especially critical for the production of global Seamless Data Cube (SDC). Considering the limitations of existing STF methods, we propose a ROBust OpTimization-based (ROBOT) fusion model that exploits time-series information to obtain more accurate predictions. ROBOT maintains stable under varied data conditions by adopting a temporal-coherence regularization term. And being free of parameter tuning, ROBOT can be applied to arbitrary spatiotemporally distributed data without repetitive process customization. Its performance was compared with eight representative STF methods. Results show that ROBOT outperforms existing STF methods in most cases and is computationally efficient, about 4000-fold faster than ESTARFM and 600-fold faster than FSDAF. The proposed method has demonstrated its potential for global-scale SDC generation to support subsequent remote sensing applications.

TI  - Sand Spit Morphology at an Inlet on Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal inlets with attached sand spits are a very common coastal landform. Since the evolution of sand spits along coastlines influence the social-economic development of local coastal areas, sand spits have become the objects of numerous studies. However, previous studies have mainly focused on sand spits that are usually in the scale of hundreds of meters in width, whilst knowledge about the evolution of smaller-scale sand spits still remains limited. Therefore, in this study, the morphological change of a small and unexplored sand spit in front of Song Tranh Inlet on the west coast of Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam is investigated. Satellite images are first used to observe the morphological change of the sand spit and calculate the longshore sediment transport rates (LSTR) along the sand spit. Waves and beach sediments are collected at the study site to calculate the longshore sediment transport rate using the CERC formula. It is found that there is a seasonal variation in the evolution of the sand spit at Song Tranh Inlet. The longshore sediment transport rates along the spit calculated by image analysis are 39,000 m(3)/year, 66,000 m(3)/year, and 40,000 m(3)/year, whilst the longshore sediment transport rate calculated by the CERC formula is 72,000 m(3)/year. This study aims to contribute to the methodology for investigating the evolutions of small sand spits and, specifically, sustainable coastal management for Phu Quoc Island, which is well-known as the Pearl Island of Vietnam.

TI  - Remotely sensed terrestrial open water evaporation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial open water evaporation is difficult to measure both in situ and remotely yet is critical for understanding changes in reservoirs, lakes, and inland seas from human management and climatically altered hydrological cycling. Multiple satellite missions and data systems (e.g., ECOSTRESS, OpenET) now operationally produce evapotranspiration (ET), but the open water evaporation data produced over millions of water bodies are algorithmically produced differently than the main ET data and are often overlooked in evaluation. Here, we evaluated the open water evaporation algorithm, AquaSEBS, used by ECOSTRESS and OpenET against 19 in situ open water evaporation sites from around the world using MODIS and Landsat data, making this one of the largest open water evaporation validations to date. Overall, our remotely sensed open water evaporation retrieval captured some variability and magnitude in the in situ data when controlling for high wind events (instantaneous: r(2) = 0.71; bias = 13% of mean; RMSE = 38% of mean). Much of the instantaneous uncertainty was due to high wind events (u > mean daily 7.5 m center dot s(-1)) when the open water evaporation process shifts from radiatively-controlled to atmospherically-controlled; not accounting for high wind events decreases instantaneous accuracy significantly (r(2) = 0.47; bias = 36% of mean; RMSE = 62% of mean). However, this sensitivity minimizes with temporal integration (e.g., daily RMSE = 1.2-1.5 mm center dot day(-1)). To benchmark AquaSEBS, we ran a suite of 11 machine learning models, but found that they did not significantly improve on the process-based formulation of AquaSEBS suggesting that the remaining error is from a combination of the in situ evaporation measurements, forcing data, and/or scaling mismatch; the machine learning models were able to predict error well in and of itself (r(2) = 0.74). Our results provide confidence in the remotely sensed open water evaporation data, though not without uncertainty, and a foundation by which current and future missions may build such operational data.

TI  - A temporal segmentation approach for dendrometers signal-to-noise discrimination
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic analysis of point dendrometer time series (DTS) registering radial stem variations of trees is of relevant interest to study tree water use and growth. Unfortunately, data from such sensors are often characterized by a large amount of noise that needs to be distinguished by sensors responses induced by biological processes (signal) and irregular fluctuations due to electrical disturbances, malfunctions, or external inputs (noise) such as stem flow, perturbation induced by animals, stem temperature and humidity variations. Although some algorithms have been developed to adjust jumps and correct peaks in DTS, it is nowadays challenging to extract biological signals after a large number of corrections and artifacts introduced during denoising processes. In this study, we present an alternative methodology consisting of the first attempt to automatically identify days in which the dendrometers are registering information related to the activity of the tree and relevant for a specific study (days-of-signal). Through (i) per-day temporal segmentation of different stem behaviors, (ii) daily temporal features extraction, and (iii) automatic days-of-signal and days-of-noise discrimination, we automatically analyzed 19 million DTS records acquired during three years by 12 dendrometers installed on xylem and bark at different stem heights from the collar, at the bottom and top-level, of Pinus sylvestris trees. To train and assess the performance of the model, we constructed a reference dataset by labelling 600 daily DTS into days-ofsignal or days-of-noise. As a result of our model application, we detected 3,534 days-of-signal among the altogether 13,152 measurement days with a per sensor overall accuracy, calculated using the reference dataset, ranging between 100% and 82%. Finally, we showed the trend of stem shrinkage and swelling over the three years study period. The large accuracies obtained over the different sensors suggest that our method is versatile and generalizable.

TI  - Land use-land cover dynamics, and local perceptions of change drivers among Nyangatom agro-pastoralists, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and land cover (LULC) and their drivers is instrumental in synthesizing knowledge for informed natural resource management, planning, and associated decisions. The objective of this study was to analyze LULC dynamics and their drivers in the Nyangatom district of southwest Ethiopia. This study adopted a mixed-method approach, comprising remote sensing and geographic information system-based analysis, focus-group discussions, key informant interviews, and structured interviews covering 384 agro-pastoral households. Land use and land cover maps were compiled with Landsat image data from 1992, 1999, 2010, and 2020 using supervised pixel-based classification with a maximum likelihood algorithm. The study revealed that grassland (33%) and shrub land (27%) are the dominant LULC classes in the study periods. The results show a significant increase in settlement, cropland, and bare land, between 1992 and 2020 following demand for fertile lands, overgrazing, and climate changes. Reductions in the water body, open woodland, riverine forest, and dense woodland of -23%, -18%, -18%, and -7%, respectively, were observed for the same period with an overall accuracy of 80%. Agro-pastoralists identified agricultural expansion, overgrazing, and drought as the main drivers of LULC changes, followed by conflicts, invasion of alien plant species, and change in policy institutions. The impacts of unplanned LULC change can be reduced through appropriate land-use planning with genuine stakeholder engagement. Updated information on present and future LULC dynamics can support these social dynamics and align a shared understanding among stakeholders that replaces polari-zation and erosion of mutual trust.

T2  - TRAVEL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp decline of post-travel patient encounters at the European sentinel surveillance network (EuroTravNet) of travellers' health. We report on the impact of COVID-19 on travel-related infectious diseases as recorded by EuroTravNet clinics. Methods: Travelers who presented between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2021 were included. Comparisons were made between the pre-pandemic period (14 months from January 1, 2019 to February 29, 2020); and the pandemic period (19 months from March 1, 2020 to September 30, 2021). Results: Of the 15,124 visits to the network during the 33-month observation period, 10,941 (72%) were during the pre-pandemic period, and 4183 (28%) during the pandemic period. Average monthly visits declined from 782/month (pre-COVID-19 era) to 220/month (COVID-19 pandemic era). Among non-migrants, the top-10 countries of exposure changed after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic; destinations such as Italy and Austria, where COVID-19 exposure peaked in the first months, replaced typical travel destinations in Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, India). There was a small decline in migrant patients reported, with little change in the top countries of exposure (Bolivia, Mali). The three top diagnoses with the largest overall decreases in relative frequency were acute gastroenteritis (-5.3%), rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (-2.8%), and dengue (-2.6%). Apart from COVID-19 (which rose from 0.1% to 12.7%), the three top diagnoses with the largest overall relative frequency increase were schistosomiasis (+4.9%), strongyloidiasis (+2.7%), and latent tuberculosis (+2.4%). Conclusions: A marked COVID-19 pandemic-induced decline in global travel activities is reflected in reduced travel-related infectious diseases sentinel surveillance reporting.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background: In Japan, sentinel surveillance is used to monitor the trend of infectious gastroenteritis. Another method of pathogen surveillance, wastewater-based epidemiology, has been used recently because it can help to monitor infectious disease without relying on patient data. Here, we aimed to determine the viral trends reflected in the number of reported patients and number of gastroenteritis virus-positive samples. We focused on gastroenteritis viruses present in wastewater and investigated the usefulness of wastewater surveillance for the surveillance of infectious gastroenteritis.Methods: Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for viral gene detection in wastewater. The number of reported patients per pediatric sentinel site and number of viral genome copies were compared for correlation potential. The number of gastroenteritis virus positive samples reported by NESID and a status of gastroenteritis viruses detected in wastewater were also evaluated.Results: Genes of norovirus GI, norovirus GII, sapovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus group A, and rotavirus group C were detected in wastewater samples. Viruses were detected in wastewater during periods when no gastroenteritis virus-positive samples were reported to NESID.Conclusions: Norovirus GII and other gastroenteritis viruses were detected in wastewater even during periods when no gastroenteritis virus-positive samples were found. Therefore, surveillance using wastewater can complement sentinel surveillance and is an effective tool for the surveillance of infectious gastroenteritis.

TI  - Religious schools in the Netherlands: An analysis of arguments and assumptions in a tense public debate
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the public and political debate about religious schools in the Netherlands, various arguments recur. Those arguments are not isolated or neutral, but are shaped and defined by various normative assumptions. Arguments against religious schools are, for instance, affected by the dominant secular discourse in Western Europe. Unconscious normative assumptions are potentially problematic if they remain unnoticed and if there is a lack of reflection on them. A religious worldview has become a minority perspective in the Netherlands, which makes it important to reflect on the normative assumptions underlying the arguments in the debate about religious schools in order to avoid blindly and uncritically imposing a majority norm on a minority. In this article, the arguments dominating the public and political debate on religious schools in the Netherlands are discerned. Implicit assumptions are brought to the surface and analysed from an interreligious perspective. In order to do so, the social, religious and historical context of the Dutch debate is reflected upon, and the recurring arguments are defined by conducting a qualitative content analysis.

TI  - Time series (2001/2002-2021) analysis of Earth observation data using Google Earth Engine (GEE) for detecting changes in land use land cover (LULC) with specific reference to forest cover in East Godavari Region, Andhra Pradesh, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study employs Google Earth Engine (GEE), a new cloud computing platform, to monitor changes in LULC, focusing on the shifting forest cover in the East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh through loss and gain scenarios. Satellite data collected in 2001, 2016, and 2022 at a spatial resolution of 30 m from Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and Landsat 9 OLI-2, respectively, were used for this purpose. An increase of 375.81 km(2) (3.32%) in forest cover is observed between 2001 and 2022. Other categories such as water (36.06%), built-up (158.78%), riverbed (145.5%) and mangroves (4.69%) have also witnessed positive net area change from 2001 to 2022, whereas a decrease is observed in the vegetation and fallow-land/barren-land category. Additionally, year-by-year trend analysis for loss and gain status was used to confirm the reported increase in the forest class. Utilising the Hansen Global Forest Change Technique in the GEE platform, the loss trend was examined from 2001 to 2020 and revealed a clear decrease in forest loss. On the other hand, for gain trend, biennial Indian State Forest Report (ISFR) provided by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) from 2001 to 2021 corroborated with the findings of apparent changes in LULC forest class. The findings show that cutting-edge technology like GEE may be successfully used for trend monitoring and analysing the condition of natural resources, which would further aid and guide land-use planners in formulating sustainable land-use policies.

TI  - An Approach Integrating Multi-Source Data with LandTrendr Algorithm for Refining Forest Recovery Detection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Disturbances to forests are getting worse with climate change and urbanization. Assessing the functionality of forest ecosystems is challenging because it requires not only a large amount of input data but also comprehensive estimation indicator methods. The object of the evaluation index of forest ecosystem restoration relies on the ecosystem function instead of the area. To develop the appropriate index with ecological implications, we built the hybrid assessment approach including ecosystem structure-function-habitat representatives. It was based on the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral indicator and combined with the local forest management inventory (LFMI), Landsat, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. The results of the visual interpretation of Google Earth's historical imagery showed that the total accuracy of the hybrid approach was 0.94. The output of the hybrid model increased as the biodiversity index value increased. Furthermore, to solve the multi-source data availability problem, the random forest model (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.14) with 0.77 total accuracy was built to generate an annual recovery index. A random forest model based on tree age is provided to simplify the hybrid approach while extending the results on time series. The recovery index obtained by the random forest model could facilitate monitoring the forest recovery rate of cold spots. The regional ecological recovery time could be predicted. These two results could provide a scientific basis for forest managers to make more effective forest restoration plans. From the perspective of space, it could ensure that the areas with slow recovery would be allocated enough restoration resources. From the perspective of time, the implementation period of the closed forest policy could also be estimated.

TI  - RSARE: A physically-based vegetation index for estimating wheat green LAI to mitigate the impact of leaf chlorophyll content and residue-soil background
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The green leaf area index (LAI) is an important structural parameter that can be used for monitoring plant transpiration and carbon cycling over large spatial extents. LAI is also critical for understanding biophysical processes and predicting crop productivity. However, the retrieval of wheat green LAI based on canopy reflec-tance is always affected by the background material. For example, in the Yangtze River Basin of China, rice residues are typically returned to rice-wheat rotation fields. Thus the background for observing wheat canopy varies from a mixture of traditional wheat-soil components to wheat-residue or wheat-residue-soil, posing a significant challenge for accurate LAI estimation at the early stages of crop growth. Furthermore, when current vegetation indices (VIs) are used to estimate LAI, leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and field moisture are two additional confounding factors. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel residue-soil adjusted red edge dif-ference index (RSARE), which draws on concepts from a simple physical algorithm, i.e., linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). The results of field, satellite and modeling experiments demonstrate that the RSARE-LAI model is generally not sensitive to LCC, or to variations in residue-soil and traditional soil backgrounds, and estimates LAI with high accuracy (RMSEval = 0.55, RRMSEval=20.71%). In comparison to traditional VI-LAI maps, RASRE-LAI maps are less sensitive to confounding factors associated with the background components, field moisture, LCC, and both inter-annual and geographical differences. This novel residue-soil background-resistant RSARE particularly improves the accuracy of wheat LAI estimation at low LAI levels, thus facilitating large-scale mapping of LAI in the early growing season.

TI  - Brightness Temperature Characteristics of Short-Duration Heavy Rainfall in the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Region in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyzed the brightness temperature characteristics of short-duration heavy rainfall (SDHR) along the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway (CCR), an important corridor of economic and transportation activity in southwest China. Our findings could prove useful in the monitoring and advance warning of SDHR events: (1) SDHR predominantly occurred from July to August, with a peak frequency in July in the CCR area. In terms of diurnal variation, SDHR was mainly observed at night, particularly between 22:00-05:00 and 06:00-09:00 (local time), with a peak at 01:00; (2) The relationship between SDHR and equivalent blackbody temperature (TBB) further showed that the occurrence of SDHR was accompanied by TBB decreasing to its minimum value, after which it increased, and SDHR ceased. In cases where TBB approached its minimum value after 1 h but continued to decrease slightly, SDHR continued. When SDHR occurred, the majority of the TBB values were recorded in the range 190-230 K; within this range, values between 190 and 200 K were most frequently recorded. In general, lower TBB values are associated with more intense SDHR. Based on this finding, we used linear regression to establish an estimating equation for SDHR.

TI  - OC_3S: An optical classification and spectral scoring system for global waters using UV-visible remote sensing reflectance
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification of water bodies is an effective means of understanding the optical properties of aquatic environ-ments. However, most existing water classification systems are mainly based on the visible domain, and the ultraviolet (UV) wavelength, which has important impacts on the growth of phytoplankton, has received less focus. In this study, we developed a novel water classification and spectral scoring system (denoted OC_3S) using 26,709 global in situ hyperspectral data. These spectral data range from the UV to visible domain (380 nm to 750 nm), covering waters from clear to turbid. OC_3S classified water types into 30 classes, providing detailed in-formation on the inherent optical properties and apparent optical properties of different water classes and quality assurance of remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectra for multiple sensor data. The results show that OC_3S can capture high-quality Rrs data with little loss of data volume. For example, the uncertainty of Rrs (443) can be reduced by-1.33 % at the cost of 5 % of observations in oligotrophic oceans. In addition, OC_3S performs more stably in turbid water classes compared to the QA system (Wei, J., Lee, Z., & Shang, S., 2016b. A system to measure the data quality of spectral remote-sensing reflectance of aquatic environments. Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 8189-8207) because the coefficient of variation of OC_3S scores in turbid waters can be reduced by-44 % compared to that of QA scores. Moreover, good consistency was observed when OC_3S was applied to multiple current satellite images due to its superior tolerance to potential errors in atmospheric correction and radiometric calibration. Our OC_3S is capable of reducing the uncertainty of satellite products and could be applied to future sensors with UV bands (e.g., PACE).

TI  - Portable RT-PCR and MinION Nanopore Sequencing as a Proof-of-Concept SARS-CoV-2 Biosurveillance in Wastewater.
T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In this study, wastewater samples collected from a participating sentinel site were initially screened for the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using portable RT-PCR, with positive samples sequenced using a handheld MinION nanopore sequencing device. Genomic biosurveillance of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants within wastewater has been established as an early warning system of infectious disease spread in a given catchment area, due to good correlation between spikes in viral levels detected in wastewater coincident with increases in COVID-19 incidence rates. Moreover, viral titers detected in a single wastewater sample are reflective of pre-symptomatic, asymptomatic, and post-symptomatic cases, making wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) a cost-effective, non-invasive public health surveillance method complementary to clinical diagnostic testing. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of population-scale SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology for insights into the viral evolution and transmission dynamics associated with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants that are necessary for effective strategies of containment and timely deployment of appropriate countermeasures.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis and cellular automata-based simulations of biophysical indicators under the scenario of climate change and urbanization using artificial neural network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization is an indicator of infrastructure and economic development. Changes in the urbanization pattern contribute significantly to land use land cover (LULC) change, precipitation pattern, and vegetation cover (VC). These changes are intensified by climate change and the increasing population. Understanding the responses of the biophysical indicators such as precipitation accumulation (PA), trends, and vegetation cover to climate change and rapid urbanization is the key to predicting future scenarios. This study aims to monitor and simulate the scenario of the biophysical indicators in response to urbanization and climate change in the Rangpur district, Bangladesh. Landsat 4-5 TM and 8 OLI satellite images, data regarding meteorological conditions, and biophysical indicators from 2001 to 2020 were used to quantify the LULC, PA, and VC changes and predict future scenarios for 2025 and 2030 using machine learning algorithms such as cellular automata (CA) and artificial neural network (ANN). Between 2001 and 2020, urban areas and vegetation have increased by 768% and 27.9% respectively, followed by redactions in water bodies and barren land by 65% and 77.5% respectively. Simulation results indicate significant growth in urban areas by 17.4% and 25.1% in 2030 and 2040, flowed by decreased vegetation cover (1.2% and 1.8%), water bodies (12.9% and 17.2%), and barren lands (22.9% and 31.5%). Mann Kendall trend test also shows no pattern for eight months in one year, suggesting changing precipitation pattern. These changes are indicative of climate change at a micro-level and threaten sustainable development and climate resilience.

TI  - Visual feature-based improved EfficientNet-GRU for <i>Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus</i> identification
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Fritillariae Cirrhosae Bulbus (FCB) as a well-known traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which is widely used for its ability of relieving cough and eliminating phlegm in cooking and treating. However, the adulteration by different species for economic profit has frequently been reported. Inspired by deep learning, a novel approach based on image captioning is proposed to achieve the accurate and fast identification of FCB: EGNet, via bridging between image visual features and word expression in Chinese Pharmacopoeia. In encoder module, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and spatial attention module (SA) are introduced into EfficientNet-B0 to strengthen and focus on the unique features. For decoder module, due to the simpler structure and fewer parameters, gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied for generating the correspondence and explanation with text descriptions. Simultaneously, the adaptive attention mechanism with a visual sentinel is inject into GRU for judging adaptively whether to rely on visual information or semantic information. Eventually, experiments confirm that the proposed EGNet outperforms competing methods. And it is superior in the highest identification accuracy of 99.0%, 99.3% and 99.4%, the best words matching completeness 91.1%, 92.2% and 91.6% for Lubei, Qingbei, and Songbei. This paper can significantly improve the accuracy of classification and the cost is low. It is proved to be an exceptional practice for the high-efficiency of TCM-discrimination and TCM-technology.

TI  - Optical Remote Sensing in Provisioning of Ecosystem-Functions Analysis-Review
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Keeping natural ecosystems and their functions in the proper condition is necessary. One of the best contactless monitoring methods is remote sensing, especially optical remote sensing, which is used for vegetation applications. In addition to satellite data, data from ground sensors are necessary for validation or training in ecosystem-function quantification. This article focuses on the ecosystem functions associated with aboveground-biomass production and storage. The study contains an overview of the remote-sensing methods used for ecosystem-function monitoring, especially methods for detecting primary variables linked to ecosystem functions. The related studies are summarized in multiple tables. Most studies use freely available Sentinel-2 or Landsat imagery, with Sentinel-2 mostly producing better results at larger scales and in areas with vegetation. The spatial resolution is a key factor that plays a significant role in the accuracy with which ecosystem functions are quantified. However, factors such as spectral bands, algorithm selection, and validation data are also important. In general, optical data are usable even without supplementary data.

TI  - Detection of dawn sea fog/low stratus using geostationary satellite imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional satellite-based detection of dawn sea fog/low stratus (SFLS) is difficult because of the weak reflec-tivity in the visible at low solar elevation angles and the contamination of the reflected sunlight in the mid-infrared. Here, based on single geostationary satellite measurements acquired by China's Fengyun 4A (FY-4A), we propose a dawn SFLS detection algorithm using the joint Fully Convolutional Network and Conditional Random Field (FCN-CRF), which are well known for image semantic segmentation under low contrast conditions. We train the FCN-CRF detection algorithm using FY-4A measurements over the Yellow Sea, where some dawn SFLS events are long-lived, providing relatively time-invariant dawn SFLS samples for training. We design a SFLS labelling technique using the satellite observations before and after dawn to train the FCN-CRF detection for dawn SFLS. A test against buoy visibility observations shows that the FCN-CRF detection is able to detect dawn SFLS with satisfactory accuracy, with a probability of detection (POD) of 84.9%, a false alarm ratio (FAR) of 8.7%, a critical success index (CSI) of 78.5% and a hit rate score (HR) of 87.4%.

TI  - Three-Dimensional Deformation of the 2023 Turkey Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.7 Earthquake Sequence Obtained by Fusing Optical and SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In February 2023, Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.7 earthquakes struck southeastern Turkey. Generating a coseismic 3D deformation field that can directly reflect the characteristics of surface deformation is important for revealing the movement mode of a seismogenic fault and analyzing the focal mechanism. Optical image sub-pixel correlation (SPC) only captures deformation in the horizontal direction, and SAR image pixel offset tracking (POT) obtains range deformation that is not sensitive to north-south deformation signals. Thus, neither of them can capture the complete 3D deformation alone. Combining them may be able to allow the monitoring of 3D deformation. In this study, we used Sentinel-2 optical images to obtain the horizontal deformation (east-west and north-south) and Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 data to extract the range and azimuth offsets. The least-squares method was used to fuse the optical and SAR offsets to obtain the 3D deformation field of the 2023 Turkey earthquake sequence, which indicates that the two events were both left-lateral strike-slip earthquakes. The surface deformation caused by the two large earthquakes is mainly in the east-west direction. In the vertical direction, the two earthquakes caused a small-magnitude uplift and subsidence. The findings in this paper can be used as a reference for the study of coseismic 3D deformation.

TI  - SUCCOR Nodes: May Sentinel Node Biopsy Determine the Need for Adjuvant Treatment?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Background The SUCCOR cohort was developed to analyse the overall and disease-free survival at 5 years in women with FIGO 2009 stage IB1 cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the use of adjuvant therapy in these women, depending on the method used to diagnose lymphatic node metastasis.Patients and Methods We used data from the SUCCOR cohort, which collected information from 1049 women with FIGO 2009 stage IB1 cervical cancer who were operated on between January 2013 and December 2014 in Europe. We calculated the adjusted proportion of women who received adjuvant therapy depending on the lymph node diagnosis method and compared disease free and overall survival using Cox proportional-hazards regression models. Inverse probability weighting was used to adjust for baseline potential confounders.Results The adjusted proportion of women who received adjuvant therapy was 33.8% in the sentinel node biopsy + lymphadenectomy (SNB+LA) group and 44.7% in the LA group (p = 0.02), although the proportion of positive nodal status was similar (p = 0.30). That difference was greater in women with negative nodal status and positive Sedlis criteria (difference 31.2%, p = 0.01). Here, those who underwent a SNB+LA had an increased risk of relapse [hazard ratio (HR) 2.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98-6.33, p = 0.056] and risk of death (HR 3.49, 95% CI 1.04-11.7, p = 0.042) compared with those who underwent LA.Conclusions Women in this study were less likely to receive adjuvant therapy if their nodal invasion was determined using SNB+LA compared with LA. These results suggest a lack of therapeutic measures available when a negative result is obtained by SNB+LA, which may have an impact on the risk of recurrence and survival.

TI  - Study on Spatiotemporal Evolution and Driving Forces of Habitat Quality in the Basin along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province Based on InVEST Model
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The basin along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province is an important ecological protective screen in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Belt, with a large number of wetlands, lakes, and nature reserves in the basin. The effect of the rapid development of regional urbanization on the ecological environment quality has become an important threat source that restricts ecosystem function and biodiversity protection in the basin. Therefore, this study used InVEST model to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of habitat quality based on remote sensing image data from 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 in the basin along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province and revealed the spatial evolution trend of habitat quality degradation by using hot and cold spot analysis methods. The geographical detector model was used to discuss the main driving factors of habitat quality change. The study results showed that a trend of increase and decrease of construction land and paddy land in the basin from 1990 to 2020 was the opposite, that is, the area of construction land increased, and the area of paddy land decreased. Especially, the area of construction land increased from 390.18 km(2) in 1990 to 1616.34 km(2) in 2020. The area of increase and decrease of other land types remained around 1% to 2%. During the period from 2000 to 2020, Construction land was mainly transferred in from paddy land, accounting for over 60% of the area transferred in, which indicated the continuous increase of human activity intensity in the study area. From 1990 to 2020, the areas with a significant decline in habitat quality in the basin were mainly concentrated along the Yangtze River and in the northern part of the Chaohu Lake. The area proportion with the lowest grade of habitat quality showed a trend of increasing year by year, that is, the area proportion increased from 4.85% in 1990 to 8.47% in 2020. The hot spots of habitat quality degradation were concentrated in Hefei and its surrounding areas, while the cold spots of the degradation were mainly concentrated in the southern and western mountainous areas. Land use type was the main driving factor affecting habitat quality, and the interaction between land use and per capita GDP was the main driving factor for changes in habitat quality. The study results had important theoretical and practical value for the ecological environment protection and harmonious development of the relationship between humans and nature in the basin along the Yangtze River in Anhui Province.

TI  - Accounting for cloud cover and circannual variation puts the effect of lunar phase on deer-vehicle collisions into perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - 1. Although several studies have focused on the influence of moonlight on deer-vehicle collisions, findings have been inconsistent. This may be due to neglect of the effects of cloud cover, a major impediment to moon illumination and circannual variation in both deer and human activity.2. We assessed how median cloud cover interacted with the illuminated fraction of the moon in affecting daily roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkill in Slovenia (Central Europe). Data included nationwide roadkill (n = 49,259), collected between 2010 and 2019 by hunters, as required by law.3. Roadkill peaked under medium to high cloud cover and decreased during nights with low or extremely high cloudiness. This pattern was more pronounced on nights with a full moon. However, the effects of moon illumination and cloud cover had a lower predictive potential than circannual variation, as collisions clearly peaked in April/May, July and August/September.4. Our results suggest that moonlight could influence roe deer movements through compensatory foraging. However, on nights with a full moon, collisions could also be affected by weather. On bright nights, roe deer might be less active due to increased human presence and sustained vehicular traffic. Then, with medium to high cloud cover and also rainfall, human presence in the environment may be low enough to increase deer movements, but vehicular traffic can still be intermediate, maximizing the risk of collisions. Finally, with overcast skies, widespread rainfall can reduce both traffic volume and human outdoor activity, decreasing the risk of collisions.5. Moon illumination may indeed affect wildlife-vehicle collisions and roadkill, but its effects should be quantified as a function of cloud cover. Moreover, to make studies truly comparable, research about wildlife-vehicle collisions should also account for time of the year.6. Policy implications. Because collisions with roe deer peak at particular periods of the year, signs should be installed seasonally. By doing so, they would warn drivers about the risk, improve drivers' awareness and increase their safety. Moreover, as collisions also increase on nights with a full moon and overcast skies, interactive warning signs that are activated by ground illumination should also be useful.

TI  - Axillary Lymph Node Dissection is Associated with Improved Survival Among Men with Invasive Breast Cancer and Sentinel Node Metastasis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, and management is extrapolated from trials that enroll only women. It is unclear whether contemporary axillary management based on data from landmark trials in women may also apply to men with breast cancer. This study aimed to compare survival in men with positive sentinel lymph nodes after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone versus complete axillary dissection (ALND).Patients and Methods Using the National Cancer Database, men with clinically node-negative, T1 and T2 breast cancer and 1-2 positive sentinel nodes who underwent SLNB or ALND were identified from 2010 to 2020. Both 1:1 propensity score matching and multivariate regression were used to identify patient and disease variables associated with ALND versus SLNB. Survival between ALND and SLNB were compared using Kaplan-Meier methods.Results A total of 1203 patients were identified: 61.1% underwent SLNB alone and 38.9% underwent ALND. Treatment in academic centers (36.1 vs. 27.7%; p < 0.0001), 2 positive lymph nodes on SLNB (32.9 vs. 17.3%, p < 0.0001) and receipt or recommendation of chemotherapy (66.5 vs. 52.2%, p < 0.0001) were associated with higher likelihood of ALND. After propensity score matching, ALND was associated with superior survival compared with SLNB (5-year overall survival of 83.8 vs. 76.0%; log-rank p = 0.0104).Discussion The results of this study suggest that among patients with early-stage MBC with limited sentinel lymph node metastasis, ALND is associated with superior survival compared with SLNB alone. These findings indicate that it may be inappropriate to extrapolate the results of the ACOSOG Z0011 and EORTC AMAROS trials to MBC.

TI  - Assessment of the Performance of the Atmospheric Correction Algorithm MAJA for Sentinel-2 Surface Reflectance Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The correction of atmospheric effects on optical remote sensing products is an essential component of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) production lines. The MAJA processor aims at providing accurate time series of surface reflectances over land for satellite missions, such as Sentinel-2, Ven mu s, and Landsat 8. The Centre d'Etudes Spatiales de la Biosphere (CESBIO) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) share a common effort to maintain, validate, and improve the MAJA processor, using state-of-the-art ground measurement sites, and participating in processor inter-comparisons, such as the Atmospheric Correction Intercomparison Exercise (ACIX). While contributing to the second ACIX-II Land validation exercise, it was found that the candidate MAJA dataset could not adequately be compared to the main reference dataset. MAJA reflectances were corrected for adjacency and topography effects while the reference dataset was not, excluding MAJA from a part of the performance metrics of the exercise. The first part of the following study aims at providing complementary performance assessment to ACIX-II by reprocessing MAJA surface reflectances without adjacency nor topographic correction, allowing for an un-biased full resolution comparison with the reference Sentinel-2 dataset. The second part of the study consists of validating MAJA against surface reflectance measurements time series of up to five years acquired at three automated stations. Both approaches provide extensive insights on the quality of MAJA Sentinel-2 Level 2 products.

TI  - Socio-Ecological Approach to a Forest-Swamp-Savannah Mosaic Landscape Using Remote Sensing and Local Knowledge: a Case Study in the Bas-Ogooue Ramsar Site, Gabon
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Studies of landscape dynamics in protected areas often rely exclusively on remotely-sensed data, leading to bias by neglecting how local inhabitants, who often have a long history of interaction with their environment, perceive and structure the landscape over time. Using a socio-ecological system (SES) approach in a forest-swamp-savannah mosaic within the Bas-Ogooue Ramsar site in Gabon, we assess how human populations participate in landscape dynamics over time. We first conducted a remote sensing analysis to produce a land-cover map representing the biophysical dimension of the SES. This map is based on pixel-oriented classifications, using a 2017 Sentinel-2 satellite image and 610 GPS points, that categorized the landscape in 11 ecological classes. To study the landscape's social dimension, we collected data on local knowledge to understand how local people perceive and use the landscape. These data were collected through 19 semi-structured individual interviews, three focus groups and 3 months of participant observation during an immersive field mission. We developed a systemic approach by combining data on biophysical and social dimensions of the landscape. Our analysis shows that in the absence of continued anthropic interventions, both savannahs and swamps dominated by herbaceous vegetation will experience closure by encroaching woody vegetation, leading to eventual biodiversity loss. Our methodology based on an SES approach to landscapes could improve the conservation programs developed by Ramsar site managers. Designing actions at the local scale, rather than applying one set of actions to the entire protected area, allows the integration of human perceptions, practices and expectations, a challenge that is more than essential in the context of global change.

TI  - Local interpretation of machine learning models in remote sensing with SHAP: the case of global climate constraints on photosynthesis phenology
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven models using machine learning have been widely used in remote-sensing applications such as the retrieval of biophysical variables and land cover classification. However, these models behave as a 'black box', meaning that the relationships between the input and predicted variables are hard to interpret. Recent regression models that downscale sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) with MODIS and weather variables are an example. The impact of weather variables on the predicted SIF in these models is unknown. The explanation of such weather-SIF relationships would aid in the understanding of climate-related constraints on photosynthesis phenology since SIF is a proxy of gross primary productivity. Here, we used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) - a novel technique based on game theory - for explaining the contribution of input variables to the individual predictions in a machine learning model. We explored the capabilities of this technique with a weather-SIF model. The regression model predicted ESA-TROPOSIF measurements from ERA5-Land air temperature, shortwave radiation, and vapour-pressure-deficit (VPD) data. The SHAP values of the model were estimated at the start and end of the growing season for the entire globe. These values depicted the global constraints of the three climate variables on the photosynthetically active season and confirmed existing knowledge on the limiting factors of terrestrial photosynthesis with unprecedented spatial detail. Radiation was the limiting factor in tropical rainforest and VPD constrained the start and end of the growing season in tropical dryland ecosystems. In extra-tropical regions, temperature was the main limiting factor during the start of the growing season, but both temperature and radiation constrained photosynthesis at the end of the growing season. This technique may help future remote sensing studies that require the use of non-interpretable machine-learning regression models and explain how input variables contribute to the model prediction in a spatiotemporally explicit manner.

TI  - STFRDN: a residual dense network for remote sensing image spatiotemporal fusion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are useful models for spatiotemporal fusion, especially under strong temporal changes. Convolutional layers with receptive fields of various sizes produce hierarchical features that can improve prediction performance. In this study, we aimed to develop a CNN model for spatiotemporal fusion, which can extract hierarchical features and fully use them. The proposed network is composed of residual dense blocks with local dense connections that effectively utilize the hierarchical features. We conducted the experiments in the newly proposed Kansas dataset, which includes Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 image pairs with large resolution differences and strong temporal changes. Based on both quantitative and qualitative evaluation, experiments revealed that the STFRDN model outperformed the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) 2.0, Reliable and Adaptive Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (RASDF), Fit-FC, and DMNet methods in all of the test groups. The second major finding was that the STFRDN model was able to produce sufficiently successful predictions against cases with such large resolution differences. To get more accurate prediction results when there is a significant resolution difference, it is important to extract the right features that can model the discrepancy. Loss of spatial detail can be avoided by making full use of hierarchical features without any manipulation after extraction. The results of this study provide insights into the significance of extracting and fully utilizing the hierarchical features.

TI  - Assessing 100 biophysical indices performances in the Mediterranean basin using multi-satellite data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Due to its impact on our ecosystem (i.e. vegetation, soil, water, etc.), global change has become more significant over time. Therefore, several biophysical indices (e.g. NDVI, NDWI, NDBI, etc.) have been developed to quantify, assess, and monitor the ecosystem reaction to these changes. Numerous and various satellite imagery can be integrated into multiple analysis approaches to carry out this assessment. One of the efficient methods in this field is Time Series Analysis (TSA), which allows the decomposition of data into three components (i.e. seasonality, irregularity, and trend). In this paper, we considered 100 biophysical indices, which we classified into six categories (i.e. vegetation, water, soil, burn, building, and others). These indices were computed using images of different satellite sensors ranging from coarse to high resolution [i.e. AVHRR, MODIS, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, etc.] considering two study cases. The first case involved monitoring the Mediterranean basin from 2010 to 2014. The second focused on four specific climate zones -most dominant within the Mediterranean basin- (i.e. San Severo, Tangier, Tobruk, and Murcia), which were conducted from 2015 to 2022. High-performance computing of biophysical indices in both study cases resulted in more than 30,000 images used in generating a significant number of time series. To examine these results and quantify the relationship between satellites across different parameters, two analysis methods (i.e. trend analysis and correlation analysis) were employed. Trend analysis results showed that in the first case, 87% of indices trends are harmonized between AVHRR and SPOT-VGT. Moreover, in the second case, the percentages of biophysical indices that showed harmonized trends among all satellites are 55% for San Severo and Tobruk, 49% for Tangier, and 34% for Murcia. Finally, this study shows that satellite-derived biophysical indices and their trends may be significantly impacted by spatial scale, climate, satellite resolution, time series length, and outliers.

TI  - Long-term exposure and health risk assessment from air pollution: impact of regional scale mobility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe negative effect of air pollution on human health is widely reported in recent literature. It typically involves urbanized areas where the population is concentrated and where most primary air pollutants are produced. A comprehensive health risk assessment is therefore of strategic importance for health authorities.MethodsIn this study we propose a methodology to perform an indirect and retrospective health risk assessment of all-cause mortality associated with long-term exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O-3) in a typical Monday to Friday working week. A combination of satellite-based settlement data, model-based air pollution data, land use, demographics and regional scale mobility, allowed to examine the effect of population mobility and pollutants daily variations on the health risk. A Health Risk Increase (HRI) metric was derived on the basis of three components: hazard, exposure and vulnerability, utilizing the relative risk values from the World Health Organization. An additional metric, the Health Burden (HB) was formulated, which accounts for the total number of people exposed to a certain risk level.ResultsThe effect of regional mobility patterns on the HRI metric was assessed, resulting in an increased HRI associated with all three stressors when considering a dynamic population compared to a static one. The effect of diurnal variation of pollutants was only observed for NO2 and O-3. For both, the HRI metric resulted in significantly higher values during night. Concerning the HB parameter, we identified the commuting flows of the population as the main driver in the resulting metric.ConclusionsThis indirect exposure assessment methodology provides tools to support policy makers and health authorities in planning intervention and mitigation measures. The study was carried out in Lombardy, Italy, one of the most polluted regions in Europe, but the incorporation of satellite data makes our approach valuable for studying global health.

TI  - Geostationary active fire products validation: GOES-17 ABI, GOES-16 ABI, and Himawari AHI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current generation of geostationary Earth-observing satellites provide spectral bandpass, spatial resolution and imaging frequency characteristics well suited to near-continuous active fire detection and monitoring. The earliest of these systems-SEVIRI on-board EUMETSAT's MSG series-has operated since 2004, and more recently the capability has been expanded globally with the ABI on-board NOAA's GOES-16 and GOES-17 satellites, and the AHI on-board JMA's Himawari-8 and Himawari-9. At present, the NOAA and EUMETSAT operational geostationary active fire products are available based on two different algorithms: the Fire Detection and Characterization (FDC) product operating with data from GOES-16 and -17, and FRP-PIXEL active fire products from GOES, Himawari and MSG. We have conducted a comprehensive accuracy assessment of these geostationary fire products across two seasons (1 January-31 March 2020 and 1 July-30 September 2020), based on comparison to Landsat active fire detections made simultaneously (+/- 5 minutes of geostationary overpass time) with the geostationary data. Compared to Landsat we find (i) low false alarm rates, ranging between 4%-7% (FDC) and 2%-6% (FRP-PIXEL)- depending on the season and hemispheric-disk for high confidence pixels, (ii) a reduction in this false alarm rate for FDC due to algorithm changes made since our prior (2018) validation effort (48% false alarms in summer 2018 compared to 4% in summer 2020 for high confidence pixels), and (iii) comparable active fire pixel detection rates for the FDC product (high confidence fire pixel classes only) and the matching FRP-PIXEL product (all fire pixel confidence classes). Overall, the performance of these geostationary products is shown to be strong and complementary in that the FRP-PIXEL product has fewer false alarms but a lower detection rate, whereas the FDC product detects more fire pixels but with a much higher false alarm rate.

TI  - Spatiotemporally continuous estimates of daily 1-km PM2.5 concentrations and their long-term exposure in China from 2000 to 2020
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring long-term variations in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is essential for environmental management and epidemiological studies. While satellite-based statistical/machine-learning methods can be used for esti-mating high-resolution ground-level PM2.5 concentration data, their applications have been hindered by limited accuracy in daily estimates during years without PM2.5 measurements and massive missing values due to satellite retrieval data. To address these issues, we developed a new spatiotemporal high-resolution PM2.5 hindcast modeling framework to generate the full-coverage, daily, 1-km PM2.5 data for China for the period 2000-2020 with improved accuracy. Our modeling framework incorporated information on changes in observation variables between periods with and without monitoring data and filled gaps in PM2.5 estimates induced by satellite data using imputed high-resolution aerosol data. Compared to previous hindcast studies, our method achieved su-perior overall cross-validation (CV) R2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.90 and 12.94 mu g/m3 and significantly improved the model performance in years without PM2.5 measurements, raising the leave-one-year-out CV R2 [RMSE] to 0.83 [12.10 mu g/m3] at a monthly scale (0.65 [23.29 mu g/m3] at a daily scale). Our long-term PM2.5 estimates show a sharp decline in PM2.5 exposure in recent years, but the national exposure level in 2020 still exceeded the first annual interim target of the 2021 World Health Organization air quality guidelines. The proposed hindcast framework represents a new strategy to improve air quality hindcast modeling and can be applied to other regions with limited air quality monitoring periods. These high-quality estimates can support both long-and short-term scientific research and environmental management of PM2.5 in China.

TI  - Modelling aboveground biomass and productivity and the impact of climate change in Mediterranean forests of South Spain
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main challenges under global warming is understanding and predicting the effects of increased aridity on the carbon sink role of forests, particularly in Mediterranean regions. Forest inventories monitor the real state of the forest at a high temporal and financial cost. Cloud computing tools and high spatio-temporal resolution datasets generate fast and low-cost remote sensing data. Our objective is to understand the underlying variables explaining carbon storage (aboveground biomass) and forest productivity of Mediterranean forests using remote and in field-based variables and predict expected future trends. Then, we quantify the potential effects of a hypothetical increase in aridity under climate change on aboveground biomass and forest productivity. We included remote sensing indices (NDVI), abiotic factors (climate, soil and topography) and biotic factors (forest structure) as key variables of forest biomass and productivity in a large and heterogeneous Mediterranean region (Andalusia, southern Spain). We used around 7000 forest plots from the second and the third Spanish National Forest Inventory (1995 and 2006) considering the eight most abundant species (Olea europaea, Pinus pinea, P. pinaster, P. halepensis, P. nigra, P. sylvestris, Quercus ilex subsp ballota, and Q. suber). The variance explained by the models ranged from 25% in Q. ilex forests to 65% in P. sylvestris forests. Aridity affected all-species and Quercus biomass and most productivity models. NDVI and tree density had a strong positive effect on forest biomass and productivity with a significant interaction effect in all-species models, whereas aridity had a negative effect on both. The predicted increase in aridity under future climate change scenarios could seriously reduce forest biomass by 18% and productivity by 16%. Our study suggests that aridity is a key factor determining forest biomass and productivity in Mediterranean forests, that could potentially lead to reductions of their carbon sink role.

TI  - Review on the Possibilities of Mapping Old-Growth Temperate Forests by Remote Sensing in Europe
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT
M3  - Review
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Old-growth forests (OGF) provide valuable ecosystem services such as habitat provision, carbon sequestration or recreation maintaining biodiversity, carbon storage, or human well-being. Long-term human pressure caused OGFs in Europe to be rare and scattered. Their detailed extent and current status are largely unknown. This review aims to identify potential methods to map temperate old-growth forests (tOGF) by remote sensing (RS) technology, highlights the potentials and benefits, and identifies main knowledge gaps requesting further research. RS offers a wide range of data and methods to map forests and their properties, applicable from local to continental scale. We structured existing mapping approaches in three main groups. First, parameter-based approaches, which are based on forest parameters and usually applied on local to regional scale using detailed data, often from airborne laser scanning (ALS). Second, direct approaches, usually employing machine learning algorithms to generate information from RS data, with high potential for large-area mapping but so far lacking operational applications and related sound accuracy assessment. Finally, indirect approaches integrating various existing data sets to predict OGF existence. These approaches have also been used for large area mapping with a main drawback of missing physical evidence of the identified areas to really hold OGFs as compared to the likelihood of OGF existence. In conclusion, studies dealing with the mapping of OGF using remote sensing are quite limited, but there is a huge amount of knowledge from other forestry-related applications that is yet to be leveraged for OGF identification. We discuss two scenarios, where different data and approaches are suitable, recognizing that one single system cannot serve all potential needs. These may be hot spot identification, detailed area delineation, or status assessment. Further, we pledge for a combined method to overcome the identified limitations of the individual approaches.

TI  - Crop classification methods and influencing factors of reusing historical samples based on 2D-CNN
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop classification is a crucial task in agricultural remote sensing, with the accuracy of such classification heavily relies on field sampling. Reusing historical samples can minimize the reliance on annual field sampling for crop classification. Although previous research primarily focused on the classification accuracy based on the reused historical samples, the underlying factors that influence the accuracy have not been adequately investigated. In this study, we employed a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) model for crop classification reusing historical samples and investigated the factors influencing the classification accuracy. First, we calculated a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series from historical data to characterize crop growth patterns. Secondly, we assessed three different time-series construction methods. Subsequently, we used the 2D-CNN model to automatically extract abstract features of crop growth patterns. Finally, we designed various strategies for reusing historical samples to explore the influencing factors. Experiments were conducted in Kuitun, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, from 2016 to 2020, employing a long time series of Sentinel-2 images as remote sensing data. Our results indicated that optimal 2D-CNN models using an irregular satellite image time series (irSITS) outperformed random forest models in inter-annual classifications (the overall accuracies for 2016-2020 were 0.78, 0.61, 0.89, 0.89, and 0.70, respectively). In addition, we identified that the primary factors affecting classification accuracy were 1) the time-series construction method used; 2) the crop growth patterns; and 3) the sample diversity. By reusing historical samples and considering the factors influencing classification accuracy, this study provides valuable insights into high-quality crop classification mapping under limited field sample conditions.

TI  - Limited environmental and yield benefits of intercropping practices in smallholder fields: Evidence from multi-source data
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: To ensure food security in sub-Saharan Africa, it is necessary to improve crop yields while minimizing environmental impacts. Intercropping has been demonstrated to deliver such outcomes, but their performance in smallholder fields has received limited attention therefore insufficient to capture the complexity of real-world crop fields run by smallholder farmers.Objective: This study examines the benefits and management of intercropping practices in real smallholder fields in Malawi.Methods: We collected field data on intercrop types, the number of intercropped species and maize yield in intercropped maize fields. Field data was then combined with geospatial and household survey data to inves-tigate the yield benefits, agricultural inputs, and factors related to intercropping choices. We used Pearson correlation and Tukey's test to test the statistical significance in the difference between intercropped fields and monoculture fields.Results: We found that more intercrops were planted in fields with smaller sizes, drier conditions, and higher soil erosion levels, with adoption rates increasing from 75 % in 2010 to 84 % in 2020. In addition, our field data shows that intercropping is associated with reduced primary maize yield (2.7 t/ha) compared to pure maize yield (3.8 t/ha). Conversely, satellite data demonstrates an improvement in overall field yield in intercropped fields. Meanwhile, intercropped fields require higher labor inputs (11 h more per season) and increased weeding times than monocultures, however agrochemical inputs (fertilizers and pesticides) do not necessarily decrease in intercropped fields compared to monocultures.Conclusions: Our results suggest that while smallholder farmers in Malawi adopt intercropping to improve land use efficiency, drought resilience, and soil fertility, they are not realizing the full benefits observed in experi-mental trials.Implications: More evidence on the benefits and best practices of intercropping in smallholder fields is necessary in order to better understand this practice as an option for sustainable intensification.

TI  - Cloud detection of multi-type satellite images based on spectral assimilation and deep learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With strong self-learning and data analysis capabilities, deep learning is essential in cloud detection. However, many high-quality samples are the key to deep learning cloud detection methods. Different satellite image cloud detection techniques need to select adequate representative and high-quality samples and make corresponding cloud masks, which not only requires professional knowledge but also consumes a lot of workforce and time. To improve the generalization ability of the deep learning cloud detection model and quickly apply it to the cloud detection of different satellite images, this paper proposes a deep learning cloud detection method based on spectral assimilation for multiple types of satellite images (SAUNetCD). Under the condition of using fewer deep learning data samples, the deep learning model is used to achieve automatic cloud detection of multiple satellite data. Taking Landsat 8 OLI, Landsat 9 OLI, GF-1 WFV, and Sentinel 2A as examples, this paper selects Landsat 8 OLI data as the source data of cloud detection. The experimental results show that the spectral assimilation method improves the generalization ability of the deep learning cloud detection model and improves the cloud detection accuracy by nearly 20%. It realizes the fast cloud detection application of different satellite images by deep learning. It provides an effective way for cloud detection of multiple types of satellite images.

TI  - Parameterization and Remote Sensing Retrieval of Land Surface Processes in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exchange of energy between the land surface and atmosphere is dependent upon crucial parameters, including surface roughness, emissivity, bulk transfer coefficients for momentum (C-D) and heat (C-H). These parameters are calculated through site observation data and remote sensing data. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) the aerodynamic roughness of the Gurbantunggut Desert measures 1.1 x 10(-2) m, which is influenced by the varying conditions of the underlying surface. The roughness decreases as wind speed increases and is seen to be directly proportional to the growth of vegetation. From April to June, the aerodynamic roughness increases with increasing vegetation cover, but begins to gradually decrease after July. Spatially, the middle regions show higher roughness values than the eastern and western areas. In the central part of the desert, the roughness is between 2.37 x 10(-2) m and 2.46 x 10(-2) m from April to November. The northwest and northeast regions measure 1.41 x 10(-2) m-2.04 x 10(-2) m and 1.53 x 10(-2) m-2.39 x 10(-2) m, respectively. (2) The surface emissivity is 0.93, and it varies depending on the snow and vegetation present in the underlying area. (3) C-D and C-H exhibit an inverse relationship with wind speed. When wind speed falls below 6 m/s, the C-D declines rapidly as wind speed increases. In contrast, once wind speed surpasses 6 m/s, the propensity for the C-D to decrease with increasing wind speed slows down and approaches stability.

TI  - Global estimation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations from satellite data using a deep-learning-based model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a global matchup between satellite observations and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) measurements, we developed a deep-learning-based model (DL-PPCE model) for globally estimating concentrations of 17 different phytoplankton pigments. The model adopted a fusion architecture of residual and pyramid networks to achieve robust estimation performance. The model inputs include three different data types: essential ocean color parameters, satellite-derived environmental parameters, and the slope of above-surface remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs). We compared the model performances with various input parameters to determine the most effective inputs. The results showed that R-rs in the essential ocean color parameters and sea surface temperature (SST) in the environmental parameters were the most critical input parameters. The estimation of phytoplankton pigment concentrations was validated against HPLC data using the leave-one-out crossvalidation method. Except for three pigments, 19'-butanoyloxy-fucoxanthin, prasinoxanthin, and lutein, the estimated pigment concentrations and in-situ observations were strongly correlated for all other pigments (an average relative root-mean-square error of 0.59, R-2 >= 0.60, and regression slopes close to 1). In addition, a time series analysis was performed on the MODIS retrieved global pigment concentrations during 2003-2021 using the established DL-PPCE model to explore the relationship between the distribution of phytoplankton groups and El Nino in the western equatorial Pacific. Our findings revealed that the prokaryotes-dominated area extended eastward from180 degrees E to 150 degrees W during the 2015/2016 El Nino event. From 2003 to 2021, prokaryotic abundance was positively correlated with El Nino intensity ( R = 0.65, P << 0.01) but negatively correlated with the abundance of the entire phytoplankton community ( R = -0.53, P << 0.01). These results demonstrate that the DLPPCE model presents a novel approach for estimating the concentration of 17 pigments worldwide, and the estimated pigment concentrations are advantageous for analyzing the phytoplankton community dynamics on a large spatiotemporal scale.

TI  - Cost-efficient information extraction from massive remote sensing data: When weakly supervised deep learning meets remote sensing big data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With many platforms and sensors continuously observing the earth surface, the large amount of remote sensing data presents a big data challenge. While remote sensing data acquisition capability can fully meet the requirements of many application domains, there is still a need to further explore how to efficiently mine the useful information from remote sensing big data (RSBD). Many researchers in the remote sensing community have introduced deep learning in the process of RSBD, and deep learning-based methods have achieved better performance compared with traditional methods. However, there are still substantial obstacles to the application of deep learning in remote sensing. One of the major challenges is the generation of pixel-level labels with high quality for training samples, which is essential to deep learning models. Weakly supervised deep learning (WSDL) is a promising solution to address this problem as WSDL can utilize greedily labeled datasets that are easy to collect but not ideal to train the deep networks. In this review, we summarize the achievements of WSDL-driven cost-efficient information extraction from RSBD. We first analyze the opportunities and challenges of information extraction from RSBD. Based on the analysis of the theoretical foundations of WSDL in the computer vision (CV) domain, we conduct a survey on the WSDL-based information extraction methods under the data characteristic and task demand of RSBD in four different tasks: (i) scene classification, (ii) object detection, (iii) semantic segmentation and (iv) change detection. Finally, potential research directions are outlined to guide researchers to further exploit WSDL-based information extraction from RSBD.

TI  - Multi-Satellite Detection of Long-Range Transport and Transformation of Atmospheric Emissions from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Volcano
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large volumes of atmospheric pollutants injected into the troposphere and stratosphere from volcanic eruptions can exert significant influence on global climate. Through utilizing multi-satellite observations, we present a large-scale insight into the long-range transport and transformation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai eruption on 15 January 2022. We found that the transport of volcanic emissions, along with the transformation from SO2 to sulfate aerosols, lasted for two months after the Tongan eruption. The emitted volume of SO2 from the volcano eruption was approximately 183 kilotons (kt). Both satellite observation and numerical simulation results show that the SO2 and volcanic ash plumes moved westward at a rate of one thousand kilometers per day across the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean regions and that SO2 transformation in the atmosphere lasted for half a month. The transport and enhancement of aerosols is related to the conversion of SO2 to sulfate. CALIPSO lidar observations show that SO2 reached an altitude of 25-30 km and transformed into sulfate in the stratosphere after 29 January. Sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere deceased gradually with transport and fell back to the background level after two months. Our study shows that satellite observations give a good characterization of volcanic emissions, transport, and SO2-sulfate conversion, which can provide an essential constraint for climate modeling.

TI  - Foodborne protozoan parasites in fresh mussels and oysters purchased at retail in Canada
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FOOD MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies worldwide have reported the presence of protozoan parasites in a variety of commercial bivalve shellfish. The uptake of these parasites by shellfish occurs during filter feeding in faecally-contaminated waters. The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Giardia, Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma in fresh, live shellfish purchased in three Canadian provinces as part of the retail surveillance activities led by FoodNet Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada). Packages containing mussels (n = 253) or oysters (n = 130) were purchased at grocery stores in FoodNet Canada sentinel sites on a biweekly basis throughout 2018 and 2019, and shipped in coolers to Health Canada for testing. A small number of packages were not tested due to insufficient quantity or poor quality. Following DNA extraction from homogenized, pooled tissues, nested PCR and DNA sequencing were used to detect parasite-specific sequences. Epifluorescence microscopy was used to confirm the presence of intact cysts and oocysts in sequence-confirmed PCR-positive samples. Giardia duodenalis DNA was present in 2.4 % of 247 packages of mussels and 4.0 % of 125 packages of oysters, while Cryptospo-ridium parvum DNA was present in 5.3 % of 247 packages of mussels and 7.2 % of 125 packages of oysters. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was only found in mussels in 2018 (1.6 % of 249 packages). Parasite DNA was detected in shellfish purchased in all three Canadian provinces sampled, and there was no apparent seasonal variation in prevalence. While the present study did not test for viability, parasites are known to survive for long periods in the marine environment, and these findings suggest that there is a risk of infection, especially when shellfish are consumed raw.

TI  - Validation of UV-Index retrieved from three satellites against Ground-Based measurements at different climates in Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The UV Index is a useful tool to alert people with possible risks of exposure to solar UV radiation in Egypt. Ground UV-Index observation is a primary source to monitor solar UV levels, however the spatial coverage of the ground station is quite limited. The validation of available measurements were used frequently to define the possibility of using satellite data when measurements are not available, this was carried out for (leave area index and temperatures) for example (Ganguly et al., 2012) and (Laraby and Schott, 2018). In order to test the validity of the UV-index satellite products against ground observations, three satellite instruments (OMI, Terra + Aqua, and Terra + Npp) was performed at noontime in all sky conditions in the period 2012-2017 at three sites; Aswan, Cairo, and Matruh. The aforementioned sites were selected to represent different climates in Egypt. Annual intercomparison highlighted higher relative bias (rbias) at OMI (6.4 %) than both Terra + Aqua (2.3%) and Terra + Npp (2.8%). Also, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), shows that OMI (10.6%) is relatively higher than both Terra + Aqua and Terra + Npp. (8.5 %). Based on these results, both Terra + Aqua and Terra + Npp have a better performance with respect to ground observations than OMI. This was due to OMI being more sensitive to dust and cloud than, Terra + Aqua and Terra + Npp. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of National Authority of Remote Sensing & Space Science.

TI  - Staging LaParoscopy to Assess Lymph NOde InvoLvement in Advanced GAstric Cancer (POLA)-Study protocol for a single-arm prospective observational multicenter study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionIn the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (GC), the role of staging laparoscopy (SL) will become more established. However, despite guidelines recommendations, SL for optimal preoperative staging remains underutilized. Diagnostic value of near-infrared (NIR) / indocyanine green (ICG) guided sentinel node (SN) mapping in GC confirmed its technical feasibility, however no data exist regarding its potential role in pathological nodal staging. To the best of our knowledge, current study is the first to evaluate the role of ICG in nodal staging of advanced GC patients undergoing SL. Materials and methodsThis single-arm prospective observational multicenter study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of Medical University of Lublin (Ethic Code: KE-0254/331/2018). The protocol is registered at clinicaltrial.gov (NCT05720598), and the study results will be reported according to the Strengthening of Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. The primary endpoint of this study is the identification rate of ICG-guided SN in advanced GC patients. The secondary endpoints include pathological and molecular assessment of retrieved SNs and other pretreatment clinical variables potentially associated with SL: pattern of perigastric ICG distribution according to patients' pathological and clinical characteristics, neoadjuvant chemotherapy compliance, 30-day morbidity, and mortality. ConclusionPOLA study is the first to investigate the clinical value of ICG-enhanced sentinel node biopsy during staging laparoscopy in advanced GC patients in a Western cohort. Identifying pN status before multimodal treatment will improve GC staging process.

TI  - Infiltrated Pits: Using Regional Groundwater Data to Estimate Methane Emissions from Pit Latrines
T2  - HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - On-site sanitation systems (OSS), such as pit latrines, are an important source of methane (CH4), with emissions increasing when they are wet, and this occurs when anaerobic conditions dominate. This paper presents the development of a model, which uses seasonal changes in groundwater to account for the fluctuating inundation of pit latrines, and, therefore, the associated CH4 emissions from varying degrees of anerobic conditions are examined. Given that observed timeseries of groundwater table depth at high enough spatial and temporal resolutions are often difficult to obtain in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation is used to generate values for a whole region, which is then used, alongside average pit latrine depth, to determine areas of pit latrine inundation. Outcomes are further informed with open-source contextual data, covering population, urban/rural split, and sanitation facility data, before using methodologies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to generate CH4 emissions data. As a case study, we use data from Senegal to illustrate how this model works. Results show total CH4 emissions for the month of January to be similar to 1.69 kt CH4. We have also discussed the potential use of satellite remote sensing data in regions where access to historical groundwater data is limited. Understanding when the pit conditions are most likely to change could lead to incentives for better management strategies, as well as a reduction in CH4 production.

TI  - Predicting eucalyptus plantation growth and yield using Landsat imagery in Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing applications in forest inventories allow for a detailed view of areas with extensive forest cover while potentially lowering costs. In this context, the objective of this study was to propose a methodology for using Landsat data to predict and project eucalyptus forest growth and yield, as well as to analyze forest growth dynamics. Three scenarios with varying sample sizes were proposed to assess the possibility of cost savings. The estimation was performed using an artificial neural network (ANN) and the random forest (RF) algorithm. Wallto-wall prediction and projection were used, and projection maps were used to calculate the mean and current monthly increments. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) values for the wall-to-wall prediction and for the projection ranged from 7.9% to 14.5% and 6.8% to 11.8%, respectively. All of the estimated means fell within the forest inventory confidence intervals. The mean and current monthly increment values projected by the ANN model did not differ from those obtained by the continuous forest inventory. Considering that the sampling intensity of traditional continuous forest inventories normally is one plot every 10 ha, the methodology presented here can be used to reduce sampling intensity to one plot for every 83.3 ha, without significant loss of accuracy, which represents a relevant cost reduction.

TI  - A transformer-based cloud detection approach using Sentinel 2 imageries
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Presence of clouds blocks the view of Earth's surface objects in optical imageries, thus compromising their application and usability. Identifying and removing the clouds become a crucial task during image preprocessing. Recently deep learning (DL)-based cloud detection methods have shown improved performance, but capturing global semantic features and long-range dependencies necessitates a careful selection of DL classifiers to further enhance their effectiveness. Keeping this in view, the present study proposes a novel spatial-spectral attention transformer for cloud detection (SSATR-CD) with a spatial-spectral attention module that generates an enhanced feature map to replace convolution by using the image patches directly. To implement the proposed approach, a new Sentinel-2 data set with various types of cloud covers over India (IndiaS2) was created and tested with the proposed method. Alongside this, an additional benchmarked data set (WHUS2-CD) was also considered to check the ability of the proposed model to different regions of the world by applying model-based transfer learning. The result highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the SSATR-CD approach in both cases.

TI  - Monitoring and mapping vegetation greenery in residential communities using street view images and a Normalized Vegetation Greenery Index: a case study in Beijing, China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation greenery is essential for the sensory and psychological wellbeing of residents in residential communities. To enhance the quality of regulations and policies to improve people's living environments, it is crucial to effectively identify and monitor vegetation greenery from the perspective of the residents using effective images and methods. In this study, Baidu street view (BSV) images and a Normalized Vegetation Greenery Index (NVGI) based method were examined to distinguish vegetation greenery in residential communities of Beijing, China. The magnitude of the vegetation was quantified and graded, and spatial analysis techniques were employed to investigate the spatial characteristics of vegetation greenery. The results demonstrated that (1) the identified vegetation greenery using the proposed NVGI-based method was closely correlated with those of the reference classification (r = 0.993, p = 0.000), surpassing the comparison results from the SVM method, a conventional remote sensing classification means; (2) the vegetation greenery was distributed unevenly in residential communities and can be categorized into four grades, 63.79% of the sampling sites were found with relatively low (Grade II) and moderate (Grade III) vegetation greenery distribution, most of the districts in the study area contained zero-value green view index sites; and (3) there was significant spatial heterogeneity observed in the study area, with low-value clustering (cold spots) predominantly located in the central region and high-value clustering (hot spots) primarily concentrated in the peripheral zone. The findings of this study can be applied in other cities and countries that have street view images available to investigate greenery patterns within residential areas, which can help improve the planning and managing efforts in urban communities.

TI  - Retrieving plant functional traits through time series analysis of satellite observations using machine learning methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional traits (e.g. leaf pigment and water contents, specific leaf area) serve as important indicators of plant condition, both within a given vegetation season and between years. Remote sensing-based methods allow for non-destructive and repeatable monitoring of the Earth's surface and thus offer an efficient way to map and monitor these traits. In our study, we used a large database of ground survey data sampled at several contrasting phenological phases of vegetation to develop and compare different machine learning models trained to estimate selected plant functional traits at two different sites: mixed floodplain forest at Lanzhot and beech forest at Stitna, both in the Czech Republic. Empirical models were trained as predictors using 1) Sentinel-2 satellite data (a data set with higher spatial and spectral resolution), and 2) Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product (a data set with higher temporal resolution). The most successfully retrieved traits were chlorophyll and carotenoid content (R-2 = 0.78 and 0.65, respectively). Although models trained with Sentinel-2 predictors proved to be slightly better in terms of validation statistics compared to HLS predictors, the HLS product may be preferable for some applications requiring analysis at a high frequency. The best-performing machine learning algorithm, canonical correlation forest, was then applied per pixel to all cloud-free images from the HLS product at both study sites for the years 2019-2021. This allowed us to create a time series of plant functional traits useful for observing differences between the two sites, as well as between growing seasons, and also to observe patterns of spatial behaviour using map outputs.

TI  - Near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance by fusion of Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to detect forest disturbance rapidly relies heavily on the frequency of usable satellite observations. Combining optical and SAR data can provide the most usable observations in the tropics and hence has the potential to achieve more timely detection of forest disturbance than using any individual sensor system. A new algorithm (Fusion Near Real-Time, or FNRT) for near real-time monitoring of tropical forest disturbance by fusion of Landsat, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 data fits a time series model to the data of each individual sensor system and produces a change score for each clear observation during the monitoring period. The change scores from the three different kinds of sensors are then combined for disturbance monitoring. Applying FNRT using all three data sources in eight selected sites in the Amazon Basin detected 69.8 & PLUSMN; 5% and 84.6 & PLUSMN; 4.1% of the forest disturbances within the first 30 and 60 days, respectively. FNRT using all three sensors reached a peak producer's accuracy of 91.6 & PLUSMN; 3.2% at approximately a 100-day lag time, compared to 86.4 & PLUSMN; 3.8% using the two optical sensors combined, and 71.7 & PLUSMN; 4.7% using Landsat only (the best-performing single-sensor). The user's accuracy of FNRT using all three sensors increased to 90.9 & PLUSMN; 3.3% when excluding false detections in non-forest areas. Overall, the model result using all three data sources had the highest detection rate with shorter lag times. Although modest, including Sentinel-1 data in the multi-sensor fusion approach improved the detection speed of some disturbance events. Given the abundance of optical data during the dry season in our study region, Sentinel1 data would be more valuable during the wet season or in persistently cloudy regions such as Madagascar or coastal West Africa.

TI  - Algorithm for the Reconstruction of the Ground Surface Reflectance in the Visible and Near IR Ranges from MODIS Satellite Data with Allowance for the Influence of Ground Surface Inhomogeneity on the Adjacency Effect and of Multiple Radiation Reflection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An atmospheric correction algorithm is proposed for the reconstruction of the ground surface reflectance from the data of satellite measurements. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it takes into account the influence of the ground surface inhomogeneity on the adjacency effect and additional illumination of the ground surface by reflected radiation. These factors are important for the reconstruction of the reflectance of ground surface fragments with sharp reflectance changes and high atmospheric turbidity. The algorithm is based on Monte Carlo programs developed by the authors. To reduce the computing time, we have proposed some original criteria and approaches. To estimate the capabilities of the developed algorithm, its results have been validated by comparing with the results of the MOD09 algorithm for four MODIS bands and measurements for the Portugal surface fragment with coordinates 38.829 N, 8.791 W. Good agreement of the results obtained by the proposed algorithm with the surface measurements and the data obtained by the MOD09 algorithm demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in the reconstruction of the ground surface reflectance.

TI  - Child of two worlds: How foster care workers perceive their skills in dealing with worldview differences in foster care
T2  - CHILD & FAMILY SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Foster children often encounter worldview differences between their foster family and their birth family, for example, when participating in religious activities and practices. Foster children not only have a right to continuity in upbringing but also consistency in worldview, culture and language. Good co-parenting relationships are important for their identity development. For these reasons, foster care workers are entrusted with the task of supporting the triadic relationship of the foster child, birth parents and foster parents in dealing with worldview differences. Based on in-depth interviews with foster care workers (n = 16) six skills in dealing with worldview differences can be distinguished: (1) basic knowledge of worldviews and identity formation; (2) empathizing with the other; (3) inquisitiveness to discover what is essential for the other; (4) initiating worldview conversations and keeping them going; (5) fostering self-reflection in worldview; and (6) manoeuvring between and monitoring all interests. It is helpful if birth parents are well-informed in advance about the impact of worldview differences and if foster care workers and foster parents are aware of the identity and developmental needs of foster children to explore the worldview of the foster family and the birth family.

TI  - Towards sustainable port management: Data-driven global container ports turnover rate assessment
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of port turnover rate is essential for port operators and shipping carriers to benchmark and improve their operations. This study proposes a standardized method to estimate the port turnover rate based on satellite data of ocean ships. This method can be generalized to accommodate ports of different geographic and operational characteristics with minimum input and running times. To achieve the research objective, we first construct berth polygon areas for terminals based on Greatmaps (GMap) visual technique. Then, two tailor-made algorithms are proposed to estimate the berthing time of ship in a berthing event. Finally, we assess the port turnover rate with aggregate berthing time at a port and its historical port throughput. Assuming that the turnover rate is unchanged in the short term, we can use the estimated turnover to estimate the monthly throughput of global ports. The findings suggest the average Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of our estimation is 3.84%. Standardized and high-frequency port statistics are highly valued by the industry but very costly to access. The proposed method makes high-frequency port turnover rate and throughput available for a wide range of users. The statistics and findings will enhance standardization and transparency of port statistics and promote the sustainable development of port industry.

TI  - Monitoring suspended sediment concentration in the Yellow River Estuary from 1984 to 2021 using landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The transport of suspended sediment in estuaries affects the erosion and deposition of estuaries and changes in landform patterns, and it has a profound impact on primary productivity and ecosystem regulation in estuaries. It is of great value for coastal construction and environmental monitoring to study the surface suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in estuaries and adjacent waters. Using 2355 Landsat 5/7/8 satellite images from the Google Earth Engine, the SSC in the surface layer of the Yellow River Estuary from 1984 to 2021 was studied. The results showed that from 1984 to 2021, the SSC declined by more than 30%. The Xiaolangdi Dam and Water and Sediment Regulation Scheme have affected the sediment transport and runoff of the Yellow River, which can explain more than 40% of the SSC in the buffer area of the estuary and have a close relationship with the inter-monthly changes in SSC. The diversion of estuaries and circulation to the transport of suspended sediment have largely affected the changes in nearshore SSC, including the spatial patterns and temporal variations in SSC. Wave changes caused by wind speed on the sea surface can explain the inner-annual changes in SSC in Laizhou Bay and southern Bohai Bay. From January to February, the area of high concentration zones (100 mg L-1 <= SSC) accounts for more than 10%, higher than in other months, and re-suspension of sediment caused by wind is the main reason for the increase in SSC.

TI  - Spatial Prediction and Mapping of Soil Water Content by TPE-GBDT Model in Chinese Coastal Delta Farmland with Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water content is an important indicator used to maintain the ecological balance of farmland. The efficient spatial prediction of soil water content is crucial for ensuring crop growth and food production. To this end, 104 farmland soil samples were collected in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China, and the soil water content was determined using the drying method. A gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model based on a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) hyperparametric optimization was developed, and then the soil water content was predicted and mapped based on the soil texture and vegetation index from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. The results of statistical analysis showed that the soil water content had a high coefficient of variation (55.30%), a non-normal distribution, and complex spatial variability. Compared with other models, the TPE-GBDT model had the highest prediction accuracy (RMSE = 6.02% and R-2 = 0.71), and its mapping results showed that the areas with high soil water content were distributed on both sides of the river and near the estuary. Furthermore, the results of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis showed that the soil texture (PC2 and PC5), modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) index provided important contributions to the spatial prediction of soil water content. We found that the hydraulic physical properties of soil texture and the vegetation characteristics (such as vegetation coverage, root action, and transpiration) are the key factors affecting the spatial migration and heterogeneity of the soil water content in the study area. The above results show that the TPE algorithm can quickly capture the hyperparameters that are most suitable for the GBDT model, so that the GBDT model can ensure prediction accuracy, reduce the loss function with less training data, and accurately learn of the nonlinear relationship between soil water content and environmental factors. This paper proposes a machine learning method for hyperparameter optimization that shows considerable potential to predict the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content, which can effectively support regional farmland soil and water conservation and high-quality agricultural development.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of wetlands in China during 2000-2015 using Landsat imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - China has abundant wetland resources; however, wetland ecosystems are experiencing critical challenges owing to continuous anthropogenic activities and climate change. Therefore, rapid and accurate mapping of wetlands and analysis of the drivers of spatiotemporal changes in wetlands are of great importance for wetland resource conservation. In this study, we proposed a comprehensive method for wetland mapping in China based on Landsat images, in which inland wetlands were identified by the object-oriented and hierarchical classification method, and coastal wetlands were extracted by visual interpretation based on sea boundaries and sea level nodes. Additionally, partial least squares structural equation modelling was utilized to exploit the mechanisms of spatiotemporal variability in wetlands during 2000-2015. The application of the comprehensive method to Landsat TM/OLI resulted in wetland maps of China with overall classification accuracies above 85%. The national wetland maps demonstrated that the wetland areas of China in 2000 and 2015 were 476,305.68 and 456,262.01 km2, respectively, and swamps accounted for the largest proportion of the total wetland area in China (over 38%). Statistics show that wetlands are mainly located in the northern inland areas, such as Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang Autonomous Region, as well as the Qinghai and Heilongjiang Provinces. Wetland changes were concentrated in the Tibetan Plateau, Loess Plateau, Song-Liao Plain, and middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Human activities and climate change were the primary contributors to wetland changes in China. These two factors can not only directly influence wetland changes but also can be indirectly influenced by other factors, such as soil and topography. The results of this study are intended to provide basic data for monitoring and conserving wetland resources in China.

TI  - Hydrological modeling of spatial and temporal variations in streamflow due to multiple climate change scenarios in northwestern Morocco
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is one of the most important factors impacting hydrological regimes. In this paper, climate change impact on streamflow of Loukkos basin (northwestern Morocco) is evaluated using SWAT model for three future periods: near (2021-2040), mid (2041-2070), and far (2071-2100), compared to baseline 1981-2020. A set of bias-corrected climate models was used: five regional climate models (EURO-CORDEX), four global climate models (CMIP6) and their ensemble mean, under two representative concentration pathways respectively (RCP 4.5; RCP 8.5) and (SSP2-4.5; SSP5-8.5). Furthermore, SUFI-2 algorithm in SWAT-CUP was performed to calibrate (1981-1997), validate (1998-2015), and analyze uncertainty for each dataset at ten hydrological stations. In most stations, statistical performance indicated a good simulation, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) greater than 0.77 and percent bias (PBIAS) within +/- 10% on a monthly basis. Overall, 82% of models indicated that future climate could decline streamflow. The largest decrease would be for 2071-2100 and under RCP 8.5/SSP5-8.5. Our findings could help planners and policymakers in developing reasonable water management policies and climate change adaptation measures.

TI  - Assessment of machine learning classifiers in mapping the cocoa-forest mosaic landscape of Ghana
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of clear-cut directives on the optimal classifier for land-use land-cover (LULC) classification of Ghana's cocoa landscape presents a practice gap. This has resulted in monitoring challenges since it is difficult to effectively compare land cover maps because they differ in the classifiers. In this paper, we explored the performance of four commonly used machine learning classifiers in the cocoa landscape to accurately determine the option that best segregates the different vegetation classes. Specifically, the accuracy with which k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers mapped the cocoa landscape in Juaboso, Ghana, was compared. A pre-processed Sentinel-2 image, 352 training and 151 validation points collected through field Global Positioning System survey were used. The image was classified using the kNN, ANN, SVM and RF classifiers. The accuracies of the LULC maps were assessed using overall accuracy (OA), Cohens' kappa (k). Also, practitioners with practical knowledge of the land cover classes and their distribution in the landscape subjected the map to visual inspection. The OA and k values indicated RF (OA = 84.77%, k = 0.801), kNN (OA = 84.11%, k = 0.796), ANN (OA = 76.13%, k = 0.7), and SVM (OA = 81.45%, k = 0.762) all performed well in classifying the landscape with a satisfactory agreement. Additionally, there are no clear-cut classifier that experts in remote sensing should apply while mapping Ghana's cocoa environment. At any point, using the classifier that most accurately represents the landscape is crucial and should be prioritized. Therefore, guidance on the choice of classification algorithms by researchers and practitioners for mapping the cocoa landscape of Ghana must not be limited to the overall accuracies and kappa only. Instead, operationalising a mapping and validation framework that incorporates experts' review will yield a LULC map that better represents the landscape.

TI  - Identification of time-varying wetlands neglected in Pakistan through remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aside from Ramsar Convention awareness programs, the concept of wetlands is mostly ignored in developing countries. Wetland ecosystems are essential to hydrological cycles, ecosystem diversity, climatic change, and economic activity. Under the Ramsar Convention, there are 2414 wetlands that are internationally recognized, and Pakistan is home to 19 of them. The major goal of this study is to use the satellite image technology to locate Pakistan's underutilized wetlands (Borith, Phander, Upper Kachura, Satpara, and Rama Lakes). The other goals are to understand how these wetlands are affected by climate change, ecosystem change, and water quality. We used analytical techniques including supervised classification and Tasseled Cap Wetness to identify the wetlands. To find changes caused by climate change, Quick Bird high-resolution images was used to create the change detection index. Tasseled Cap Greenness and the Normalized Difference Turbidity Index were also used to assess the water quality and changes in the ecology in these wetlands. Sentinel-2 was used to analyze data from 2010 and 2020. ASTER DEM was also used to do a watershed analysis. The land surface temperature (degrees C) of a few selected wetlands was calculated using Modis data. Rainfall (mm) data was taken from PERSIANN (precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks) databases. Results indicated that in 2010, the water content of Borith, Phander, Upper Kachura, Satpara, and Rama Lakes was 22.83%, 20.82%, 22.26%, 24.40%, and 22.91%. While in 2020, these lakes' water ratios are 21.33%, 20.65%, 21.76%, 23.85%, and 22.59%, respectively. Therefore, the competent authorities must take precautions to ensure that these wetlands are preserved in the future in order to improve the dynamics of the ecosystem.

TI  - Learning curve and factors influencing successful robot-assisted bilateral sentinel lymph node mapping in early-stage cervical cancer: an observational cohort study
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate whether a learning curve affects the bilateral sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection in early-stage cervical cancer.MethodsAll patients with FIGO (2018) stage IA1-IB2 or IIA1 cervical cancer who had undergone robot-assisted SLN mapping performed with a combination of preoperative technetium-99m nanocolloids (including preoperative imaging) and intraoperative blue dye were retrospectively included. Risk-adjusted cumulative sum (RA-CUSUM) analysis was used to determine if a learning curve based on bilateral SLN detection existed in this cohort.ResultsA total of 227 cervical cancer patients were included. In 98.2% of patients (223/227) at least one SLN was detected. The bilateral SLN detection rate was 87.2% (198/227). Except for age (OR 1.06 per year, 95%CI 1.02-1.09), no significant risk factors for non-bilateral SLN detection were found (e.g., prior conization, BMI or FIGO stage). The RA-CUSUM analysis showed no clear learning phase during the first procedures and cumulative bilateral detection rate remained at least 80% during the entire inclusion period.ConclusionsIn this single-institution experience, we observed no learning curve affecting robot-assisted SLN mapping using a radiotracer and blue dye in early-stage cervical cancer patients, with stable bilateral detection rates of at least 80% when adhering to a standardized methodology.

TI  - Gene expression and wildlife health: varied interpretations based on perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated wildlife population health from the perspective of statistical means vs. variances. We outlined the choices necessary to provide the framework for our study. These consisted of spatial and temporal boundaries (e.g., choice of sentinel species, populations, time frame), measurement techniques (molecular to population level), and appropriate statistical analyses. We chose to assess the health of 19 sea otter populations, located in the north Pacific from the Aleutian Islands, AK, to Santa Barbara, CA, and varying in population growth rates and length of occupancy. Our focal metric was gene expression (i.e., mRNA transcripts) data that we had previously generated across sea otter populations as a measure of population health. We used statistical methods with different approaches (i.e., means vs. variances) and examined the subsequent interpretive outcomes and how these influence our assessment of "health." Interpretations based on analyses using variances versus means overlapped to some degree. In general, sea otter populations with low variation in gene expression were limited by food resources and at or near carrying capacity. In populations where the variation in gene expression was moderate or high, four out of five populations were increasing in abundance, or had been recently increasing. Where we had additional information on sources of stressors at the level of the population, we were able to draw inferences from those stressors to specific gene expression results. For example, gene expression patterns of sea otters from Western Prince William Sound were consistent with long term exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons, whereas in Kachemak Bay, patterns were consistent with exposure to algal toxins. Ultimately, determination of population or ecosystem health will be most informative when multiple metrics are examined across disciplines in the context of specific scenarios and goals.

TI  - Measuring the threat from a distance: insight into the complexity and perspectives for implementing sentinel plantation to test the host range of<i> Xylella</i><i> fastidiosa</i>
T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel plantation concept consists of assessing the impact of exotic factors, such as pests and patho-gens, on plants of interest by planting them out of their native range. This tool is a way to enhance knowl-edge for pest risk analysis (PRA) by guiding decisions on how quarantine organisms should be regulated and where to focus prevention and surveillance efforts for an early detection. In this study, the sentinel method was used in the case of research on Xylella fastidiosa, a plant pathogenic bacterium that has re-cently been found established in southern Europe, but whose potential impact and possible host range are still poorly documented in northern areas where the bacterium is not known to occur. To improve knowl-edge on the susceptibility of potential hosts of X. fastidiosa in northern Europe, a sentinel plantation of Prunus domestica cv. Opal, Quercus petraea and Salix alba was established in the X. fastidiosa-infected area of Majorca. In order to assess the circulation of the bacterium in the sentinel plot and around it, surveys of the local flora and insect vectors were carried out, as well as the planting of a network of rosemary "spy plants". Symptomatic monitoring and molecular analyses were performed on the sentinel plants for four years. During these years, X. fastidiosa was never detected in our sentinel plants most likely because of the low infectivity pressure recorded in the surroundings. This study underlines the complexity of conducting sentinel plantation assays combined with X. fastidiosa research, highlighting the need for long-term inves-tigation and questioning the efficiency of the sentinel tool. However, this study is placed in perspective with other valuable sentinel plantations. It also highlights the complementarity of the tool and proposes elements to improve or re-orientate the implementation of future sentinel projects.

TI  - Improved Object-Based Mapping of Aboveground Biomass Using Geographic Stratification with GEDI Data and Multi-Sensor Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) mapping using spaceborne LiDAR data and multi-sensor images is essential for efficient carbon monitoring and climate change mitigation actions in heterogeneous forests. The optimal predictors of remote sensing-based AGB vary greatly with geographic stratification, such as topography and forest type, while the way in which geographic stratification influences the contributions of predictor variables in object-based AGB mapping is insufficiently studied. To address the improvement of mapping forest AGB by geographic stratification in heterogeneous forests, satellite multisensory data from global ecosystem dynamics investigation (GEDI) and series of advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) and Sentinel were integrated. Multi-sensor predictors for the AGB modeling of different types of forests were selected using a correlation analysis of variables calculated from topographically stratified objects. Random forests models were built with GEDI-based AGB and geographically stratified predictors to acquire wall-to-wall biomass values. It was illustrated that the mapped biomass had a similar distribution and was approximate to the sampled forest AGB. Through an accuracy comparison using independent validation samples, it was determined that the geographic stratification approach improved the accuracy by 34.79% compared to the unstratified process. Stratification of forest type further increased the mapped AGB accuracy compared to that of topography. Topographical stratification greatly influenced the predictors' contributions to AGB mapping in mixed broadleaf-conifer and broad-leaved forests, but only slightly impacted coniferous forests. Optical variables were predominant for deciduous forests, while for evergreen forests, SAR indices outweighed the other predictors. As a pioneering estimation of forest AGB with geographic stratification using satellite multisensory data, this study offers optimal predictors and an advanced method for obtaining carbon maps in heterogeneous regional landscapes.

TI  - Optimal Setting of Earthquake-Related Ionospheric TEC (Total Electron Content) Anomalies Detection Methods: Long-Term Validation over the Italian Region
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, thanks to the availability of historical satellite observations that have begun to be significantly large and thanks to the exponential growth of artificial intelligence techniques, many advances have been made in the detection of geophysical parameters such as seismic-related anomalies. In this study, the variations of the ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC), one of the main parameters historically proposed as a seismic-connected indicator, are analyzed. To make a statistically robust analysis of the complex phenomena involved, we propose a completely innovative machine-learning approach developed in the R programming language. Through this approach, an optimal setting of the multitude of methodological inputs currently proposed for the detection of ionospheric anomalies is performed. The setting is optimized by analyzing, for the first time, multi-year-mostly twenty-year-time series of TEC satellite data measured by global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) over the Italian region, matched with the corresponding multi-year time series of seismic events. Seismic events including all the countries of the Mediterranean area, up to Turkey, are involved in the analysis. Tens of thousands of possible combinations of input methodological parameters are simulated and classified according to pre-established criteria. Several inputs examined return clear results. These results combined with each other highlight the presence of anomalous seismic-related sequences that have an extremely low probability of having been detected randomly (up to 2 out of 1 million). The anomalies identified represent the most anomalous behaviors of the TEC recorded during the entire period under investigation (e.g., 20 years). Some of the main conclusions are that, at mid-latitudes, ? the detection of seismic-TEC anomalies can be more efficient looking for punctual rather than persistent phenomena; ? the optimal thresholds for the identification of co-seismic anomalies can assume different values depending on type of anomaly (positive or negative) and type of observation; ? single GNSS receiver data can be useful for capturing local earthquake-ionospheric effects and Global Ionospheric Maps (GIM) data can be functional in detecting large-scale earthquake-ionospheric effects; ? earthquakes deeper than 50 km are less likely to affect the ionosphere.

TI  - Relationship between Dynamics of Modern Glaciers of the Mt. Munkhkhairkhan (Mongolian Altai) and Climate
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Mt. Munkhkhairkhan is the most crucial region for understanding climate and glaciation changes in Mongolia. This study investigated the relationship between glacial area changes and the climate elements of Mt. Munkhkhairkhan in the Mongolian-Altai Mountains using a remote sensing approach, in-situ observations, the Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Innovative Trend Analysis Method (ITAM), Sen's slope estimator test, and statistical analysis. The study results showed that for the last 30 years, the annual average air temperature of Mt. Munkhkhairkhan has been slightly increasing. Total annual precipitation (mainly snow) in the mountain area decreased from 1990 to 2000, but since 2000, a significant increase in precipitation levels has appeared. For the last 30 years, the glacial area has decreased by 32% to 11.7 km(2). Multiple regression results showed a strong correlation between Temperature, Precipitation, and Glaciers (Multiple R = 0.69, R-2 = 0.48). Ruther indicated that Temperature (t = -2.332, p = 0.036) and Precipitation (t = -3.212, p = 0.007) were significant predictors in the model. Air temperature and precipitation explained 48 percent of the change in the glacier area, and R = 0.69 is a strong correlation. The glaciers and snow area in the study area have changed due to climate warming and precipitation changes and are located in arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia. This study of Mt. Munkhairkhan shows that climate change significantly impacts glaciers and snow.

TI  - Modeling and Predicting Land Use/Land Cover Change Using the Land Change Modeler in the Suluh River Basin, Northern Highlands of Ethiopia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover change are among the drivers of environmental change. The Suluh River Basin's land use and land cover are modeled in this study using a land change modeler. To accomplish the goals of this study, Landsat images and ancillary data sources were utilized. In eCognition Developer 9.2 software, nearest neighbor fuzzy classification was used to classify Landsat images. With the IDRISI Selva 17.3 software, change detection and modeling were carried out. Both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the data were conducted. The results showed that, despite a drop in forest land of 97.2%, grazing land of 89.8%, plantation land of 89.1%, shrub-bush land of 1.5%, and water bodies of 84.8% from 1990 to 2002, bare land increased by 10.6%, built-up land by 29.4%, and cultivated land by 65.4%. The model projects, bare, built-up, and cultivated land will increase at the cost of water bodies, grazing, forest, shrub-bush, and plantation land between the years 2028 and 2048. Rainfall, slope, height, distance to rivers, distance to highways, distance from towns, and population density were the main determinants of LULC change in the study area. Therefore, in order to promote sustainable development, safeguard the river basin, and lessen the severity of the changes, appropriate management and timely action must be taken by policymakers and decision makers.

TI  - Climate-Change-Driven Droughts and Tree Mortality: Assessing the Potential of UAV-Derived Early Warning Metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Protecting and enhancing forest carbon sinks is considered a natural solution for mitigating climate change. However, the increasing frequency, intensity, and duration of droughts due to climate change can threaten the stability and growth of existing forest carbon sinks. Extreme droughts weaken plant hydraulic systems, can lead to tree mortality events, and may reduce forest diversity, making forests more vulnerable to subsequent forest disturbances, such as forest fires or pest infestations. Although early warning metrics (EWMs) derived using satellite remote sensing data are now being tested for predicting post-drought plant physiological stress and mortality, applications of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are yet to be explored extensively. Herein, we provide twenty-four prospective approaches classified into five categories: (i) physiological complexities, (ii) site-specific and confounding (abiotic) factors, (iii) interactions with biotic agents, (iv) forest carbon monitoring and optimization, and (v) technological and infrastructural developments, for adoption, future operationalization, and upscaling of UAV-based frameworks for EWM applications. These UAV considerations are paramount as they hold the potential to bridge the gap between field inventory and satellite remote sensing for assessing forest characteristics and their responses to drought conditions, identifying and prioritizing conservation needs of vulnerable and/or high-carbon-efficient tree species for efficient allocation of resources, and optimizing forest carbon management with climate change adaptation and mitigation practices in a timely and cost-effective manner.

TI  - Developing a more complete understanding of tropical montane forest disturbance ecology through landslide research
T2  - FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Review
AB  - Landslides are a central component of tropical montane forest disturbance regimes, including in the tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, one of the most biodiverse ecosystems in the world. Technological developments in remote sensing have made landscape-scale landslide studies possible, unlocking new avenues for understanding montane biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the future effects of climate change. Here, we outline three axes of inquiry for future landslide ecology research in Andean tropical montane forest. We focus exclusively on the Andes due to the vast floral diversity and high endemicity of the tropical Andes biodiversity hotspot, and its importance for global biodiversity and regional ecosystem service provisioning; the broad elevational, latitudinal, and topographic gradients across which landslide dynamics play out; and the existence of long-term plot networks that provide the necessary baseline data on mature forest structure, composition, and functioning to contextualize disturbance impacts. The three lines of study we outline, which draw heavily on remote sensing data and techniques, will deepen scientific understanding of tropical montane forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and the potential impacts of climate change on both. They are: (1) tracking landslide biodiversity dynamics across time and space with high spatial and temporal resolution satellite and unoccupied aerial vehicle imagery; (2) assessing the ecological influence of landslides through the lens of plant functional diversity with imaging spectroscopy; and (3) understanding current and predicting future landslide regimes at scale by building a living landslide inventory spanning the tropical Andes. The research findings from these three axes of inquiry will shed light on the role of landslides and the process of forest recovery from them in both the Andes and worldwide.

TI  - Maize (Zea Mays L.) Yield Estimation Using High Spatial and Temporal Resolution Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the world's most important annual cereal crops and its yield can be estimated for a wide variety of purposes. The objective of this work is to evaluate in which stage of crop the best fit between remote sensing data and real yield occurs to predict yield in corn seed crops. For this, polynomial regression models were used between spectral indices of vegetation and real yield in 10 days time's windows covering the critical period for generation of performance. Subsequently, the predictive capacity of the best goodness of fit model was evaluated by comparing estimates with those made using a conventional field estimation method. This experiment was carried out in production fields located in Tandil and Loberia district inside of the Argentine Pampas Region in southeast of Buenos Aires province in summer (from january to march) of 2020. We found the highest level of adjustment between vegetal index and real yield (R-2 = 0.91) in the time window of 110 to 120 days after sowing (DAS) corresponding to the end of the critical period. Then, the predictive performance was evaluated, satellite model shows an underestimation of 53 kg/ha (0.72% relative error) while the conventional method underestimated by 955 kg/ha (13% relative error). A close relationship between remote sensing data and grain yield at the end of the critical period of maize can be evidenced, and this information can be used to predict yield early in the southeast of Buenos Aires province. Using the methodology here developed it is recommended to analyze- time series of satellite vegetal index in maize crops in other regions and climates to make more robust the yield prediction system.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF REMOTE SENSING ON DEFORESTATION OF ECONOMIC TREE SPECIES IN WUDIL, KANO STATE, NIGERIA
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - A remote sensing strategy was investigated to evaluate how temperature and rainfall affect the deforestation of economically important tree species in Wudil, Kano Nigeria. The research was carried out in Wudil. To assess the vulnerability of the study area to desertification and the abundance of economic tree species. Landsat satellite products (Landsat 5, 7, 8. were used as the sources of remote sensing imageries. These products were sourced for intervals of ten years, from 1986 to 1999, 2006 to 2016, and 2020 Standardized temperature anomaly and precipitation index from 1986 to 2020 were analyzed using primary and secondary data obtained for information on temperature and rainfall, a hundred questionnaires were used to analyze how much anthropogenic activity has contributed to desertification in the area by looking at their socioeconomic activities, roads, and infrastructural development. To determine the quantity, distribution, growth, and yield of all the species, a transect of one square kilometer was surveyed using regional techniques in each of the four cardinal directions. Principal component analysis revealed that the activity variables and activity observations for 1999, 2006, 2016, and 2016 were all negative, while the years 1986 and 2020 were positive. Increased trends in temperature and decreasing trends in rainfall are evident using the Mann-Kendall analysis, with P-values of 0.0 and 0.003, respectively, which are smaller than the alpha value of 0.05. The main causes of drought and desertification vulnerability according to the findings include variations in the characteristics of rainfall, human activities, and overgrazing. More tree planting initiatives should be encouraged, ideally making them an annual event in the study region.

TI  - Multi-sensor InSAR time series fusion for long-term land subsidence monitoring
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is widely used for topographic, geological and natural resource investigations. However, most of the existing InSAR studies of ground deformation are based on relatively short periods and single sensors. This paper introduces a new multi-sensor InSAR time series data fusion method for time-overlapping and time-interval datasets, to address cases when partial overlaps and/or temporal gaps exist. A new Power Exponential Knothe Model (PEKM) fits and fuses overlaps in the deformation curves, while a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network predicts and fuses any temporal gaps in the series. Taking the city of Wuhan (China) as experiment area, COSMO-SkyMed (2011-2015), TerraSAR-X (2015-2019) and Sentinel-1 (2019-2021) SAR datasets were fused to map long-term surface deformation over the last decade. An independent 2011-2020 InSAR time series analysis based on 230 COSMO-SkyMed scenes was also used as reference for comparison. The correlation coefficient between the results of the fusion algorithm and the reference data is 0.87 in the time overlapping region and 0.97 in the time-interval dataset. The correlation coefficient of the overall results is 0.78, which fully demonstrates that the algorithm proposed in our paper achieves a similar trend as the reference deformation curve. The experimental results are consistent with existing studies of surface deformation at Wuhan, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed new fusion method to provide robust time series for the analysis of long-term land subsidence mechanisms.

TI  - Characterization of an allosteric inhibitor of fungal-specific C-24 sterol methyltransferase to treat<i> Candida</i><i> albicans</i> infections
T2  - CELL CHEMICAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Filamentation is an important virulence factor of the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. The abolition of Candida albicans hyphal formation by disrupting sterol synthesis is an important concept for the develop-ment of antifungal drugs with high safety. Here, we conduct a high-throughput screen using a C. albicans strain expressing green fluorescent protein-labeled Dpp3 to identify anti-hypha agents by interfering with ergosterol synthesis. The antipyrine derivative H55 is characterized to have minimal cytotoxicity and potent inhibition of C. albicans hyphal formation in multiple cultural conditions. H55 monotherapy exhibits therapeu-tic efficacy in mouse models of azole-resistant candidiasis. H55 treatment increases the accumulation of zy-mosterol, the substrate of C-24 sterol methyltransferase (Erg6). The results of enzyme assays, photoaffinity labeling, molecular simulation, mutagenesis, and cellular thermal shift assays support H55 as an allosteric inhibitor of Erg6. Collectively, H55, an inhibitor of the fungal-specific enzyme Erg6, holds potential to treat C. albicans infections.

TI  - Detection of Smoke from Straw Burning Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Data and an Improved YOLOv5s Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The burning of straw is a very destructive process that threatens people's livelihoods and property and causes irreparable environmental damage. It is therefore essential to detect and control the burning of straw. In this study, we analyzed Sentinel-2 data to select the best separation bands based on the response characteristics of clouds, smoke, water bodies, and background (vegetation and bare soil) to the different bands. The selected bands were added to the red, green, and blue bands (RGB) as training sample data. The band that featured the highest detection accuracy, RGB_Band6, was finally selected, having an accuracy of 82.90%. The existing object detection model cannot directly handle multi-band images. This study modified the input layer structure based on the YOLOv5s model to build an object detection network suitable for multi-band remote sensing images. The Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) network attention mechanism was introduced based on the YOLOv5s model so that the delicate features of smoke were enhanced, and the Convolution + Batch normalization + Leaky ReLU (CBL) module was replaced with the Convolution + Batch normalization + Mish (CBM) module. The accuracy of the model was improved to 75.63%, which was 1.81% better than before. We also discussed the effect of spatial resolution on model detection and where accuracies of 84.18%, 73.13%, and 45.05% for images of 60-, 20-, and 10-m resolution, respectively, were realized. The experimental results demonstrated that the accuracy of the model only sometimes improved with increasing spatial resolution. This study provides a technical reference for the monitoring of straw burning, which is vital for both the control of straw burning and ways to improve ambient air quality.

TI  - Evaluation of the Accuracy of Spectral Calibration Light Source on Spectral Radiance Acquired by the Greenhouse-Gases Absorption Spectrometer-2 (GAS-2)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring global greenhouse gas concentration information via satellite remote sensing has become a critical area of research to support the further understanding of global carbon emissions. The Greenhouse-gases Absorption Spectrometer-2 (GAS-2) is being developed as the primary payload of the Fengyun-3H (FY-3H), which will be launched in 2024. Achieving high-precision mesurements of greenhouse gases requires precise spectral calibration. However, currently, there is no method for assessing the detection accuracy of GAS-2 using spectral calibration light sources, and quantitative studies are lacking. In this study, the influence model of calibration light sources on spectral calibration accuracy is established, and the spectral radiance acquired via GAS-2 is simulated using the line-by-line radiative transfer model (LBLRTM). We investigated the impact of different linewidths and wavelength stabilities of the calibration light source on its accuracy in four wavelength bands. This study is the first to examine the effects of the linewidth and wavelength stability of a calibration light source on the spectral radiance acquired via GAS-2. The initial results demonstrate that if the linewidth of the calibration light source is approximately 100 MHz and the wavelength stability is in the order of subpicometers, the radiance error obtained by GAS-2 is less than 10%. Among the four bands, the 2.06 mu m (strong-CO2) band is more affected by the calibration light source than the other three bands. In addition, the wavelength stability of the light source has a greater influence on the error than the linewidth of the light source under the same error condition. The research findings can be used to guide and reference the selection of light sources in the laboratory spectral calibration of GAS-2, ultimately contributing to the instrument's quantitative development level.

TI  - Source Model of the 2023 Turkey Earthquake Sequence Imaged by Sentinel-1 and GPS Measurements: Implications for Heterogeneous Fault Behavior along the East Anatolian Fault Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 6 February 2023, a devastating doublet of earthquakes with magnitudes of Mw 7.8 and Mw 7.6 successively struck southeastern Turkey near the border of Syria. The earthquake sequence represents the strongest earthquakes in Turkey during the past 80 years and caused an extensive loss of life and property. In this study, we processed Sentinel-1 and GPS data to derive the complete surface displacement caused by the earthquake sequence. The surface displacements were adopted to invert for the fault geometry and coseismic slip distribution on the seismogenic faults of the earthquake sequence. The results indicate that the coseismic rupture of the Turkey earthquake sequence was dominated by left-lateral strike slips with a maximum slip of similar to 10 m on the East Anatolian Fault Zone (EAFZ) and the Surgu fault (SF). Significant surface ruptures are recognized based on the geodetic inversion, which is consistent with the analysis of post-earthquake satellite images. The cumulative released moment of the two earthquakes reached 9.62 x 10(20) Nm, which corresponds to an event of Mw 7.95. Additionally, the interseismic fault slip rates and locking depths along the central and western segments of the EAFZ were estimated using the high-resolution long-term velocity field. The results reveal significant lateral variations of fault slip rates and locking depths along the central and western segments of the EAFZ. Generally, the estimated fault locking zone showed good spatial consistency with the coseismic fault rupture of the Mw 7.8 shock on the EAFZ. The static coulomb failure stress (CFS) change due to the Mw 7.8 earthquakes suggests that the subsequent Mw 7.6 event was certainly promoted by the Mw 7.8 shock. The stress transfers from the fault EAFZ to the fault SF were realized by unclamping the interface of the fault SF, which significantly reduces the effective normal stress on the fault plane. Large CFS increases in the western Puturge segment of the EAFZ, which was not ruptured in the 2020 Mw 6.8 and the 2023 Mw 7.8 earthquakes, highlight the future earthquake risk in this fault segment.

TI  - Applicability Assessment of Passive Microwave LST Downscaling over Semi-Homogeneous Desert Underlying Surface Based on Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal resolution of remote sensing products in land surface temperature (LST) studies can be improved using the downscaling method. This is a crucial area of research as it provides basic data for the study of climate change. However, there have been few studies evaluating the applicability of downscaling methods using underlying surfaces of varying complexities. In this study, we focused on the semi-homogeneous underlying surface of Gurbantunggut Desert and evaluated the applicability of five classical, passive microwave, downscaling methods based on the machine learning of Catboost, using 365 days of AMSR-2 and MODIS data in 2019, which can be scanned once during the day and night. Our results showed four main points: (1) The correlation coefficients between feature vectors and the LST of the semi-homogeneous underlying surface were clearly different from those of the surrounding oases. The correlation coefficient of the semi-homogeneous underlying surface was high, and that of the surrounding oases was low. (2) At the same frequency, the correlation coefficient between vertically polarized BT and LST was greater than that between horizontally polarized BT and LST. Considering the semi-heterogeneous underlying surface, 23.8 GHz and 36.5 GHz may be more suitable for passive microwave LST retrieval than 89 GHz according to physical mechanisms. (3) The fine-scale LST downscaling accuracy achieved with all BT channels of AMSR-2 was higher than that achieved with the other four classical models. The day and night RMSE values verified with MYD11A1 data were 2.82 K and 1.38 K, respectively. (4) The correlation coefficients between downscaled LST and the soil temperature of the top layer of the site were the highest, with daytime-nighttime R-2 values of 0.978 and 0.970, and RMSE values of 3.42 and 4.99 K, respectively. The all-channel-based LST downscaling method is very effective and can provide a theoretical foundation for the acquisition of all-weather, multi-layer soil temperature.

TI  - Damage Assessment Through the Use of SBAS-DInsar Data: An Application to the "Vittorino da Feltre" Masonry School Building in Rome
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL HERITAGE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The detection and monitoring of deformation patterns induced by causes of various nature is fundamental to prevent and mitigate the associated risk. To this aim, one of the most innovative, non-invasive monitoring approaches is based on the use of satellite radar images through the advanced multi-temporal Differential Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) technique, which is able to detect deformations induced by slowly evolving phenomena. In this work, the multi-temporal DInSAR technique referred to as full resolution SBAS approach is exploited for the monitoring of the ground deformations and their effects on the "Vittorino da Feltre" school building located in the city of Rome (Italy), which is undergoing a retrofitting project. The displacement measurements were obtained by using the COSMO-SkyMed satellite dataset related to the city of Rome during the 2011-2019 time interval, processed with full resolution Small. The damage progression during the last years has been evaluated by comparing a recent survey of the structural damage with the previously available ones. An integration of SAR-derived data and outcomes of the on-site damage surveys is presented, aimed to perform a damage assessment of the structure using literature scales of damage.

TI  - Object- Versus Pixel-Based Unsupervised Fire Burn Scar Mapping under Different Biogeographical Conditions in Europe
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire detection and mapping is crucial for managing natural resources and preventing further environmental damage. In this study, we compared two methods of mapping burn scars using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, a pixel-based approach and an object-based approach, at test sites located in various climatic zones with diverse land cover synthesis. The study aimed to determine the advantages and limitations of each method in terms of accuracy and precision in detecting burn scars. The results showed that both methods could detect burn scars with high accuracy, but with some limitations. The F1 score was in the range of 0.64-0.89 for the object-based approach, and 0.58-0.90 for the pixel-based approach. The pixel-based method produced a more precise delineation of the burnt area, but it was only suitable for detecting burn scars in a limited area of interest. The object-based method, on the other hand, was able to detect burn scars over a larger area accurately but with some commission errors. The results of both methods were also compared to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) rapid mapping product.

TI  - Digital exploration of selected heavy metals using Random Forest and a set of environmental covariates at the watershed scale
T2  - JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study was established for predicting some selected heavy metals (HMs) including Zn, Mn, Fe, Co, Cr, Ni, and Cu, by applying random forest (RF) and a set of environmental covariates at watershed scale. The objectives were to find out the most effective combination of variables and controlling factors on the variability of HMs in a semiarid watershed in central Iran. One hundred locations were selected in the given watershed in the hypercube manner and soil samples from a surface 0-20 cm depth and concentration of HMs and some soil properties were measured in the laboratory. Three scenarios of input variables were defined for HMs prediction. The results revealed that the first scenario (remote sensing + topographic attributes) explained about 27-34% of the variability in HMs. Inclusion of a thematic map to the scenario I, improved the prediction accuracy for all HMs. Scenario III (remote sensing data+ topographic attributes + soil properties) was the most efficient scenario for prediction of HMs with R2 values ranging from 0.32 for Cu to 0.42 for Fe. Similarly, the lowest nRMSE was found for all HMs in scenario III, ranging from 0.271 for Fe to 0.351 for Cu. Among the soil properties, clay content and magnetic susceptibility were the most important variables, and also some remote sensing data (Carbonate index, Soil adjusted vegetation index, Band2, and Band7) and topographic attributes (mainly control soil redistribution along the landscape) were the most efficient variables for estimating HMs. We concluded that the RF model with a combination of remote sensing data, topographic attributes, and assisting of thematic maps such as land use in the studied watershed could reliably predict HMs content.

TI  - Antarctic sea-ice low resonates in the ecophysiology of humpback whales
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The past six years have been marked by some of the most dramatic climatic events observed in the Antarctic region in recent history, commencing with the 2017 sea-ice extreme low. The Humpback Whale Sentinel Programme is a circum-polar biomonitoring program for long term surveillance of the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. It has previously signalled the extreme La Nina event of 2010/11, and it was therefore of interest to assess the capacity of existing bio-monitoring measures under the program to detect the impacts of 2017 anomalous climatic events. Six ecophysiological markers of population adiposity, diet, and fecundity were targeted, as well as calf and juvenile mortality via stranding records. All indicators, with the exception of bulk stable isotope dietary tracers, indicated a negative trend in 2017, whilst C and N bulk stable isotopes appeared to indicate a lag phase resulting from the anomalous year. The collation of multiple biochemical, chemical, and observational lines of evidence via a single biomonitoring platform provides comprehensive information for evidence-led policy in the Antarctic and Southern Ocean region.

TI  - River mouth morphodynamics and deflection over the short term: effects on spit growth and mangrove dynamics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The river mouth shows the influence of the dynamics of sediment deposition and the processes organising the deposits. The river mouths of the Guyana coast, as with other coastal systems in the Guianas, are influenced by the deposition of mud banks from the Amazon River and other rivers. This study analysed and probed the influence of the riverine and marine influences on small river mouth morphological developments. In this study, the morphological dynamics of the system were carried out from satellite images through the comparison of the inter-annual morphodynamics of the river mouths, complemented by data from hydrodynamic processes among others. This study demonstrates that the recent advancement and availability of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), remotely sensed data, allow for the classification of migrating river mouth action and processes; effective monitoring of mudflats development and spit formation; and, the exhibition of river mouth transitioning and infilling. Sentinel-1 images of the Mahaica-Mahaicony river mouth in Guyana were processed and analysed using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS to observe the mud dynamics and its effects on deflecting the river mouth, influencing the development of spit and mangrove dynamics. The results of the analyses show that the dynamics of the mud shoal and river mouth are governed by feedback from various estuarine and hydrodynamic processes resulting from the interactions between the river and ocean. The results have not only highlighted the importance of mud infilling and sediment build-up for spit development and river-mouth deflection but the impact of the sediment morphological dynamics on the ecosystem (mangrove) associated with the river mouth.

T2  - NEOBIOTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Austropuccinia psidii, the causal agent of myrtle rust, has emerged as a significant threat to Myrtaceae in planted and natural woody ecosystems. The first detection of A. puccinia in South Africa was from severely infected ornamental Myrtus communis. This raised concern that M. communis, the sole Myrtaceae species native to Europe and an important component of vegetation in Mediterranean regions, could be threatened by the rust. In light of the potential threat to this unique species, seed was collected from 12 Italian provenances of M. communis, including mainland and island (Sardinia and Sicily) populations. We assessed the susceptibility of these provenances to both the pandemic and South African strains of A. psidii. In Colombia, where the pandemic strain of A. psidii is native, seedlings rapidly became infected by natural inoculum. In South Africa, a preliminary screening of seedlings by artificial inoculation with a single-uredinium isolate produced high levels of disease. Finally, plants of each of the 12 provenances were planted and monitored in Florence, Italy. To date, these showed no signs of disease, but will continue to be monitored. This study highlights the significant threat that both the pandemic and South African strains of A. puccinia pose to M. communis in Europe.

TI  - Evaluation of Temporal Stability in Radiometric Calibration Network Sites Using Multi-Source Satellite Data and Continuous In Situ Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The radiometric calibration network (RadCalNet) comprises four pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS): Gobabeb, Baotou, Railroad Valley Playa, and La Crau. Due to its site stability characteristics, it is widely used for sensor performance monitoring and radiometric calibration, which require high spatiotemporal stability. However, some studies have found that PICS are not invariable. Previous studies used top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data without verifying site data, which could affect the accuracy of their results. In this study, we analyzed the short- and long-term radiometric trends of RadCalNet sites using bottom-of-atmosphere (BOA) data, and verified the trends revealed by the TOA data from Landsat 7, 8, and Sentinel-2. Besides the commonly used methods (e.g., nonparametric Mann-Kendall and sequential Mann-Kendall tests), a more robust Sen's slope method was used to estimate the magnitude of the change. We found that (1) the trends based on TOA reflectance contrasted with those based on BOA reflectance in certain cases, e.g., the reflectance trends in the red band of BOA data for La Crau in summer and autumn and Baotou were not significant, while the TOA data showed a significant downward trend; (2) the temporal trends showed statistically significant and abrupt changes in all PICS, e.g., the SWIR2 band of La Crau in winter and spring changed by 1.803% per year, and the SWIR1 band of Railroad Valley Playa changed by >0.282% per year, indicating that the real changes in sensor performance are hard to detect using these sites; (3) spatial homogeneity was verified using the coefficient of variation (CV) and Getis statistic (Gi*) for each PICS (CV < 3% and Gi* > 0). Overall, the RadCalNet remains a highly reliable tool for vicarious calibration; however, the temporal stability should be noted for radiometric performance monitoring of sensors.

AB  - The periodic forest fire incident adversely impacts the function and services of ecologically fragile forest regions and the worst air quality conditions. Reliable information on forest fire hotspots can offer to develop and implement appropriate action plans to minimize the severe impacts of the forest fire on society and the environment. The Simlipal Biosphere Reserves (SBR) in Odisha state is one of India's major forest fire hotspots, where forest fire occurs almost every year. The present study deployed long-term (2003-2021) MODIS fire datasets (namely, MYD14A1: Fire Radiative Power (FRP); and MCD64A1: Burned area (BA) product) to delineate the forest fire hot spots using the Getis-Ord Gi* approach over the SBR. The spatiotemporal analysis of the MODIS fire dataset (during 2003-2021) showed that the maximum fire extents were comparatively more in 2004, 2009, 2010, 2018, and 2021. Furthermore, the derived forest fire hotspot map exhibited that similar to 225, 108, and 30 km(2) areas are prone to forest fire based on the FRP, BA, and intersection of FRP and BA datasets, respectively. The forest fire hotspot patches are found nearby the human settlement regions in the SBR, and the areas near the Ligirda, Debasthali, Bhanjbasa, and Kiajhari villages seem highly prone to forest fire occurrence. On the other hand, a significant correlation (R-2 = 0.45-0.62, p < 0.01) was observed between the area coverage of FRP and BA patches with aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the SBR during 2003-2021. The outcomes of the present study shall be key inputs in assisting, managing, and preventing forest fires over the identified fire hotspot zones in SBR to reduce the socio-economic and environmental losses.

TI  - Monitoring of land surface albedo and its impact on land surface temperature (LST) using time series of remote sensing data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and urban population growth are increasing every day across the world. The replacement of natural surfaces with artificial surfaces such as bitumen, asphalt, and cement reduces albedo, increases the land surface temperature (LST), and contributes to creating urban heat islands (UHI). In this study, Landsat satellite time-series images were used to produce land use/land cover (LULC) and calculate albedo, LST, and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) in the 1985-2018 period of Tabriz. The results demonstrated an over 170% increase in the area of impervious surfaces. Monitoring of albedo and LST in the 1996-2018 period showed that reflective surfaces could reduce the mean temperature of impervious surfaces in the entire city by 4.42 degrees C and increase the mean albedo by 0.0647. Meanwhile, LST was decreased by 7.97 degrees C and albedo was increased by 0.1633 in densely populated urban areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient between LST and albedo in the impervious surface class was-0.6 for the entire city, which is higher than the correlation between NDVI and LST parameters in the vegetation class. Therefore, reflective surfaces can reduce the surface temperature more efficiently than vegetation. It is worth mentioning that this correlation reaches up to-0.8 in urban districts. The research findings showed that urban growth and the increasing area of impervious surfaces could create urban cold islands instead of urban heat islands if reflective surfaces are used in the rooftops.

TI  - Research on the diurnal variation characteristics of ozone formation sensitivity and the impact of ozone pollution control measures in "2+26" cities of Henan Province in summer
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface ozone pollution is becoming an increasingly serious air quality issue in China, especially in "2 + 26" cities (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and nearby cities). HN2 + 26 cities ("2 + 26" cities of Henan Province) are located in the south of "2 + 26" cities, with frequent and severe ozone pollution events in recent years. This study investigated the diurnal evo-lution characteristics of ozone formation sensitivity (OFS) of HN2 + 26 cities from May to September in 2021 by the in-novative combination of Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME-2B) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite data, and assessed the impact of ozone pollution control measures (OPCMs) implemented from June 26 to July 1, 2021. The localized FNR (ratio of formaldehyde to nitrogen dioxide of satellite measurement) threshold (1.4-2.55) was established, and it was found that OFS in May-September 2021 was mainly in VOCs-limited regime in the morning (-10:00), while transitional/NOx-limited regime in the afternoon (-14:00). Three periods (before, during and after the OPCMs) were divided to evaluate the impact of OPCMs on OFS. It was indicated that OPCMs had no impact on the morn-ing OFS, but had a significant impact on the afternoon OFS. Specifically, the OFS in two industrial cities Xinxiang (XX) and Zhengzhou (ZZ) shifted from transitional regime to NOx-limited regime after the OPCMs. We further investigated OFS dif-ferences between urban and suburban areas and found that OFS shift of XX only existed in urban areas, while that of ZZ existed in both urban and suburban areas. We compared their measures and found that it is effective to take hierarchical control measures on different levels of ozone pollution days to alleviate ozone pollution. This study provides an improved understanding of diurnal evolution characteristics of OFS and the impacts of OPCMs on it, which will provide a theoretical basis for formulating more scientific ozone pollution control policies.

TI  - Evidence for marine sedimentary rocks in Utopia Planitia: Zhurong rover observations
T2  - NATIONAL SCIENCE REVIEW
M3  - Review
AB  - Decades of research using remotely sensed data have extracted evidence for the presence of an ocean in the northern lowlands of Mars in the Hesperian (similar to 3.3 Ga), but these claims have remained controversial due to the lack of in situ analysis of the associated geologic unit, the Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF). The Tianwen-1/Zhurong rover was targeted to land within the VBF near its southern margin and has traversed almost 2 km southward toward the interpreted shoreline. We report here on the first in situ analysis of the VBF that reveals sedimentary structures and features in surface rocks that suggest that the VBF was deposited in a marine environment, providing direct support for the existence of an ancient (Hesperian) ocean on Mars.Whether or not an ocean ever existed on Mars has been debated for decades. China's Zhurong rover has recently found ocean sedimentary rocks for the first time in the Utopia Planitia of Mars, which supports that there was an ancient ocean in Martian northern lowland.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Monitoring the volcanic activity of a potentially hazardous volcano is essential for eruption warning and hazard mitigation. The SO2 flux from the volcano is one of the most important measures to understand its activity. Mount Tokachi, in Japan, is an active volcano that experienced three magmatic explosive eruptions in the 20th century (in 1926, 1962, and 1988-1989). Since 2006, geodetic observations have captured ground deformation, suggesting an inflation beneath the main crater. Moreover, since 2020 daily visual observations have detected the increase in plume heights and the occurrence of volcanic glow at the main crater. The high-time-resolution estimation of SO2 flux will help monitor the activity of Mount Tokachi and clarify the associating mechanisms. Furthermore, satellite remote sensing can estimate the vertical column density (VCD) of sulfur dioxide (SO2), enabling the daily determination of SO2 flux without the need to visit the site. Due to the improved spatial resolution, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) has advanced satellite-based volcanic gas flux measurements.Methods: We have analyzed the available TROPOMI data and conducted ground-based observations to estimate the SO2 flux from Mount Tokachi at 100-2,000 tons/day.Result and Discussion: The average annual SO2 flux has been increasing since 2021, on par with the increase in plume height and volcanic glow. TROPOMI data enabled quantification of the annual SO2 flux, with a sufficient temporal resolution to monitor the volcanic activity at Mount Tokachi. However, a high flux, such as in excess of 2,000 tons/day, was observed in the winter season. The flux from the satellite data was similar to that from ground-based observations during the summer. However, a seasonal change in flux from the satellite data was observed in winter, with the flux being larger than that in summer, possibly because the flux increases during winter. Another possible reason is the influence of snow cover on satellite observations due to its high surface reflectance. We reanalyzed some TROPOMI data during the winter, in which the ground snow cover was misidentified as clouds at low altitudes. This procedure suppresses the error caused by the high surface reflectance due to winter snow coverage and improves the quality of the annual SO2 flux from satellite observations. This methodology is applicable to other high-latitude or high-altitude volcanoes during specific seasons characterized by frequent fluctuations in snow cover conditions.

TI  - Long transportation duration affects nutrient composition, mycotoxins and microbial community in whole-plant corn silage
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPotential nutrient losses and mycotoxin accumulation caused by abnormal fermentation during transportation from cropland to dairy farms leads to the diseases incidence and threatens the health of dairy cows, then further causes financial losses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different transportation times on the nutritional composition, mycotoxins, and microbial communities in whole-plant corn silage (WPCS). MethodsThree groups were subjected to different transport times: DY, short (<200 min); ZY, medium time (300-500 min); and CY, long transport time (>600 min). WPCS were collected from the same field, and nutrient composition and microbial composition before and after transportation were analyzed. Results and discussionOur results showed that the temperature of WPCS was higher in the ZY and CY groups than in the DY group (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ether extract (EE) and starch contents after different transportation times (P > 0.05), whereas the starch and water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) contents in the CY group was significantly decreased after transport (P < 0.05). Similarly, the concentration of vomitoxin in the DY and CY groups declined markedly (P < 0.05) and the zearalenone content in the DY group also significantly decreased after transportation (P < 0.05). Regarding the analysis of microorganisms in WPCS, UniFrac-distance matrices and Shannon indices showed differences in the ZY group (P < 0.05), but fungal diversities were not influenced by the transport time (P > 0.05). In the ZY group, the relative abundance of Lactiplantibacillus decreased significantly after transportation (P > 0.05), but the relative abundances of unidentified_Chloroplast, Pantoea, Gluconobacter, unidentified Acetobacter and Acinetobacter increased markedly (P < 0.05). In addition, the relative abundances of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter in the CY group increased after transport (P < 0.05). Among fungal communities, a total of three, nine, and ten different fungal flora were observed in the DY, ZY, and CY groups, respectively, although no difference was found in fungal diversity. In conclusion, increased temperature, loss of starch, and mycotoxin variation were found with increased transport time. This might be the result of competition between bacteria and fungi, and novel technologies will need to be utilized for further exploration of the mechanism.

TI  - A CNN-Based Layer-Adaptive GCPs Extraction Method for TIR Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground Control Points (GCPs) are of great significance for applications involving the registration and fusion of heterologous remote sensing images (RSIs). However, utilizing low-level information rather than deep features, traditional methods based on intensity and local image features turn out to be unsuitable for heterologous RSIs because of the large nonlinear radiation difference (NRD), inconsistent resolutions, and geometric distortions. Additionally, the limitations of current heterologous datasets and existing deep-learning-based methods make it difficult to obtain enough precision GCPs from different kinds of heterologous RSIs, especially for thermal infrared (TIR) images that present low spatial resolution and poor contrast. In this paper, to address the problems above, we propose a convolutional neural network-based (CNN-based) layer-adaptive GCPs extraction method for TIR RSIs. Particularly, the constructed feature extraction network is comprised of basic and layer-adaptive modules. The former is used to achieve the coarse extraction, and the latter is designed to obtain high-accuracy GCPs by adaptively updating the layers in the module to capture the fine communal homogenous features of the heterologous RSIs until the GCP precision meets the preset threshold. Experimental results evaluated on TIR images of SDGSAT-1 TIS and near infrared (NIR), short wave infrared (SWIR), and panchromatic (PAN) images of Landsat-8 OLI show that the matching root-mean-square error (RMSE) of TIS images with SWIR and NIR images could reach 0.8 pixels and an even much higher accuracy of 0.1 pixels could be reached between TIS and PAN images, which performs better than those of the traditional methods, such as SIFT, RIFT, and the CNN-based method like D2-Net.

TI  - Coseismic and Early Postseismic Deformation of the 2020 Mw 6.4 Petrinja Earthquake (Croatia) Revealed by InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The largest earthquake (Mw 6.4) in northwestern Croatia ruptured the faults near the city of Petrinja on 29 December 2020, at 11:19 UTC. The epicenter was located similar to 3 km southwest of Petrinja, similar to 40 km southeast of Zagreb, the capital of the Republic of Croatia. Here we investigated the geometric and kinematic properties of the 2020 Mw 6.4 Petrinja earthquake using a joint inversion of ascending and descending interferograms from three tracks of Sentinel-1 Single-Look Complex (SLC) images. The coseismic and early postseismic surface displacements associated with the Petrinja earthquake were imaged using standard DInSAR and SBAS time-series InSAR methods, respectively. The distributed slip model was inverted based on the ground surface displacements with maximum slip patch in 5 km depth. The early postseismic deformation occurred on the northwestern extent of coseismic slip, and it cannot be well modeled by the coseismic model. We thus suggested that the postseismic deformation was caused by a combined effect of the postseismic afterslips and aftershocks occurring in this area. Based on the inverted slip model, we calculated the Coulomb stress change in the region, and found a good correlation between positive Coulomb failure stress increment CFS and the distribution of aftershocks. Based on these results, we identified which faults are more active, and then better estimated the seismic hazards in the region.

TI  - A neural network approach to the estimation of in-water attenuation to absorption ratios from PACE mission measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In preparation for the upcoming PACE mission, we explore the feasibility of a neural network-based approach for the conversion of measurements of the degree of linear polarization at the top of the atmosphere as carried out by the HARP2 instrument into estimations of the ratio of attenuation to absorption in the surface layer of the ocean. Polarization has been shown to contain information on the in-water inherent optical properties including the total attenuation coefficient, in contrast with approaches solely based on remote sensing reflectance that are limited to the backscattered fraction of the scattering. In turn, these properties may be further combined with inversion algorithms to retrieve projected values for the optical and physical properties of marine particulates.Methodology: Using bio-optical models to produce synthetic data in quantities sufficient for network training purposes, and with associated polarization values derived from vector radiative transfer modeling, we produce a two-step algorithm that retrieves surface-level polarization first and attenuation-to-absorption ratios second, with each step handled by a separate neural network. The networks use multispectral inputs in terms of the degree of linear polarization from the polarimeter and the remote sensing reflectance from the Ocean Color Instrument that are anticipated to be fully available within the PACE data environment.Result and Discussion: Produce results that compare favorably with expected values, suggesting that a neural network-mediated conversion of remotely sensed polarization into in-water IOPs is viable. A simulation of the PACE orbit and of the HARP2 field of view further shows these results to be robust even over the limited number of data points expected to be available for any given point on Earth's surface over a single PACE transit.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Effects on the Value of Ecosystem Services in the Konqi River Basin, China, under Ecological Water Conveyance Conditions
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Basin ecosystems are vulnerable to natural resource depletion, ecological damage, and environmental pollution due to their fragile natural environment. Assessing the value of basin ecosystem services (ES) can facilitate informed decision making by policy makers and stakeholders in the context of competing resource use. The Konqi River Basin in China, an arid inland river basin, has suffered from degraded ecosystems due to overexploitation of soil and water resources. In response, the local government launched an ecological water conveyance (EWC) project in 2016 to enhance ecological restoration efforts. This paper analyzes and evaluates the value of ES in the Konqi River Basin based on land use and land cover (LULC) change characteristics before and after EWC in 2013 and 2020, respectively. Remote sensing data and related socioeconomic statistics data are used to assess a typical river basin from three unique locations in the Konqi River Basin, divided into upper and lower reaches. The results show that cropland and unused land are the most important land use types in the upper and lower reaches. The characteristics of ecosystem service value (ESV) changes in the study area are consistent with land use structure changes. The total ESV shows a decreasing trend in the upper reaches from 2013 to 2020, while the lower reaches show an increasing trend. The total ESV increases in the typical river reaches of the Konqi River Basin. Spatially, low-ESV areas are mainly located in ecologically fragile areas that are difficult to develop and use. The sensitivity indexes of the study area are all less than 1, making the results of this study credible. The Moran index shows a significant spatial correlation in the study area, indicating that the distribution characteristics of high-ESV areas are agglomerative. Hot spot areas in the upper reaches show an overall increasing trend, while in the lower reaches, former sub-hot spot areas transform into hot spot areas. Due to data limitations, this study is limited to demonstrating that the value of ES in the area changes due to a combination of EWC policies and other factors. Nevertheless, the analysis shows that EWC policies actively change the ESV of a typical river basin in Konqi. This study can provide a reference for evaluating ESV in inland river basins in the northwest arid region and a scientific basis for the rational development and utilization of water and soil resources in the study area, located in an arid and ecologically fragile area.

AB  - Study of the lymphatic system, compared to that of the other body systems, has been historically neglected. While scientists and clinicians have, in recent decades, gained a better appreciation of the functionality of the lymphatics as well as their role in associated diseases (and consequently investigated these topics further in their experimental work), there is still much left to be understood of the lymphatic system. In this review article, we discuss the role lymphatic imaging techniques have played in this recent series of advancements and how new imaging techniques can help bolster this wave of discovery. We specifically highlight the use of lymphatic imaging techniques in understanding the fundamental anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic system; investigating the development of lymphatic vasculature (using techniques such as intravital microscopy); diagnosing, staging, and treating lymphedema and cancer; and its role in other disease states.

TI  - Behaviour and occurrence of the Antillean manatee (<i>Trichechus manatus manatus</i>) in relation to habitat characteristics and the influence of human activities in a protected area in north-eastern Brazil
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - While all sirenian species are considered sentinel animals for the ecological health of their habitat, they are currently facing extinction risk. The Antillean manatee (Trichechus manatus manatus) is classified as an endangered species in Brazil.Its distribution and behaviour are mainly influenced by the presence of aquatic vegetation, freshwater and anthropogenic activities, as well as by variations in tides, temperature and salinity.The study investigated the behaviour of manatees in the Barra do Rio Mamanguape Environmental Protection Area in north-eastern Brazil, and the relationship between these behaviours and the biotic and abiotic characteristics of this estuarine environment.The behavioural data were collected between November 2016 and May 2017, during 35 days of monitoring. The records of surface behaviour were obtained using animal focal sampling. Anthropogenic activities were recorded qualitatively and quantitatively during the surveys.Warmer water (30-31 degrees C), reduced turbidity (1-2 m) and sandy sediments had a significant influence on the behaviour of the manatees.The manatees presented neutral behaviour more often than expected in response to anthropogenic activities, which indicates that the animals were undisturbed by these activities.This is the first systematic study of the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the behaviour and ecology of Antillean manatees in a protected area of a tropical region, providing important new insights into the behavioural ecology of an endangered species.The Barra do Rio Mamanguape Environmental Protection Area seems to fulfil the goal of adequate management and conservation of manatees in a tropical region. Specifically, it shows that appropriate management, law enforcement and inspection measures are essential for maintaining endangered populations.

TI  - Can the establishment of a protected area improve the lacustrine environment? A case study of Lake Chaohu, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eutrophication of lacustrine environments with frequent cyanobacterial blooms has become a serious problem. Overpopulation and runoff into groundwater and lakes from fertilizers with too much nitrogen and phosphorous have caused most of the problems. Here, we first devised a land use and cover classification system based on the local characteristics of the first-level protected area of Lake Chaohu (FPALC). Lake Chaohu is the fifth largest freshwater lake in China. The land use and cover change (LUCC) products were produced using sub-meter res-olution satellite data from 2019 to 2021 in the FPALC. This study presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of the established protected areas. The results show the most impactful type was the reduction in cropland with an area that declined from 7446.4 hm2 to 6433.3 hm2 from 2019 to 2021. Most of the reduced cropland was converted into wetlands, with 460.2 hm2 and 152.0 hm2 of cropland restored to wetlands from 2019 to 2020 and 2020-2021, respectively. The area of cyanobacterial blooms in Lake Chaohu showed a downward trend, and the lacustrine environment was greatly improved after the establishment of the FPALC. These quantified data can inform decision-making related to Lake Chaohu conservation and provide a reference for managing the aquatic environment in other watersheds.

TI  - Detecting subpixel human settlements in mountains using deep learning: A case of the Hindu Kush Himalaya 1990-2020
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of future population growth in mountains will occur in small- and medium-sized cities and towns and affect vulnerable ecosystems. However, mountain settlements are often omitted from global land cover analyses due to the low spatial resolution of satellite images, which cannot resolve the small scale of mountains settlements. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the potential of deep learning to detect human settlements in mountains at the sub-pixel level, based on Landsat satellite imagery. We hypothesized that adding spatial and temporal features could improve the detection of mountain settlements since spectral information alone led to inaccurate results. For spatial features, we compared a U-shaped neural network (U-Net), a deep learning algorithm that automatically learns spatial features, with a simple random forest (RF) algorithm. Then, we assessed whether temporal features would increase accuracy by comparing two input datasets, multispectral imagery and temporal features from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm. We evaluated each method by calculating the accuracies of (1) the binary settlement footprint, (2) the subpixel estimates of impervious surfaces, and (3) urban growth. We tested the accuracies using visually interpreted datasets from time-series Google Earth images across the Hindu Kush Himalaya that were not used for training to evaluate model transferability. The U-Net successfully improved mountain settlement mapping compared to the random forest, with a substantial discrepancy in small settlements. The time-series results from the U-Net successfully captured long-term urban growth but fewer short-term changes. Contrary to expectations, the CCDC temporal features reduced the accuracy of mountain settlement mapping due to frequent cloud cover in hilly areas. Our subpixel analysis reveals that the built-up area of the Hindu Kush Himalaya has expanded at a rate of 61 km2 per year from 1990 to 2020, which is about twice the estimate of the Global Human Settlement Layer using binary urban/non-urban classifications.

TI  - Flooding and inundation maps using interpolated CYGNSS reflectivity observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the myriad of remote sensing techniques currently used to map surface water, a gap remains in our ability to rapidly map inundation from flooding at the required temporal resolution to understand how floods evolve. However, the recent launch of constellations of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSSR) satellites can provide data at a more frequent temporal repeat than a single satellite. These L-band instruments could provide moderate spatial resolution inundation maps at a better temporal resolution than other satellite radars. This paper describes a retrieval algorithm for flood inundation mapping using GNSS-R data from the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) constellation. The algorithm employs a simple dielectric model to retrieve fractional inundation from an observation of reflectivity, requiring parameterizations of soil surface and water roughness as well as ancillary soil moisture data. Here, we give a brief overview of the model, describe our parameterization scheme, and present inundation maps using CYGNSS data. We describe four case studies (from the Amazon, Mozambique, Mali, and Australia) and compare the CYGNSS inundation maps to other surface water data (SWAMPS, PALSAR-2, Dartmouth Flood Observatory, MODIS, and the Global Surface Water Explorer). We identify sources of uncertainty in the CYGNSS inundation maps and discuss possible reasons for discrepancies between the inundation retrievals. We introduce the data portal, which houses the CYGNSS inundation maps, for use by the science community.

TI  - Satellite-based environmental variables complement traditional variables in spatio-temporal models of purple martin migration
T2  - WILDLIFE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Context. As advanced satellite-based environmental data become widely accessible, emerging opportunities exist to understand avian lifecycle events at continental scales. Although this growing toolbox offers much promise, an abundance of options may appear overwhelming to ecologists and point to the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to develop and interpret complex, spatio-temporal models. Aims. Here, we demonstrate that satellite-based environmental variables complement conventional variables in spatio-temporal phenology models. The objective of this case study was to assess the degree to which including more sophisticated, satellite-based greenness data in association with a customised growing degree-day metric, can improve traditional phenological models based solely on monthly temperature and precipitation. Methods. Using 2001-2018 purple martin (Progne subis) first arrival dates (n = 49481) from the Purple Martin Conservation Association, we develop a predictive model for their first arrival dates on the basis of traditional temperature and precipitation values from ground-based meteorological stations, the MODIS satellite-based greenness index, and a more sophisticated growing degree-day metric. We used a Bayesian framework to construct 10 spatio-temporal candidate models on the basis of different combinations of predictor variables and our best model included a combination of both traditional and customised MODIS-based variables. Key results. Our results indicated that purple martins arrive earlier when greening occurs earlier than the mean, which is also associated with warmer spring temperatures. In addition, wetter February months also predicted earlier martin arrivals. There was no directional change in purple martin first arrival dates from 2001 to 2018 in our study region. Conclusions. Our results suggest that satellite-based environmental variables complement traditional variables such as mean monthly temperature and precipitation in models of purple martin migratory phenology. Implications. Including emerging and conventional variables in spatio-temporal models allows complex migratory changes to be detected and interpreted at broad spatial scales, which is critical as Citizen Science efforts expand. Our results also pointed to the importance of assembling interdisciplinary research teams to assess the utility of novel data products.

TI  - A rapid assessment of stubble burning and air pollutants from satellite observations
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - For the last several years, the air quality of India's capital Delhi and surrounding region (NCR) has been degrading to a very poor and severe category during the autumn season. In addition to the various sources of air pollutants within the NCR region, the stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana states contributes to the poor air quality in this region. The current study employs the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) active fire products and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) products on carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations for spatio-temporal assessment of stubble burning and associated emissions. The analysis performed in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform indicated a nearly threefold rise in crop residue burning in November than in October, with 92.58% and 7.42% reported from Punjab and the Haryana states in November, respectively. The study highlights the availability of near-real-time remote sensing observations and the utility of the GEE platform for rapid assessment of stubble burning and emissions thereof, having the potential for developing mitigation strategies.

TI  - Assessment of dynamic drought-induced ecosystem risk: Integrating time-varying hazard frequency, exposure and vulnerability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems, occupying 28.26% of Earth's surface, are extensively at risk from droughts, which is likely to propagate into human communities owing to loss of vital services. Ecosystem risk also tends to fluctuate within anthropogenically-forced nonstationary environments, raising considerable concerns about effectiveness of mitigation strategies. This study aims to assess dynamic ecosystem risk induced by droughts and identify risk hotspots. Bivariate nonstationary drought frequency was initially derived as a hazard component of risk. By coupling vegetation coverage and biomass quantity, a two-dimensional exposure indicator was developed. Tri-variate likelihood of vegetation decline was calculated under arbitrary droughts to intuitively determine ecosystem vulnerability. Ultimately, time-variant drought frequency, exposure and vulnerability were multiplied to derive dynamic ecosystem risk, followed by hotspot and attribution analyses. Risk assessment implemented in the drought-prevalent Pearl River basin (PRB) of China during 1982-2017 showed that meteorological droughts in eastern and western margins, although less frequent, were prolonged and aggravated in contrast to prevalence of less persistent and severe droughts in the middle. In 86.12% of the PRB, ecosystem exposure maintains high levels (0.62). Relatively high vulnerability (>0.5) occurs in water-demanding agroecosystems, exhibiting a northwest-southeast-directed extension. A 0.1-degree risk atlas unveils that high and medium risks occupy 18.96% and 37.99% of the PRB, while risks are magnified in the north. The most pressing hotspots with high risk continuing to escalate reside in the East River and Hongliu River basins. Our results provide knowledge of composition, spatio-temporal variability and driving mechanism of drought-induced ecosystem risk, which will assist in risk-based mitigation prioritization.

TI  - Refining historical burned area data from satellite observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 imagery has revealed a substantial underestimation of burned area (BA) compared with earlier sat-ellite products with coarser spatial resolution. In this context, we investigate the predictability of biases between the reference Sentinel-2 BA product developed for Sub-Saharan Africa (FireCCISFD) in 2019 and commonly used global coarse resolution BA products (MCD64, Fire CCI and C3S), providing tools to refine historical annual BA data before the Sentinel-2 era. To do so, we built a comprehensive dataset of environmental predictors of BA biases, with variables or proxies of (I) the annual BA estimated from the coarse-resolution product, (II) BA sizes, (III) the persistence and strength of BA signals, (IV) the maximum potential BA, and (V) the obstruction of land surface observation from satellites. Full and parsimonious random forest models were performed and validated through out-of-bag (OOB) estimations, and reconstructed BAs were validated with external data over space, and over time. The explained variance in BA biases was >= 78.58% (OOB) for all full and parsimonious models. The reconstructed BA data showed a high correspondence with the reference BA in the validation sites over space (>= 91.15% var. explained) and time (>= 90.37% var. explained), notably reducing biases of coarse resolution products. As an example of the model applicability, the spatial patterns of Madagascar's BA were reconstructed for 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2020, revealing a burned extent between two and four times higher than previous estimations. The proposed models are operational solutions to obtain regional and global virtually unbiased BA estimates since 2000.

TI  - The effective use of anchor observations in variational bias correction in the presence of model bias
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In numerical weather prediction, satellite radiance observations have a significant impact on forecast skill. However, radiance observations must usually be bias-corrected for the satellite data to have a positive impact. Many operational centres use variational bias correction (VarBC) to correct the observation biases, but VarBC assumes that there is no model bias within the system. As model biases are often non-negligible, unbiased observations (anchor observations) are known to play an important role in VarBC to reduce the contamination of model bias. However, more work is needed to understand what properties the network of anchor observations needs to have to reduce most contamination of model bias. We derive analytical expressions to show the sensitivity of the bias correction to the anchor observations and the expected value of the error in the analysed bias-correction coefficients. We find that the precision and location of the anchor observations are important in reducing the contamination of model bias in the estimate of observation bias. Anchor observations work best at reducing the effect of model bias when they observe the same state variables as the bias-corrected observations. When this is not the case, strong background-error correlations become more important, as they allow more information about the model bias to be passed from the anchor observations to the bias-corrected observations. The model bias observed by both the biased and anchor observations must be similar, otherwise the anchor observations cannot reduce the contamination of model bias in the observation-bias correction. These results show that, in operational systems, regions with sparse anchor observations could be more susceptible to model biases within the radiance observation-bias corrections. We demonstrate these results in a series of idealised numerical experiments that use the Lorenz 96 model as a simplified model of the atmosphere.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Impact on the Quality of Life of Patients with Endometrial Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Given the improvement in the surgical treatment of endometrial cancer with the inclusion of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), our aim was to evaluate the impact of this minimally invasive and tailored nodal assessment on patients' quality of life (QoL). Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a single-centre, tertiary-level hospital. Patients diagnosed with preoperative early-stage endometrial cancer, who underwent primary surgical treatment between August 2015 and November 2021, were included. The enrolled patients were divided into two cohorts according to the nodal staging performed: the first group underwent only SLNB (SLNB group); the second group underwent pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy (LND group). We evaluated the overall QoL using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life core 30-item questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and a sexual health questionnaire (EORTC SHQ-C20). The scores were compared between the groups. Results: Ninety patients were enrolled in the study: 61 (67.8%) in the SLNB group and 29 (32.2%) in the LND group. In the LND group, 24 (82.7%) patients underwent pelvic and para-aortic LND, while 5 (17.3%) patients underwent pelvic LND. The assessment of the functional scales showed better results for the SLNB group than for the LND group, with a significantly lower impact on physical status (8.2% vs. 25%, respectively; p = 0.031). In terms of the symptom scales, the SLNB group reported a significantly lower negative impact on sleep quality (4.9% vs. 27.6%, respectively; p < 0.01), pain (1.6% vs. 13.8%, respectively; p = 0.019), and dyspnoea (0% vs. 10.3%, respectively; p = 0.011) than the LND group. The SLNB group had better results for all analysed items regarding sexual QoL. Conclusions: The implementation of a surgical technique with SLNB improved patients' overall QoL by increasing their well-being in the functional and symptom spheres.

TI  - Supervised Classification of Tree Cover Classes in the Complex Mosaic Landscape of Eastern Rwanda
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Rwanda consists of a mosaic of different land cover types, with agroforestry, forest patches, and shrubland all containing tree cover. Mapping and monitoring the landscape is costly and time-intensive, creating a need for automated methods using openly available satellite imagery. Google Earth Engine and the random forests algorithm offer the potential to use such imagery to map tree cover types in the study area. Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, along with vegetation indices, texture metrics, principal components, and non-spectral layers were combined over the dry and rainy seasons. Different combinations of input bands were used to classify land cover types in the study area. Recursive feature elimination was used to select the most important input features for accurate classification, with three final models selected for classification. The highest classification accuracies were obtained for the forest class (85-92%) followed by shrubland (77-81%) and agroforestry (68-77%). Agroforestry cover was predicted for 36% of the study area, forest cover was predicted for 14% of the study area, and shrubland cover was predicted for 18% of the study area. Non-spectral layers and texture metrics were among the most important features for accurate classification. Mixed pixels and fragmented tree patches presented challenges for the accurate delineation of some tree cover types, resulting in some discrepancies with other studies. Nonetheless, the methods used in this study were capable of delivering accurate results across the study area using freely available satellite imagery and methods that are not costly and are easy to apply in future studies.

TI  - Machine learning-based country-level annual air pollutants exploration using Sentinel-5P and Google Earth Engine
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic condition is triggering human health emergencies and earth's surface changes. Anthropogenic activities, such as built-up expansion, transportation development, industrial works, and some extreme phases, are the main reason for climate change and global warming. Air pollutants are increased gradually due to anthropogenic activities and triggering the earth's health. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Carbon Monoxide (CO), and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) are truthfully important for air quality measurement because those air pollutants are more harmful to the environment and human's health. Earth observational Sentinel-5P is applied for monitoring the air pollutant and chemical conditions in the atmosphere from 2018 to 2021. The cloud computing-based Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is applied for monitoring those air pollutants and chemical components in the atmosphere. The NO2 variation indicates high during the time because of the anthropogenic activities. Carbon Monoxide (CO) is also located high between two 1-month different maps. The 2020 and 2021 results indicate AQI change is high where 2018 and 2019 indicates low AQI throughout the year. The Kolkata have seven AQI monitoring station where high nitrogen dioxide recorded 102 (2018), 48 (2019), 26 (2020) and 98 (2021), where Delhi AQI stations recorded 99 (2018), 49 (2019), 37 (2020), and 107 (2021). Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, and Chennai recorded huge fluctuations of air pollutants during the study periods, where similar to 50-60% NO2 was recorded as high in the recent time. The AOD was noticed high in Uttar Pradesh in 2020. These results indicate that air pollutant investigation is much necessary for future planning and management otherwise; our planet earth is mostly affected by the anthropogenic and climatic conditions where maybe life does not exist.

TI  - Vegetation Dynamic in a Large Floodplain Wetland: The Effects of Hydroclimatic Regime
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floodplain wetlands are among the most dynamic ecosystems on Earth, featuring high biodiversity and productivity. They are also sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances and are globally threatened. Understanding how flow regime drives the spatiotemporal dynamics of wetland habitats is fundamental to effective conservation practices. In this study, using Landsat imagery and the random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, we mapped the winter distribution of four wetland habitats (i.e., Carex meadow, reedbed, mudflat, and shallow water) in East Dongting Lake, a Ramsar wetland in the middle to lower Yangtze Basin of China, for 34 years (1988-2021). The dynamics of wetland habitats were explored through pixel-by-pixel comparisons. Further, the response of wetland habitats to flow regime variations was investigated using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM). Our results demonstrated the constant expansion of reedbeds and shrinkage of mudflats, and that there were three processes contributing to the reduction in mudflat: (1) permanent replacement by reedbed; (2) irreversible loss to water; and (3) transitional swapping with Carex meadow. These changes in the relative extent of wetland habitats may degrade the conservation function of the Ramsar wetland. Moreover, the duration of the dry season and the date of water level withdrawal were identified as the key flow regime parameters shaping the size of wetland habitats. However, different wetland vegetation showed distinct responses to variations in flow regime: while Carex meadow increased with earlier water withdrawal and a longer dry season, reedbed continuously expanded independent of the flow regime corresponding to the increase in winter rainfall. Our findings suggested that flow regime acts in concert with other factors, such as climate change and sand mining in river channels, driving wetland habitat transition in a floodplain landscape. Therefore, effective conservation can only be achieved through diverse restoration strategies addressing all drivers.

TI  - Observation of spatial and temporal patterns of seasonal ground deformation in central Yakutia using time series InSAR data in the freezing season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal freeze/thaw variations of the active layer cause seasonal ground deformation, such as thaw subsidence in summer and frost heave in winter due to the cyclic phase changes of soil water. The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing, especially interferometric SAR (InSAR) techniques, has been proven to be a very useful tool for observing surface displacements of permafrost environments. Most previous studies on seasonal InSAR displacement have been concentrated in several study sites in the Arctic tundra regions. The objective of this study is to extend the InSAR analysis of seasonal ground deformations to boreal forest regions, where monitoring ground deformation is particularly important in terms of better understanding active layer dynamics under various ecological and geological conditions. In this study, we presented a strategy to analyze the time series SAR data in the freezing season to estimate the differential phase for seasonal ground deformation while overcoming the problem of coherence losses due to the rapid growth of vegetation during the short growing season. We applied the SBAS-based InSAR processing method to Sentinel-1 SAR in the central Yakutian lowlands, where boreal forests and thermokarst landforms are widely distributed, and retrieved frost-related displacement signals successfully. In addition to the magnitude of ground deformation in the freezing season, we further examined the temporal deformation pattern related to the progression of the freezing front in the soil during active freezing. Based on the Stefan solution, we proposed a piecewise linear model for the time series deformation. The proposed model divides the time series displacement according to the progression of freezing into three linear segments, and the slope parameter of each linear model can be interpreted as indicating the hydrological characteristics of the upper, middle, and lower parts of the soil. The results for the Yakutian lowlands illustrated the potential of SAR remote sensing to observe and quantify spatial details of the thermal and hydrological properties inside the active layer soil even in highly vegetated subarctic boreal forest areas.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)) values as an indicator of seawater clarity/transparency were estimated using the ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-3A and Sentinel-3B OLCI (S3/OLCI) satellite data in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman (PG&GO). To do so, two procedures were evaluated including an existing methodology developed by Doron et al. (J Geophys Res: Oceans 112(C6) 2007 and (Remote Sens Environ 115:2986-3001 2011) and an empirical model proposed in this research formed by employing the blue (B-4) and green (B-6) bands of S3/OLCI data. In this regard, a total number of 157 field-measured Z(sd) values (114 training points for calibration of the models and 43 control points for accuracy assessment of them) were observed during eight research cruises conducted by the research vessel, the Persian Gulf Explorer, in the PG&OS between 2018 and 2022. The optimum methodology was then selected based on the statistical indicators including R-2 (coefficient of determination), RMSE (root mean square error), and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). However, after the indication of the optimal model, the data of all 157 observations were utilized for the calculation of unknown parameters of the model. The final results demonstrated that compared to the existing empirical model proposed by Doron et al. (J Geophys Res: Oceans 112(C6) 2007 and (Remote Sens Environ 115:2986-3001 2011), the developed model in this study which was formed based on the linear and ratio terms of B-4 and B-6 bands, has more efficiency in the PG&GO. Consequently, a model in form of Z(sd) = e(4)(6)(4)(6)(1.638B)(/B)(-8.241B)(-12.876B)(+1.26) was suggested for the estimation of Z(sd) values from S3/OLCI in the PG&GO (R-2 = 0.749, RMSE = 2.56 m, and MAPE = 22.47%). The results also showed that the annual oscillation of the Z(sd) values in the GO (5-18 m) is evidently higher compared with those in the PG (4-12 m) and the SH (7-10 m) regions.

TI  - Minority Student Perspectives of Barriers, Supports, and Christian Virtues in an Undergraduate Christian Nursing Program.
T2  - Journal of Christian nursing : a quarterly publication of Nurses Christian Fellowship
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - ABSTRACT: Diversity and inclusion are critical priorities in nursing education programs. Literature has focused on minority student experiences of barriers and supports-but not through a Christian worldview. This qualitative study using a phenomenological-hermenuetic approach gave voice to the experiences of 15 self-identified minority student graduates from a Christian baccalaureate nursing program. Data analysis revealed opportunities for growth in providing a supportive climate within the program and how Christian virtues of hospitality, humility, and reconciliation can be employed to achieve this goal.

TI  - Alternative tree-cover states of dryland ecosystems: Inconsistencies between global and continental scales
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Dryland ecosystems are complex systems that can exhibit alternative tree-cover states, making conservation and restoration efforts challenging. However, our understanding of these states is still limited, particularly at the global level. In this study, we utilized remote sensing data to analyze the distribution of tree cover in drylands and assess the impacts of factors such as the aridity index, temperature, fire frequency, and grazing on tree cover at both the global and continental scales. The results showed that dryland ecosystems in Asia, Australia, and South America exhibited alternative tree-cover states, while dryland ecosystems at the global scale and in Africa, Europe, and North America did not. Livestock density and the aridity index appeared to be the primary drivers of these states in the regions where they occurred. This study highlights the importance of considering the variability in dryland vegetation states across different scales and regions, as small-scale processes may not always accurately predict large-scale dynamics. By examining dryland woody vegetation at both global and continental scales, our work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect the tree-cover states in these ecosystems.

TI  - Gestational gigantomastia: The sentinel event to systemic lupus erythematosus
T2  - OBSTETRIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Gestational gigantomastia or gravid macromastia is a rare condition presenting as incapacitating breast enlargement during pregnancy. It is physically and psychologically debilitating for the patient. Fewer than 100 cases have been published to date. The etiology of the condition is unknown, but various theories have been proposed. Here we report a case of a 27 year old woman in her second pregnancy, with an abnormal increase in the size of breasts. Her breast size increased from 34B to 52D brassiere size. Routine antenatal, hormone, and initial autoimmune investigations were within normal limits. The patient was managed conservatively with breast support and had a spontaneous resolution in the postpartum period. During follow up she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, making the association of the two conditions a possibility. Good knowledge about this rare condition is necessary for all doctors, especially obstetricians.

TI  - Comparison of dust optical depth from multi-sensor products and MONARCH (Multiscale Online Non-hydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry) dust reanalysis over North Africa, the Middle East, and Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol reanalysis datasets are model-based, observationally constrained, continuous 3D aerosol fields with a relatively high temporal frequency that can be used to assess aerosol variations and trends, climate effects, and impacts on socioeconomic sectors, such as health. Here we compare and assess the recently published MONARCH (Multiscale Online Non-hydrostatic AtmospheRe CHemistry) high-resolution regional desert dust reanalysis over northern Africa, the Middle East, and Europe (NAMEE) with a combination of ground-based observations and space-based dust retrievals and products. In particular, we compare the total and coarse dust optical depth (DOD) from the new reanalysis with DOD products derived from MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer), and IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) spaceborne instruments. Despite the larger uncertainties, satellite-based datasets provide a better geographical coverage than ground-based observations, and the use of different retrievals and products allows at least partially overcoming some single-product weaknesses in the comparison. Nevertheless, limitations and uncertainties due to the type of sensor, its operating principle, its sensitivity, its temporal and spatial resolution, and the methodology for retrieving or further deriving dust products are factors that bias the reanalysis assessment. We, therefore, also use ground-based DOD observations provided by 238 stations of the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) located within the NAMEE region as a reference evaluation dataset. In particular, prior to the reanalysis assessment, the satellite datasets were evaluated against AERONET, showing moderate underestimations in the vicinities of dust sources and downwind regions, whereas small or significant overestimations, depending on the dataset, can be found in the remote regions. Taking these results into consideration, the MONARCH reanalysis assessment shows that total and coarse-DOD simulations are consistent with satellite- and ground-based data, qualitatively capturing the major dust sources in the area in addition to the dust transport patterns. Moreover, the MONARCH reanalysis reproduces the seasonal dust cycle, identifying the increased dust activity that occurred in the NAMEE region during spring and summer. The quantitative comparison between the MONARCH reanalysis DOD and satellite multi-sensor products shows that the reanalysis tends to slightly overestimate the desert dust that is emitted from the source regions and underestimate the transported dust over the outflow regions, implying that the model's removal of dust particles from the atmosphere, through deposition processes, is too effective. More specifically, small positive biases are found over the Sahara desert (0.04) and negative biases over the Atlantic Ocean and the Arabian Sea ( 0.04), which constitute the main pathways of the long-range dust transport. Considering the DOD values recorded on average there, such discrepancies can be considered low, as the low relative bias in the Sahara desert ( < 50 %) and over the adjacent maritime regions ( < 100 %) certifies. Similarly, over areas with intense dust activity, the linear correlation coefficient between the MONARCH reanalysis simulations and the ensemble of the satellite products is significantly high for both total and coarse DOD, reaching 0.8 over the Middle East, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Arabian Sea and exceeding it over the African continent.Moreover, the low relative biases and high correlations are associated with regions for which large numbers of observations are available, thus allowing for robust reanalysis assessment.

TI  - Sustainable Ready-Mixed Concrete (RMC) Production: A Case Study of Five RMC Plants in Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine whether ready-mixed concrete (RMC) production in Nigeria is sustainable. This study proposes that RMC production will be sustainable, assuming the RMC plant, RMC products, plant management, RMC supply, RMC quality, and demand for RMC are sustainable. Based on a constructivist worldview, the proposition of RMC production's sustainability was assessed by conducting a contextual analysis of five RMC plants in Lagos State, Nigeria. It was observed that the RMC plants required sustainability in power supply, plant output, and plant capacity. The plants have a sustainable supply of raw materials. The management methods and product control strategies were found to be unsustainable. Fair supply time, supply methods, and quality control systems were established in the findings. Challenges, such as administrative issues, economic problems, poor technology, and the absence of an innovative business model, influenced the sustainable demand for RMC products. This study concludes that alternative power supplies and methods such as just-in-time (JIT) purchasing systems and learning frameworks ought to be considered for RMC plants. Likewise, improving the ease of doing business would significantly help the sustainability of RMC production. This study presumes that RMC production is, as of now, not sustainable in Nigeria. Still, the sustainability of RMC production could be ensured through measures such as the reuse of waste, the adoption of innovative RMC production and delivery, and technological development.

TI  - Factors Determining Concurrent Reclamation and Abandonment of Cultivated Land on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau has important functions, such as water and soil conservation, wind and sand control, carbon fixation, and biodiversity protection. Agricultural development on the Tibetan Plateau not only maintains local food security but is also related to the important ecological functions in China and Asia. This study analyzed the spatial distribution of reclaimed and abandoned cultivated land in the Yarlung Zangbo-Lhasa-Nyangqu River (YLN) region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from 2000 to 2020 using high-resolution remote sensing data. Additionally, this study explored the factors influencing spatial distribution patterns using a landscape pattern index and correlation analysis. The results showed that: (1) From 2000 to 2020, cultivated land reclamation and abandonment coexisted in the YLN region. The total areas of reclaimed and abandoned cultivated land were 558.57 and 196.85 km(2), and their growth and abandonment rates were 25.47 and 8.29%, respectively. (2) Apparent regional differences existed in the distribution of reclaimed and abandoned lands. The reclaimed land was concentrated in the northeast and southwest of YLN, whereas abandoned land was scattered, with relatively higher fragmentation than in the former. (3) Climate and location affected the spatial distribution of both land types, with precipitation, aspect, and SOM having less influence and temperature, elevation, slope, traffic conditions, and farming radius having relatively prominent influence. (4) Socioeconomic factors were the main factors driving changes in cultivated land area in the region, wherein grain output and the number of livestock positively impacted reclamation and abandonment, relatively more significantly for reclamation. This study helps to understand the land use changes and their impacts in the YLN region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is of great significance for formulating appropriate sustainable development strategies and land management policies, and ensuring the sustainable development of local ecological environment and cultivated land resources utilization.

TI  - Endometrial cancer in a transgender male: A rare case and review of the literature
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective: Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in the United States. Despite the high prevalence amongst cisgender females the prevalence of this gynecological malignancy in transgender men has not been clearly identified. To date, only four reported cases have been described in the literature. Case: A 36-year-old nulliparous assigned female at birth, transgender premenopausal male underwent a laparoscopic total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, sentinel lymph node mapping and omental biopsy after having an endometrial biopsy that demonstrated well differential endometroid adenocarcinoma. He had been on testosterone therapy for at least five years prior to presenting to his gynecologist with the chief complaint of vaginal bleeding. Final pathology showed FIGO Stage 1A endometroid endometrial carcinoma. Conclusion: This case report adds to the body of literature demonstrating that transgender men can develop endometrial carcinoma while on exogenous testosterone therapy. In addition, this report illustrates the importance of routine gynecological care in the transgender patient population.

TI  - Response of soil moisture and vegetation conditions in seasonal variation of land surface temperature and surface urban heat island intensity in sub-tropical semi-arid cities
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The cities of arid and semi-arid regions have distinctive landscape patterns and large-scale variations in soil moisture and vegetation cover which causes significant variations in land surface temperature (LST) and surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) pattern. Therefore, the study aims to analyse the seasonal and spatial variation in LST and SUHII in the eight semi-arid cities of India in response to soil moisture and vegetation conditions. LST was retrieved from the thermal bands of Landsat data and then SUHII was calculated. The global Moran's I was used to analysis the spatial pattern of SUHII. The result shows that the mean SUHII was higher during spring and summer seasons to a tune of 0.2 to 1.0 degrees C in comparison to the winter and autumn season. SUHII zones exhibit seasonal variation in coverage, with high and very high zones increasing during spring and summer, while low and very low zones increase during autumn and winter. Furthermore, the highest LST was noticed in outskirt areas of the selected cities. The regression coefficient shows that soil moisture is closely associated with SUHII, while there is a weak association between vegetation condition and SUHII. This indicates that soil moisture has a higher impact on SUHII than vegetation condition in semi-arid environment. Global Moran's I showed that the SUHII had a clustered distribution pattern across all cities. The outcome of this study may provide useful insight for the urban planners in SUHII mitigation in the selected cities as well as in other semi-arid cities of the world with similar geographical conditions.

TI  - Modeling crop yield using NDVI-derived VGM metrics across different climatic regions in the USA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate, cost-efficient, and early crop yield projection is a national and global necessity. This study is aimed to achieve the national demands by proposing crop yield estimation models on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This study directly used dynamic crop phenology metrics to model soybean crop yield by considering climatic regions in the USA (e.g., Central, East, Northeast, South, Southeast, and West North Central regions). We modeled soybean yields with vegetative growth metrics (VGMs) of NDVI narrated as VGM70 (avg. NDVI of 70 days from the emergence), VGM85 (avg. NDVI of 85 days from the emergence), VGM98T (total NDVI of 98 days from the emergence), VGM120 (avg. NDVI of 120 days from the emergence), VGM(mean) (avg. NDVI of the growth season), VGM(max) (maximum NDVI of the growth season), and climatic factors (i.e., daytime surface temperature: DST, night-time surface temperature: NST, and precipitation) from 2000 to 2019. This study further explored individual predictors and a combination of predictors in modeling crop yield for diverse climatic regions. Therefore, we proposed six crop yield linear models for each of the climatic divisions, and these models are then compared with support vector machine (SVM) models. All models showed reliable predictability based on adjusted R-square, normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), normalized mean prediction error (NMPE) parameters, and a p-value of less than 0.001.The impact of the independent predictor in the best crop yield models is discussed based on the regression weights (beta weight: beta), and, the VGM(max) is identified as the significant predictor in crop yield modeling for different climatic regions. Overall, this study will help the national agricultural management system for better monitoring and forecasting of soybean yield to support and manage soybean production.

TI  - Simulation Study on the Effect of Elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on Regional Temperature Change on the Loess Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - CO2 undisputedly affects global temperature change, but the specific impact of change in atmospheric CO2 concentration on regional warming remains to be quantified, especially in different climatic backgrounds. Taking the Loess Plateau as the research area, this study quantified the effect of CO2 elevation on regional temperature change based on a single-factor sensitivity experiment of the regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climatic model, and the results revealed the following: (i) The correlation coefficient between monthly mean values of temperature simulated by the WRF model and the observed values reached 0.96 (p < 0.01), and the overall spatial trends of simulated and observed temperatures increased from the northwest to the southeast. (ii) CO2 concentration increased from 370.70 ppm in 2000 to 414.54 ppm in 2020, and the Loess Plateau region warmed by 0.04 and 0.06 <degrees>C under the MODIS land cover of 2000 and 2020, respectively. This indicates that increase in CO2 concentration over the Loess Plateau has greater impact than land cover change on regional temperature change. (iii) As CO2 concentration increased, the maximum fluctuation of temperature in summer exceeded 2.0 degrees C, while the fluctuations in spring (0.72 degrees C), autumn (0.77 degrees C), and winter (0.15 degrees C) were relatively small, indicating that summer temperature is most sensitive to CO2 concentration change. By emphasizing the marked temperature difference associated with the same CO2 change in different seasons, this study provides an important basis for extending the understanding of the differences in the effect of CO2 on regional temperatures.

TI  - Nanoparticles containing hazardous elements and the spatial optics of the Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite in Amazonian rivers: a potential tool to understand environmental impacts
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon River is the longest river in the world. The Tapajos River is a tributary to the Amazon. At their junction, a marked decrease in water quality is evident from negative impacts from the constant activity of clandestine gold mining in the Tapajos River watershed. The accumulation of hazardous elements (HEs), capable of compromising environmental quality across large regions is evident in the waters of the Tapajos. Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) Level-2 satellite imagery with Water Full Resolution (WFR) of 300 m was utilized to detect the highest potential for the absorption coefficient of detritus and gelbstoff in 443 m(-1) (ADG443_NN), chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN) and total suspended matter concentration (TSM_NN), at 25 points in the Amazon and Tapajos rivers (in 2019 and 2021). Physical samples of riverbed sediment collected in the field at the same locations were analyzed for NPs and ultra-fine particles to verify the geospatial findings. The riverbed sediment samples collected in the field were studied by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), following laboratory analytical procedures. The Sentinel-3B OLCI images, based on the Neural Network (NN) were calibrated by the European Space Agency (ESA), with a standard average normalization of 0.83 mu g/mg, containing a maximum error of 6.62% applied to the sampled points. The analysis of the riverbed sediment samples revealed the presence of the following hazardous elements: As, Hg, La, Ce, Th, Pb, Pd, among several others. The Amazon River has significant potential to transport ADG443_NN (55.475 m(-1)) and TSM_NN (70.787 gm(-3)) in sediments, with the possibility of negatively impacting marine biodiversity, in addition to being harmful to human health over very large regions.

AB  - BackgroundSuspicion of cancer in the Emergency Department (ED) may lead to potentially avoidable and prolonged admissions. We aimed to examine the reasons for potentially avoidable and prolonged hospitalizations after admissions from the ED for new colon cancer diagnoses (ED-dx).MethodsA retrospective, single-institution analysis was conducted of patients with ED-dx between 2017 and 2018. Defined criteria were used to identify potentially avoidable admissions. Patients without avoidable admissions were examined for ideal length of stay (iLOS), using separate defined criteria. Prolonged length of stay (pLOS) was defined as actual length of stay (aLOS) being greater than 1 day longer than iLOS.ResultsOf 97 patients with ED-dx, 12% had potentially avoidable admissions, most often (58%) for cancer workup. Very little difference in demographic, tumor characteristics, or symptoms were found, except patients with potentially avoidable admissions were more functional (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1: 83% vs. 46%; p = 0.049) and had longer symptom duration prior to ED presentation {24 days (interquartile range [IQR] 7-75) vs. 7 days (IQR 2-21)}. Among the 60 patients who had necessary admissions but did not require urgent intervention, 78% had pLOS, most often for non-urgent surgery (60%) and further oncologic workup. The median difference between iLOS and aLOS was 12 days (IQR 8-16) for pLOS.ConclusionsPotentially avoidable admissions following Ed-dx were uncommon but were mostly for oncologic workup. Once admitted, the majority of patients had pLOS, most often for definitive surgery and further oncologic workup. This suggests a lack of systems to safely transition to outpatient cancer management.

TI  - Learning from COVID: recognising the centrality of the relational in early years practice and research
T2  - EARLY YEARS
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - The initial aim of this research was to undertake an in-depth study to understand the impact of COVID-19 on early years practitioners. Following a survey and interviews with staff in Kids Planet Day Nurseries, an early years organisation in England, we used thematic analysis to analyse their responses. The findings were diverse, particularly highlighting the centrality of relationships in influencing how people responded to the anxiety caused by the pandemic, but the learning did not stop there. The research team was multidisciplinary, including university researchers and a manager from Kids Planet. It was discovered that the professional role of the interviewer influenced the response to the questions. Similarly, discussions within the research group highlighted the entanglement of knowledge acquisition and ethical practice, with consequent challenges. We discuss the value of explicitly supporting a relational worldview in Early Childhood Education and Care as the foundation for understanding and promoting improved ways of working together.

TI  - Indocyanine green combined with methylene blue versus methylene blue alone for sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer: a retrospective study
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies have shown that near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging using Indocyanine green (ICG) may improve the efficiency of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of the combination of ICG and methylene blue (MB) in breast cancer patients undergoing SLNB.Patients and methodWe evaluated ICG plus MB (ICG + MB) identification effectiveness with MB alone using retrospective analysis. From 2016 to 2020, we collected data on 300 eligible breast cancer patients who got SLNB treatment in our institution by ICG + MB or MB alone. By comparing the distribution of clinicopathological characteristics, the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and metastatic SLNs, as well as the total number of SLNs in the two groups, we were able to assess the imaging efficiency.ResultsFluorescence imaging allowed 131 out of 136 patients in the ICG + MB group to find SLNs. ICG + MB group and MB group had detection rates of 98.5% and 91.5% (P = 0.007, chi(2) = 7.352), respectively. Besides, the ICG + MB approach was able to produce improved recognition outcomes. What's more, compared with the MB group, the ICG + MB group can identify more lymph nodes (LNs) (3.1 to 2.6, P = 0.000, t = 4.447). Additionally, in the ICG + MB group, ICG could identify more LNs than MB (3.1 vs 2.6, P = 0.004, t = 2.884).ConclusionICG has high detection effectiveness for SLNs, and when paired with MB, the detection efficiency can be increased even further. Furthermore, the ICG + MB tracing mode does not involve radioisotopes, which has a lot of promise for clinical use and can take the place of conventional standard detection methods.

TI  - Mapping Eucalyptus plantation in Guangxi, China by using knowledge-based algorithms and PALSAR-2, Sentinel-2, and Landsat images in 2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Eucalyptus plantations promote the economic development of forestry in southern China, but many studies have reported their negative environmental impacts, such as high water resource usage of certain species of Eucalyptus plants and losses in biodiversity. To date, annual maps of Eucalyptus plantations at large scales with high spatial resolutions are not yet available. Here, we investigated the spectral properties of Eucalyptus plantations and developed a knowledge-based Eucalyptus plantation mapping algorithm. We produced annual maps of Eucalyptus plantation at 10-m spatial resolution in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), China, using our proposed algorithm and images of ALOS PALSAR-2, Sentinel-2, and Landsat (ETM+/OLI) in a single year. First, we generated annual evergreen forest maps using PALSAR-2 and Landsat/Sentinel-2-based vegetation index time series data. Second, we distinguished Eucalyptus plantations from the evergreen forest layer using the unique biophysical features of Eucalyptus plantations, the Sentinel-2 red edge bands, and Landsat/Sentinel-2based enhanced vegetation index (EVI). Our resultant 2020 Eucalyptus plantation map had high producer's, user's, and overall accuracies of 0.85, 0.89, and 0.96, respectively. There were 3.10 x 106 ha of Eucalyptus plantation in Guangxi in 2020. Among the 14 administrative units, Wuzhou City had the largest Eucalyptus plantation area in Guangxi, followed by Nanning, Baise, and Chongzuo cities. We demonstrated the potential of knowledge-based mapping approaches for identifying evergreen forest and Eucalyptus plantations in complex and fragmented landscapes where cloud cover is frequent. Our 10-m Eucalyptus plantation map is the most current dataset available and can be used to assist the sustainable production of Eucalyptus, ecological assessments, and conservation.

TI  - Coarse spatial resolution remote sensing data with AVHRR and MODIS miss the greening area compared with the Landsat data in Chinese drylands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The warming-wetting climates in Chinese drylands, together with a series of ecological engineering projects, had caused apparent changes to vegetation therein. Regarding the vegetation greening trend, different remote sensing data had yielded distinct findings. It was critical to evaluate vegetation dynamics in Chinese drylands using a series of remote sensing data. By comparing the three most commonly used remote sensing datasets [i.e., MODIS, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and Landsat], this study comprehensively investigated vegetation dynamics for Chinse drylands. All three remote sensing datasets exhibited evident vegetation greening trends from 2000 to 2020 in Chinese drylands, especially in the Loess Plateau and Northeast China. However, Landsat identified the largest greening areas (89.8%), while AVHRR identified the smallest greening area (58%). The vegetation greening areas identified by Landsat comprise more small patches than those identified by MODIS and AVHRR. The MODIS data exhibited a higher consistency with Landsat than with AVHRR in terms of detecting vegetation greening areas. The three datasets exhibited high consistency in identifying vegetation greening in Northeast China, Loess Plateau, and Xinjiang. The percentage of inconsistent areas among the three datasets was 39.56%. The vegetation greening areas identified by Landsat comprised more small patches. Sensors and the atmospheric effect are the two main reasons responsible for the different outputs from each NDVI product. Ecological engineering projects had a great promotion effect on vegetation greening, which can be detected by the three NDVI datasets in Chinese drylands, thereby combating desertification and reducing dust storms.

TI  - Monitoring and analysis of ground subsidence in Shanghai based on PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR technologies
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shanghai is susceptible to land subsidence due to its unique geological environment and frequent human activities. Traditional leveling techniques are not sufficient for monitoring large areas of land subsidence due to the time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive nature of the process. Furthermore, the results of conventional methods may not be timely, rendering them ineffective for monitoring purposes. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology is a widely used method for monitoring ground subsidence due to its low cost, high efficiency, and ability to cover large areas. To monitor the surface sink condition of Shanghai over the past 2 years, monitoring data were obtained through the technical processing of 24 images from Sentinel-1A data covering Shanghai from 2019 to 2020 using the Persistent Scatterer (PS-InSAR) and Small Baseline Subset (SBAS-InSAR) technique. The ground subsidence (GS) results were extracted via PS and SBAS interferometry processing, while Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data were used to correct the residual phase. According to PS and SBAS methods, the maximum ground subsidence in the study area reached 99.8 mm and 47.2 mm, respectively. The subsidence rate and the accumulated amount of subsidence derived from the monitoring results revealed the urban area in Shanghai to be principally characterized by uneven GS, with multiple settlement funnels being found to be distributed across the main urban area. Moreover, when compared with the historical subsidence data, geological data, and urban construction distribution data, the individual settlement funnels were observed to correspond to those data concerning the historical surface settlement funnel in Shanghai. By randomly selecting GS time-series data regarding three feature points, it was determined that the morphological variables of the GS remained largely consistent at all time points and that their change trends exhibited a high degree of consistency, which verified the reliability of the PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR monitoring method. The results can provide data support for decision making in terms of geological disaster prevention and control in Shanghai.

TI  - Change in Antarctic ice shelf area from 2009 to 2019
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic ice shelves provide buttressing support to the ice sheet, stabilising the flow of grounded ice and its contribution to global sea levels. Over the past 50 years, satellite observations have shown ice shelves collapse, thin, and retreat; however, there are few measurements of the Antarctic-wide change in ice shelf area. Here, we use MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data to measure the change in ice shelf calving front position and area on 34 ice shelves in Antarctica from 2009 to 2019. Over the last decade, a reduction in the area on the Antarctic Peninsula (6693 km(2)) and West Antarctica (5563 km(2)) has been outweighed by area growth in East Antarctica (3532 km(2)) and the large Ross and Ronne-Filchner ice shelves (14 028 km(2)). The largest retreat was observed on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, where 5917 km(2) of ice was lost during an individual calving event in 2017, and the largest area increase was observed on Ronne Ice Shelf in East Antarctica, where a gradual advance over the past decade (535 km(2) yr(-1)) led to a 5889 km(2) area gain from 2009 to 2019. Overall, the Antarctic ice shelf area has grown by 5305 km(2) since 2009, with 18 ice shelves retreating and 16 larger shelves growing in area. Our observations show that Antarctic ice shelves gained 661 Gt of ice mass over the past decade, whereas the steady-state approach would estimate substantial ice loss over the same period, demonstrating the importance of using time-variable calving flux observations to measure change.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in canine mast cell tumours using a preoperative radiographic indirect lymphography: Technique description and results in 138 cases
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Several sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping techniques, to detect nodal metastasis in canine tumours have been investigated in the last 10 years in veterinary oncology. The purpose of this prospective study was to describe a reliable, quick, and inexpensive technique for SLN mapping in canine patients affected by cutaneous and subcutaneous mast cell tumours (MCT). Eighty dogs were enrolled in this study for a total of 138 cytologically diagnosed MCTs. Sentinel lymph node mapping was performed by injecting iomeprole peritumorally followed by serial radiographs at 1, 3, 6 and 9-min post injection. A total of 168 SLNs were detected, 90% at first radiograph, 1 min after the peritumoral iomeprole injection, while in the rest of the cases SLN was identified at 3 min. Sentinel lymph nodes detected by the preoperative radiographic indirect lymphography with iomeprole (PRILI) differed from regional lymph nodes in 57% of cases. The PRILI technique detected simultaneously multiple SLNs in the 26% of cases and multiple lymph centers in the 31% of MCTs. To allow the surgical identification of the SLNs, a peritumoral injection of methylene blue was performed at the time of surgery. This study reports a widely available technique for SLN mapping using digital radiographs in combination with a water-soluble medium, representing a cost-effective alternative to other SLN mapping procedures. Based on our results, this technique can be effective for SLNs mapping in dogs with MCTs but further comparative studies are needed to assess its reliability and efficacy in different tumours.

TI  - Melt rates in the kilometer-size grounding zone of Petermann Glacier, Greenland, before and during a retreat.
T2  - Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Warming of the ocean waters surrounding Greenland plays a major role in driving glacier retreat and the contribution of glaciers to sea level rise. The melt rate at the junction of the ocean with grounded ice-or grounding line-is, however, not well known. Here, we employ a time series of satellite radar interferometry data from the German TanDEM-X mission, the Italian COSMO-SkyMed constellation, and the Finnish ICEYE constellation to document the grounding line migration and basal melt rates of Petermann Glacier, a major marine-based glacier of Northwest Greenland. We find that the grounding line migrates at tidal frequencies over a kilometer-wide (2 to 6 km) grounding zone, which is one order of magnitude larger than expected for grounding lines on a rigid bed. The highest ice shelf melt rates are recorded within the grounding zone with values from 60 ± 13 to 80 ± 15 m/y along laterally confined channels. As the grounding line retreated by 3.8 km in 2016 to 2022, it carved a cavity about 204 m in height where melt rates increased from 40 ± 11 m/y in 2016 to 2019 to 60 ± 15 m/y in 2020 to 2021. In 2022, the cavity remained open during the entire tidal cycle. Such high melt rates concentrated in kilometer-wide grounding zones contrast with the traditional plume model of grounding line melt which predicts zero melt. High rates of simulated basal melting in grounded glacier ice in numerical models will increase the glacier sensitivity to ocean warming and potentially double projections of sea level rise.

TI  - Assessing ocean ensemble drift predictions by comparison with observed oil slicks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Geophysical models are cornerstone pieces in marine forecasting of floating objects and pollution, such as marine surface oil slicks. Trajectory forecasts of oil spills inherit the uncertainties from the underlying geophysical forcing. In this work we compare the forecast capabilities of an ocean ensemble prediction system (EPS) to those from a higher resolution deterministic model on the representation of oil slick drift. As reference, we use produced water (PW) slicks detected and delineated from 41 C-band Sentinel-1A/B satellite synthetic aperture radar images between April and December, 2021. We found that the EPS provided at least equivalent member-wise results relative to simulations forced with the deterministic model. Ensemble verification through rank histograms and spread-error relationship showed that including the ocean fields is necessary to address model uncertainties. Whether considering the ocean field or not, the modeled slicks were counterclockwise rotated between 20 degrees and 30 degrees relative to the ones observed in the satellite images, and these were deflected about 45 degrees to the right of the observed wind direction.

TI  - Measurement of extracapsular extension in sentinel lymph node as a possible predictor of residual axillary disease in breast cancer
T2  - CLINICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The presence of Extracapsular Extension (ECE) in the Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) is still a doubt in the literature. Some studies suggest that the presence of ECE may be related to a greater number of posi-tive axillary lymph nodes which could impact Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS). This study searches for the clinical significance of the ECE.Methods: Retrospective cohort comparing the presence or absence of ECE in T1-2 invasive breast cancer with posi-tive SLNB. All cases treated surgically at the Cancer Institute of the State of Sa not similar to o Paulo (ICESP) between 2009 and 2013 were analyzed. All patients with axillary disease in SLNB underwent AD.Outcomes: Identify the association between the presence and length of ECE and additional axillary positive lymph nodes, OS and DFS between both groups.Results: 128 patients with positive SLNB were included, and 65 had ECE. The mean metastasis size of 0.62 (SD = 0.59) mm at SLNB was related to the presence of ECE (p < 0.008). The presence of ECE was related to a higher mean of positive sentinel lymph nodes, 3.9 (+/- 4.8) vs. 2.0 (+/- 2.1), p = 0.001. The median length of fol-low-up was 115 months. The OS and DFS rates had no differences between the groups.Conclusion:The presence of ECE was associated with additional positive axillary lymph nodes in this study. There-fore, the OS and DFS were similar in both groups after 10 years of follow-up. It is necessary for additional studies to define the importance of AD when SLNB with ECE.

TI  - Capacity of Urban Green Infrastructure Spaces to Ameliorate Heat Wave Impacts in Mediterranean Compact Cities: Case Study of Granada (South-Eastern Spain)
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Heat wave episodes are becoming more frequent and severe worldwide, especially in areas such as the Mediterranean region. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of heat waves in an urban environment and the ways areas of urban green infrastructure (UGI) can play key roles in moderating the impacts of these high-temperature events. We analyzed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data retrieved from Landsat 8/9 satellite images. These data were recorded during heat wave episodes from 2017 to 2022 in a representative Mediterranean medium-sized compact city. We carried out a correlation analysis between LST and NDVI per area type and as individual units to assess how UGI elements can contribute to the cooling of the urban matrix during heat wave episodes. Those small green spaces distributed throughout the city, defined as "Other" areas, showed stronger negative correlation. These spaces are particularly relevant for Mediterranean cities, where highly limited space in city centers hinders the possibility of having larger-surface UGI elements. The study highlights the need for further research into the composition of those small public green spaces to understand how their components enhance the city's cooling capacity given the climate conditions and water scarcity in the Mediterranean region.

TI  - Effect of landscape pattern of urban surface evapotranspiration on land surface temperature
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surfaces in urban areas can be classified into artificial surfaces (impervious surface such as buildings and roads) and natural surfaces (vegetation, soil and water), and the natural surfaces have important influence on the urban environmental thermal regulation. Current research on urban spatial characteristics mostly focuses on the regulation of urban green spaces to mitigate the urban heat island effect and rarely explores the effect of the landscape pattern of urban natural surface evapotranspiration (ET) on land surface temperature (LST). Xuzhou, China, was selected as the study area, and the urban RS-PM and improved mono-window algorithm were applied to invert ET and LST values based on Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor images, respectively. The study area was divided into five levels (LV5 to LV1) from high to weak, according to the ET intensity (ETi), four landscape-level (SHDI, SHEI, PD, and CONTAGION) and five class-level landscape metrics (PLAND, LPI, LSI, AI, and COHESION) were extracted based on the moving-window approach. Bivariate Moran's I was then used to calculate the spatial correlation between each landscape metric and LST. The weighted impact of each landscape metric on LST was obtained using principal component analysis and multiple regression. The results indicate that only five class-level metrics of high (LV5) and sub-high (LV4) ETi patches had significant negative spatial correlations with LST, and the weighted impacts of the high ETi patch metrics were all greater than those of the sub-high ETi patches. The weighted impacts of all class-level metrics that can mitigate LST were ranked as COHESION_LV5 > PLAND_LV5 > LPI_LV5 approximate to AI_LV5 > LSI_LV5 > LSI_LV4 > PLAND_LV4 > COHESION_LV4 > LPI_LV4 > AI_LV4. These findings revealed the importance of ET spatial pattern for urban thermal environment regulation, which may provide a new perspective in urban planning and environmental governance.

TI  - Arctic sea ice drift fields extraction based on feature tracking to MODIS imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate-resolution optical imagery holds great potential in deriving Arctic sea ice drift fields because of its higher resolution than microwave radiometers and scatterometers, as well as its larger swath widths than most other optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. However, the application of such imagery is hindered by cloud influences and a lack of texture. In this study, we propose a method of deriving Arctic sea ice drift fields based on applying feature tracking to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery. To enhance the quality of the feature tracking step, a bundle of digital image processing techniques is first introduced, including histogram equalization which is based on the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the sea ice area, and Laplacian filtering which enhances image texture. Various MODIS bands and A-KAZE parameter settings are subsequently compared to balance the quality of sea ice drifting fields and calculation efficiency. Three pairs of MODIS images observed in different zones of the Arctic Ocean are selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. International Arctic Buoy Programme (IABP) buoy data are employed for validating the derived drift vectors with MODIS imagery. The results show that our proposed method effectively increases the number of vectors and their coverage rates of the sea ice drift fields extracted with MODIS images. The coverage rates of sea ice drift fields in three regions increase from 4.8%, 2.3%, and 2.5% to 56.5%, 23.5%, and 53.0% compared to using the A-KAZE algorithm directly, respectively. The MAEs of the derived sea ice motion vectors are 707 m/d in speed and 6.4 degrees in direction, superior to the sea ice drift products based on the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. The proposed method enables MODIS and other medium-resolution optical data to be utilized in deriving Arctic sea ice drift fields, which is of great significance to the long-term and large-scale Arctic environment, climate, and oceanography research in the future.

TI  - Time series temperature anomalies for earthquake prediction using remote sensing techniques: A case study of five major earthquakes in pakistan's history
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The earthquakes prediction based on LST anomalies remain a contradicting debate due to limited and short-term data around the earthquake's epicenter. The results are varying in different case studies, only few research matches with pre seismic LST anomalies while many are not found to be significant for earthquakes predication. This study assessed temperature anomalies in different earthquakes events of Mw > 6.0 in Pakistan from 2000 to 2020. The present study uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite thermal imagery data over the epicenter region to analyze thermal anomaly associated and earthquake prediction. The surface temperature growth before the earthquake event is estimated using the satellite thermal infrared images carrying valuable earthquake precursory information. The study area Pakistan is prone to active seismicity due to Northern Head-on Collision of Indian-and Eurasian plate; Southern Makran Subduction Zone of Indian and Arabian plate and the regional Chaman transform boundary. The results show pre seismic temperature variation range between 30 degrees C - 54 degrees C, which seems to be a good prospect for linking thermal anomalies to earthquake prediction.(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - Fire in highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome, a burned areas time series analysis and its correlation with the legislation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire has been an intrinsic ecological component of the ecosystems, affecting the public, economic, and socio-cultural policies of human-nature interactions. Using fire over grassland vegetation is a traditional practice for livestock in the highland grasslands and has economic and environmental consequences that have not yet been understood. A better description of the spatio-temporal biomass burning patterns is needed to analyze the effects of creation and application in these areas. This study used remote sensing techniques based on Sentinel-2 data and machine learning algorithms to identify burning scars and compare them with a national fire collection database for the highland grasslands in the Atlantic Forest Biome in Brazil. The aim is to evaluate public management tools and legislation evolution during the 35 years of the time series analyzed. The results indicated that 12,285 ha of grasslands were converted to other uses, losing about 24% of their original formation, with 10% occurring after banned this practice in 2008. The burned areas classification using the Random Forest algorithm obtained an AUC = 0.9983. Divergences in the burned area's extent and frequency were found between the municipality's authorized license and those classified as burned. On average, only 43% of the burned area in the Parque Estadual do Tainhas and its buffer zone had an environmental permit in the last 5 years. This research's results provide subsidies for revising and creating public policies and consequently help territorial management.

TI  - Satellite remote-sensing capability to assess tropospheric-column ratios of formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide: case study during the Long Island SoundTropospheric Ozone Study 2018 (LISTOS 2018) field campaign
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite retrievals of tropospheric-column formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are frequently used to investigate the sensitivity of ozone (O-3) production to emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic carbon compounds. This study inter-compared the systematic biases and uncertainties in retrievals of NO2 and HCHO, as well as resulting HCHO-NO2 ratios (FNRs), from two commonly applied satellite sensors to investigate O-3 production sensitivities (Ozone Monitoring Instrument, OMI, and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) using airborne remote-sensing data taken during the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study 2018 between 25 June and 6 September 2018. Compared to aircraft-based HCHO and NO2 observations, the accuracy of OMI and TROPOMI were magnitude-dependent with high biases in clean environments and a tendency towards more accurate comparisons to even low biases in moderately polluted to polluted regions. OMI and TROPOMI NO2 systematic biases were similar in magnitude (normalized median bias, NMB = 5 %-6 %; linear regression slope = 0.5-0.6), with OMI having a high median bias and TROPOMI resulting in small low biases. Campaignaveraged uncertainties in the three satellite retrievals (NASA OMI; Quality Assurance for Essential Climate Variables, QA4ECV OMI; and TROPOMI) of NO2 were generally similar, with TROPOMI retrievals having slightly less spread in the data compared to OMI. The three satellite products differed more when evaluating HCHO retrievals. Campaignaveraged tropospheric HCHO retrievals all had linear regression slopes similar to 0 :5 and NMBs of 39 %, 17 %, 13 %, and 23% for NASA OMI, QA4ECV OMI, and TROPOMI at finer (0 :05 degrees x 0 :05 degrees) and coarser (0 :15 degrees x 0 :15 degrees) spatial resolution, respectively. Campaign-averaged uncertainty values (root mean square error, RMSE) in NASA and QA4ECV OMI HCHO retrievals were similar to 9 :0 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) ( similar to 50 %-55% of mean column abundance), and the higher-spatial-resolution retrievals from TROPOMI resulted in RMSE values similar to 30% lower. Spatially averaging TROPOMI tropospheric-column HCHO, along with NO2 and FNRs, to resolutions similar to the OMI reduced the uncertainty in

TI  - Evaluation of near-surface air temperature reanalysis datasets and downscaling with machine learning based Random Forest method for complex terrain of Turkey
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Near-surface air temperature is a key variable used in a wide range of applications showing the environmental conditions of the Earth. Standard meteorological observations generally provide the best estimation with high accuracy over time for a small area of influence. However, considerable uncertainty arises when point measurements are extrapolated or interpolated over much larger areas. Satellite and reanalysis products have emerged as a viable alternative or supplement to in situ observations due to their availability over vast ungauged regions. Thus, spatial patterns of air temperature can be derived from these products. In this study, we evaluate the performance of several reanalysis products of near-surface air temperature to determine the best product in estimating daily and monthly air temperatures across the complex terrain of Turkey. European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis version 5 (ERA5), (AgERA5), (ERA5-Land), the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applica-tions version 2 (MERRA2), and the Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55) products are assessed with 1120 ground-based gauge stations for the period 2015-2019 over complex terrain having different climate classes according to Ko center dot ppen-Geiger classification scheme and land surface types. Moreover, several traditional and more sophisticated machine learning downscaling algorithms are applied to increase the products' spatial resolution. The agreement between ground observations and the different products and the downscaled temperature product is investigated by using a set of commonly employed statistical estimators of mean absolute error (MAE), corre-lation coefficient (CC), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and bias. Performance analysis of reanalysis air temperature products with ground-based observations on daily and monthly time series has shown that among the five datasets, the AgERA5 product is superior in estimating air temperature over Turkey, both seasonally and annually. Compared to the other datasets, ERA5 and ERA5-Land show similar performance and reach the second highest performance score at both daily and monthly time steps. In terms of improving product performance with spatial downscaling, among the distance -based methods, the best overall performance is obtained by bicubic interpolation with a slight increase in the product performance in monthly and daily time series. However, depending on the season, the Random Forest algorithm's performance is far superior to all other methods used in this study. (c) 2023 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a 10-m resolution maize and soybean map over China: Matching satellite-based crop classification with sample-based area estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit information on crop distribution is essential for market information, food security, and agri-cultural sustainability. However, high-resolution crop maps are unavailable for most countries of the world. In this study, we developed an operational workflow and produced the first openly-available 10-m resolution maize and soybean map over China. We also derived area estimates for maize and soybean extent for 2019 using a stratified, two-stage, cluster sampling design and ground data collected for the entire country. We developed a multi-scale, multi-temporal procedure for mapping, in which field data were used as training to map maize and soybean over the first-stage sample of 10 km x 10 km equal-area blocks with PlanetScope and Sentinel-2 data. Then, the classified blocks were used as training to map maize and soybean for the country with wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data using a random forests approach. We used all available Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data ac-quired between April and October 2019, applied quality assurance, including cloud and shadow masking, and created monthly image composites as inputs for the random forests analysis. We derived maize and soybean area estimates using the field sample data and a regression estimator. Utilizing the probability output layer of the random forests models, we found and applied empirical probability thresholds that matched map-based crop area estimates with sample-based area estimates. Maize area in China in 2019 was estimated to be 330,609 +/- 34,109 km2 (+/- value is the standard error), and soybean area was estimated to be 78,107 +/- 12,969 km2. Validated using the field sample data as reference, our crop map had an overall accuracy of 91.8 +/- 1.2%. The user's and pro-ducer's accuracies for the maize class were 93.9 +/- 2.5% and 79.2 +/- 3.6%, and for the soybean class were 63.6 +/- 12.1% and 61.9 +/- 11.8%. Our map-based maize and soybean area estimates had close agreement with gov-ernment reports at the provincial and prefectural levels, with r2 of 0.90 and 0.92 for maize, and 0.93 and 0.94 for soybean, respectively. Our workflow can generate internally consistent results for crop area estimation and crop mapping simultaneously. As Sentinel-2 data are being acquired consistently and very-high-resolution commercial satellite data are increasingly available, our established workflow may be applied in an operational setting for annual crop mapping in China and other countries.

TI  - Mountain Glacier Flow Velocity Retrieval from Ascending and Descending Sentinel-1 Data Using the Offset Tracking and MSBAS Technique: A Case Study of the Siachen Glacier in Karakoram from 2017 to 2021
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar images have recently been utilized in glacier surface flow velocity research due to their continuously improving imaging technology, which increases the resolution and scope of research. In this study, we employed the offset tracking and multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) technique to extract the surface flow velocity of the Siachen Glacier from 253 Sentinel-1 images. From 2017 to 2021, the Siachen Glacier had an average flow velocity of 38.25 m a(-1), with the highest flow velocity of 353.35 m a(-1) located in the upper part of a tributary due to the steep slope and narrow valley. The inter-annual flow velocity fluctuations show visible seasonal patterns, with the highest flow velocity observed between May and July and the lowest between December and January. Mass balance calculated by the geodetic method based on AST14DEM indicates that the Siachen Glacier experienced a positive mass change (0.07 +/- 0.23 m w.e. a(-1)) between 2008 and 2021. However, there was significant spatial heterogeneity revealed in the distribution, with surface elevation changes showing a decrease in the glacier tongue while thickness increased in two other western tributaries of the Siachen Glacier. The non-surface parallel flow component is correlated with the strain rate and mass balance process, and correlation analysis indicates a positive agreement between these two variables. Therefore, using glacier flow velocities obtained from the SAR approach, we can evaluate the health of the glacier and obtain crucial factors for the glacier's dynamic model. Two western tributaries of the Siachen Glacier experienced mass gain in the past two decades, necessitating close monitoring of flow velocity changes in the future to detect potential glacier surges.

TI  - MCSTNet: a memory-contextual spatiotemporal transfer network for prediction of SST sequences and fronts with remote sensing data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean fronts are a response to the variabilities of marine hydrographic elements and are an important mesoscale ocean phenomenon, playing a significant role in fish farming and fishing, sea-air exchange, marine environmental protection, etc. The horizontal gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) are frequently applied to reveal ocean fronts. Up to now, existing spatiotemporal prediction approaches have suffered from low prediction precision and poor prediction quality for non-stationary data, particularly for long-term prediction. It is a challenging task for medium- and long-term fine-grained prediction for SST sequences and fronts in oceanographic research. In this study, SST sequences and fronts are predicted for future variation trends based on continuous mean daily remote sensing satellite of SST data. To enhance the precision of the predicted SST sequences and fronts, this paper proposes a novel memory-contextual spatiotemporal transfer network (MCSTNet) for SST sequence and front predictions. MCSTNet involves three components: the encoder-decoder structure, a time transfer module, and a memory-contextual module. The encoder-decoder structure is used to extract the rich contextual and semantic information in SST sequences and frontal structures from the SST data. The time transfer module is applied to transfer temporal information and fuse low-level, fine-grained temporal information with high-level semantic information to improve medium- and long-term prediction precision. And the memory-contextual module is employed to fuse low-level, spatiotemporal information with high-level semantic information to enhance short-term prediction precision. In the training process, mean squared error (MSE) loss and contextual loss are combined to jointly guide the training of MCSTNet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCSTNet predicts more authentic and reasonable SST sequences and fronts than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on the SST data.

I identify DeVos's framing and lexical choices deployed to increase memory and attention salience, thereby highlighting the role words play in shaping political and cultural outcomes. Although the paper provides only a snapshot of DeVos's framing, the discussion is situated within a broader neoliberal discourse designed to manipulate public sense-making and trigger emotions through emotionally charged rhetoric. Through careful lexical choices, DeVos crafts a worldview for primary and secondary audiences that likewise informs macro-level educational narratives, policies, and practices.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICAL AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Satellite data transmissions are complex due to the various factors that intervene in them. Many institutions have opted for laser communications in search of high data transmission rates, reduced size and weight, lower costs, and low power consumption, unlike radio-frequency communications. However, optical links require tremendously precise pointing and tracking since poor pointing can yield connection errors. Thus, fine pointing is required, with the ability to redirect the transceptor with exceptionally delicate motions, allowing a stable link within the sight window. In this work, the development of a pointing, acquisition, and tracking subsystem consisting of a computer vision system is presented, capable of recognising and detecting a guide beam emitted by an optical ground station, together with a fuzzy logic controller for servomotors to perform the tracking phase. The fine-pointing system was implemented on a printed circuit board for a trouble-free and adequate interface to communicate with any microprocessor. The outcome shows that the system can follow and identify the indicated beam amongst many other light sources at short and long distances. Likewise, the pointing accuracy was found to be within the same order of magnitude as the minimum required, showing that an onboard active tracking system for laser communications within a CubeSat is feasible. Ultimately, this research serves as an alternative method for the future development of affordable narrow-beam tracking systems for nanosatellite applications.

TI  - A critical review on the state-of-the-art and future prospects of machine learning for Earth observation operations
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - The continuing Machine Learning (ML) revolution indubitably has had a significant positive impact on the analysis of downlinked satellite data. Other aspects of the Earth Observation industry, despite being less susceptible to widespread application of Machine Learning, are also following this trend. These applications, actual use cases, possible prospects and difficulties, as well as anticipated research gaps, are the focus of this review of Machine Learning applied to Earth Observation Operations. A wide range of topics are covered, including mission planning, fault diagnosis, fault prognosis and fault repair, optimization of telecommunications, enhanced GNC, on-board image processing, and the use of Machine Learning models on platforms with constrained compute and power capa-bilities, as well as recommendations in the respective areas of research. The review tackles all on-board and off-board applications of machine learning to Earth Observation with one notable exception: it omits all post-processing of payload data on the ground, a topic that has been studied extensively by past authors. In addition, this review article discusses the standardization of Machine Learning (i.e., Guidelines and Roadmaps), as well as the challenges and recommendations in Earth Observation operations for the purpose of building better space missions.(c) 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Hot or not? Investigating radiation safety and policy updating for the appropriate storage of radioactive specimens at Mount Sinai Hospital
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: The current hospital policy for this study is stringent re-garding the storage of radioactive sentinel lymph node (SLN) speci-mens, which requires the storage time of 24 hours before being han-dled by Pathology. Additional labeling along with separate contain-ment of these specimens can be forgone if negligible radiation levels are found. The objective of this study was to determine whether the storage time needed for resected radioactive breast and primary site specimens to decay to twice the background radiation levels is less than 24 hours. Methods: The investigators retrieved breast and primary site SLN specimens from the Pathology department on the same day of the biopsy. A dose calibrator was used to measure the dose, specimen, and concurrent background radioactivity in Megabecquerels (MBq). Radioactive decay calculations were used to further investigate when specimen activities reached twice the background levels. A retrospec-tive analysis was performed using a one-sample t-test to determine if the time to reach double the background activity was significantly dif-ferent from 24 hours. This study pertained to workflow optimization; thus, general procedure consent forms were sufficient. Both patient confidentiality and privacy were protected. The investigators followed the necessary radiation safety measures. Results: The mean time for specimens to reach twice the background level of radioactivity was 3.99 hours, significantly less than current storage time of 24 hours (p < 0.001). The mean time point for the SLNs to reach 1/16th of the original activity was 7.78 hours (p < 0.001). The average node activity was 0.14 MBq. Conclusion: The average sentinel node activity was less than 1 ex-emption quantity and the time to reach less than twice the background levels was significantly less than 24 hours, meaning that radioactive la-bels are not needed, and the 24-hour overnight specimen storage can be mitigated.

TI  - SAR Interferometry Data Exploitation for Infrastructure Monitoring Using GIS Application
T2  - INFRASTRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring structural stability in urban areas and infrastructure networks is emerging as one of the dominant socio-economic issues for population security. The problem is accentuated by the age of the infrastructure because of increasing risks due to material deterioration and loss of load capacity. In this case, SAR satellite data are crucial to identify and assess the deteriorating conditions of civil infrastructures. The large amount of data available from SAR satellite sensors leads to the exploitation and development of new GIS-based procedures for rapid responses and decision making. In recent decades, the DInSAR technique has been used efficiently for the monitoring of structures, providing measurement points located on structures with millimeter precision. Our study has analyzed the behavior of structures in settlements, attempting to discuss the interactions of soil and structures, and examining the behavior of different types of structures, such as roads and buildings. The method used is based on long-term SAR interferometry data and a semi-automatic procedure to measure the displacement (mm/year) of structures, through a GIS-based application performed in the "Implemented MOnitoring DIsplacement" I.MODI platform. The analysis provides extensive information on long-term spatial and temporal continuity of up to 25 years of record, using satellite SAR multi-sensors from ERS, Envisat, and COSMO-SkyMed. The interpretation uses time series spatial analysis, supported by orthophotos, and layers of the DBTR (regional topographic database), Digital Surface model (DSM), and hydrogeological map to show anomalous areas with a high displacement rate and to observe the correlation of settlements in the sediments. With the satellite information and Geographic Information System (GIS), we were able to observe relevant parameters, such as the velocity of advance in the direction of the slope (deformation profiles), the cumulative displacement, and the trend changes in structures. The results illustrate an innovative procedure that allows the management of DInSAR data to facilitate the effective management of structures in which a monitoring protocol was developed at different spatial scales, integrating the information into a GIS.

TI  - Improving Detection of Changepoints in Short and Noisy Time Series with Local Correlations: Connecting the Events in Pixel Neighbourhoods
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting changepoints in time series becomes difficult when the series are short and the observation variance is high. In the context of time series of environmental resource maps, it is often safe to assume that the abrupt events are spatially continuous, and so are the changepoints. We propose to utilise this assumption by means of hierarchical models where the changepoints are modelled using a spatial model. We demonstrate utility of the approach by constructing a Bayesian model based on the Potts model, with additional assumptions relevant to changepoint detection in national multi-source forest inventory maps. We discuss implementation issues and demonstrate the idea's performance using a simulation study. We then apply the model to forest resource maps in order to detect felling events.

TI  - Application of Machine Learning to Tree Species Classification Using Active and Passive Remote Sensing: A Case Study of the Duraer Forestry Zone
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The technology of remote sensing-assisted tree species classification is increasingly developing, but the rapid refinement of tree species classification on a large scale is still challenging. As one of the treasures of ecological resources in China, Arxan has 80% forest cover, and tree species classification surveys guarantee ecological environment management and sustainable development. In this study, we identified tree species in three samples within the Arxan Duraer Forestry Zone based on the spectral, textural, and topographic features of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral remote sensing imagery and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data as classification variables to distinguish among birch, larch, and nonforest areas. The best extracted classification variables were combined to compare the accuracy of the random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and classification and regression tree (CART) methodologies for classifying species into three sample strips in the Arxan Duraer Forestry Zone. Furthermore, the effect on the overall classification results of adding a canopy height model (CHM) was investigated based on spectral and texture feature classification combined with field measurement data to improve the accuracy. The results showed that the overall accuracy of the RF was 79%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.63. After adding the CHM extracted from the point cloud data, the overall accuracy was improved by 7%, and the kappa coefficient increased to 0.75. The overall accuracy of the CART model was 78%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.63; the overall accuracy of the SVM was 81%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.67; and the overall accuracy of the RF was 86%, and the kappa coefficient was 0.75. To verify whether the above results can be applied to a large area, Google Earth Engine was used to write code to extract the features required for classification from Sentinel-2 multispectral and radar topographic data (create equivalent conditions), and six tree species and one nonforest in the study area were classified using RF, with an overall accuracy of 0.98, and a kappa coefficient of 0.97. In this paper, we mainly integrate active and passive remote sensing data for forest surveying and add vertical data to a two-dimensional image to form a three-dimensional scene. The main goal of the research is not only to find schemes to improve the accuracy of tree species classification, but also to apply the results to large-scale areas. This is necessary to improve the time-consuming and labor-intensive traditional forest survey methods and to ensure the accuracy and reliability of survey data.

TI  - Exceptional stratospheric contribution to human fingerprints on atmospheric temperature
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In 1967, scientists used a simple climate model to predict that human-caused increases in atmospheric CO2 should warm Earth's troposphere and cool the stratosphere. This important signature of anthropogenic climate change has been documented in weather balloon and satellite temperature measurements extending from near-surface to the lower stratosphere. Stratospheric cooling has also been confirmed in the mid to upper stratosphere, a layer extending from roughly 25 to 50 km above the Earth's surface (S25-50). To date, however, S25-50 temperatures have not been used in pattern based attribution studies of anthropogenic climate change. Here, we perform such a "fingerprint" study with satellite-derived patterns of temperature change that extend from the lower troposphere to the upper stratosphere. Including S25-50 information increases signal-to-noise ratios by a factor of five, markedly enhancing fingerprint detectability. Key features of this global-scale human fingerprint include stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming at all latitudes, with stratospheric cooling amplifying with height. In contrast, the dominant modes of internal variability in S25-50 have smaller-scale temperature changes and lack uniform sign. These pronounced spatial differences between S25-50 signal and noise patterns are accompanied by large cooling of S25-50 (1 to 2 degrees C over 1986 to 2022) and low S25-50 noise levels. Our results explain why extending "vertical fingerprinting" to the mid to upper stratosphere yields incontrovertible evidence of human effects on the thermal structure of Earth's atmosphere.

TI  - Strong Anthropogenic Cloud Perturbations Can Persist for Multiple Days
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using geostationary satellite data, we show that strong cloud perturbations downwind of isolated continental anthropogenic aerosol sources can live for multiple days, and 7% of tracks live longer than 48 hr. The median lifetime for polluted cloud tracks in Eastern Europe studied using Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager data is 18 hr but shows a strongly skewed distribution toward longer lifetimes. This suggests that ship-track-like cloud perturbations help infer causal relationships between aerosols and clouds. Strong anthropogenic cloud perturbations are usually visible until favorable liquid-water low-level clouds exist. Only in 12% of cases do liquid-phase stratiform clouds persist, but tracks disappear. Longer-lived tracks occur in anticyclonic conditions, and in case of statically very stable lower troposphere and low relative humidity above clouds.

TI  - Using Baidu Index Data to Improve Chickenpox Surveillance in Yunnan, China: Infodemiology Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chickenpox is an old but easily neglected infectious disease. Although chickenpox is preventable by vaccines, vaccine breakthroughs often occur, and the chickenpox epidemic is on the rise. Chickenpox is not included in the list of regulated communicable diseases that must be reported and controlled by public and health departments; therefore, it is crucial to rapidly identify and report varicella outbreaks during the early stages. The Baidu index (BDI) can supplement the traditional surveillance system for infectious diseases, such as brucellosis and dengue, in China. The number of reported chickenpox cases and internet search data also showed a similar trend. BDI can be a useful tool to display the outbreak of infectious diseases.Objective: This study aimed to develop an efficient disease surveillance method that uses BDI to assist in traditional surveillance.Methods: Chickenpox incidence data (weekly from January 2017 to June 2021) reported by the Yunnan Province Center for Disease Control and Prevention were obtained to evaluate the relationship between the incidence of chickenpox and BDI. We applied a support vector machine regression (SVR) model and a multiple regression prediction model with BDI to predict the incidence of chickenpox. In addition, we used the SVR model to predict the number of chickenpox cases from June 2021 to the first week of April 2022.Results: The analysis showed that there was a close correlation between the weekly number of newly diagnosed cases and the BDI. In the search terms we collected, the highest Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.747. Most BDI search terms, such as "chickenpox," "chickenpox treatment," "treatment of chickenpox," "chickenpox symptoms," and "chickenpox virus," trend consistently. Some BDI search terms, such as "chickenpox pictures," "symptoms of chickenpox," "chickenpox vaccine," and "is chickenpox vaccine necessary," appeared earlier than the trend of "chickenpox virus." The 2 models were compared, the SVR model performed better in all the applied measurements: fitting effect, R-2=0.9108, root mean square error (RMSE)=96.2995, and mean absolute error (MAE)=73.3988; and prediction effect, R-2=0.548, RMSE=189.1807, and MAE=147.5412. In addition, we applied the SVR model to predict the number of reported cases weekly in Yunnan from June 2021 to April 2022 using the same period of the BDI. The results showed that the fluctuation of the time series from July 2021 to April 2022 was similar to that of the last year and a half with no change in the level of prevention and control.Conclusions: These findings indicated that the BDI in Yunnan Province can predict the incidence of chickenpox in the same period. Thus, the BDI is a useful tool for monitoring the chickenpox epidemic and for complementing traditional monitoring systems.

TI  - A new index for assessing the coastal wind disasters based on the HY-2 satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical cyclone disasters have a substantial impact on human activity in coastal zones. The traditional methods used to classify wind disasters include the Beaufort Scale, Saffir-Simpson Scale, and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Hurricane Index (CMEHI). This research established a new index, the Haiyang Cyclone Index (HYCI), which considers spatial distributions and sea level anomalies (SLA) using HY-2 satellite data. The HYCI of three mega coastal cities, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, was calculated. A brief analysis was then performed using Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The proposed HYCI can accurately evaluate the impact of cyclone disasters, thereby confirming its financial application potential.

TI  - Local Climate Zone Classification by Seasonal and Diurnal Satellite Observations: An Integration of Daytime Thermal Infrared Multispectral Imageries and High-Resolution Night-Time Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, rapid, and automatic local climate zone (LCZ) mapping is essential for urban climatology and studies in terms of urban heat islands. Remotely sensed imageries incorporated with machine learning algorithms are widely utilized in LCZ labeling. Nevertheless, large-scale LCZ mapping is still challenging due to the complex vertical structure of underlying urban surfaces. This study proposed a new method of LCZ labeling that uses a random forest classifier and multi-source remotely sensed data, including Sentinel 1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument, and Luojia1-01 night-time light data. In particular, leaf-on and -off imageries and surface thermal dynamics were utilized to enhance LCZ labeling. Additionally, we systematically evaluated how daytime and night-time features influence the performance of the classification procedure. Upon examination, the results for Beijing, China, were confirmed to be robust and refined; the Overall Accuracy (OA) value of the proposed method was 88.86%. The accuracy of LCZs 1-9 was considerably increased when using the land surface temperature feature. Among these, the Producer Accuracy (PA) value of LCZ 3 (compact low-rise) significantly increased by 16.10%. Notably, it was found that NTL largely contributed to the classification concerning LCZ 3 (compact low-rise) and LCZ A/B (dense trees). The performance of integrating leaf-on and -off imageries for LCZ labeling was better than merely uses of leaf-on or -off imageries (the OA value increased by 4.75% compared with the single use of leaf-on imagery and by 3.62% with that of leaf-off imagery). Future studies that use social media big data and Very-High-Resolution imageries are required for LCZ mapping. This study shows that combining multispectral, SAR, and night-time light data can improve the performance of the random forest classifier in general, as these data sources capture significant information about surface roughness, surface thermal feature, and night-time features. Moreover, it is found that incorporating both leaf-on and leaf-off remotely sensed imageries can improve LCZ mapping.

TI  - Comparison genetic diversity and population structure of four <i>Pseudaspius leptocephalus</i> populations in Heilongjiang River Basin based on mitochondrial COI gene
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pseudaspius leptocephalus is a unique fish in the Heilongjiang River Basin and has important economic and ecological value. In the present study, the complete mitochondrial genome of P. leptocephalus were determined, and COI partial sequences of 85 individuals from Erguna river (EH), Mohe (MH), Fuyuan (FY), Hulan (HL) were used to evaluated the genetic diversity of four populations of P. leptocephalus in Heilongjiang River Basin. The mitogenome is 16,607 bp in length and contained one D-loop, 2 rRNA, 13 PCG, and 22 tRNA. 4 variable sites and 5 haplotypes were detected in 705 bp COI, and 705 bp COI exhibited a lower content of C + G (45.95%) than A + T (54.05%). The nucleotide diversity (pi) and haplotype diversity (h) indices ranged from 0.00027 (HL) to 0.00065 (EH and FY) and from 0.192 (HL) to 0.462 (EH), respectively. The genetic distance within the population and between populations ranged from 0.0006554 to 0.0002728 and from 0.0003541 to 0.0006974, respectively. Pairwise values of FST and Nm showed that there was moderate genetic differentiation between EH population and other populations and individuals between EH population and other populations can mate randomly (0.15 > FST > 0.05, Nm > 4). Significant negative values of neutrality tests (P < 0.05) indicated that MH and FY populations may had experienced population expansion, but mismatch distribution analysis suggested that all populations have remained basically stable. These results provide strong basis for the protection and utilization of P. leptocephalus germplasm resources, and provide valuable information for the population structure and genetic diversity of P. leptocephalus.

TI  - Evaluation of oceanic precipitable water vapor products from Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboard the Fengyun-3D satellite
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water vapor (PWV) products from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) onboard the Fengyun-3D (FY-3D), a second-generation polar orbit meteorological satellite of China, have a high spatiotemporal resolution and play an increasingly key role in the atmosphere and climate analysis. We focus on the FY-3D/MWRI PWV products in the global ocean area and comprehensively evaluate their quality by using the coastal radiosonde data from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive (IGRA) along with the PWV reanalysis products from the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric Reanalysis (ERA5). With respect to the radiosonde data, the correlation coefficient is 0.97, the root mean squared error (RMSE) is 2.71 mm, and the mean bias and mean relative bias is 0.36 mm and 2.57% respectively. The discrepancy between FY-3D/MWRI and radiosonde PWV is smallest at high latitudes and is biggest in the ocean around Africa. The seasonal variation characteristics perform best in spring and worst in summer. We also find that FY-3D/MWRI PWV products are in consistent with the ERA5 PWV, with a RMSE of 2.39 mm and 2.85 mm for daily and monthly data, respectively. Among globally 551,213 daily oceanic PWV grid data, there are 11.3% of matched points, which are mainly located between 15 degrees S and 30 degrees N latitudes, has a RMSE larger than 3 mm, while 68.5% of points have a RMSE of less than 2 mm, meeting the requirements of climate research.(c) 2023 COSPAR.

TI  - Monitoring and estimating coastal upwelling using Sentinel-3 satellite imagery (case study: The Caspian Sea)
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Delineation of upwelled zones is critical for the economy and physical processes of the coastal areas. The upwelling process is accompanied by vertical water motion, resulting in a surface with lower water temperature and increased chlorophyll-a contents (Chl-a). Since such patterns can be monitored using remote sensing technologies, this research investigates the potential of newly launched Sentinel-3 satellite imagery to gather information about the causes of summer upwelling in the Caspian Sea in 2017 and 2021. The upwelling spatial extent was determined using a Fuzzy C-means Clustering (FCM) approach. The UIwind index was also calculated to identify Ekman transport's involvement as an upwelling triggering factor. The results showed that during summer, the middle and south Caspian Sea had three upwelling cells, one in the eastern (cell 1) and two in the western regions (cells 2 and 3). FCM analysis revealed up to a 10 degrees C decline in SST, a 5 mg/m3 increase in Chl-a, and 70 km width during the upwelling events.

TI  - Semi-analytical inversion modelling of Chlorophyll a variability in the US Virgin Islands
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral reef health in the U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is in decline due to land-based sources of pollution associated with watershed development and global climate change. Water quality is a good indicator of stress in these nearshore environments as it plays a key role in determining the health and distribution of coral reef communities. Conventional water quality assessment methods based on in situ measurements are both time consuming and costly, and they lack the spatial coverage and temporal resolution that can be achieved using satellite remote sensing techniques. Water quality parameters (WQPs) such as Chlorophyll a (Chl-a), can be studied remotely using models that account for the inherent optical properties (IOPs) of the water. In this study, empirical based standard ocean color algorithm (OC4) and two semi-analytical algorithms, the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena (GSM) and the Generalized Inherent Optical Properties (GIOP) model, were evaluated in retrieving Chl-a in the nearshore waters of the USVI. GSM and GIOP were also evaluated for modeling inherent optical properties such as absorption coefficient of phytoplankton (aph (443)). Analysis of the results from each model using a field database from six cruises during May/June and December between 2016 and 2018, showed that the OC4 performed poorly with R2 of 0.14 and RMSE = 0.15. Effects of suspended particulates and benthic reflectance most likely contributed to the poor performance of the algorithm. GSM is a slightly better estimator for aph (443) and Chl-a (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 0.04; R2 = 0.60, RMSE = 0.09) than GIOP (R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 0.05; R2 = 0.17, RMSE = 0.15). Performance of the semi-analytical models are limited in estimating particulate back scattering (bbp (443)) also due to the benthic albedo effects in the shallow waters. The calibrated GSM model was applied to Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery spanning 2016-2018 to develop a time series of the spatial changes in Chl-a concentrations in the coastal waters of the USVI. The Landsat GSM Chl-a model produced promising results of R2 = 0.45, RMSE = 0.07, in an environment where signal-to-noise ratio is significantly low.

TI  - Sonophotocatalytic Degradation of Fast Yellow AB and Remazol Brilliant Violet-5R by Using Ag-Impregnated ZnO as a Photocatalyst
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The fundamental aimof this project was to assess the sonophotocatalyticdegradation of textile dyes mostly eluted from industries into wastewater.Such a pretreatment of wastewater makes the water suitable for drinkingand irrigation purposes and thereby helps protect the ecosystem. Themain objective of this research was to degrade real samples and laboratory-preparedsamples sonophotocatalytically using a silver-impregnated ZnO photocatalyst.Reactive dyes, including Fast Yellow AB (FY AB) and Remazol BrilliantViolet-5R (RBV-5R), were degraded via this technique under optimumand enhanced conditions. The photocatalyst was synthesized througha wet impregnation process and characterized by scanning electronmicroscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and UV/vis spectroscopy toexamine the morphology, composition, and functional groups of thephotocatalyst. Parameters including pH, dosage, dye concentration,scavengers, and effects of oxidizing agents were considered. Underoptimal conditions, the degradations were 95.7 and 88.9% for RBV-5Rand FY AB, respectively, in 60 min. The pH and oxidizing agents playedimportant roles in the degradation process. Only 43.8 and 32.5% ofRBV-5R and FY AB, respectively, were degraded in the absence of anoxidizing agent. With the addition of oxidizing agents, 95.7 and 88.9%of RBV-5R and FY AB degradation occurred, respectively. The optimalpH values for RBV 5-R and FY-AB were 8 and 12, respectively. A comparisonbetween the photocatalytic and sonophotocatalytic processes revealeddegradation efficiencies of 41 and 33% for RBV-5R and FY-AB, respectively,by the photocatalytic process. Therefore, results indicate the productivityof the sonophotocatalytic degradation process.

TI  - Adjacency effect correction of the GF-1 image in coastal waters of Hangzhou Bay and Taihu Lake, China
T2  - OPTICS CONTINUUM
M3  - Article
AB  - For coastal waters, the radiation signals received by the sensor are affected by the high reflectance of the coastal land, inducing reduced image contrast and significant adjacency effect. Eliminate the atmospheric attenuation and adjacency effect, and obtain the accurate remote sensing reflectance above water surface is an important prerequisite for the quantitative water color remote sensing. Based on the in situ spectral data of the coastal Hangzhou Bay, China on July 23, 2017 and the Taihu Lake, China on April 29, 2016, as well as the synchronous Gaofen-1 wide field-of-view camera (GF-1/ WFV) images, the 6S model was used to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation, and a point spread kernel function was used to correct the adjacency effect. The experimental results show that the images after adjacency effect correction are clearer, with increased image contrast and more abundant information of the water body. Compared to the atmospheric correction results only after the 6S model, the average relative errors of three in situ synchronous samples in Hangzhou Bay after adjacency effect correction are reduced by 8.39%, 10.81% and 7.29%, and that in Taihu Lake after adjacency effect correction are reduced by 10.8%, 5.24% and 0.39%, respectively. The adjacency effect correction improves the radiation detection accuracy of the remote sensing reflectance above water surface and can be a reference for quantitative water color remote sensing in coastal waters.

TI  - Vicarious Radiometric Calibration of the Multispectral Imager Onboard SDGSAT-1 over the Dunhuang Calibration Site, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The multispectral imager (MII), onboard the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1), performs detailed terrestrial change detection and coastal monitoring. SDGSAT-1 was launched at 2:19 UTC on 5 November 2021, as the world's first Earth science satellite to serve the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. A vicarious radiometric calibration experiment was conducted at the Dunhuang calibration site (Gobi Desert, China) on 14 December 2021. In-situ measurements of ground reflectance, aerosol optical depth (AOD), total columnar water vapor, radiosonde data, and diffuse-to-global irradiance (DG) ratio were performed to predict the top-of-atmosphere radiance by the reflectance-, irradiance-, and improved irradiance-based methods using the moderate resolution atmospheric transmission model. The MII calibration coefficients were calculated by dividing the top-of-atmosphere radiance by the average digital number value of the image. The radiometric calibration coefficients calculated by the three calibration methods were reliable (average relative differences: 2.20% (reflectance-based vs. irradiance-based method) and 1.43% (reflectance-based vs. improved irradiance-based method)). The total calibration uncertainties of the reflectance-, irradiance-, and improved irradiance-based methods were 2.77-5.23%, 3.62-5.79%, and 3.50-5.23%, respectively. The extra DG ratio measurements in the latter two methods did not improve the calibration accuracy for AODs = 0.1. The calibrated MII images were verified using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) images. The retrieved ground reflectances of the MII over different surface types were cross-compared with those of OLI and MSI using the FAST Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes software. The MII retrievals differed by <0.0075 (7.13%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0084 (7.47%) from MSI retrievals for calibration coefficients from the reflectance-based method; <0.0089 (7.57%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0111 (8.65%) from MSI retrievals for the irradiance-based method; and <0.0082 (7.33%) from OLI retrievals and <0.0101 (8.59%) from MSI retrievals for the improved irradiance-based method. Thus, our findings support the application of SDGSAT-1 data.

TI  - Significance of geomorphic indicators for identification of groundwater recharge potential in the Khapri watershed of Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), district Dangs, western India
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The district Dangs of western India, marks the extension of Western Ghats in Gujarat state. It is characterized by less transmissible basaltic lithology of Deccan Volcanic Province (DVP), rugged trappean highlands and moderate to very steeply sloping surfaces. Despite receiving high average annual rainfall (2000 mm) the terrain framework produces high runoff than infiltration (recharge), leading to groundwater crisis. In such terrains, where lithology is homoge-nous, the natural groundwater recharge is significantly influenced by geomorphic indicators (landforms, drainage characteristics and slope). Therefore, identification of groundwater recharge potential (here after referred as GWRPOT) is crucial for the sustainable development of groundwater resource. In the present study GWRPOT is iden-tified on the basis of geomorphic indicators (Gi) in sub-watersheds of Khapri, district Dangs of DVP. To generate the database on geomorphic indicators the IRS-LISS-III (24 m) satellite data, Survey of India topographic maps (1:50,000), and SRTM-DEM are used. The ranks are assigned to geomorphic indicators of each sub-watershed by considering their aerial coverage, influence on GWRPOT and field studies. The summation of average ranks of each geomorphic indicator viz., landform (Gc), drainage characteristics (Dc) and slope (Sc) is used to compute Gi value. On the basis of Gi, the GWRPOT is identified and categorized as very poor (SW-5), poor (SW-3, SW-2, SW-10), moderate (SW-7, SW-4), good (SW-11), very good (SW-1, SW-8, SW-9) and excellent (SW-6). These results are validated with seasonal groundwater level fluctuations in 33 dug-wells, which shows positive correlation between Gi and ground-water fluctuation (R2 = 0.77). Further, the sub-watershed prioritization is carried out to highlight the need of improving the GWRPOT and thereby sustainability.

TI  - Incidence of Cancer and Role of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in BRCA Mutation Carriers Undergoing Prophylactic Mastectomies
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Introduction Breast surveillance in patients with BRCA mutations include mammography (MMG) and MRI. Patients may elect to undergo risk-reducing bilateral prophylactic mastectomies (BPM). Sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) are frequently performed and associated with increased morbidity. This study sought to determine the correlation between preoperative imaging and the final pathology and evaluate the role of SLNB in these high-risk patients. Methods A prospective database identified BRCA patients who underwent BPM between 2006 and 2022. Imaging, pathology, and operative reports were reviewed. Results 170 patients with BRCA 1/2 mutations were identified. 162 (95.3%) had imaging within one year of BPM. Of these, 28 (17.3%) patients had a MMG/ultrasound, 53 (32.7%) had an MRI, and 81 (50%) had both; 21/162 (13.0%) patients had abnormal imaging. Bilateral SLNB were performed in 31 (18.2%) patients, of which 7 had abnormal imaging; unilateral SLNB were performed in 4 (2.4%) patients, of which 3 had abnormal imaging. 11/170 (6.4%) patients had a malignancy and only one (9%) of these patients had imaging abnormalities. 1/170 (0.6%) patient had an invasive carcinoma requiring an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 10/170 (5.9%) patients had ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 25/170 (14.7%) had ADH/ALH. Only 7/170 (4.1%) patients had imaging abnormalities and abnormal pathology. All SLNB and ALND performed demonstrated no metastatic disease. Discussion There is a high rate of discordance between preoperative imaging prior to surgery in BRCA patients undergoing prophylactic mastectomies and final pathology. This study does not support routine SLNB at the time of BPM.
